<p>

<a name="stpa_0">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[Claire Ward.]

<a name="time_0">
<a name="51012h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51012h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Grogan  (Selby)</b>  (Lab): Today, we have no fewer than four opportunities to discuss energy policy. Following this morning&#039;s debate on the coal industry&#151;I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting it&#151;another debate in Westminster Hall this afternoon is about oil and gas. That will be followed in the House by an Opposition day debate on tackling climate change, and energy policy will doubtless feature then. Finally, for those with real stamina, we end the day with an Adjournment debate on clean coal technology.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">That plethora of debates reflects the fact that energy policy is once again taking centre stage in national politics. Such is the level and nature of the supply of energy in relation to ever-increasing demand that we are coming to realise that a bad winter could result in power cuts. There is also an increasing realisation among Ministers that people will ultimately hold the Government responsible for keeping the lights on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">The Confederation of UK Coal Producers has pointed out to me that, to date, about 26 billion tonnes of coal has been mined in the United Kingdom. The blood, sweat and tears that went into mining that coal has helped shape communities and generated a culture; indeed, it helped form the political party to which I am proud to belong. Only 1 billion tonnes of economically available reserves are left, but it is worth remembering that domestic coal production last year was marginally in excess of 25 million tonnes. At the current rate of extraction, we could easily look forward to producing coal for nearly half a century more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">The central tenet of my speech, which will be relatively short to allow all hon. Members to contribute, is that although we will never see a return to &quot;King Coal&quot; in our economy, it is in all our interests to ensure a diverse energy supply in which clean coal continues to play a big role, and in which the critical mass of remaining pits in the UK are maintained to maximise that diversity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">I argue for the coal industry not by way of special pleading or out of sentiment but because I believe it has a key role to play in our energy policy. British coal production is inextricably linked to the fortunes of our coal-fired power stations. Indeed, virtually all domestic coal production goes to power stations. In the four years since 2001, coal&#039;s share in our electricity generation has been respectively 34 per cent., 32 per cent., 35 per cent. and 35.6 per cent.&#151;all substantial figures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">The first principle that we need to establish in our energy policy is the importance of diversity of supply. Even if we build a new generation of nuclear power stations&#151;I have grave doubts that the issues of waste and cost have been satisfactorily resolved&#151;and even if 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 74WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
we expand renewables to produce 20 per cent. of our energy requirements, between 60 and 70 per cent. of our electricity-generating capacity will still have to be accounted for, in all but the long term, by gas and coal. Without some sort of public policy intervention, that percentage is likely to be mainly gas.
</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51012h01_spnew1"><b> Jim Sheridan  (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North)</b>  (Lab): On that point, I wonder whether my hon. Friend agrees with Les King, director of technology at Mitsui Babcock, who said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Retrofit or new build of modern coal-fired plant which has been designed to be future-proof would allow plant operators to reduce emissions by up to 60 per cent. now. This could be achieved without increasing dependence on imported gas or on intermittent power sources such as wind and allows for fitting of carbon dioxide capture and storage when this becomes practical. The UK coal fired fleet and its infrastructure is a valuable legacy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">Does my hon. Friend agree?
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51012h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Grogan </b> : I do indeed. Mitsui Babcock is a leader in that field; I shall suggest later one or two mechanisms by which that sort of technology could be encouraged.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">The current increases in gas prices could be the start of a trend. If we diversify the energy mix, including clean coal, we would improve the security of supply and decrease the risks of rapid price rises in a totally dominant energy sector destabilising the economy in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">Moreover, coal-fired power stations offer something that no other energy source can match: flexibility to meet demand. Coal can be stockpiled at power stations and used to provide base load, but its supply also has the capability of being turned up and down to meet peaks in demand. Electricity generated from nuclear and gas-fired power stations is not flexible enough to deal with severe fluctuations in demand during winter months. For example, during summer, about 350 GWh of electricity is produced by gas-fired plant and a little more than 250 GWh by coal-fired plant. That position is reversed come the winter, when gas remains at about 350 GWh and coal increases to 390 GWh, with a maximum provision of 420 GWh.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">Having established the overriding principle of diversity, we have to make coal fit for purpose environmentally. The Minister is now the seventh holder of the position of Minister for Energy since 1997. Each of his predecessors reaffirmed the Government&#039;s commitment to invest in clean coal to produce results. Indeed, the energy White Paper makes it clear that in a low carbon economy, the future for coal must lie in cleaner coal technologies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">However, it is no longer enough just to back research. In a former life, the Minister was a distinguished academic at the university of York in my constituency. In time, I want to be able to recommend him for a honorary degree from York on the basis that he was the one of the magnificent seven Energy Ministers who, in the end, persuaded the Treasury, No. 10, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&#151;whoever it was who had to be persuaded&#151;to commit resources to invest in clean coal as opposed to only research. My hon. Friend will be aware that the &#163;40 million funding offered in the recently published carbon abatement technology strategy, which concentrated on carbon capture and storage research&#151;a welcome measure&#151;is somewhat 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 75WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
dwarfed by the $1 billion that President Bush has assigned to the FutureGen initiative. Among other things, its aim is to develop the world&#039;s first coal-based, zero-emissions electricity power plant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">If we in the United Kingdom are really serious about developing workable technologies, that ambition has to be matched at some stage by serious funding. Time does not permit me to talk about the details of clean coal technology; it may be covered by other speakers or in tonight&#039;s debate. I want instead to make a couple of suggestions about how the Minister could act to provide regulatory certainty for clean coal producers and give incentives for clean coal production.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">In the short term, the quickest way for coal-fired power stations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is to co-fire with biomass. For example, Drax Power Ltd., the owner of the largest coal-fired power station in the United Kingdom, has ambitions to increase biomass to 20 per cent. of total coal burn. To be able to sell such coal-fired electricity to suppliers under the renewables obligation, stations have first to acquire renewables obligation certificates. The Government currently cap the share of the ROC market that can be accounted for by co-firing to 25 per cent. Next year, the cap will be cut drastically to 10 per cent. The expansion of co-firing that would result from the simple action of maintaining the cap at 25 per cent. would save 2.5 million equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and maintain much more coal burn.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">Will the Minister deal with an anomaly that could threaten the successful operation of phase 2 of the European Union emissions trading scheme, proposals which will have to be submitted to the European Commission by June 2006? At present, a perverse advantage is being offered to those coal-fired power stations that are not equipped with flue gas desulphurisation units. The carbon allocations distributed under phase 1 of the scheme are calculated using historical output on the basis that that provided a reliable prediction of future carbon production.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">As for coal-fired power stations, the lifetime of several plants in the United Kingdom will be limited under the terms of the large combustion plant directive. However, the plants without FGD units are in receipt of the same carbon allocations as those afforded to FGD-equipped stations. The FGD stations will be put at a disadvantage even though Drax, West Burton, Cottam, Eggborough and other power stations have invested millions of pounds in the equipment. It could be a start if carbon allocations were increased at those power stations that have made an investment in cleaning up their act, as opposed to, what is in effect, rewarding them for making no such effort.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">A number of the mechanisms that could be adopted as incentives for clean coal would provide some financial inducement. For example, we could mirror the renewables obligation with a clean coal technology obligation, encouraging electricity suppliers to source specified percentages of the electricity that they supply from stations fitted with both FDG and carbon abatement technologies. Alternatively, the Government could offer long-term carbon contracts to clean coal producers, perhaps under the auspices of the EU emissions trading scheme. Under that proposal, the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 76WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government would guarantee prices for the purchase of carbon allocations left unutilised by plant employing specified carbon abatement technology. That would provide a revenue stream to underpin the investment made in the equipment. Every producer would have an incentive to save carbon using clean coal technology in order to cash in on the guaranteed prices for unused carbon allocations. The Government could then sell on those unused allocations to other industrial sectors&#151;according to studies that I have seen, they might even make a profit on the deal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">However, even if we create a future for clean coal generation, what is the future for British coal production? Of the 25.1 million tonnes produced in Britain last year, around 12.5 million tonnes came from deep-mined production with some 12 million tonnes from open-cast. The open-cast sector is still a substantial and important contributor to UK coal production, but the extent to which that continues to be true will depend on planning policy and on the outcome of various planning applications&#151;my hon. Friends want to refer to some of those later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">Only eight deep mines are still operating: Daw Mill, Thoresby, Welbeck, Maltby, Tower, Kellingley in my constituency, Harworth and Rossington&#151;although the last two are due to be placed in care and maintenance from next spring by their owner, UK Coal. For UK coal production to survive beyond this Parliament in a meaningful way, and for reasons of diversity and security, it is imperative that the Government top up the &#163;60 million of investment aid. To ask for bids for the third term of the scheme when &#163;57.53 million of the original allocation has already been allocated makes little sense; the presumption is that more money will be assigned. At Kellingley pit, to which many former Selby miners have moved, a bid for &#163;13 million of investment aid is part of a &#163;48 million plan to provide access to over 17 million tonnes of reserves at the site. Without that investment aid, the future of the remaining pits will be under greater threat.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">I understand that the Government are considering not paying investment aid for schemes at Harworth and Rossington because the pits are to be mothballed. That is superficially an attractive idea, but it is worth remembering that no money is handed over to UK Coal until work has been completed. So long as that has been done in those cases, I fear that if the Government go down the route of claiming money back, the extra transfer of risk will mean that no private company will claim investment aid. Unless nationalisation is to be announced&#151;I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to advocate that today&#151;such reclamation of aid will only hasten the demise of UK coal production.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">There is a strong case for making UK Coal more accountable in return for aid, and I would advocate transferring the administration of the investment aid scheme from the Department of Trade and Industry directly to the Coal Authority, which has a great knowledge of the industry, and which can better insist that if UK Coal claims public money for coal production it must demonstrate that it is interested in more than property development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">Germany&#039;s domestic coal industry is similar in size to that of the UK, and it has recently received approval from the European Commission for an aid package totalling &#8364;12 billion to assist it until 2010. I do not 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 77WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
suggest anything on such a scale, but given the sums that are going to renewables and nuclear, I think that we can afford between &#163;30 million and &#163;50 million in investment aid for the next five years. If announcements could be made well in advance, that would help the industry to plan.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">In my view, large-scale private investment in future coal production is likely only if the generators of coal power can offer long-term contracts to the producers. That could be a quid pro quo for the Government&#039;s offering the generators the sort of long-term carbon contracts that I discussed earlier. I note that the investment aid scheme is up for review in Europe in 2006. I hope that the Government will contribute to that review, and that we can extend the scheme until 2010, as is allowed under EU rules, and consider expanding its scope.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">I want to put on record my thanks to the Labour Government for all their work in regenerating former coalfield areas and helping former miners. To give but one example of what they have done, I can tell the Chamber that in Selby, just one year after closure, fewer than 60 of the 2,000 miners who were employed at the Selby mine complex are out of work. That did not happen by accident; it happened because of investment, political will and retraining. The experience in Selby was very different to that in neighbouring coalfield areas in the 1980s and 1990s.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">Real partnership is possible in the industry between miners and management. For example, at Kellingley in my constituency, a determined but fair manager, Bill Tinsley, has won the respect of all the unions. Change has been achieved. Kellingley is not unique, but it provides a good template.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">I ask the Government to intervene in the market with a five or 10-year plan for clean coal that gives some regulatory and price certainty to coal generators and ensures long-term coal contracts for a clean, modern coal industry. I think that we will win the case for clean coal in the forthcoming energy review, but unless the Government act quickly on investment aid, there may well be little British coal production left by then. I want the Minister to be remembered as the man who, in the interests of energy diversity, gave a kick start to clean coal, and not as the man who finally buried &quot;King Coal&quot;.
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51012h01_spnew3"><b> Frank Cook  </b> (in the Chair): I think it advisable to explain the situation: the established protocol in this Chamber is to commence the first of the three Front-Bench winding-up speeches 30 minutes before the termination of the debate&#151;in other words, at 10.30 am. We have 43 minutes left, and nine hon. Members have indicated that they wish to contribute. I appeal to them to bear in mind the time constraint, which leaves them just a little more than four minutes if they are to be fair to their colleagues. Hon. Members should bear that in mind when accepting, and responding to, interventions.

</p>



<a name="time_1">
<a name="51012h01_time1"><h5>9.47 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51012h01_spnew4"><b> Paddy Tipping  (Sherwood)</b>  (Lab): I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan), who said that we would have opportunities to discuss energy today. We will have future opportunities, too, what with the publication of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 78WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the climate change programme review. I hope that the Minister will tell us when he will announce an energy review. The last time I heard him speak, he said that he would do so &quot;soon&quot;; that was a fortnight ago.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">My hon. Friend the Member for Selby is quite right to say that coal has a future. During the review, the Minister will have to decide how far the Government are prepared to take a strategic approach, as opposed to the market approach that has served us well over the past 10 years. The thinking, it is clear to me, is that there should be a move towards greater intervention. The reasons are straightforward: we will not meet our target of 20 per cent. renewables by 2020. By then, there will be perhaps three nuclear stations remaining, producing 7 per cent. of our electricity, and we will be heavily dependent on gas. Some 70 per cent. of our electricity needs will be generated from gas, some 90 per cent. of which will be imported. That is a dangerous situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">Coal will have a place in the future, provided that it is used flexibly to meet the peaks and troughs in the market. The question, as my hon. Friend the Member for Selby said, is probably whether that coal will be British coal. Let me talk about the major coal producer in the country, UK Coal. It made losses of &#163;40 million in the first six months of this year. The Minister knows that Rossington and Harworth are to be put into care and repair. To be blunt, I think that that is closure by another name. Welbeck colliery, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), is not being managed well by UK Coal. There are real problems at that company; the Minister knows it. He met representatives from the three Nottinghamshire pits on 8 September; he heard them speak about their flexible approach and their attitude towards the coal industry, and I think that he will have been impressed by them. He will also have heard them speak about the change of managers at each of those collieries. He knows of the merger talks and the talk of takeover at UK Coal, and that is all destabilising.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">The Minister needs to think carefully about what the role of the Government would be if the major producer UK Coal were to hit real financial difficulties shortly. What would be the role of the Coal Authority? Clearly, resources that are in our national interest are involved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">I should like to pursue the issue of investment aid. We have had &#163;60 million. There are discussions with UK Coal about claims at Rossington, Harworth, Ellington and Welbeck. We should be investing for the future, not the past. I support the Minister&#039;s decisions, but he needs to reinforce with UK Coal the need for British coal. He needs to have serious discussions with the company about the way forward and with the Treasury about the bids for investment aid already in. I believe that there are bids of about &#163;100 million, and the resources available in the Department are very small indeed. Investment in British coal will be investment in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">My hon. Friend the Member for Selby has spoken movingly about the need for clean coal technology. We need to get the economics and the environment right. All over the world, coal is being used more vigorously. China is opening one new power station a day; in recent years, South Africa has had an electrification rate of 80 per cent., and 90 per cent. of that is driven by coal. If we can produce new clean coal technologies, we can sell them all over the world.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 79WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">We have good rhetoric and a good reality on climate change, but we have to have policies to ensure that British coal remains. That means investment in the infrastructure and in clean coal technology. There is a big task ahead of us. There is a chance for discussions, and I know that the Minister will encourage us all to be involved in them.
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51012h01_spnew5"><b> Frank Cook  </b> (in the Chair): For the benefit of everyone in the Chamber, I should say that that contribution took just over five minutes. If everyone who spoke took as long, we would, under normal circumstances, run out of time. However, I have an announcement: in a spirit of bonhomie and co-operation, the two Opposition spokesmen have offered to confine their comments to no more than five minutes each, so there can be a slight leniency now. However, let us not go overboard.

</p>



<a name="time_2">
<a name="51012h01_time2"><h5>9.53 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51012h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Denis Murphy  (Wansbeck)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on securing this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">The questions that we need to address today are: will we continue to need coal for the foreseeable future; can coal be used in an environmentally acceptable way that meets our international commitments; and are the nation&#039;s coal reserves in good hands? That last question is perhaps the most important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">There is no doubt that we will continue to use relatively large quantities of coal for electricity generation for at least 20 years. There is also no doubt that under the stewardship of UK Coal not one tonne of coal burned in 20 years&#039; time will be mined in the United Kingdom. Indeed, it is my firm belief that not one deep mine will be left in five years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">Coal can certainly meet our environmental commitments if our Government act now to ensure that a new generation of clean coal power stations is built. It is also right that we have another look, as a matter of urgency, at the nation&#039;s energy needs and at how we will guarantee that the lights remain on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">I can understand why nuclear power will be on the agenda as part of an energy review. I must be honest: I have never supported that industry; whichever way the finances are presented, it will always be the most expensive option. However, I accept that we will have to decide how we replace generating capacity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">For less than the cost of decommissioning a nuclear power station, the Government could offer sufficient financial support to encourage clean coal units to be built, which would include gasification and carbon capture. That would help us meet our international environmental commitments. It makes no sense to allow a massive national asset to be under the control of a single private company, no matter how diligent, let alone one with the record of UK Coal. It operates a disastrous one-face policy at its collieries by planning to have long periods at each of its mines where there are huge face gaps and no production. There is nothing to stop any of the remaining mines following the same route as Ellington colliery, which UK Coal closed this year after an inrush of water.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 80WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">I spent 30 years working underground at Ellington. I had many disagreements with the National Coal Board and British Coal, but they provided the best equipment available at collieries such as Ellington. When I left there in 1994, it was state of the art. It had high-speed locomotives, the latest computer technology, the best coal-cutting equipment and a brand new multi-million-pound underground ventilating fan system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">When I returned for a visit in 1999, the colliery was then under the ownership of UK Coal&#039;s predecessor, RJB Mining, and it was like visiting a scrap yard. Broken and derelict machinery was lying around; much of it had been cannibalised for spare parts. I could not believe the change. Even the fan system had been sold. Access to those reserves had been lost. It will cost a lot of money to attempt to access them again, and it would be impossible to do so from the original site, which has been destroyed by UK Coal with indecent haste.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">Based on Government projections, 70 per cent. of our electricity will come from gas by 2020; 90 per cent. of that will be imported. That has not happened by accident, but by a strategy that was considered desirable. We will be dependent on policy decisions made primarily in one country&#151;Russia. We have heard the arguments: &quot;Everything will come together&quot;, &quot;The gas will be there&quot; and, &quot;The pipelines have been planned and the liquefied natural gas terminals are being built as we speak&quot;. In these distinctly politically unstable times, do we want to rely on gas for 70 per cent. of our electricity and on 90 per cent. of that being imported?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">I am not sure that the British public are fully aware of what has been planned. Even if the gas is available, what will be the cost? If we had no alternative, it would be a risk that we would have to take, but we are lucky because we have an alternative. We stand on an island of coal, which has 200 years of known reserves. UK Coal is not a company to be trusted to mine them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">I do not say that lightly. Along with a number of colleagues present, I pressed the Government from 1997 to make public money available to invest in the mining industry. There were 21 pits at privatisation and now there are eight. There will be none in five years. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to intervene to ensure that UK Coal does not sterilise any more of the nation&#039;s reserves. I would not allow it an extra penny of public money until it gives guarantees on the future. It is currently flogging its wares around the City, looking to offload its company, and with it the nation&#039;s coal reserves, to any City spiv who has a bit of spare cash.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">We cannot let that happen. Only UK Government plc can save what is left of our coal reserves. I urge the Minister to act now. That would be in the public interest. The Minister should remove those reserves from the company, invest them in the Coal Authority and set up a not-for-profit company.

The UK coal industry&#039;s situation is perilous, and this energy review is welcome. The background is one of a 10-year decline in fuel prices, which continued until 2003. In the past two years, there has been a rapid change in the direction of gas and oil prices. We have seen what has happened this year to oil

<br>&nbsp;<br>
prices, and an increase in gas prices for domestic consumers has been announced in the past month or two. Furthermore, the price of coal has increased globally. I notice, for example, that between 2002 and 2004 the price of coal increased from $34 a tonne to $78.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">The situation elsewhere has been mentioned. In China, India and the United States alone, 800 new coal-fired power stations will be built in the next seven years. That will continue the drive towards an increased cost of coal, both internationally and in this country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">As we have heard, Britain will be a net importer of energy by 2020. We will be 90 per cent. dependent on gas, 70 per cent. of which will come from overseas. It will come from the middle east, the former Soviet Union and north Africa, all of which are politically and geologically unstable. We shall rely on gas pipelines that are 3,000 km long, which will tempt both earthquakes and terrorists. This country will be almost entirely dependent on gas, and I fear that we shall submit to the power of monopoly suppliers, certainly in Russia, where a single company now controls gas supply. In the United Kingdom, there is open talk among civil servants and others about the possibility of power outages because we are so close to our capacity in a severe winter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">That forms a background to the debate. It is clear to anybody who reflects on it that coal must be a key energy source in future. Key questions for the Minister, for the Government and for all of us are whether that coal will be indigenous and whether it will be deep mined or open-cast. Given that we shall be 90 per cent. dependent on fuel imports, it would be foolish to allow our coal deposits to be sterilised. I hope that the Minister will say that he regards the coal beneath the soil in Yorkshire and elsewhere throughout the country to be a precious, strategic energy asset that we shall not allow to be sterilised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">I have already said that there are two ways to take coal&#151;by open-casting and by deep mining. The Government were elected in 1997 on a 10-point pledge to reduce mining companies&#039; capacity to take coal by open-casting; at least to do so without the co-operation of local communities. We have a presumption against open-casting. I hope that the Government will not renege on the promises that we made to the people of the coalfield communities to ensure that there would be proper environmental protection against the ravages of open-casting. That does not mean a blanket ban on open-casting&#151;no one ever advocated that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">Therefore the argument exists for deep mining to continue. The situation, as we have heard, is absolutely perilous. We must ask serious questions about whether UK Coal&#039;s corporate strategy of sitting on so much of what is a precious asset is in the long-term interests of the nation. Frankly, the company&#039;s corporate strategy appears to rely more on property development and its property portfolio, which is valued at about &#163;200 million, rather than on coal. The coal production part of UK Coal&#039;s balance sheet appears to show a negative influence. That is largely because of the method of engineering and management that UK Coal has used. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 82WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Coal is a precious asset that is being badly developed by the company. There are changes in the stock exchange valuation&#151;UK Coal&#039;s share values are changing. We read in the financial press that American-based companies might be moving around UK Coal, perhaps a little like scavengers. I am not sure whether it will be in the interests of the country for UK Coal to be foreign-owned, with even less care shown for the work force and the nation&#039;s strategic resources.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">All that argues for the closest scrutiny of UK Coal&#039;s corporate strategy, and perhaps for the removal of the asset of coal from the company. Certainly, if investment aid is to be given, which it must, I expect the Minister to pay the closest attention to UK Coal&#039;s corporate strategy. If he fails to be satisfied by commitments that it makes, alternative forms of ownership must be explored.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">I shall focus today on the current crisis. There has been a crisis in the UK deep coal mining industry since it was privatised, because it was below its critical mass when the Conservative Government privatised it. In the 1992&#150;93 inquiry, the Select Committee on Trade and Industry identified that the industry needed at least 25 collieries to be within critical mass, but it was privatised with 21 collieries. That was well below critical mass, and the industry has been in crisis since then. As a result, the market failed, and the industry relied constantly on the Government to win finance for development. Eventually, we agreed the investment aid package. My hon. Friend referred to that package and to the fact that it is less than sufficient to be able to retain the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">The package is currently identified as &#163;60 million, with an allocation of some &#163;57 million, of which less than half has already been paid. That is insufficient to be able to finance long-term development. As a result, two Yorkshire collieries, Rossington and Harworth, which is on the border between Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, have been put into mothballs. In Yorkshire, two collieries, Kellingley and Maltby, remain, and only six collieries remain in total. Of those six, five are in England and one is in Wales. Unless the Minister is prepared to pick up the challenge, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) said, the industry could go in fewer than five years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">We are faced with an enormous challenge, but one with which I believe we can deal. There are, of course, the men who work in the industry to be considered. As my hon. Friend the Member for Selby said, all the miners who were made redundant from Selby had been retrained, and most of them had been allocated to new jobs in different areas of the economy. The fact remains, however, that when Selby closed we were optimistic that many of those men would be transferred to the Hatfield colliery in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband).

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">We believed that Hatfield could take the men from Selby because of its reserves, which make it a jewel in the crown. That has not happened. Indeed, Hatfield has been in mothballs for a considerable time, and I fear for its future unless a package can be put together to rescue it.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">What is to be done? There is a need for a revised scheme. The Minister needs to call in the Coal Authority, and to talk with that authority, the unions and the management of UK Coal&#151;and perhaps with RJB as well, because it owns Hatfield&#151;to see what can be done to provide the necessary incentive to ensure that the industry can survive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">It is crucial that we retain the indigenous coal industry, because changes may well take place in the energy market, providing for coal to be burned cleanly, at a time when we will have no indigenous deep mines. That would be a tragedy. Our deep mines are the safest in the world. Some of them are the most productive. They face enormous challenges because of the depth at which we mine in the UK. Yet we can meet that challenge with technological superiority, and win through.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">What I am talking about is important, because it is attractive to the coal mining machinery manufacturers and because of the likelihood, without a deep mine here, of their transferring the whole of their operations&#151;some of which, I accept, have been transferred&#151;to Australia or America.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">I hope that the Minister will respond to the call to pull the four agencies together. I understand his reluctance to make large amounts of money available for the private industry, when some of that money could finish up in dividends. The way to deal with that is to bring in the Coal Authority. That could be important to the Minister in ensuring that the money that he makes available for the industry in a revised scheme would be used in a way that would ensure sustainability. I hope that the Minister will take on board the need to call the agencies together, the need for a revised scheme and the need to ensure that indigenous deep mining continues in this country.

I shall repeat nothing and take no interventions, but I have a question for the Minister. Alchemy is hovering&#151;and it is rumoured that my constituent Mr. Richard Budge is involved with the Alchemy proposals. Would the Minister regard a takeover of UK Coal by Alchemy as positive, negative or neutral for the future of the industry? The fact that UK Coal and Alchemy are in discussions seems to me a major distraction from the key decisions that are needed on security of supply for UK industry in the longer term.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">That is particularly ironic given that the price of coal has increased. The irony is not just connected to the fact that the price has more than doubled in the past couple of years; in addition&#151;and it seems to be a permanent shift&#151;the price of shipping aggregate across the world has more than doubled. With projected demand from China for aggregates, the capacity will not change in the next five years, so the price of coal will remain high regardless of any short-term fluctuations, because of the price of shipping. That will be true particularly of coal from South Africa, China and South America.

only just on track; they have just started. I reopened the FGD facility West Burton a week ago last Saturday. That is new technology. If nothing else is done, a big problem at those power stations, which will require Government investment, concerns the import of coal. The rail freight infrastructure is not good enough to shift the coal from ports to power stations. That is a major, immediate problem, which will require significant investment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">I am completely in favour of our expanding our investment into freight and rail, but that is long-term investment and will be a cost to the Exchequer. It needs to be included in the calculations. A subsidy to coal would be a cheaper short-term option. The question, of course, arises whether UK Coal can even meet its current commitments with its under-price contracts to power stations. That could become a real problem come February if we have a harsh winter. On current output, never mind increased output, there could be a major problem for the Government in the immediate future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">Another issue needs to be brought into this debate. I met the chief executive officer of Bectel, one of the biggest power companies in the world, to find out why in the United States his company is investing in coal. Clean coal technology is part of the reason, but they see a much bigger gain in the hydrogen car. Surprisingly, that is also happening in China. California and China&#151;the top end and the bottom end of the car production market&#151;both regard the hydrogen car as the car of the immediate future. In California, Republicans and Democrats are saying that they want to see that happen by 2010. That is a political imperative, because they do not want to be reliant on oil from other countries, and an environmental one, because hydrogen is entirely clean technology.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">Bectel is investing in coal because that is one of the best ways of producing hydrogen for the car of the immediate future. China is doing the same thing, although with a much cheaper lower-end car, which will soon flood the market. Are we going to miss out on that opportunity? Will Europe miss out? We must ensure that we do not go the same way as other Europeans, who have cut back and have no available coal to use for this new development, which will certainly be the future of the car industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">Last week I met the new EU coal supremo, Jan Panek, who stated two things of interest. First, he said that 10&nbsp;years ago the European Commission&#151;the European Union&#151;thought that coal had no future. That has changed in the past 12 months, so that now, because of security of supply and the hydrogen potential, it is regarded as a major part of the future. Secondly, although we know the rules on state aid, there is nothing to stop the Government making a commercial investment in new mines or seams in any way they choose, whether through a commercial loan, a partnership, a takeover, or all three. None of those options are outside EU rules and are, therefore, available to the Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">To conclude, let me put it in terms of Harworth colliery. We want the state aid to continue, not least because of the energy gap for collieries such as Welbeck, but at Harworth there is a land asset straight off the A1. I want to see a new industrial development there&#151;a spur off the A1, a new mine, housing, and an industrial park with manufacturing. I want EU regional aid, which

goes into South Yorkshire as objective 1 money that can be accessed, for a new development, incorporating a new mine for the new seam to get 25 years&#039; worth of coal, or more. That model of coherent investment, rather than merely a taxpayer&#039;s hand-out, could apply to a number of collieries, including Rossington and Daw Mill, and allow them to expand into the coal of tomorrow.

<p>
<a name="51012h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">It is 30 years since we seriously debated energy in the House in anything like a structured way. The past debate resulted in the plan for coal. Sadly, however, that plan was consigned to the dustbin of history within five short years. The deliberate industrial sabotage of the Tory years of the 1980s and 1990s left us with an industry that is a pale shadow of that envisaged in 1975.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">Some argued, with amazing short-sightedness, that the loss of our indigenous fuel supply was a price worth paying to defeat organised labour in this country. We are now entering a period when the real cost of destroying our coal industry is becoming evident in the real world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">We have been benighted by short-termism in this country. If we are serious about our energy needs, we cannot go on like this. We need to work out a genuinely sustainable, diverse energy plan for our country. We should be confident in ourselves and in our people&#039;s ability to rise to that challenge. While some developed and developing countries are producing more coal as a bulwark against soaring oil prices, we, as was said earlier, are importing twice as much coal as we produce. We are paying through the nose for oil and gas from some of the most unstable parts of the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">We face the reality of having to reconsider reopening the nuclear option, despite the concerns of people in this country about that proposal. Let us not pretend that the nuclear option, even when it operates safely, does not contribute to global warming. The construction, decommissioning costs and processes of nuclear stations are massive contributors to the factors that produce greenhouse gases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">We also face the continuing advance of open-cast coal mining. I spoke in this House before the recess about the massive opposition to a proposed open-cast site in my constituency. That opposition has hardened over the summer months and if, as I fervently hope, we develop our coal industry again, we must not do it in a way that destroys the local environment for thousands of people, ruins some of the most beautiful country in our land, goes against the development plans in our areas and risks the lives of our families due to increased traffic. That faces us in my constituency and we will fight to stop that devastation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">Worsley has a long association with coal mining. It started in the 14th century, but production ceased more than 30 years ago. Many large tips remain, one of which is at the Cutacre site, a substantial tip in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly) which is surrounded by estates in my constituency. My predecessor, Terry Lewis, and my right hon. Friend fought for a number of years to resist an application for open-cast mining at that site. However, UK Coal eventually won planning permission and open-cast operations are due to start early next year to remove the tip and to exploit the seams underneath it.

<p>
<a name="51012h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">In my maiden speech I expressed many concerns about the development, particularly after considering the continuing concerns of communities affected by open-cast mining in Yorkshire and Scotland.

<a name="51012h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">Chronic inflammation leading to scarring of the lungs from the inhalation of coal dust is a recognised health hazard for those working in coal mining. Clearly, any jobs created in open-cast mining at the Cutacre site may be hazardous to the health of the people employed. However, I am even more concerned about the risk of respiratory conditions in children and elderly or frail people living near the site. I have read about the hazards of air pollutants caused by open-cast coal mining; early reports in the 1990s were not always conclusive about 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 87WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the dangers, but they definitely seemed to show that open-cast mining was associated with a small increase in the mean concentration of airborne particles measured at 10 microns or less.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">The major report&#151;which I am sure everyone is aware of&#151;by the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants concluded that children living in open-cast communities were, on average, exposed to a small but significant amount of that particulate matter of less than 10 microns. That 1999 report did not manage to find a correlation between the extra dust in the air near open-cast sites and the overall prevalence of asthma or other respiratory illnesses. However, it did find that there was an increased number of GP consultations for respiratory, skin and eye conditions in open-cast communities. Following that it was recommended that efforts should be made to control the emission of particles from open-cast sites.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">As a result of such findings it is unsurprising that communities living near open-cast mines are fearful of the health risks that face them and, in particular, their children. Reports such as the 1999 study fail fully to reassure such communities. Although the messages from research should be reassuring, there is clearly still a need for emissions from open-casts to be controlled.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">That leads me on to one of the chief reasons for concern: the fact that the agencies responsible for monitoring the emissions from open-cast operations, and for considering all the potential impacts on public health in my constituency, are new to those activities. As I mentioned earlier, coal production ceased in the Worsley constituency more than 30 years ago. Of the two local authorities in my constituency, Wigan has had experience of open-cast mining quite recently; however, the Cutacre site is in Bolton, so Bolton is the planning and monitoring authority, but it has no recent experience of this type of mining activity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">When the plans of UK Coal to start operations were made clear in mid-2004, I urged the company to establish a community panel to tackle some of the many issues I felt sure would emerge. The company had agreed to a planning appeal. However, it has become clear to me that UK Coal wants to settle all planning matters before it establishes contact with the community, rather than work through the issues alongside the people who are going to be affected. That is short-sighted, and will create more issues in the long run.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">It is clear that local primary care trusts need to work together on monitoring emissions of particulate matter in order to safeguard public health. However, PCTs too have little or no experience of that.

If we are concerned about the food children eat, how much more concerned should we be about the quality of the air that they breathe? The area in my constituency that will be most affected by open-cast mining is bordered by the M61 and the A6. Traffic congestion is a major issue; it is already affecting air quality.

I have been involved in discussions on this matter both in government before I became an MP and since then with hon. Members&#151;most recently on Friday when my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) chaired a meeting of the Yorkshire coal taskforce. Twenty years ago, coal was seen as the enemy, and, more recently, it has been seen as a difficult problem to manage; but I am increasingly of the view that coal is not part of the problem, but part of the solution. If we are going to have a long-term and balanced approach to energy policy in our country, we have to recognise the important role of coal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">We have some major opportunities at present. As a result of the Budget, there is to be an investigation of economic instruments and how they can encourage carbon capture and storage, and, therefore, clean technology for fossil fuels. Also, the energy review is about to take place, in which it is important that the Minister should ensure that the work on economic instruments is part of the wider energy picture.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">We must take on board three important considerations. First, we are increasingly seeing the impact of globalisation and the global community on energy policy and the volatility of oil and gas prices. We can see that from current trends. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) said, we will move from a reliance on gas of 20 or 30 per cent. to one of 70 or 80 per cent. That is a serious problem for energy security. As a recent briefing from Yorkshire Forward, our regional development agency, said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;there are growing concerns about security of energy supply with the increasing need to import both gas and LNG from potentially unstable parts of the World and at prices over which ultimately there is little control.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">That, it goes on to say, is why it is important that we retain coal in the energy mix.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">Independent of the nuclear issue, which is not a solution, and renewables, which I support but which are only a small part of the solution, the first issue to consider in the long-term energy review is the mix between coal and gas. We need such a mix for long-term security.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">The second consideration is the environment. We need global solutions for the environment and climate change, and we must recognise that many countries are producing more energy using coal. Therefore, the clean coal technology debate is not simply about what happens in Britain; it is about what happens around the world. In our review, when we consider economic instruments and incentives and how we can incentivise carbon capture and storage for fossil fuels, we must bear in mind the impact that that will have on wider global energy policy, particularly in relation to coal rather than gas, and the potential benefits of those technologies for the British industry and the global community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">The third point was made extremely well by Dieter Helm of Oxford university in an article in the <i>New Statesman</i> this week about energy policy. We must recognise, as I think the Minister does&#151;this is what the energy review is about&#151;that we cannot expect a long-term solution to climate change or energy security by relying on a liberal energy market alone. It is increasingly clear that such a market will not deliver the necessary co-operation on climate change or the incentives for long-term investment required to develop the clean fossil fuel technology that we need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">I fear that if we approach the issue of economic incentives for carbon capture and storage within the current market structure, the result will be not a balanced energy policy but a second dash for gas, which will neither solve the issue of security of energy supply and diversity nor help with our wider efforts around the world to promote clean coal technologies. I fully welcome the work on economic instruments, which brings great opportunities. Important work is being done both in government and outside, but it needs to be framed within a wider energy policy that takes into account the need for diversity of supply and a role for coal, and the wider spin-offs and benefits of clean coal and gas technologies&#151;we need not one or the other, but a mix of both. We cannot allow the short-termism of this market structure to push us down the route of using gas rather than coal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">I do not have the degree of expertise of some Members present on indigenous coal, but I have listened carefully to other speakers, and, for two reasons, I think that there is a clear relationship between the broader issue of coal and its generation and that of where coal is mined and produced. First, security of supply is not simply about power generation; it is about the sourcing of coal. That should be addressed in the review.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">Secondly, we will not have the kind of market incentives we need for long-term production of coal unless we have the kind of incentives we need for the long-term generation of coal. A long-term view of clean coal generation is probably the best way to set up a market incentive for the indigenous production of coal. If we take a sensible approach to the energy review and the balance of generation, we will find that it has a direct effect on the incentives for investment, so that we can break out of short-termism and take a long-term view, not only of a balanced energy policy but of the UK coal industry.

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51012h01_spnew17"><b> Edward Miliband  (Doncaster, North)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on securing the debate. May I say what a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 90WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
privilege it is to be the final Back-Bench speaker in what has been a very powerful debate with many eloquent contributions?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">I speak in today&#039;s debate for a very simple reason: mine is a former mining constituency, which seeks fairness in the treatment of coal in the forthcoming examination of energy policy. I shall make five brief points to explain why. First, it is important to say that no one in this debate believes that we can recreate the past. Some 20 years ago in Doncaster, there were 19 pits and 30,000 jobs in mining and related industries. Today, only one pit, Rossington, remains, and it is due to be mothballed. It is important to make that point, because of people who want to caricature what they would call a pro-coal position.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">Secondly, we must acknowledge the changed context since the energy White Paper of 2003. Not only have there been changes in patterns of demand, supply and prices, which others have talked about, but it is increasingly clear that no decision on energy policy is easy. Wind farms face great local opposition, as I know from my constituency, and there are doubts about security of supply. In the case of gas, there is excessive reliance on one source&#151;we are forecast to rely on gas for as much as 80 per cent. of our energy supply within 15 years&#151;and nuclear energy involves great clean-up costs and safety issues. Coal, too, has historically given rise to doubts about its financial viability and to concerns about environmental issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">The most important point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) made, is that it is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot leave energy policy simply to the market. Without a proper Government framework, the market cannot deliver for the simple reason that market failures do not take adequate account of environmental issues, of security of supply or of the dangers of excessive reliance on one source. That is why it is right to re-examine the issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">Thirdly, we, as a country, must recognise and acknowledge our assets. The Hatfield pit in my constituency, which has been on care and maintenance since January 2004, sits on 80 million to 100 million tonnes of coal. According to the Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s own review in 2002, that is about 50 per cent. of the UK&#039;s reserves&#151;a fact to which my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) drew our attention earlier.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">As many hon. Members know, Richard Budge, who owns the pit, has embarked on a process of trying to raise private sector resources for the reopening of Hatfield. I do not know whether he will succeed, but I must say to the Government and to the Minister that there is a strong feeling in my constituency that if it was seen as right to offer &#163;15 million two years ago as part of investment aid to keep Hatfield open&#151;money that we could not, unfortunately, take up&#151;there will be a real sense of grievance if Hatfield does not reopen because that money is no longer available. The feeling is particularly acute given the subsidies given to other forms of fuel. That is why we need a new phase of investment aid.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">Fourthly, coal has always been seen as part of the environmental problem that we face, but I believe that it has a chance to be seen as part of the solution. My interest in this is that Hatfield has planning permission 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
for an integrated gasification combined- cycle power plant. I am not in the habit of praising the President of the United States, but it is interesting that in the recent energy Bill, $800 million was made available in tax credits specifically for IGCC power plants. I welcome the Minister&#039;s document on a strategy for carbon abatement technologies, but the UK contribution is very modest by comparison.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">A point to which the Minister might respond relates to the interaction of the renewables obligation and clean coal technology. Ernst and Young&#039;s June 2005 report said that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;the present arrangements, to subsidise heavily a single way of reducing carbon emissions, do no favours to the environment, to security or to the economy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">I support our renewables obligation, but does it matter to us in principle whether renewables produce a reduction in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions or whether clean coal does? I do not have an in-principle view in advance about that, but at the moment it seems as though policy does. Some have argued that the renewables obligation should be supplemented by a sustainability obligation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para100"><a name="stpa_101">Finally, everyone in the coal industry should welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has said that he has an open mind about the future direction of energy policy. As I said at the beginning, however, those who have traditionally relied on coal have said that they do not want to return to the past, so those who have traditionally thought that coal cannot be an answer to our energy needs should approach this question with an open mind. My constituents want coal to be given a chance in the forthcoming examination of energy policy.

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51012h01_spnew19"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</b>  (LD): As the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) said, this has been a good debate. There have been many contributions from Members who have direct personal experience of their constituency&#039;s interest in the coal mining industry, its potential future and what it has to offer the economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para101"><a name="stpa_102">I also congratulate the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on securing the debate and raising the subject. As he said, the Minister will be on his feet a few times today, responding to this debate and to the later ones on gas and oil supply and on clean coal technology, which is a fundamental part of this morning&#039;s discussion. It might have been helpful if the subjects had been debated in a different order because the oil and gas situation needs to be tackled in more detail. That cannot be done now because there is not enough time; perhaps we will be able to tackle that this afternoon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">Before I move on, I should draw the Chamber&#039;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#039; Interests. I am a shareholder in Shell, which is an oil and gas company.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para103"><a name="stpa_104">In the context of security, the hon. Member for Selby mentioned that we may be facing power cuts this winter. It might be helpful if the Minister quickly gave the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 92WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chamber his view on what exactly that may mean. Some large industrial users have interruptible contracts for power supply. There is a risk that those contracts will be called on to be interrupted; that is quite serious. I understand that National Grid Transco&#039;s assessment is that even with a one in 50 winter, domestic users and those on secure supplies are not facing power cuts. It would help if the context could be clarified. Nevertheless, when major players in the economy are facing shutdowns because of the price of energy, that is not a long-term stable position. It is right to draw attention to our energy supply situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para104"><a name="stpa_105">Later this afternoon, we will address how that will progress. Carbon abatement, capture and storage is crucial. I would like to see the Minister get his honorary degree; if he could finally crack this nut and bring everything to fruition, there would be a major benefit, not only, as has been said, in providing a domestic market for our own coal by having a clean way of generating electricity from it, but for our export industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para105"><a name="stpa_106">There is an urgency relating to the export industry. As has been mentioned, many coal-fired power stations are being built abroad. If they are built now before we get the technology right, retrofitting of the technology will be a much more expensive option. At least if stations are built now with a view to retrofitting, so that they will be ready, that is a cheaper way of bringing the technology on stream. People need to see the technology. The demonstration plant must be up and running so that people can have confidence in how the technology will work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para106"><a name="stpa_107">An exciting development is taking place. The dash for gas has clearly been a major disrupter of the coal industry in the past, but now there is a coming together of the two industries. Carbon abatement technology will possibly make great use of the North sea. Already an experiment is going ahead in Peterhead power station to generate electricity, and to try to use that to take the carbon resulting from that generation and re-inject it into the Miller field to bring out more oil and gas for future production.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">Perhaps the Minister will update us on how he sees the debate about incentives progressing. There are forthcoming debates on economic instruments and on the carbon abatement strategy that the Government have proposed. I am slightly concerned about the pace at which those incentives will be made available. They must be available before the infrastructure in the North sea that can take that carbon back under the ground is lost. The situation is urgent and action needs to be taken quickly. An assurance from the Minister that urgent action will be taken would be much appreciated.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">In addition, if our long-term strategy is for the carbon to be put back under the sea, we need to sort out the OSPAR and London conventions. That is going to take a long time, so I should like some reassurance about what the Government are doing to get permission to put underground carbon that is not being used for enhanced oil recovery. It is important to get such things right now, because there will be no point in having a carbon abatement strategy in future if we have signed up to an agreement that will not allow us to put carbon back under the North sea.

<p>
<a name="51012h01_para109"><a name="stpa_110">We are in a win-win situation, in that we can provide a market for coal in the domestic economy through clean coal technology, so the Government must ensure that that technology is up and running in order to give the market the confidence that it needs.

</p>



<a name="time_11">
<a name="51012h01_time11"><h5>10.46 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51012h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex)</b>  (Con): I join others in congratulating the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on having secured the debate. It has been interesting and passionate, and I do not envy the Minister having to reply to it. I suspect that he can say little that is constructive because everything is hanging fire pending an energy review.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">An energy policy has to provide three basic outcomes in order to be a success. It has to provide fair pricing to domestic and industrial consumers; it has to comply with our environmental objectives; and it has to provide security of supply. The Minister&#039;s difficulty is that the energy policy that the Government have pursued for the past eight years has resulted in the achievement of none of those objectives. Our industrial consumers are paying the highest prices in Europe, and that is going to hit our domestic consumers too; we are failing to achieve our environmental targets; and the security of supply situation is extremely precarious, as Minister knows, given that he has to deal with it daily.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">Everything that we have heard today confirms that coal could be an important component in our strategy to tackle the security of supply. How is the Minister going to address that question if he is not allowed to consider it until next year, because the Prime Minister does not want to have a review of energy policy until then? The issue is more urgent than the Prime Minister and the Minister seem to understand. I agree that it is important for our country to develop clean coal technology, not least, as the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) said, because it will be highly exportable technology and there is little point in our achieving our environmental targets on our own. We need to come up with ideas and technologies that we can export to the rest of the world so that the whole world will be bound into environmental technologies. Coal will outlast oil as a source of global energy by a long way, possibly by hundreds of years. If we are at the forefront of the technology for clean coal, we will put Britain in a strategically strong position, and if we provide a market for our coal, we will also provide improved security of supply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para112"><a name="stpa_113">Will the Minister, simply and briefly, address the issue of intervention in energy markets? The renewables obligation certificate is a massive intervention in our domestic energy market. How can he justify putting up to &#163;1 billion of subsidy into one form of renewable energy without making an assessment as to whether it provides good value for money compared with other possible destinations for such intervention in the market? I agree with those who have suggested that we should consider a non-carbon obligation certificate rather than just a renewables obligation certificate, because the former would target the carbon abatement and carbon sequestration technologies in a way that the existing regime does not.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para113"><a name="stpa_114">Finally, what will happen to the emissions trading scheme? There are no plans for it beyond 2012. How is an industry that has to make very long-term investment 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 94WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
decisions meant to make them when there is now uncertainty on the part of other countries&#151;especially those that are breaching the Kyoto targets by a long way&#151;about whether they want to continue with the emissions trading scheme at all? What is the scheme&#039;s future? Is that not yet another issue that needs to be tipped into a proper policy review of energy issues so that we come up with a comprehensive energy policy instead of bolting this and that on to the regime that the Government inherited from the Conservatives eight and a half years ago? Things move on, but I do not think that the Government&#039;s policy has.

<p>
<a name="51012h01_para114"><a name="stpa_115">The debate has certainly been strong and serious, and it clearly deserves more time. I certainly require more time to respond to all the issues, not only about coal but wider energy policy. I thank my Opposition colleagues for agreeing to speak for just five minutes each. I heard on the radio that there is now a kind of grand German alliance between them on climate issues, and I am pleased that that applies to parliamentary procedure as well.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para115"><a name="stpa_116">I recognise the passionate conviction with which Members have argued for the continuing need to maintain an active coal mining industry in the United Kingdom. I also recognise the strong and growing interest in wider energy policy and the need for diversity among our energy sources. I take this opportunity to assure colleagues once again that the Government firmly believe that access to a range of energy sources is essential to ensure security of supply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para116"><a name="stpa_117">I am aware that there are rival camps: some think that the whole future is about efficiency, while others think that it is about renewables, or nuclear energy, or coal or gas. However, I warn against any non-serious dispute about different energy sources. The debate is about the energy mix that we need judged against different criteria, some of which, in the 21st century, are geopolitical. The dispute between rival camps may not be the most appropriate way of approaching that debate, although I am not saying that we have had any such dispute today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para117"><a name="stpa_118">There were some interesting contributions, not least from my hon. Friends the Members for Normanton (Ed Balls) and for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband), about the relationship between the market and the state. To caricature the issue in an overly simple way, I should say that we went through one era in which the state determined energy policy through the nationalised industries. Under a previous regime, we then went into a period in which the market was king and many people thought that it could determine everything. We are now into a much more serious debate about the state advancing various objectives on behalf of the democracy, albeit with a liberalised market. Such objectives include social policy aims such as tackling fuel poverty, objectives resulting from climate change and so on. We need that kind of intellectual debate if we are to get some of the important details and policies right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para118"><a name="stpa_119">We have to face facts, and colleagues have done so: coal is not a clean form of energy, and coal-fired generation is under increasing pressure from ever more

<br>&nbsp;<br>
stringent environmental regulation, including carbon pricing and emissions controls. Nevertheless, we strongly believe that there will be a continuing role for coal in meeting this country&#039;s energy needs for some years to come, provided that its potential environmental impacts can be managed satisfactorily.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para119"><a name="stpa_120">I am interested in this issue. When I was in the United States some weeks ago, I visited a clean coal technology plant in Tampa, Florida. Clearly, the technology and good practice are there. The Government have demonstrated their support for the coal industry by making more than &#163;200 million available in coal state aid since 2000. Between 2000 and 2002, we paid more than &#163;160 million of coal operating aid to help mines that could show the long-term viability necessary to survive a period of difficult international market conditions. Despite that support, the industry continued to contract; output was down by 16 per cent. over those three years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para120"><a name="stpa_121">Operating aid was replaced in 2003 by the coal investment aid system, under which up to &#163;60 million was to be made available to support projects to maintain access to economically viable reserves and to preserve mining jobs. Before the CIA was formulated, we commissioned a study to assess our remaining coal reserves and what projects mine operators might enter into with investment support. We concluded that there was likely to be sufficient demand to justify offering that form of aid and went ahead with its launch, but we did not expect the level of demand that it attracted.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para121"><a name="stpa_122">The first of the three planned rounds drew applications worth over &#163;130 million, more than double the sum available for all three. However, rather than limit the first period awards to one third of the available budget, we offered more than three quarters of the total, taking the view that such a response would show a level of commitment to the industry&#039;s future that deserved early support. In the event, one of the larger offers was not taken up, so the sum available in the second application period was about &#163;19 million. On that occasion, the applications were for over four times the sum available; but again, the decision was taken to award the bulk of the remaining money further to support ongoing investment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para122"><a name="stpa_123">I take this opportunity to announce one late period 2 award. Following the submission of a revised application, Tower colliery is being offered a further &#163;842,000 to cover planned expenditure to the end of March next year. That will bring total CIA support for Tower to just over &#163;3 million. That award brings the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 96WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
total awarded to all applicants to almost &#163;58.5 million. Allowing for project monitoring costs, the whole of the aid pot, which we originally expected to award over three years, has been committed within the first two years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para123"><a name="stpa_124">Because the CIA is paid retrospectively in order to reimburse expenditure that has been incurred and defrayed, most mines will continue to receive funding until mid-2006. There are three mines for which that clearly cannot be the case: Ellington, where investment was halted by the flooding which forced its closure earlier this year; and Harworth and Rossington, where development has halted ahead of mothballing once their current panels are worked out. UK Coal has told us that the latter two collieries still have workable reserves, but that even if more CIA funding were available they could not finance the level of investment needed to access them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para124"><a name="stpa_125">The time is therefore right to take a new look at the industry and to reconsider how best to create a climate in which it can attract the long-term investment needed to secure its future. The future of coal will therefore be scrutinised as part of our review of energy policy: that is the right context in which to consider the matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h01_para125"><a name="stpa_126">Hon. Members may be aware that, although home production has been roughly 55 per cent. deep mined and 45 per cent. surface mined in recent years, problems at the remaining deep mines in the first half of this year meant that surface mine output, mainly in Scotland, has for the first time exceeded deep mine production. The balance is expected to be restored in the second half of the year, but the lesson to be drawn from the first half is that those two sectors are not in competition. Rather, each needs the other to help to maintain the markets that they both need to ensure their futures. I do, however, note the concerns that have been expressed.

<a name="51012h01_para126"><a name="stpa_127">We cannot ignore the fact that coal is one of the more polluting fuels because of the CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. As I said, if clean coal technologies can become competitive within the next 10 to 15 years, they could contribute to our target of reducing carbon emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050. I hope that the &#163;40 million package of grants made though the carbon abatement technology system will help to support clean coal technology. Carbon capture is a major challenge, both here and worldwide, not least given the development of coal resources in China.

<a name="51012h01_para127"><a name="stpa_128">I thank again my colleague from Heslington&#151;that is how I think of my hon. Friend the Member for Selby&#151;for securing a debate on such a serious matter. However, this is not the end of the debate but the beginning of a long discussion about the future of coal.

<a name="time_13">
<a name="51012h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51012h02_spnew0"><b> Paul Rowen  (Rochdale)</b>  (LD): I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate this short debate on smoke alarms. I know that the Minister, as an ex-firefighter, has personal experience of what happens when a fire alarm is not fitted. I wish this morning to consider the issues and the current state of affairs concerning smoke alarm provision.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para0"><a name="stpa_129">I was prompted to ask for the debate by a very bad fire in Rochdale on 25 June, when a young mother and three children, a baby of 11 months, a three-year-old and a nine-year-old, lost their lives. On that same weekend there were two other serious house fires around the country, in which another three children lost their lives. That demonstrated to me why, although there has been considerable improvement in smoke alarm provision, there is room for more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para1"><a name="stpa_130">Across Greater Manchester last year there were 18 blazes that ended in tragedy. Of those 18, 14 were in buildings with no smoke alarms. Nationally there were more than 4,000 similar fires. The figures show that only 1,813, or 41 per cent., of those fires were in premises with a working smoke alarm. Another 11 per cent. happened where there was a smoke alarm that was not working. Sadly, that was what happened in the case of the fire in my constituency. An alarm was fitted, but there was no battery in it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para2"><a name="stpa_131">Typically, those affected by fires where there is no smoke alarm are old people, single people, people from ethnic minorities or families with young children. It is twice as likely that someone will suffer death by fire where no smoke alarm is fitted than where there is an alarm. In Greater Manchester, the fire service tells me, approximately 200,000 households still do not have a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoke alarm. There has been a considerable improvement since 1987, when 9 per cent. of households had smoke alarms. The current estimate is 80 per cent. Nevertheless, as the tragedies remind us, one life lost through fire is still one too many. I shall suggest some measures that are not dramatic and do not carry huge cost implications, and which could go some way to improve the statistics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para3"><a name="stpa_132">In 1997, the community fire safety task force report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;, concluded that enforcement of regular checking of smoke alarms was likely to be difficult and excessive. Notwithstanding that, I am aware that in the past few years the Government have extended relevant provision so that, for example, since 1992 all new houses have had to have a working smoke alarm; in 2000 that was extended for loft conversions; there is also now provision, through the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997, if a risk assessment is carried out, for a local authority to insist on the fitting of a smoke alarm. That, typically, applies to houses in multiple occupation. I am also aware of licensing arrangements that local authorities can make, extending the provision. However, that does not make it compulsory.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para4"><a name="stpa_133">For private rented properties in particular&#151;because the people affected by the issues I am raising are predominantly those who live in such properties&#151;I ask the Minister to consider extending the annual gas check. At present, it is a requirement for there to be an annual 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 98WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
check of the gas fires in all private rented properties. When gas engineers carry out that check, could they not also check that a working smoke alarm is fitted? If that were done, any enforcement difficulties could be overcome without a great deal of extra expense. As all the figures that I have quoted show, there is no doubt that people who have a smoke alarm fitted in their homes have a greater chance of escaping losing their lives. I ask the Minister to consider my request; nearly 50 Members have signed my early-day motion on the matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para5"><a name="stpa_134">There are a couple of other areas where there is a need to bring about improvements, and which I have been asked to raise. One of them is the provision of smoke alarms for deaf people. More than 2 million people in this country suffer deafness that requires a hearing aid, and 450,000 of them suffer severe hearing loss and would be unlikely to hear a conventional alarm. Earlier this year, for the first time ever there was a deaf awareness week, during which local brigades worked to raise awareness of the importance of smoke alarms, and in particular of the types of vibrating alarms that deaf people require. I ask the Minister to consider making that an annual requirement as part of the fire service plan, because there is a need for us to continue to reach such people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para6"><a name="stpa_135">From February 2006 there will be a new provision: the home oxygen service will be introduced. Currently, more than 50,000 patients receive oxygen at home. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the fire triangle and the causes of fire, and of the need to exercise caution when using oxygen. I am grateful that the company that has won the contract to supply the new oxygen service products is working with brigades in some areas of the country to target the people who use them and to make sure that they understand the dangers that are involved in using oxygen.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para7"><a name="stpa_136">Some brigades are taking such targeting of at-risk groups further. The brigade in West Yorkshire is visiting people over the age of 60 and replacing their chip pans with deep-fat fryers. The brigades in Leicestershire and West Yorkshire are also checking electric blankets. That is good; it demonstrates that we have extended provisions with regard to fire safety&#151;such as smoke alarms&#151;but, again, I would like such good practice to be replicated throughout the country.
</p>






<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51012h02_spnew1"><b> Mark Williams  (Ceredigion)</b>  (LD): My hon. Friend has talked at length about domestic arrangements and the domestic threats that are caused by not having suitable fire alarm equipment. Is he satisfied that the testing arrangements for fire alarms in schools are rigorous enough, and in particular the mechanisms by which they can be monitored, and also that fire drills in schools are undertaken as frequently as they should be?
</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51012h02_spnew2"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : As a former deputy head of a secondary school, I would say that we would be carrying out our fire drill at some time during this week. The biggest issue is the concern about the age of many of our schools and the current requirements for them, compared with the requirements when many of them were built. Fire officers throughout the country are producing reports on schools. From my experience, without extensive rebuilding or knocking it down and starting again, my former school would not meet modern practice. The

Department for Education and Skills needs to make specific sums available for local authorities and church authorities to bring such buildings up to a safer standard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para8"><a name="stpa_137">My focus is on the provision of domestic smoke alarms, which are cheap, simple to install and save lives. People can buy a hard-wired system, or one that would fit in a light bulb for under &#163;10. Since 1987, we have come a considerable way in improving the provision of smoke alarms. Notwithstanding that, there is still room for improvement. As the statistics have demonstrated, people are twice as likely to lose their life if they do not have a smoke detector fitted, and certain sections of the community are affected disproportionately.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para9"><a name="stpa_138">To reiterate, will the Minister consider extending the annual check on gas fires that is currently carried out in rented accommodation to include a simultaneous check on the smoke alarm? In that way we can make the requirement that alarms have to be fitted enforceable, and ensure that batteries are not removed, because people often take those out, making the alarm worse than useless. Although such a check would be made only once a year, it could help save lives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para10"><a name="stpa_139">A loss of any life is to be regretted, but when a life could be saved by the provision of a cheap and easy system, such as a smoke alarm, it is plain ridiculous that we do not try to enforce something that could save it.

</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51012h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : Mr. Cook, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this morning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para11"><a name="stpa_140">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) makes a strong case on the supply and use of smoke alarms, and I welcome this opportunity for the House to consider this important subject. I should say, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges the fact, that I am not unsympathetic to the position that he has advanced. I will come to the points that he raised later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para12"><a name="stpa_141">I take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to the families mentioned earlier by the hon. Gentleman. As he says, it is clear that there is, sadly, every reason to think that many of those deaths were, in principle, avoidable. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, the house in Rochdale had a smoke alarm fitted, but it was not working on the day of the fire. That is one of the key issues to which I will return in due course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para13"><a name="stpa_142">I assure the House that the Government agree about the importance of a working smoke alarm, which is crucial to give occupants early warning in case of fire and precious time to escape. Smoke alarms are cheap, easy to get hold of and easy to fit, whether they are hard-wired in building construction, contain 10-year lithium batteries, or are even ordinary battery-operated alarms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para14"><a name="stpa_143">As has been mentioned, the Government have, since the mid-1980s, promoted the life-saving benefits of smoke alarms through high-profile media campaigns, most of which have been focused on raising awareness among householders of the need to install and maintain smoke alarms. Those campaigns included &quot;Excuses kill. Get a smoke alarm&quot; and &quot;Push the Button, Not Your 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 100WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Luck&quot;. The strategy has been highly successful and has raised smoke alarm ownership in households in England and Wales, as the hon. Gentleman quoted, from 9 per cent. in 1987 to the current level of about 80 per cent. We estimate that the strategy is saving about 50 lives per year as a direct result.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para15"><a name="stpa_144">The Government are determined to increase smoke alarm ownership further. Last October we announced a major fire-prevention programme to target the 1.25 million most vulnerable households, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. The home fire risk check initiative is a four-year, &#163;25 million funded programme. All English fire and rescue authorities will be funded to help them establish a dedicated programme of home fire risk checks. Moreover, free 10-year battery-operated smoke alarms and, where deemed necessary, automated fire-suppression systems for high-risk households that can be protected in no other way will be installed. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that there is no use in putting a smoke detector in homes where people with disabilities are living independently&#151;it may alert them to the fact that there is a fire, but they may not be able to move. Therefore, fire-suppression systems for people with disabilities who live in such dwellings may be the only way to protect them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para16"><a name="stpa_145">Fire and rescue services have widely welcomed the initiative, and all are implementing programmes. I am pleased to announce that, since the initiative was established, almost 170,000 home fire risk checks have been undertaken, which has resulted in the installation of almost 190,000 smoke alarms. We are on course to meet our target of reaching 1.25 million vulnerable households by 2008.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para17"><a name="stpa_146">Greater Manchester fire and rescue service has received more than &#163;250,000 per annum through the initiative. It has undertaken more than 6,000 home fire risk checks, which have resulted in about 10,000 smoke alarms being installed. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is an excellent start.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para18"><a name="stpa_147">Moreover, following the tragic fire in Rochdale, Greater Manchester fire and rescue service, working with various agencies, has mounted a media campaign on the importance of fitting smoke alarms in all rented properties. It has pledged to ensure that, within five years, each household will have a working smoke alarm in place. I wholeheartedly support that initiative to help reach those most at risk from fire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para19"><a name="stpa_148">The debate so far has focused, albeit not exclusively, on fire safety in private rented accommodation. As has been mentioned, no statutory requirement is placed on landlords to install and maintain smoke alarms. They are, however, encouraged to do so as a matter of good fire safety management. That includes ensuring that all exits are kept free from obstruction and that fire apparatus is kept in good condition. Since 1992, building regulations have required that mains-operated smoke alarms be provided in all new dwellings. Government guidance that was issued in 2001 also encourages local authorities and housing associations to provide hard-wired smoke alarms in their dwellings. In addition, local authorities will, from this month, have a power, under the Housing Act 2004, to introduce a licensing scheme for privately owned properties. It is a mandatory condition of any licensing scheme that smoke alarms be provided and maintained.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para20"><a name="stpa_149">I am delighted to say that Rochdale metropolitan borough council, with which the hon. Gentleman has a close association, is already acting to raise standards in the private rented sector. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has been part of that project. In 2004, the council introduced a landlord accreditation scheme that focused on housing market renewal areas. It now has a landlords&#039; forum with 1,700 members, who, three times a year, receive fire safety information and details of free home fire safety checks by the local fire and rescue service, which also provides speakers for landlord forum meetings.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para21"><a name="stpa_150">All properties offered for accreditation are inspected independently, and smoke alarms are provided and installed for free. Interlinked alarms are provided for vulnerable households. Other free services available to accredited landlords include gas and electrical safety checks and the cost of installation. Asian landlords have been specifically targeted through the local Asian press and radio and through mosques and shops.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para22"><a name="stpa_151">I am also aware of calls for greater use of domestic sprinklers to reduce the risk of fire. We have provided funding through the home fire risk check initiative for sprinkler installation in high-risk households, with a view to assessing their effectiveness in a UK context. We are also tackling another barrier to the use of domestic sprinklers, and that is their high cost. We have funded research into the design and effectiveness of domestic low-cost sprinkler systems, based on work undertaken in other countries. The objective is to examine what can be achieved by way of life protection from a low-cost domestic sprinkler system using different operating conditions, such as water pressures. The project includes preparation of a cost-benefit analysis for all dwellings and for targeted installation aimed at vulnerable groups, as well as a practical study of sprinkler effectiveness in reducing casualties. Initial findings, I am pleased to say, suggest that a low-cost sprinkler system can be put into a new-build house and work effectively, given adequate mains water pressure, at a cost that will be acceptable, I am sure, to the industry and to purchasers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para23"><a name="stpa_152">The Government&#039;s overriding objective is to support the fire and rescue service in saving lives, reducing injuries and preventing fires. We have a national target to reduce the number of accidental fire-related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. by 2010, with no local fire and rescue authority having a fatality rate from accidental fires in the home of more than 1.25 times the national average. The Government have put in place the framework to achieve those targets. The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 has put prevention at the heart of the Government&#039;s agenda for improving the fire and rescue service and has created a statutory duty to promote fire safety.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para24"><a name="stpa_153">Too many people continue to die needlessly in house fires. Our goal must be no more preventable fire deaths. We have set the direction for the fire and rescue service through the 2004 Act and provided local authorities with new powers to regulate private rented accommodation in the Housing Act 2004. In partnership with landlords and the local community, local authorities and fire and rescue services are already showing what can be achieved, but we must not relax our efforts.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para25"><a name="stpa_154">Our aim is not only to have smoke detectors fitted in every home; the Rochdale home had one. Our aim is much more ambitious. It is to educate people about their personal safety and how best to look after themselves and their loved ones. We have made real progress, which is accepted. The increase in the number of smoke detectors installed shows that easily. We have yet to win the constant struggle to persuade people that not only can they look after themselves, but they must.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para26"><a name="stpa_155">I hear the hon. Gentleman&#039;s request to include in the gas engineer&#039;s visit the examination of smoke alarms. I will look into that and write to him in due course. He also raised the question of smoke alarms for the deaf, which, incidentally, reminded me that I had not put my hearing aid in this morning, so I thank him for that. Specialist alarms are already provided under the smoke alarm initiative. They exist and many are being fitted throughout the country. The National Community Fire Safety Centre supports the fire and rescue service&#039;s involvement in deaf awareness week, which is another dimension of their activity. Fire services should consider local needs and prioritisation within their integrated risk management plans and strongly encourage all forms of additional protection.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para27"><a name="stpa_156">I hear also the points that have been made about schools. The Department for Education and Skills has been considering sprinkler systems in schools and other building protections, and we are keen to see the outcome of that. I hear the points raised by the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams), and we will consider them and write to him if appropriate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para28"><a name="stpa_157">One of the key issues raised by both hon. Gentlemen is that there is much good practice. I am keen for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to help the existing structures: to work with fire and rescue services, the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association and the structures within which fire and rescue services are organised in order to make sure that best practice, which is being developed in local brigades, is brought to the attention of the national fire service and rolled out if appropriate. One of the key elements of the 2004 Act is that we have delegated much more responsibility for the design and deployment of the local safety plan and the number of fire stations, appliances, fire fighters and other staff to local chief fire officers and local councillors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para29"><a name="stpa_158">No community is the same as any other. The dangers for each community must be addressed by the people who understand them: the local elected councillors, the principal chief fire officers and other fire staff. We need to make sure that they are aware of progress across the country in a variety of ways, so that they do not have to reinvent for every area what works best. If an initiative suits a local community, neighbourhood or fire authority area, they should be able to follow it. I can see that that patchwork effect is happening. An imaginative campaign was run in Northern Ireland, in which the slogan &quot;Thumbs up, it&#039;s Friday&quot; was used on buses and billboards to encourage people to check their smoke detectors on Fridays.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para30"><a name="stpa_159">The hon. Gentleman spoke about gas engineers making annual inspections. Smoke detectors need to be checked weekly, especially the one-year battery operated ones. In too many of the give-away schemes that we have run, smoke detectors have ended up being exchanged in the local pub for a variety of other favours. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 103WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Too often, their batteries are taken out for television remote controls or children&#039;s toys, particularly at Christmas, which is an especially dangerous time. A weekly check that the smoke alarm battery is functioning is most important, but an annual check is also critical.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h02_para31"><a name="stpa_160">In England, we have run the national &quot;Push the Button, Not Your Luck&quot; campaign. We need to keep reinforcing that message to educate people that there are systems to protect them and their families. We want to provide that protection collectively. A key message in my many visits to fire brigades in the past few months is that fire is not a party political issue; there is genuine consensus across all parties. We are there to support the service and to protect the public. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for securing the debate and allowing us to play our part in reinforcing the message.

<a name="time_16">
<a name="51012h03_time0"><h5>2.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51012h03_spnew0"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham)</b>  (LD): I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss a subject that emerged during the summer recess as one of the dominant issues facing us. I have tailored my comments in anticipation of a Department of Trade and Industry Minister responding to the debate, but clearly there are other aspects to the subject, which relate most notably to the Treasury. A set of important issues relate to the DTI, and I shall touch on some of them briefly. They include the question of Government intervention in the oil markets, upstream investment in the North sea, the shortage of gas, if there is such a thing, competitiveness, the conservation agenda and the implications for alternative energy, and fuel poverty. At best, I shall simply tick some of them and ask questions about others.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para0"><a name="stpa_161">To put the subject into a personal and an historical context, I first became aware of the potential for oil shocks 30 years ago, when I worked in government as an official, not as a Minister. I was responsible for British foreign policy on Latin America, and on Venezuela in particular. Mr. Perez Alfonso, the Venezuelan Oil Minister and father of OPEC, had coined the term &quot;the Devil&#039;s excrement&quot; to describe oil. The point that he was trying to make was that oil was a necessary part of the functioning of society and economies, but that it had all sorts of unpleasant environmental, economic and social side effects.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para1"><a name="stpa_162">In the past year, we have encountered some of the predominantly negative effects of an oil shock. It is not of the scale that we endured in the mid-1970s and early 1980s&#151;at least not yet&#151;but it has the potential to be. Oil prices more than doubled between 1998 and 2003, increasing from an average of $13 to $31. They doubled again in the following two years: Brent crude is now just under $60, and at one point it was close to $70. Wholesale gas prices have roughly doubled in the past two years, and they increased very substantially in the two years before that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para2"><a name="stpa_163">I shall start by identifying some of the consequences that we have already experienced. Overall, the consequences might be less severe and dramatic than they were a generation ago, because our economy and that of most other western countries is now less dependent on oil and on energy in general as a share of GDP. That is partly because western societies, including our own, have made an effort to conserve, but mainly it is because of deindustrialisation. None the less, there have been some substantial impacts, as we saw yesterday in the published figures for inflation, which is now more than 3 per cent. annually compared with 1.1 per cent. in September last year. Not all of that is because of energy issues, but a substantial part of it is.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para3"><a name="stpa_164">According to the energy watchdog, family gas bills have risen from &#163;327 to &#163;445 in the past two years&#151;an increase of 40 per cent. Inevitably, that has had an impact on fuel poverty. Until quite recently, the reduction in fuel poverty was a great success story: from 1996 to 2001, the number of people defined as fuel poor fell from 4.3 million to 1.7 million&#151;a massive reduction. Two years ago, however, the Minister&#039;s predecessor warned that that reduction would not be sustained 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 105WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
because of the upward movement in gas prices in particular. Basing its estimate on existing price increases the energy watchdog suggests that the number of fuel poor could increase to about 3.5 million in the coming months. There could therefore be a great deal of regression in what was a major social advance. The energy watchdog warns that, even on the basis of current prices, the coming winter could see a big increase in personal debt and, linked to that, fuel poverty and disconnection.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para4"><a name="stpa_165">That is how the oil and gas shocks have been experienced at the personal level. However, it is not just households that are affected; we already have figures for the additional cost to the public sector. Public expenditure last year was an estimated &#163;100 million more than it otherwise would have been because of increased fuel consumption bills: hospitals alone spent an extra &#163;40 million and we expect significantly greater increases this year. The figures that have begun to emerge from the industrial federations suggest an increase in energy costs for the chemicals industry of about 70 per cent. over two years and close to 60 per cent. for the plastics industry; those are big industries, each employing about 200,000 people. The paper, glass and construction industries have had similar experiences, with major knock-on effects that will have an impact on their international competitiveness.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para5"><a name="stpa_166">Is that all, or is there more to come? I do not know. I was once professionally engaged in the business of forecasting in the energy industry and my experience taught me never to attempt forecasts. Indeed&#151;I may have told this anecdote before&#151;when I was installed in my office at the oil and gas company for which I worked, I was given an Arabic saying, which I pinned to my wall. Roughly translated, it said, &quot;Those who claim to forecast the future are all lying, even if by chance they are later proved right.&quot; Forecasting is a dangerous business, but I have looked at some of the consensus forecasts that are currently being made about crude oil prices, and it is worth reviewing the range. Barclays Capital is working with a figure of $50 for the next year, Merrill Lynch with $45, the Deutsche Bank with $40, and BP, which presumably knows a thing or two about the matter, expects roughly $40 over the next three years. In other words, the figures are somewhat down on current levels, but substantially higher than we were used to in the late 1980s and for most of the 1990s. However, some outliers&#151;knowledgeable and well-informed people&#151;are talking about the possibility of something of the order of $100 over the winter if adverse circumstances arise.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para6"><a name="stpa_167">I will not ask the Minister to give a Government view about what prices should be&#151;it would be foolish to do so. However, it would be useful to know how the Government approach the big controversy on the future of energy prices, particularly oil prices. There are essentially two views. The optimistic view, which I acquired in the industry, is that oil reserves are always underestimated&#151;there has always been an expectation of a 20-year life&#151;and that over time, prices increase, which increases exploration, and technology advances and all kinds of basins and fields are discovered that we did not know existed. However, there is another plausible view, which I do not discount, which is that there is an oil mountain, the summit of which we have reached, and that we face a long-term future of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 106WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
depletion. It is important for the Government to take a view on that controversy, because it affects the way in which one perceives the future of the North sea. It will be interesting to know, for example, what kind of analysis the Government&#039;s chief scientific adviser has made of the competing views.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para7"><a name="stpa_168">In the time remaining to me today, I shall identify some specific areas on which it would be useful to hear the Minister&#039;s views. The first is whether there is anything that the Government could or should do to stabilise oil prices that they have not done. They were right to avoid subsidies and oil caps and some of the other panic measures that have been introduced in other European countries. However, the one major intervention that the Government have made, along with other International Energy Agency countries, has been the use of the strategic stocks. That has probably been a factor in the moderation of prices in the weeks since the hurricane. It would therefore be useful to know whether the Government believe in the domestic market. We should also consider the fact that if the oil companies are left to make a commercial decision, they might run their stocks down to avoid the associated overheads. It can be argued that we should look afresh at the size of our strategic reserves.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para8"><a name="stpa_169">In respect of the oil markets, the Government have set out six points at international gatherings such as G7 and the European Council of Ministers that are effectively a series of demands on the OPEC countries. A Conservative spokesman captured the tone rather well by saying it was &quot;a little colonial&quot; to demand that OPEC countries produce more oil. What is the Government&#039;s current assessment of the spare capacity of the OPEC countries? I am not terribly close to such matters nowadays, but my impression is that there is very little or even none. The underlying problem over the past few years is that, despite rapidly growing demand from China, India and the United States&#151;all strongly growing countries&#151;OPEC capacity has been pretty fixed. That is understandable, because for a long time low oil prices resulted in there being little investment. The OPEC countries have simply run out of capacity. Urging those countries to produce more is at best rather pointless, and at worst a distraction. Will the Minister tell us the Government&#039;s professional assessment of OPEC&#039;s current spare capacity?
</p>






<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51012h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex)</b>  (Con): I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who brings much expertise to the debate. Is he aware that changes in the taxation regime for road fuel stations has resulted in a big reduction in stocks of fuels held at the point of sale? Could it be that the Chancellor, in a rather typical Labour manoeuvre, is trying to distract attention from the perverse incentives caused by his taxation regime, which has made it more likely that filling stations will run out of fuel, and is blaming someone else for problems to which he has contributed?
</p>






<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51012h03_spnew2"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : I do not know the motives but I think that the hon. Gentleman may be correct. I understand that, over time, the oil industry has been running smaller stocks in the distribution sector and at the refining stage. I had not realised that it was being done for tax reasons; I thought that it was being done to reduce the cost of maintaining stocks.

<p>
<a name="51012h03_para9"><a name="stpa_170">My second set of questions relates to the first. Are the Government doing all they can to maximise our oil production in the North sea? I note that the Minister had a successful round of licence bidding during the summer&#151;the best for 30 or 40 years, I believe. He must be rather pleased about that, given that only two or three years ago we had the worst round. I do not know whether that was because of the oil price environment or the sudden changes in taxation, but during the past few months there has clearly been a positive response, and that bodes well. I have a slightly technical question for the Minister. Is he satisfied that the larger number of bidders that have emerged as a result of the licensing are capable of carrying through the exploration and production to which they have committed themselves? I understand that many of the companies are extremely small and have little capital; they will depend on secondary equity markets to raise money. It is potentially an internet bubble, in that their commitments might not be carried through into production. It will be interesting to know how the Department regards the bidders and whether it screens them for competence and ability to deliver.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para10"><a name="stpa_171">My third question&#151;probably the most topical&#151;is about gas supplies and is indirectly related to the upstream issue. A few weeks ago, Digby Jones warned of the real danger of &quot;the switch being pulled&quot; on British industry because of a shortage of gas. The engineering employers have given a similar warning. To be fair, the Minister said in response to such comments that he is not complacent, and the problem is referred to in the July paper published by the Department for Trade and Industry. The controversy centres on what is a sensible storage capacity. At present, our long-term storage of gas is approximately 11 days, compared with a European average of just over 50 and, in some European countries, just over 80 days. Although the Government do not maintain a strategic stock of gas as they do for oil, the question arises what is the optimum and who decides it? Should there be a stock and, if so, should a figure be set? Have the Government decided whether, in broad security of supply terms, it would be sensible to define a minimum stock level? If so, what should it be?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para11"><a name="stpa_172">How did we get to a position in which storage is so tight? Was it a failure of regulation by Ofgem or a failure of policy? Was it, as Energywatch suggests, a rather subtle problem caused by the lack of trading in the futures markets leading to destabilising speculation? If that has been the problem, what can be done at Government level to influence it and to improve the workings of the market?
</p>






<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51012h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. John Grogan  (Selby)</b>  (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman share Energywatch&#039;s concern that the completion dates for three of the storage facilities have been delayed and that storage capacity has been reduced for two of them? Does he also share its concern about the workings of the market? It contends that much more real-time information about gas flows should be provided to buyers and that it would be a good idea if regulation of the gas market were not split between the DTI and Ofgem, but unified.
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51012h03_spnew4"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : The last point is a good one and the hon. Gentleman expressed it better and more fully than I did. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 108WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Essentially, there is not a properly functioning market and because of that there is a tendency for speculation to bid up prices very quickly. I asked how the lack of transparency and liquidity in the markets that gives rise to the relevant criticism can be rectified. The hon. Gentleman is also right to point out the frustration about how slowly the storage is forthcoming&#151;although the other side of the argument is that it is on the way, so that there will be substantially enhanced storage capacity within a year. The problem is this coming winter, which leads back to the question I posed about what the minimum should be and who should determine it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para12"><a name="stpa_173">One of the implications of that question follows from the problem that the hon. Gentleman has just raised. How much of the problem is due to the lack of liberalisation of EU energy markets? Because the British have liberalised their gas markets and, by and large, most EU countries have not, we are now net importers&#151;we are importing gas, the price of which is arbitrarily linked to the price of oil rather than to supply and demand on a short and medium-term basis. As a result, we are importing substantial extra costs. The question for the Minister to answer, which is at the top of his agenda, I am sure, is how high the issue sits among the Government&#039;s priorities for decision-making in the European Union, now that we hold the EU presidency. What is the prospect of achieving any significant improvement in the liberalisation objectives of the Union? It is, as the Minister knows, a long-standing problem. I was involved the energy industry 10 years ago when liberalisation was discussed as an imminent breakthrough, but it never happened.
</p>






<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51012h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jenkin </b> : We are all for the liberalisation of EU energy markets, but it is not going to happen this year, next year, or in five or 10 years, and that is probably an insurmountable obstacle in the medium term, if not the long term. Is that a legitimate excuse for the Government&#039;s failure to act in the national interest on other policy areas that they have under their direct control?
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51012h03_spnew6"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : I shall give the Government the benefit of the doubt and assume that the problem probably is surmountable. I am asking for the Minister&#039;s political judgment about the prospects of achieving substantial improvements. As the hon. Gentleman implies, it will probably involve pressing on other issues to get concessions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para13"><a name="stpa_174">Linked to that matter is my fourth set of questions about competitiveness in general. Gas supply is important not only because of insecurity but because of price impact and the effect that that has had on manufacturing. I do not think that anyone realistically expects manufacturing to be subsidised to offset the disadvantage that it carries. However, it is not simply an academic issue; it is necessary to the survival of many manufacturing companies that they operate on a level playing field with the rest of the European Union on gas costs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para14"><a name="stpa_175">I shall touch on other aspects of the competitiveness debate. One issue has opened up because of the large cash reserves that OPEC countries now have. I believe that about $300 billion additional income is being generated, most of which is sitting in the form of US 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 109WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Treasury bonds and not being spent. There is a cash mountain that the OPEC countries will want to spend over the next few years. During the last two oil shocks, the Government played a major role through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Trade and Industry in helping British industry to deal with its often difficult commercial relationships with OPEC countries, which do not necessarily function in the same way as western European or American countries, or even developing countries in Asia. In such countries there is much centralisation, and many procurement decisions are highly politicised. To what extent have the Government taken account in their trade promotion work of the enormous bulge in OPEC spending that is likely to occur in the next few years as those balances are drawn down?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para15"><a name="stpa_176">I have a fifth set of questions about conservation. Clearly, the most effective solution to the problem of oil and gas shocks is for our economy to be more efficient in conserving energy. That is broadly recognised, and there has been a move toward the British economy becoming more energy efficient, but there are problems with specific Government decisions. One troubling area is that of building regulations&#151;I do not know if the Minister is involved with this issue. It has been known for some time that the regulations allow substantial energy inefficiency&#151;indeed, a study a few years ago suggested that about 65 per cent. of new homes are not airtight. As a result, earlier this summer, the Government embarked on a consultation with industry&#151;the building industry and others&#151;about tightening regulations on the building of conservatories and extensions. There was a broad consensus that the regulations needed to be tightened in respect of energy conservation, and there was a broadly supportive regulatory impact assessment that found that such regulation would be useful and would not just be red tape. However, when the new building regulations appeared a few weeks ago, the organisations that follow the issue closely were deeply alarmed to discover that almost all the energy-conserving aspects had effectively been removed. I do not know whether the DTI was involved with that, but it certainly should have been because if that is the case, much of the Government&#039;s strategy has been seriously undermined. I believe that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister took the lead on that matter. Can the Minister report on that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para16"><a name="stpa_177">My final set of questions relates to alternative fuels. This whole debate has triggered discussion over alternatives to oil and gas for environmental and economic reasons, much of which centred on the long-term question about the role of the nuclear industry, which I do not want to reopen now. We have had the energy White Paper and are promised further papers on that issue. I want to switch attention to an equally important issue, which receives little attention. In the long term, the transport sector is almost certainly responsible for generating as much CO <sub>2</sub>  as the power sector, but speeding up the introduction of alternative technologies in the vehicle sector receives relatively little attention. Some excellent work has been done in the industry on establishing a hierarchy of costs to show the most cost-effective way of changing the vehicle stock. On that basis, hybrids are almost certainly the best way of substantially reducing emissions. Will the Minister tell us about the Government&#039;s evaluation of that issue, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 110WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and about infrastructure development and the incentive structure faced by car producers and motorists in relation to the process of substituting alternative fuels?
</p>






<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51012h03_spnew7"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b>  (LD): My hon. Friend is on to an important point. Over the past 40 or 50 years, oil and gas have come mostly from quarters of the Earth that, geopolitically, are not inherently stable, yet we have not made progress in providing alternatives that are more secure. Does he share my puzzlement about that? To illustrate, Russia is a major provider of oil and gas; Russia is rebuilding a one-party state that controls all its assets. If it became unfriendly, that could be a problem. One could say the same of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq. My hon. Friend is absolutely right: we surely need to develop a wider range of alternatives that would leave us less vulnerable to geopolitics.
</p>






<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51012h03_spnew8"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : Yes, the emphasis on a range of alternatives is absolutely right. I do not lose too much sleep over supplies from Russia; throughout the cold war the Russians supplied gas unfailingly. I think that President Reagan tried to stop the British Government contributing to a pipeline from Russia&#151;the liberty pipeline&#151;but the pipeline was built and supplied gas. None the less, my hon. Friend is right; security of supply is important. One of the ways to ensure that is through diversity of gas suppliers, which will come about when we get liquefied natural gas as well as piped gas, and different types of road fuels and so on. However, I entirely agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s emphasis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para17"><a name="stpa_178">On that note, I bring my thoughts to a conclusion. We have had an oil shock with potentially severe impacts, particularly on poor people, and the energy poverty data are very worrying. I am not predicting the future, but there is potential for the position to deteriorate. I have touched on a variety of subjects in which the Government, even when working with the grain of the markets, have a relevant role. I would be grateful to learn what the Minister feels about the Government&#039;s positioning on those issues.

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51012h03_spnew9"><b> Jo Swinson  (East Dunbartonshire)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing this debate on gas and oil prices and supply. It is particularly timely given the huge hikes in oil prices over the summer months. The impact of the hurricanes in the US, coupled with uncertainty in the middle east, has inflated the price of fuel. I would like to focus on what that means for people in our constituencies across the country and, let me put it bluntly, on fuel poverty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para18"><a name="stpa_179">For some people, a change in fuel prices makes the difference between heating their home properly or not. It is particularly fitting that, today, there are members of the National Pensioners Convention lobby just outside this Room, because many of those worst hit by rising fuel prices are pensioners. Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that each winter there is an increase of between 20,000 and 50,000&#151;depending on how cold it is&#151;in the number of pensioner deaths. Not all of those deaths can be directly related to cold homes, but fuel poverty is certainly a contributing factor in the increasing number of deaths in the winter.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 111WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para19"><a name="stpa_180">It is estimated that there are approximately 1.2 million households living in fuel poverty across the UK. Of those, 1 million are considered vulnerable households. The Government&#039;s 2003 energy White Paper set targets on reducing fuel poverty. They included ending fuel poverty in vulnerable households in the UK by 2010 and eradicating it in England and Scotland by 2016, and in Wales by 2018. I appreciate that fuel poverty is not solely under the jurisdiction of the DTI&#151;it obviously has an impact on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Health, too&#151;but part of the problem when dealing with the issue is that no one Department is solely responsible for it. I would welcome the Minister&#039;s comments on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para20"><a name="stpa_181">Competition between energy companies has actually lowered prices since 2001. The period since then has been good for consumers, and that has enabled many households to escape the fuel poverty trap. However, recent double-figure percentage rises in energy costs mean that those households that escaped the fuel poverty trap may be plunged back into fuel poverty this winter. National Energy Action suggests that, since 2003, gas prices have gone up by 20 per cent. and electricity prices by 15 per cent. Of course, that means that many households that were not previously considered fuel-poor will run into this problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para21"><a name="stpa_182">I would also like to give examples of good news in tackling fuel poverty. Hon. Members may be aware that, in Scotland, there was a drop of 50 per cent. in fuel poverty between 1998 and 2002. That was achieved partly through two key initiatives: the central heating programme launched in 2001 and the warm deal scheme, which dates back to 1999. Those schemes were implemented for all pensioner households, regardless of the benefits that they received. Without being means-tested, they were entitled to have central heating installed in their homes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para22"><a name="stpa_183">Furthermore, properties were insulated and subjected to energy efficiency measures, which helps people to save money on their fuel bills year in, year out. Almost 40,000 households in Scotland have benefited from the installation of central heating. That obviously has an impact on fuel poverty. Using less energy costs less, so any measures that can be taken to help homeowners and tenants increase the efficiency of the energy used in their homes will certainly help fuel poverty. Such methods conserve scarce resources, too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para23"><a name="stpa_184">My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham looked to the future and talked about alternative technologies. It is important to remember that it is much cheaper to conserve 1 GW of electricity than to create the capacity to generate an extra gigawatt. We must therefore make more efforts to encourage people to save energy in their homes and throughout business and industry. We must also pursue renewable sources of energy. They will be a huge part of the solution to the problem in the future. In time, such action will reduce our dependence on gas and oil and, of course, renewable sources of energy are cleaner and more sustainable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para24"><a name="stpa_185">The target throughout England and Wales is to increase the production of renewable sources of energy to meet 20 per cent. of energy needs by 2020. In Scotland, an even more ambitious approach has been 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 112WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
taken; the target has been set at 40 per cent. We need to be ambitious about such issues and support industries that are developing those technologies. Their costs may be higher in the interim, but with the Government&#039;s support we should be able to ensure that, in future, not only will companies develop technologies that can help to meet our energy needs, but there will be huge economic advantages to the country. We need only to consider countries such as Denmark: it has become a world leader in wind farm technology, which will clearly become increasingly important in the future. I hope that the Minister will address such matters in his response.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51012h03_spnew10"><b> Malcolm Bruce  (Gordon)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on introducing the debate. I apologise for missing the first couple of minutes of his speech. He is an acknowledged expert on this subject, and his speech demonstrated how deeply he thinks about it. I freely admit that I have been engaged in energy debates for longer than I care to remember&#151;long before I entered the House. Indeed, you and I, Mr. Cook, have shared the platform on such issues on more than one occasion. My constituency is heavily engaged in North sea oil and gas, so such matters are of particular interest to me.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para25"><a name="stpa_186">My intervention in my hon. Friend&#039;s speech was not supposed to be alarmist. I take his point about Russia, but it is a matter of reflection&#151;it was debated at the time of the previous oil shock in the 1970s&#151;that we are heavily dependent for our oil and gas supplies on resources sourced in parts of the world that, if put together, have less-than-guaranteed political stability. Two responses are needed to the problem. We must first ensure that we maximise exploration, development and production of the areas that are more accessible and less vulnerable. Clearly, the North sea is paramount to the United Kingdom. Secondly, we must promote a wider range of alternatives to oil and gas that will cause less damage to the planet and extend the useful life of our oil and gas reserves by broadening the mix of fuels that we can use.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para26"><a name="stpa_187">As for geopolitics, the oil price is a two-edged sword. A high oil price clearly brings into prospect supplies that have previously been uneconomic. I recently talked to several Canadian politicians and economists who were quite excited at the forecast oil prices that put a completely different prospect on the viability of the Athabasca tar sands in western Canada. At a price of $100 a barrel&#151;or even $50 a barrel&#151;the sands start to become interesting. They could have the resource that Saudi has produced at much lower prices. We will have to see whether that will be sustained and whether the investment will be forthcoming. However, I know where my judgment would lie if I had a choice between being dependent on Saudi Arabia or being dependent on Canada.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para27"><a name="stpa_188">My hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) alluded to my second point. In Scotland, we are promoting conservation and diversity of supply, particularly through renewables. I, and I am sure some other Members, have had experience of current developments in wind farms and wind technology. I hasten to stress unequivocally that wind technology and wind farms have a worthwhile 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 113WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
contribution to make. I have supported them in my constituency, where they have not always been popular; I have stood up and said that they are right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para28"><a name="stpa_189">I am pleased to say that I was at the opening of a wind farm just four weeks ago. It has proved economically successful and, interestingly, quite a local talking point and tourist attraction. That does not mean that every wind energy development everywhere is right, but it seems to me that such technology has a contribution to make.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para29"><a name="stpa_190">I shall tweak the Minister a little, although I suspect that he may not entirely disagree. In Scotland, to achieve our 40 per cent. target, we recognise that the bluntness of the renewables obligation is what drives the investment in wind technology. We need to diversify. Oil and gas supplies are made more secure the more diverse the fuel mix is, because we become less heavily dependent on them; that diversity is also more environmentally beneficial. The Scottish Executive have added an incentive for those investing in wave or wind power, to spread the mix. I suggest to the Minister that his Department might want to consider that as it adapts south of the border.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para30"><a name="stpa_191">I have probably heard too much about the threat to security of supply. Digby Jones always likes to attract attention and the easiest way to do that is to make dramatic suggestions such as, &quot;The switch is about to be thrown on the British industry&quot;. Most of the people I talk to in the gas industry are confident that the investments being made to bring liquefied natural gas and other contracts on board will lead to a secure and reduced gas supply. However, I agree that we should not be complacent about that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para31"><a name="stpa_192">To my mind, it has always been important that we have a good relationship with our friends in Norway. Of course Norway wants to sell its gas at a high price. However, not to find a basis on which we can accommodate Norway would not be in its interest or ours. My conclusion is that we should look at the whole of the North sea. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) will concur with me when I say that when he and I were in Norway last year, at an offshore North sea exhibition, there were some interesting discussions about the potential for joint development&#151;particularly of fields that straddle the median line. The infrastructure certainly requires a partnership that involves Norwegian and British ownership and investment, even for fields that do not straddle the line.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para32"><a name="stpa_193">This debate is timely. This country needs oil and gas and produces both. We still have a long-term stake in the production of oil and gas from our own resources, partly by diversifying the fuel mix and partly&#151;this is my final, direct last plea to the Minister&#151;by ensuring a regime that stimulates and encourages exploration and does not drive investment away by unexpected and abrupt changes in the tax regime. I assure the Minister that that has happened.

<a name="51012h03_para33"><a name="stpa_194">My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham made a particular point about the smaller investors that the Minister has welcomed into this last round; they are the most vulnerable to such changes. If the Minister and the Government have made a pact&#151;or an agreement or accommodation&#151;to bring in small operators, I will not object; they are often innovative

and can provide new techniques. However, it is also important to understand that they of all people need to know that there is a long-term stable regime that will enable them to bid for and secure investment funds, instead of them fearing that the regime could undermine their long-term viability. That has not always been the case, and I hope that the Government will learn from some of the past mistakes.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51012h03_spnew11"><b> Sir Robert Smith  (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</b>  (LD): As was said this morning while we were discussing a similar matter to do with the coal industry, we have an opportunity to make progress on some issues. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing this debate. It enables us to focus on something that has been high profile and of great concern over the summer, and it provides the Minister with an opportunity to address on the record, in the House, the concerns that have been raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para34"><a name="stpa_195">Before I go any further, I should declare an entry of mine in the Register of Members&#039; Interests: I am a shareholder in Shell, an oil and gas integrated company.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para35"><a name="stpa_196">I shall begin by addressing a subject that was tackled by my hon. Friends the Members for Twickenham and for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson). It is clear that the most immediate and pressing problem with oil and gas prices relates to domestic users this winter and, potentially, next winter. The gas market in the UK is tight almost, but not completely, regardless of the world situation. Therefore, in the winter months when not enough gas supplies come to the UK to meet all the demand, the price will go up; and if the price goes up, that will affect both our constituents and industrial users.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para36"><a name="stpa_197">We had many good years of competition, which gave us cheap energy, and I think that although Digby Jones is worried about this winter, he does not want to throw away all those years when we had the competitive advantage of a market in energy supply. However, perhaps the Government need to address how and why the market signals did not work well enough to take us into this winter in a better state than we are in.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para37"><a name="stpa_198">When the Trade and Industry Committee looked into fuel prices, one of the things we were concerned about was gas storage and the delay in some of the schemes. In its response to the Committee, Ofgem said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;We agree with the Committee that planning regulations are a key reason for the delaying of several storage projects which could have eased the situation last winter. However, planning regulations are a matter for Government.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para38"><a name="stpa_199">The Government pointed out that planning is a balancing act because various issues have to be weighed up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para39"><a name="stpa_200">Do the Government have a view on what was wrong in the signals to the market that led to investors not getting into the process early enough to get over the planning hurdles? Should the planning hurdles be changed so that investors can get the storage in place? If we had more storage in place in the run-up to this winter, the market would not be so worried about the potential peaks of a downside&#151;of a very cold winter&#151;and therefore the forward price of gas would not have hit quite such extremes when people were trying to get secure contracts.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para40"><a name="stpa_201">Another issue for the coming winter is power cuts. The Minister did not have time to address that this morning, but I hope that he will have time to do so this afternoon. How does he see this winter in terms of security and stability of supply? Is it just the interruptible supplies that are likely to be hit in a one in 50 winter, or might there be a wider problem that could affect our constituents?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para41"><a name="stpa_202">My hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire made an important point about energy conservation. In the long run, energy conservation is a permanent victory because, regardless of what happens to the price of the energy, we will be consuming less, helping our environmental goals and helping to ensure security of supply because we will need less supply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para42"><a name="stpa_203">With regard to tackling fuel poverty, there are three pillars: the price of the energy, the quality of the housing stock and the income of the person living in the house. If the quality of the housing stock can be tackled, there is a good chance that when people move&#151;and a lot of people do&#151;they will still be in good housing, and that will help to deal with fuel poverty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para43"><a name="stpa_204">I ask again for more guidance from the Government. How will they take that next step in getting our housing stock right? If we do not do that through the building regulations, and if we do not press it strongly enough, will we not miss out? Even with the current high prices, televisions are often left on standby. People do not realise how the energy costs in their home add up. All the little things&#151;such as filling the kettle up instead of just putting in a mug-full of water when they want a mug of coffee&#151;add up to extra costs. People need more information.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para44"><a name="stpa_205">On fuel poverty, we looked at debt and disconnections and the Government&#039;s response. One of the things we examined was trying to get more information to consumers about the priority services register. We are again going into a winter with much higher prices and there is a greater risk of people not being able to pay their bills, getting into trouble and getting behind. It is crucial that the elderly, disabled and those with health problems are on the priority services register, so that the energy companies know that they are dealing with someone who is at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para45"><a name="stpa_206">In July, the Government said in their response:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;Through DTI and DEFRA, the Government has also agreed to examine how other departments such as DWP and DoH can support companies&#039; efforts to identify vulnerable customers and promote a range of relevant services, including the Priority Services Register.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para46"><a name="stpa_207">Perhaps the Minister will say how, over the summer, the Departments have got together to take that forward, because the winter is nearly upon us. Here in London it is still quite warm, but back home it is already getting that much colder. It would be helpful if the Minister tackled that issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para47"><a name="stpa_208">EU liberalisation has also been raised. There are two more months of the UK presidency of the EU, and the issue affects the UK directly. It would be helpful to know what the Government have done so far to advance what, I think, the Commission wants: the opening up and liberalisation of the markets in mainland Europe. While the UK, a liberalised market, is connected physically to a market that is not liberalised, there will be distortions in our price system.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para48"><a name="stpa_209">As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said, the link with oil is particularly distorting for us at the moment. There are historic reasons why customers wanted the link with oil, but now that there is a much more fluid gas market, such reasons are in the past. It is time to break the link. I hope that the Minister will give us an update on how far the Government are getting with liberalisation or&#151;if they are very pessimistic of how far they will get&#151;what alternative strategy they have to deal with the disconnection of liberalised and unliberalised markets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para49"><a name="stpa_210">Other colleagues, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), have raised the vital role that the upstream sector in the UK&#151;our own oil and gas&#151;can play in a situation such as this and the importance of ensuring good investment. One of the triggers for this winter and the need for more storage is the fact that a lot more of our gas comes from fields that are produced with oil. Therefore, the flow of gas cannot be varied; it comes as fast or slow as the oil can be got out of the ground. We have lost the flexibility of having as much of our gas as we used to coming from plain gas fields. It is much easier to turn the tap off and on with them. That is another driver for the need for more storage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para50"><a name="stpa_211">It is also another driver for ensuring that the Government have a regime in place that maximises the investment in the next generation of exploration and production. There was a successful licensing round. The Minister may answer my colleagues&#039; questions about some of the smaller entrants. Some of them are generating or working up potential prospects for larger investors to tempt them forward. The fallow field initiative aims to persuade people who have sat on old investments to liberate them, and that is to be welcomed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para51"><a name="stpa_212">The working of industry with Government through pilot programmes has made a big difference to the climate in the North sea and the understanding between Government and investors. When it comes down to it, the oil and gas in the ground is ours; it belongs to citizens of the United Kingdom. We license it to operators to take it out of the ground, so there will always have to be a close partnership between Government and industry in that sector.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para52"><a name="stpa_213">The Chancellor is the one player who does not pull his weight and who has done a lot of damage. He lectures Saudi Arabia on maximising its production and investment yet, three years ago, he frightened away people from investing in the North sea. It is a little rich for a major oil and gas producer that has not been careful about shepherding its own resources to lecture abroad. In the long run, we all benefit if he gets it right, because the more investment there is in the North sea, the more gas and oil will be produced, the more tax he will raise and the more money will come into the UK economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para53"><a name="stpa_214">The Minister needs to reassure us that the Government are on board in terms of getting the next phase of the North sea development done. The Minister is a regular visitor to Aberdeen. As he has said, the glass is half full and not half empty. We need to get that optimism across to help recruit the next generation of engineers, who we need to make that a vital industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para54"><a name="stpa_215">Finally, I want to touch on the potential of renewables. Those with transferable skills in the North sea, wearing the badge of AREG&#151;the Aberdeen

<br>&nbsp;<br>
renewable energy group, which I am sure the Minister has already met&#151;are trying to take the skills of the north-east of Scotland as an oil and gas expertise area, such as offshore engineering, and diversify into the renewables sector. A wave power machine has already been developed by Portugal, but has sadly not yet been bought in this country. Such an industry has the potential to be a major export industry. We missed the onshore wind industry&#151;we let the Danes get there first&#151;and we must not give up the slot to others when we have such potential, with our coastline, tides and waves. Recognition from the Government on the roles of diversification would be most welcome.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para55"><a name="stpa_216">To reiterate, will the Minister answer the points about fuel poverty and the priority service register, will he give his view on the power cuts? Will he respond to the concern expressed this morning about accelerating the carbon capture and storage programme? A lot of heads around the Chamber are nodding when we talk about the pace of progress. We may just have missed the connection between getting the technology established and losing the easy route of disposing of the CO <sub>2</sub>  into the North sea. If the Minister will address ways in which the Government can see the demonstration plant get up and running soon, that would recognise the issues raised this morning in the debate on the coal industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para56"><a name="stpa_217">Will the Minister update us on the liberalisation of the EU market and what efforts have been made to date? How does he see gas storage being incentivised: by improving the planning process or by getting the signals into the market sooner so that the planning process can be got through at the pace it now takes? Finally, will he reiterate the commitment to the North sea? If we invest effectively in the North sea, we all win.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51012h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Bernard Jenkin  (North Essex)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable) on obtaining the debate and on the comprehensive set of questions that he has tabled for the Minister. The scale of the task set for him makes me wonder how the Minister will manage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para57"><a name="stpa_218">As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the energy agenda has suddenly become very big, but the Government have only one Minister for Energy&#151;a Minister of State, not a Secretary of State. I say with the greatest of respect to all those present, that one hears that some officials are demoralised and fed up that energy does not carry more clout throughout Whitehall. That is no personal criticism of the Minister; it is a matter of the way in which the boss runs things. Many Cabinet figures have responsibilities that cross boundaries with the Minister&#039;s, but he is probably frequently not present to make his pitch on the issues that matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para58"><a name="stpa_219">I reiterate what I said this morning: the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Government have been in power for eight and a half years. A fair measure of success of a Government&#039;s energy regime is that they deliver on three crucial areas: prices that are fair and competitive, albeit not necessarily low; environmental outputs that meet the Government&#039;s targets; and security of supply. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to see that we have some of the highest wholesale energy prices in Europe, if not the highest, so

the Government are failing on price. Our carbon emissions are increasing and the Government&#039;s failure in respect of electricity generation is ensuring that the carbon emissions from that source are increasing. The 2003 White Paper showed a heavier reliance on fossil fuel generation, so the Government are failing on that, as well as on security of supply. When the director general of the CBI&#151;in his usual florid style&#151;says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;it&#039;s an absolute disgrace that we risk running out of fuel because of something that was entirely avoidable&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para59"><a name="stpa_220">the Government have a bare-knuckle fight on their hands, as one might have said in the early 1980s.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para60"><a name="stpa_221">High gas prices in this country have been caused by the failure of Labour&#039;s energy policy. In 2003, the Government should have been smoothing the transition to this country becoming a net importer of gas. As the hon. Member for Twickenham suggested, the Government should have been making a risk assessment of what gas supplies were likely to be, given different scenarios and given that the industry&#039;s forecasts might be out by a margin one way or another. Instead, the Government&#039;s energy White Paper ignored any possible approach to gas shortage and gave no incentive to invest in anything except wind power stations. We are all in favour of promoting renewables, but planning to spend nearly &#163;1 billion in subsidy by 2010 on renewables&#151;and, incidentally, failing to reach that target as well as everything else&#151;and neglecting other failures in the oil, gas and electricity markets shows a degree of complacency or blindness that is breathtaking in terms of the Government&#039;s responsibility.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para61"><a name="stpa_222">The Government were asleep at the switch and failed in their duty to provide adequate energy supplies. British industry is now paying a heavy price, if not in terms of interruptions, certainly in respect of what it is actually having to pay. A fortnight ago, I visited Amcor, a polyethylene terephthalate bottling plant in Wrexham, which operates in a heavily energy dependent industry. The plant is a subsidiary of an American company with plants elsewhere in the world, particularly in France, where it is able to make long-term contracts with cheap electricity suppliers, the result of which is that the British plant is woefully uncompetitive against its French counterpart. As we went around this state-of-the-art bottle manufacturing plant in Wrexham, someone commented that there comes a point at which investment in the UK becomes fruitless and investment elsewhere becomes much more fruitful. It is not impossible to imagine that high technology manufacturing equipment could simply be transported from Wrexham to Dunkirk, where the parent company has alternative facilities and would make much more money; in fact, it might make a profit there, rather than a loss on its UK activities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para62"><a name="stpa_223">This is the Government&#039;s responsibility; it is not something that they can give over to the markets. The Government are responsible for the market regulators and for ensuring that regulators are acting in the national interest. Markets were never a religion. The Minister looks astonished at my saying that, but he treats the markets as more of a religion than any Conservative. The present Administration inherited the regulation of energy markets from their Conservative predecessors but, extraordinarily, they treat competitiveness as a higher objective than almost any other. Their dogmatic adherence to internal 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 119WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
competitiveness ignores the fact that we have moved from big surpluses into possible deficits, that raw material prices have changed, and that we have gone from a cheap energy world to a high-price energy world. The Government have also ignored the fact that to achieve environmental objectives, they have bolted one policy after another on to the framework that they inherited. They have not had a proper review of energy policy in eight and a half years, and British industry and British consumers are now paying the price.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para63"><a name="stpa_224">Opening the debate, the hon. Member for Twickenham referred to fuel poverty and the very big increases in electricity and gas prices that domestic consumers are having to accept. That knocks into a cocked hat all the Labour party&#039;s wailing and gnashing of teeth about VAT on fuel and the great fanfare with which they lopped 3 per cent. off the VAT on domestic fuel when they came to office. Consumers are now paying far more than that token cut in tax that the Government produced then. Is it right that consumers should bear the cost of diversification into renewables, particularly when energy prices have risen so much?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para64"><a name="stpa_225">The system of renewables obligation certificates simply piggybacks on energy prices. At a time of high energy prices, certain questions arise. When the system was set up the ROC system was going to pay out &#163;30 per kW and the consumer was paying &#163;11 per kW in the market. What is the wholesale price of electricity going to be this winter&#151;&#163;35 or &#163;40 per kW? The ROC system is still going to pay an extra &#163;30 per kW. Should not the level of subsidy be sensitive to the price? Nobody talks about windfall profits tax on wind power generators, but everybody is ready to talk about it when the oil companies make money. If the wind generators are making huge extra profits, why not clobber them with a windfall profits tax? I do not advocate windfall profits taxes, I am merely trying to tease out the lack of internal logic in the Government&#039;s policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para65"><a name="stpa_226">The Government are there to oversee the operation of energy markets and to ensure that any regulation and intervention that they make will work in the public interest. The Government have failed in that respect. They have failed on prices, on security of supply and on environmental outputs. They should have made a much more sober and longer-term assessment of the likelihood of an unexpected decline in the production of the United Kingdom&#039;s continental shelf production of gas. That is the Minister&#039;s job. Why bother to have a Minister for Energy or a Department responsible for energy policy unless they are going to look over the horizon and think up some scenarios in which things go wrong and have to be put right? The Government manfully resisted any obligation to oversee security of supply when we were debating energy legislation, but we all know the truth. When the lights start to go out, a Minister will have to make a statement about it at the Dispatch Box. When the lights went out under previous Governments&#151;of both colours, I hasten to add&#151;the domestic consumer took the hit in order to keep industry going. Under this Government, the big

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51012h03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Jenkin </b> : I am just pointing out that the Government are doing everything to save face as they contemplate possible shortages of supply this winter. We all know from conversations that we have had with those in the industry that the Minister likes to present a calm and reassuring face in public, but when he speaks to people in private, his chief concern is about what will happen this winter. I commend him for that concern&#151;it is the right concern for him to have, and nobody in this Chamber will seek to make life more difficult for him this winter or next.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para66"><a name="stpa_227">The United Kingdom needs a long-term energy strategy that includes a complete review of how the energy markets are operating in this country, otherwise we will have other problems further down the line. The large combustion plant directive, for example, will cut in in 2008 and create more strain on the gas market as more coal generation is forced out of business and more gas plants come on-stream as a result. All that must be addressed by a Department that takes a strategic view of what is required for the regulation and operation of gas, electricity and oil markets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para67"><a name="stpa_228">Comments about maximising the life of the UK continental shelf by providing a stable tax regime are absolutely right. The Chancellor obviously gave the industry a horrible shock three years ago when he pounced on it for taxation. The difficulty that we now face is that public expenditure, which is astonishingly unreported and uncommented on in British politics, has increased by 8 per cent. of GDP in only five years and at a time of relatively strong economic growth. That is not sustainable growth in public spending. We all know that the Government should be repaying debt over a period of the economic cycle, but they have instead been increasing their borrowings. Sooner or later, the chickens will come home to roost unless the Chancellor is luckier than we can possibly imagine. He has had some luck, but there are those who believe that it will start to run out. No doubt the Prime Minister will have departed the scene by then, but the question arises: where will the Government get the money from? With high oil and gas prices, the industry is absolutely right to warn very sternly that an attack on the oil industry for windfall profit taxes, or any other kind of raid, will be a very serious setback for the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para68"><a name="stpa_229">I should just warn about one little panacea that we are all tempted to indulge at this particular juncture, which is that somehow all the problems in our oil and particularly gas markets are not the UK&#039;s fault at all, but the fault of those naughty Europeans, the French and the Germans, who have failed to liberalise their markets as they agreed to do in principle. We should be realistic. What are we actually asking France and Germany to do? We have liberalised gas markets, but we have the highest wholesale gas prices in Europe by a very long way. If France and Germany liberalised their gas markets, their gas prices would increase to reflect the increase in the oil price, just as ours have to a degree. We are basically asking France and Germany to increase

<br>&nbsp;<br>
their electricity and gas prices for their industrial consumers. Do we really believe that they will do that? Is that realistic? We should be more realistic and recognise that liberalising the gas and electricity markets in the EU will take 10 or more years. That is not a solution to the problems that we face at the moment. By failing to invest in gas storage capacity, the Government feel asleep at the switch.
</p>






<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51012h03_spnew14"><b> Sir Robert Smith </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman disagree with Digby Jones that in the past eight years we have benefited from the liberalised market in terms of competitive prices for industry? Would not that be an attraction to those in other markets, who would be taken away from being reliant on state monopolies?
</p>






<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51012h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Jenkin </b> : I do not disagree with the liberalisation of gas markets, but we should be realistic. The French have a long record of providing their industry with hidden subsidies and they will not suddenly take them away. That is how they operate in global capitalism. The same is true of the vertically integrated energy markets in Germany: the Germans will not take away the competitive advantages that are maintaining them at the moment. I am in favour of market liberalisation; I am in favour of a common market and I am in favour of the directive that is designed to bring it about. However, that is not going to fix the problem this year, or next year or in the next 18 months or anywhere near that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para69"><a name="stpa_230">As for alternative fuels, we are pushing for a much earlier energy review than the Prime Minister seems able to contemplate. I suspect that he is trying to avoid an energy review that clashes with the tenure of the present Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, because she is a bit of a road block to what he wants to do about energy policy&#151;which is to explore the possibilities of relaunching a nuclear new build programme. Perhaps the Prime Minister wants to delay his energy review until a change in personnel has taken place in that Department and elsewhere. Perhaps at that point the Minister for Energy will be propelled up the system and we shall be able to expect more clout on the energy portfolio.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para70"><a name="stpa_231">Some other issues are being missed, such as biomass and biofuels. At a time when the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is effectively running down the production capacity of British agriculture because of the changes in agricultural policy, and when the sugar regime has changed so that sugar beet ceases to be an economically viable crop for the production of sugar, where is the Government&#039;s strategy for maintaining the viability of agricultural production and giving a little boost to the environment by promoting the growing of oilseed rape and sugar beet for the production of biofuels in the UK? It is not realistic simply to lop some duty off biofuels at the filling station; that will attract biofuels from other countries with perhaps less environmentally benign policies. I am not in favour of buying subsidised biofuels from, say, Brazil, where they cut down rainforest to plant sugar cane. That is not the answer. I want the Government to take the same kind of strategic approach to biofuels that they have shown themselves capable of taking to, for example, wind generation. There is a huge mismatch between the Government&#039;s obsession with wind, which will not deliver what they want, and all the other issues that need to be tackled.

<a name="51012h03_para71"><a name="stpa_232">At Trade and Industry questions just before the recess the Secretary of State promised a debate about security of supply this autumn. It is now the autumn. When will we have the debate about security of supply? It might be a good idea from the Minister&#039;s point of view and in terms of the Government&#039;s credibility if we had it before the cold snap.

</p>



<a name="time_21">
<a name="51012h03_time5"><h5>3.42 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51012h03_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks) </b> : I thank the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) for requesting the debate and for the sober and calm way in which he introduced it. That tone has been a feature of the debate: hon. Members have sought not to scaremonger but to raise serious issues on an important theme. Some might think that that tone went off a little in the last few minutes, but I do not want to be too churlish about the somewhat alarmist speech that we just heard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para72"><a name="stpa_233">In explaining my approach the matter, I am reminded of this morning&#039;s debate about coal, whereas we are now primarily discussing gas and oil. Perfectly reasonably, those subjects raise the general context of energy policy and its interface with climate change and social policy issues connected with fuel poverty. I shall try to remain fairly focused on gas and oil, although towards the end of my response I shall try to range a little more widely. I hope that that is acceptable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para73"><a name="stpa_234">Gas is, of course, the fuel of choice for household consumers and it now accounts for more than 30 per cent. of our electricity generation. It is a major source of fuel&#151;indeed, it is a source of feedstock for industry. Oil literally lubricates the machinery of UK industry and ensures that our transport system runs efficiently. However, there is no denying&#151;no one is complacent&#151;that some significant challenges are ahead, particularly in relation to gas. As Great Britain moves towards increasing its gas imports&#151;we became a net importer last year&#151;we will need a new gas import and storage infrastructure. Developments in the oil market over the past few years also present a challenge.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para74"><a name="stpa_235">Providing supply to meet demand is a commercial matter. The Government, the Department for Trade and Industry and Ofgem will establish a regulatory and commercial environment conducive to major new ventures and will work on individual projects to identify and help remove avoidable non-commercial obstacles. I am pleased to say that that approach has yielded excellent results. Three important new facilities to increase the amount of gas available to the UK market will be ready for this winter. The new liquefied natural gas import terminal at the Isle of Grain is already commissioned; a new gas storage project at Humbly Grove in Hampshire will shortly be commissioned; and a large increase in the import capacity of the interconnector from Belgium is due to be commissioned in November, which I am advised is a month early. Several other major projects are planned for the next winter or so, including further LNG import terminals under development at Milford Haven, Canvey island and, potentially, in north Wales. In other words, the Government&#039;s approach to security of supply is working well. At least &#163;10 billion-worth of private sector investment will be made in providing gas to the UK market in the next few years.
</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51012h03_spnew16"><b> Sir Robert Smith </b> : In the Minister&#039;s long-term big picture, there will be new pipelines and new storage, but

<br>&nbsp;<br>
will not a mismatch hit our large energy users, in that it will be a year or two years too late to achieve a smooth flow from the previous regime to the new one?
</p>






<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51012h03_spnew17"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> : That is not altogether unfair. As Minister for Energy I would have hoped that some developments had come on line a year or two earlier. That is partly the result of the fact that the decline in oil and gas from the North sea happened at a faster rate than many in the market and in Government anticipated. I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but the developments that I have mentioned will help in part this winter, and over the next year or two they will make a considerable difference.
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51012h03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Jenkin </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51012h03_spnew19"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> : I shall, even though the hon. Gentleman spoke for quite a while. I shall take one intervention, then make progress on my speech.
</p>






<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51012h03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Jenkin </b> : My question is about the operation of gas markets. Representations have been made to me, and, I expect, to the Minister, that there is not enough transparency in the market. Large buyers cannot see into the supply chain&#151;I might not be using the right expression&#151;to discover the likely forecast of gas supplies month by month, perhaps over the next six months. We are getting what the market calls anxiety spikes in the price, but they might not reflect the true position. It obviously suits certain people that there should be anxiety spikes, but if information was available to the market, people could see that there would be enough gas and the big spikes would therefore not occur. Will the Minister consider that point?
</p>






<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51012h03_spnew21"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> : Yes. I believe that Ofgem and the industry are looking at that, but some commercial sensitivities are involved. If I have more to say, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para75"><a name="stpa_236">I shall now make progress on covering the issues raised in the debate and answering some of the questions. Access to reliable and affordable supplies of oil is vital for the UK and the global economy. In real terms, current price levels are lower than the peaks seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A strong and unexpected growth in global oil demand, rather than a supply shock, has been the driving force behind the recent higher prices. Because of that increased demand, global production and refining capacity has become very tight.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para76"><a name="stpa_237">In that context, I should say something about the response to the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the oil market. The International Energy Agency called on its member states to release 2 million barrels of oil a day over 30 days. The organisation was able very quickly to reach a view that the disruption to the world markets was large enough to justify releasing stocks. That was a remarkable achievement. It demonstrates the merits of the IEA&#039;s multilateral approach and the need for such an approach when dealing with the global oil market.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para77"><a name="stpa_238">The release of stocks has improved the supply situation, and it has had a calming effect on the market and on prices. It was clearly the right thing to do and the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 124WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
timetable was right. Indeed, when I saw him in Washington a few weeks ago, the United States Energy Secretary, Mr. Bodman, said how grateful he was for the international response at a difficult time for our friends in the USA. The United Kingdom industry, as well as taking part in the release of stocks, was able to increase gasoline exports to the United States while ensuring that the UK remained supplied without domestic shortages.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para78"><a name="stpa_239">Both oil-producing and consuming nations have shared interests and responsibilities in delivering more stable oil prices that enable sustainable economic growth. Our response was well summarised at the meeting on 23 September of the G7 Finance Ministers and central bank governors, who agreed on the key steps that need to be taken. Among the most important decisions that were made was to call for significant investment in exploration, production, energy, infrastructure and refinery capacity. The G7 also called for oil-producing countries to ensure a favourable investment climate, open markets with transparent business practices and stable regulatory frameworks. It said that subsidies and artificial price caps that constrain the price of oil and oil products have an adverse effect on the global market and should be avoided. We shall pursue such policies domestically and through the International Energy Agency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para79"><a name="stpa_240">I have been asked perfectly properly about the outlook for winter. Looking forward to the winter&#151;it says here, although that is not the phraseology that I would have used&#151;there are concerns about gas prices and gas supplies. The Government are taking those worries seriously. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I regularly meet representatives from both the supply side and the demand side, so we have a clear view of the impact that such concerns have on business confidence. It is no secret that the gas market is likely to be tighter than in recent winters. Given normal weather conditions, however, there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity generation to meet demand, and even in the severest of winters, analysis shows that the market can maintain supplies by a combination of actions to reduce demand for gas. In all credible scenarios, the energy market will be able to deliver supplies to domestic consumers. Given the vulnerability of some of our constituents&#151;not least the very elderly&#151;that has to be the right priority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para80"><a name="stpa_241">For many years, our gas market has provided internationally competitive prices to Great Britain gas consumers&#151;for example, our prices to domestic customers have ranked the lowest within the 15 EU countries since 2001 and are still 40 per cent. below EU median prices&#151;but gas prices have been rising steadily since the summer of 2004. That is especially true in the wholesale market, where UK prices have been driven by continental prices that are linked contractually to oil. However, based on official statistics UK retail gas and electricity prices to industrial consumers remain 5 to 10 per cent. below EU median prices. I recognise that there may be a special problem for UK super-large industrial consumers, and I have spent much time meeting their representatives. They pay close to wholesale market prices, and their competitors on the continent do the same. Our analysis for the coming year suggests that UK forward prices will be roughly 15 per cent. above those on the continent. However, forward prices are already showing an expectation of narrowing 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 125WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
differentials between the UK and the continent, with UK prices only about 10 per cent. above continental prices for gas year 2006.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para81"><a name="stpa_242">I have been asked about EU liberalisation. Prices on the continent are not fully market reflective, as so few of the energy markets in the EU are functioning properly. That is why making European energy markets work properly is a key priority for the UK presidency. A key element in our strategy is to push for proper implementation of existing legislation. We expect the Commission to ensure full compliance by all member states. That is why we are looking forward to the report that the Commission will be publishing later this year, which will evaluate progress made towards the development of the an internal energy market. However, full implementation of the liberalisation legislation may not deliver the competition that consumers need, so the Commission has launched a sectoral review of gas and electricity markets, with initial findings to be published later this year and a final report to be issued at the end of 2006. Those two reports should illuminate the state of the EU&#039;s energy market and identify what steps may be necessary to ensure its proper functioning. They also present an important opportunity for market participants and stakeholders to bring to the Commission&#039;s attention any problems that they have encountered when trying to do business in Europe.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para82"><a name="stpa_243">Meanwhile, to try to address the problems already being caused to large users in the UK, my Department has set up a gas prices working group with industry and Ofgem. The group has now agreed a list of short to medium-term action points, such as taking measures to maximise gas supplies; encouraging demand-side response; and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU. It has also discussed ways for industrial consumers to adapt their purchasing strategies in the light of the changed situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para83"><a name="stpa_244">A number of issues were raised in the debate and I might not address them in the right order. The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), in an important speech on the social aspects of energy, mentioned what we now call fuel poverty. I wish I had time to go into it in more detail. I am immensely interested in the subject and could write a book about it&#151;indeed, in 1978, I did. After years of progress on the indicator to which she referred, there are now difficulties with rising energy prices. We need to marshal the resources that we now have through the warm front programme in England and its equivalents in Wales and Scotland, and through the obligation on suppliers to take energy efficiency seriously in the homes of people on low incomes. I also think that we should use the resources of other Departments, not least my former Department, the Department for Work and Pensions. Locally, the Pension Service now works closely with 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 126WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
other agencies, social services departments and social work departments in Scotland. Such an approach will enable better targeting. We should remember the winter fuel payments&#151;&#163;300 for the over-80s and &#163;200 for other elderly people&#151;which have made a considerable difference. I take the hon. Lady&#039;s comments on the issues seriously.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para84"><a name="stpa_245">Wider issues relating to renewables were raised. Again, I wish I could debate them at some length. The 10 per cent. target by 2010 is in place. and it should be achieved mainly through wind&#151;hon. Members should not tilt at windmills. Wind energy will be an important source of renewable energy but we also need to develop other technologies. Britain&#151;Scotland in particular&#151;could become a world leader in some of them. There is an agenda involving energy efficiency, which we need to discuss more, not least because 27 per cent. of our CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions come from our own homes. We need to focus on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para85"><a name="stpa_246">I cannot say much more about the transport aspects today because I am not the Secretary of State for Transport. However, my Toyota Prius is waiting for me outside so I am making a small contribution in that respect. I had the opportunity of driving one of the first hydrogen cars when I was in Washington. I am, at least, aware of that important agenda.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para86"><a name="stpa_247">It has been acknowledged that we are actively engaged with the industry in exploiting the UK continental shelf and the North sea as effectively as possible. I chair the partnership known as PILOT, whereby my Department meets with industry with the aim of establishing a dynamic relationship with the industry. In essence, the message is, &quot;If we have given you a licence, use it or lose it. Exploit fallow fields and brownfields in the North sea.&quot; I think it that is effective, given our present situation. The fact that 20 or more new companies were given licences is exciting. We need to ensure that they deliver and get the investment they need, but I am excited about the entrepreneurship of smaller companies in the North sea.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h03_para87"><a name="stpa_248">There are now regular summit meetings between the EU and OPEC on energy issues. I am sorry that I have not had much time to address the remarks by the official Opposition spokesman. He made some derogatory remarks about my boss, which I will not follow up. I would say that at least it has not taken us five months to choose a boss. That is one of the differences between our parties. I found his views on the market fascinating. He seemed to be calling for far greater state intervention in the market. I always thought he was a true believer in the market, but he seems to be becoming a bit of an agnostic, which is a wonder to behold.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51012h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): Thank you, Mr. Cook. I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate. I am grateful also that the Minister is here to listen to&#151;and, I hope, respond positively to&#151;the debate. For the record, I should state that I serve as a councillor on Kettering borough council and am also a member of the Campaign to Protect Rural England.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para0"><a name="stpa_249">I shall start, if I may, with my conclusion and then attempt to lead the debate through the process of how I arrived at it. My conclusion is that despite Government promises that housing expansion plans for Northamptonshire would be infrastructure and jobs-led, that is increasingly proving not to be the case. Unless the Minister and his Department seize proper ownership of the delivery of their growth-area agenda and bring other Government Departments and their related agencies&#151;primarily the Highways Agency&#151;into line with their own ambitions, then as far as Northamptonshire is concerned, either the target number of houses envisaged for 2021&#150;31 will not be met, or, if that is pushed through, it will be accompanied by poorer quality new housing than need be the case and a local transport network and local public services that are so overstretched and inadequate as to imperil seriously the quality of life for all who live in the county at the moment and make those new communities unsustainable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para1"><a name="stpa_250">As a matter of urgency, the Minister and his Department need to undertake a major strategic reassessment of the ability of the A14&#151;the A1-M1 link road&#151;and the roads off it to cope with the housing that is required to be built along it, and in particular of the need for an urgent solution to the traffic congestion around Kettering.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para2"><a name="stpa_251">How have I arrived at that conclusion? A good place to start is at the beginning. As a result of the Government-led Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional spatial strategy, the final version of which was published in March this year, issues on development and its repercussions on local infrastructure and public services will be the dominant political issue in the Kettering constituency for the next 25 years. Under that strategy, north Northamptonshire, which comprises the boroughs of Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and the district of East Northants, is expected to deliver about 52,000 new homes and 43,800 new jobs over the period 2001&#150;2021 and a further 28,000 new houses in the following decade. The 52,000 new houses to be built by 2021 will be equivalent to a city the size of Worcester and there will be more of them than in any other part of the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para3"><a name="stpa_252">The borough of Kettering is due to see 13,100 new houses built during that period, with further thousands of houses thereafter. That will increase the number of houses and people in the borough by more than a third by 2021 and even more thereafter. Other parts of the Kettering constituency outside the borough will also see housing expansion, although not on as great a scale. Given the housing expansion elsewhere in Northamptonshire, the county will see at least 145,000 new houses constructed by 2031, increasing its population by half. That will be a major step change for the local area and will change life for ever for all those who live there now and will live there in future.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 128WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para4"><a name="stpa_253">I have to tell the Minister that expansion on this scale is not what local people would have chosen for their area. The rate of expansion is far more rapid than that set out in the 1996 Northamptonshire county council structure plan, which was democratically arrived at, and which has effectively been consigned to the dustbin of history. Expansion on such a scale is widely opposed in Kettering as being too great and too rapid.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para5"><a name="stpa_254">There is clearly strong local support for the economic redevelopment of historically underperforming parts of the county&#151;not least Corby, as well as parts of Northampton and Kettering borough&#151;and support for the provision of more affordable housing in general. However, there are real concerns about the loss of valued local countryside and the creation of new and elongated conurbations, leading to the coalescence of separate, distinctive and historic small towns, with the subsequent loss of their identity. It is extremely disappointing that in the sub-regional strategy the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has abandoned its national minimum target for 60 per cent. of new residential development to take place on brownfield sites.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para6"><a name="stpa_255">There is also genuine concern about the fact that the local road network and public services are already overstretched; they will be stretched to breaking point unless urgent steps are taken to co-ordinate and provide the necessary funding for their improvement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para7"><a name="stpa_256">Having said all that, we are where we are. Like it or not, the sub-regional strategy is Government policy, and changes made by the ODPM last Parliament mean that the planning system is now driven by the top-down approach desired by the Government. The result is that local councils and planning authorities in the county are given far less latitude to resist major development plans than under the previous system. As that is the case, local authorities and other agencies in the county that are responsible for the delivery of these development plans and the provision of expanded public services want to work with the new system to ensure that the plans are delivered in the best possible way, so that the local population can make the best of future expansion for the county.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para8"><a name="stpa_257">The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, North Northants Together&#151;the north Northamptonshire local delivery vehicle&#151;Catalyst Corby, the North Northamptonshire joint planning unit and the local councils are all set to help deliver the growth that the Government require. These councils and other agencies have not been overly precious about their powers and have pooled their efforts in order to be more effective. Indeed, the districts of Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and East Northants, together with Northamptonshire county council, are the first in the country to use the new planning system to create a joint committee for strategic planning, which is supported by a joint planning unit staffed by planning officers from the five authorities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para9"><a name="stpa_258">All the local agencies that I have seen in the county are of the view that, as a Northamptonshire County Council memorandum says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;we in Northamptonshire have a solutions-based approach to problems, are committed to delivery and to sort out problems amongst ourselves. We need continuing support from government to inject the growth policy into mainstream thinking for the main government departments and their agencies.&quot;</p>

There is widespread recognition that up-front investment in jobs, infrastructure and services is essential if we are not to repeat the mistakes of failed development opportunities that Northamptonshire has endured in the past.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para11"><a name="stpa_260">There is also recognition locally that more resources need to be provided to the delivery agencies if progress is to be made. Sir Patrick Walker, chairman of North Northants Together, said that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;we need additional resources if the pace of our efforts is to be maintained. We are urging the ODPM to give greater recognition to the challenges faced by Growth Area authorities.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51012h04_para12"><a name="stpa_261">Given that NNT has not even been granted sufficient funds to maintain a full-time chief executive and is having to borrow a deputy chief executive from Kettering borough council for one and a half days a week to fulfil this role, Sir Patrick&#039;s comments would appear to be spot on. Sir Patrick also highlights that

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;there are still major infrastructure issues to address, such as improvement of the A.14 road around Kettering and provision of a passenger rail service to Corby.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para13"><a name="stpa_262">The message that the Minister needs to hear today is that although Northamptonshire wants to make the best of the housing expansion plans for the county, it is now being hindered in achieving what needs to be achieved by a lack of co-ordination and drive by central Government with regard to development-related funding and initiatives. That is not just my view: it is also, without exception, that of all the major local authorities and agencies that I met during the recess to discuss my preparation for this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para14"><a name="stpa_263">To put it bluntly, unless the Minister and his Department seize proper ownership of this growth-area agenda and bring other Government agencies&#151;primarily the Highways Agency&#151;into line with their own ambitions, these development plans will fail. The Government are saying, &quot;Deliver this growth&quot; at the same time as the Highways Agency is saying not to do so while the local roads are at their current level of congestion. That is clearly a failure of joined-up government of considerable proportions. The agency is looking at solutions 10 years or more hence, but local district councils are statutorily bound now to provide tens of thousands of new houses.

The Highways Agency have issued seven Article 14 Directions in Corby, effectively slowing down the growth and much needed investment there, and there are significant risks that more will follow in Kettering and Corby. This will reduce growth to a trickle.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51012h04_para18"><a name="stpa_267">I have even been provided with evidence that a firm wishing to invest in high-quality jobs in Kettering&#151;and itself located near the A14&#151;is being told by the Highways Agency not to invest in the local area. It wants to locate on an existing industrial estate, and the agency has said that it is minded to issue a direction to prevent the council giving permission on already allocated land.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para19"><a name="stpa_268">The A14 around Kettering is already operating over its design capacity; it is used by upwards of 70,000 vehicles a day. I understand&#151;perhaps the Minister will want to confirm this this afternoon&#151;that the Government are introducing congestion targets later this year. If necessary, that will mean that the Highways Agency will seek to control access on to the A14 at peak times, which will push congestion back on to the local road network. There are particular concerns over junction 7, located to the north-west of Kettering, which is now acting as a constraint on housing growth in Corby, and in due course will do the same for Kettering, when major planning applications come forward. Highways Agency assessments for major planning applications in Corby also appear to assume only background traffic growth outside Corby. That approach is patently wrong given the growth required from elsewhere, including Kettering.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para20"><a name="stpa_269">A memorandum from one of the local planners involved in the development of the area makes it clear that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;unless the Government and the Highways Agency take a different view of the level of congestion that is acceptable on the A14, levels of growth in North Northamptonshire will be constrained below those set out in the Subregional Strategy until the Kettering By-pass is constructed. This is currently planned for 2017&#150;21.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para21"><a name="stpa_270">Indeed, in the final version of the sub-regional strategy published in March, this was the new timetable agreed by the Minister&#039;s Department, taking the expansion of this road back from 2012 to 2016. The Minister and his Department need to undertake as a matter of urgency major strategic reassessment of the ability of the A14 and the roads off it to cope with the housing expansion plans for the area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para22"><a name="stpa_271">It is true that a number of initiatives have been announced by the ODPM to encourage development and regeneration in parts of the county. However, the sums already announced fall well below the eventual hundreds of millions of pounds that my area will require. An increase in the population of 50 per cent. means a need for 50 per cent. more GPs, 50 per cent. more dentists, 50 per cent. more schools, 50 per cent. more hospital beds, 50 per cent. more police and so on. Far from being forward looking, most of the funding formulae for future revenue streams for major Departments look backwards to 2001 census data and not forwards to take into account the step change in local population that Northamptonshire is set to experience.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para23"><a name="stpa_272">The Milton Keynes and South Midlands health and social care sub-group estimates that relative to the local population there are one fifth fewer nurses and one third fewer hospital-based doctors in the Milton Keynes and south midlands area than in the country as a whole. It also anticipates that the sub-region will see a 44 per cent. growth in population but an 80 per cent. growth in the demand for acute care. What is the Minister&#039;s Department&#039;s assessment of the total amount of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
infrastructure investment that will be required for the county up to 2021? I want to see the Government guarantee that that sum will be provided.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para24"><a name="stpa_273">I thank you, Mr. Cook, for the opportunity to debate this subject this afternoon and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>






<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51012h04_spnew1"><b> Frank Cook  </b> (in the Chair): Order. We have only 14 minutes remaining so any further contribution must be as brief as possible to give the Minister adequate time to respond.

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51012h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b>  (Con): I shall be brief. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing the debate, which is of enormous importance to all who live in Northamptonshire, and particularly on his points on the funding formulae. I hope that the Minister will take those points on board. The formulae are retrospective; they should be forward looking. That is the cause of many of the problems.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para25"><a name="stpa_274">Where are the plans for the increase in infrastructure needed for that rapidly expanding county? My constituency does not have enough of an infrastructure to support the people living there at the moment. In Wellingborough, people are unable to register directly with a GP. They have to travel outside the county to get an NHS dentist. Northamptonshire roads are the sixth worst in the country. A secondary school has been closed down and demolished, leaving many children without any education. Our police stations have now become part time. The chief constable states that he is 200 officers short.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para26"><a name="stpa_275">My constituents have to travel a long way to get to the nearest hospital. The waiting times are long; operations are cancelled at the last minute. If someone is lucky enough to get an appointment, they can spend an hour looking for a car parking space at the hospital. We need a community hospital in Wellingborough with minor accident and emergency facilities. We used to have one, but that went as well. With the huge increase in population, which my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering has so eloquently described, it is about time that the Government delivered the proper infrastructure that my constituents and the people of Northamptonshire deserve.

I am conscious that many issues have been raised of substantial importance to their constituents and to the wider area. If I am not able answer each specific point, and the hon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para27"><a name="stpa_276">Before I move on to specifics, let me briefly set out Government policy on housing growth and sustainable communities, which forms the backdrop to the debate. We all know that the demand for housing is rising, especially in London and the south-east. Estimates show that by 2016, at least 1.1 million more households will be added to the current backlog of those without their own home in the wider south-east. In parallel, house building in the UK is not keeping pace with increasing demand. House building in 2001 was at its lowest level since world war two. The scale of housing growth outlined in the sustainable communities plan is essential if we are to tackle the problems of housing demand. We must build these homes. Indeed, figures published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister this week show that only three out of 10 of today&#039;s 10-year-olds will be able to buy their own home unless house building increases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para28"><a name="stpa_277">The Government have a duty to the population to meet the housing needs of the country. It is our policy to do so in a planned and sustainable way, taking proper account of the needs of individuals, the economy and the environment. We do not want growth at any cost; there must be high-quality, high-density development with the transport links and services that communities need. I think that the hon. Member for Kettering probably agrees with that statement of policy, and that it is the method of implementation that he questions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para29"><a name="stpa_278">What Government support is there for growth areas? There is a wide range of funding streams across Government that directly benefit such areas. The sustainable communities plan is a cross-Government agenda, and we are working closely with all Departments. A &#163;1.25 billion ODPM growth areas fund for 2003&#150;08 has been made available to support the four growth areas. The ODPM and the Department for Transport are providing a &#163;200 million community infrastructure fund, and the Department of Health&#039;s growth-area-related funding package brings extra revenue allocations for primary care trusts in the growth areas, as well as an extra &#163;20 million of revenue funding in 2004&#150;06, which is being allocated to the growth areas. Primary care trusts in the growth areas will receive funding increases of &#163;860 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;970 million in 2007&#150;08. There is a strong case for saying that the money is there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para30"><a name="stpa_279">In Northamptonshire, about &#163;60 million has been allocated to infrastructure projects over the past three years. We have invested in transport infrastructure with schemes such as the X4 inter-urban bus network, which links Kettering with Corby, Wellingborough, Northampton and Milton Keynes. We have also invested in the Rushden town centre link road. Our &#163;8 million funding of a county-wide investment promotion agency has already been responsible for the creation of 1,500 jobs. There are other examples.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para31"><a name="stpa_280">We want to continue our investment to support growth in Northamptonshire, and we have invited new schemes throughout the county, worth up to &#163;50 million over the next two years, to bid for the second round of the growth area fund for the period 2006&#150;08. That includes up to &#163;5 million in Kettering for regeneration and urban renewal in the town centre and surrounding towns, up to &#163;9 million for the Corby Parkland Gateway for town centre renewal and new housing, and &#163;750,000 for environmental improvements in two of east Northamptonshire&#039;s market towns.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 133WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para32"><a name="stpa_281">In addition, up to &#163;6 million has been earmarked for the continuation of the Fit for Market/Invest Northants project, which brings high-grade employment opportunities to the county; more than &#163;4.5 million has been provisionally allocated to greenspace projects across the county; and in west Northamptonshire a &#163;25 million block grant has been provisionally allocated to the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation to help with regeneration.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para33"><a name="stpa_282">I will now address some of the specific points raised by the hon. Gentleman. It is worth stating that the growth figure of 145,000 houses is not Government policy. The current regional spatial strategy extends only to 2021 and calls for 99,500 houses in the county. Growth figures past 2021 will be subject to full review as the next regional spatial strategy is prepared. Local authorities had ample opportunities to influence the content of that strategy: they made submissions and were present at the examination in public. Local authorities have always operated within housing targets set by strategic documents. In the past, structure plans set overall housing requirements. In the new planning system, they will be set by RSSs, as the hon. Gentleman knows.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para34"><a name="stpa_283">There is also a great opportunity for the county. Sustainable growth, and the jobs, hospitals, schools and transport links needed to support it, will bring economic prosperity and town centre renewal, along with affordable housing that will benefit both the current and future residents of these communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para35"><a name="stpa_284">The hon. Gentleman rightly expressed concerns about environmental protection. The Government have increased environmental protection as part of the sustainable communities plan. More than 70 per cent. of new homes are now being built on brownfield land compared with 56 per cent. in 1997. New building standards will mean that new homes are 40 per cent. more energy efficient compared with five years ago.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para36"><a name="stpa_285">We will protect the historic villages and the distinctive rural character of north Northamptonshire by ensuring that growth is high density and high quality, and that it maximises the capacity of the existing built-up areas. The sub-regional strategy states that urban extensions, where required, must be sustainable and planned to prevent the physical coalescence of Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough. We are supporting the local authorities in this goal through, for example, the &#163;4.5 million green-space funding allocated for the next two years of growth area funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para37"><a name="stpa_286">The hon. Gentleman said that it was disappointing that the 60 per cent. target for new residential development on brownfield sites had been abandoned. We have not abandoned that target. He was, as he acknowledged, referring to a national target. National planning policy as set out in PPS 3 requires that priority be given to brownfield sites, and that policy approach will apply to development in Northamptonshire, as it will anywhere else.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para38"><a name="stpa_287">On the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about planning, local authorities have always operated to housing targets set by strategic documents. In the past, structure plans set 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 134WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
overall housing requirements. Under the new planning system, those requirements will be set by regional spatial strategies, as I said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para39"><a name="stpa_288">The Government have already allocated a considerable amount of funding to the two delivery vehicles in north Northamptonshire to which the hon. Gentleman referred. North Northants Together received &#163;934,000 during its set-up phase. This year, we have committed &#163;500,000 funding, comprising revenue and capital, to the body, and we will continue with at least that level of funding in the next two years. We are in the process of working out the future level of funding available to this and other local delivery vehicles across the growth areas, and we hope to make an announcement on that in the near future. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para40"><a name="stpa_289">In the short time available to me, I want to put on record my response to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the A14&#151;a road with which anyone will be familiar who has travelled in his part of the world. The Highways Agency&#039;s approach to development and the possible impact on trunk roads is set out in circular 4/2001. The A14 is a core national route that links the midlands with east coast ports. It is also part of the European strategic road network. It is vital that those functions are not compromised by development in his area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para41"><a name="stpa_290">The Highways Agency is already investigating options for widening the Kettering bypass section of the A14. There are also long-term proposals for other sections of the A14 that link with the M1 and the Al. Together, these schemes will provide a long-term solution. Inevitably, however, major improvements such as these will take time to plan, design and build. In the meantime, we will need to consider also the potential of minor improvements and other solutions to help to limit the impact of growth on the functioning of the A14. The joint core strategy that is being prepared by the north Northamptonshire joint planning unit provides a key forum for considering in detail how to deliver growth while managing the impact on the A14. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there are significant constraints on growth in north Northamptonshire that will need the pro-active engagement of the Highways Agency, the Environment Agency and others in order to be resolved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para42"><a name="stpa_291">The hon. Gentleman has made several specific and comprehensive points, on which I congratulate him. The time limit on these debates is such that I cannot answer all his points in detail, but I have information for him on the levels of funding that will justify the Government&#039;s policy, and some points for the future on infrastructure spending that I hope he will consider in response to his speech.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h04_para43"><a name="stpa_292">I undertake again to complete my replies to the many points that the hon. Gentleman has made, in writing, and to treat the debate as part of the dialogue that we are engaged in with him and the agencies in his area. It is important to the Government and to his constituents that we get it right.

<a name="51012h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Fun Parks (Megan Wilcox)</h3>

<a name="time_26">
<a name="51012h05_time0"><h5>4.40 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51012h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Graham Allen  (Nottingham, North)</b>  (Lab): I dedicate this debate on theme park safety to the memory of Megan Wilcox, aged seven, from the Broxtowe estate in my constituency. She died after an accidental fall at the Wonderland pleasure park in Farnsfield and the coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para0"><a name="stpa_293">I have a petition with 6,000 signatures of local people, urging the Government to ensure that adequate medical assistance is provided at theme parks, which I take to include all commercially operated attractions open to the general public where children have access to play equipment. That will include amusement parks and locations similar to the one where Megan&#039;s tragedy occurred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para1"><a name="stpa_294">Megan&#039;s family believe that there were not enough first aiders on hand at Wonderland when she died, near a slide, on 5 September 2003. It is still unclear whether she tripped on a mat at the foot of the slide or fell after colliding with another child. My constituents, Megan&#039;s mother Kerry and stepfather Wayne, believe, as I do, that first aiders should be compulsory at attractions such as fun parks, leisure parks and the like. It came as a surprise to me, and may do to you, Mr. Cook, and to anyone listening to the debate, that that was not already the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para2"><a name="stpa_295">Megan&#039;s parents cannot understand why what is compulsory at football grounds cannot be so at places such as Wonderland, which cater for children. As regulations stand, employers are obliged to provide first aid at work for their employees, but not for those visiting the site. Yet as I understand it, under primary legislation employers are obliged to ensure that those who visit their site or are affected by their work are not at risk. Similarly,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;the common law duty of care would require provision of first aid for the public&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para3"><a name="stpa_296">That is a quotation from paragraph 150 of the health and safety guidance HSG 175. A contradiction is evident in that to lay people, if not to those who understand the nuances of legislation and regulation in this context. There is a contradiction between regulation, primary legislation and common law. To keep our children safe, that confusion must be resolved and clarified. I am glad to give the Minister a chance to do so today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para4"><a name="stpa_297">I know that the Minister has taken an interest in the matter. She answered questions in the House recently, on 18 July, and I have spoken to her on the matter. I have also spoken to the Minister in the Department who is responsible for health and safety, Lord Hunt. I know that the Department takes the issue seriously, and as it has been raised over quite some time I am sure that today we shall hear the results of Government thought and activity on the matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para5"><a name="stpa_298">I do not pretend to understand the ins and outs of the legislation, and there may be several ways of proceeding. I am sure that the Minister will have considered those. One approach is to include the public with employees. The guidance from the Health and Safety Executive on safe practice at fairgrounds and amusement parks&#151;HSG 175, to which I referred&#151;is currently being 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 136WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
reviewed and revised in conjunction with the industry associations, through a working party of the fairgrounds joint advisory committee.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para6"><a name="stpa_299">I hope that the House will bear with me with this quite technical information which is none the less important for youngsters in the relevant parks. The revised document is currently with the HSE, in draft form, and is expected to be published in 2006. Revisions to that document address the continuing efforts of the industry, together with the HSE, to make amusement parks and fairgrounds as safe as possible. I urge the Minister to make it a priority to publish a revised HSG 175 as soon as humanly possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para7"><a name="stpa_300">I am not clear about the status of the guidance, and I would be grateful for more information. First, does it apply to all fairgrounds and attractions, including those outside the associations represented on the joint advisory committee? In other words, it can be monitored by the professional bodies, but whom outside those associations&#151;those who do not join the industry&#039;s organisations&#151;will monitor it? Secondly, is the guidance to be used to determine whether attractions have met their duty of care toward the public?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para8"><a name="stpa_301">I appreciate that only last year the HSE carried out a review of a separate item&#151;the health and safety first aid regulations. That review was wide-ranging; among other things, it considered extending the provision of first aid to members of the public. Following the review, the guidance relating to the regulations remain unamended. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;These regulations do not oblige employers to provide first aid for anyone other than their employees. Indeed, Regulations requiring first aid provision for members of the public cannot be made under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. But many undertakings, for example educational establishments, places of entertainment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fairgrounds provide a service for others, and employers may wish to include them in their assessment of needs and make provision for them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para9"><a name="stpa_302">&quot;May wish&quot; is not strong enough, given the possibility of tragedies such as that which befell Megan.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para10"><a name="stpa_303">The Minister and the Department may wish to reconsider the result of that review. Will the Minister make clear whether the provision of first aid for the public is part of the common law duty of care for a fairground, bearing in mind that the nature of fairground business is to admit the public, especially children, who are a vulnerable group? No change was made to the guidance after last year&#039;s review, but I hope that Megan&#039;s sad death will demand that it is reconsidered and that proper provision for the public at all entertainment parks is introduced.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para11"><a name="stpa_304">Work could be done also to apply the same standards to all attractions. Local authority environmental health officers enforce health and safety law under the general direction of the Health and Safety Commission, not by the granting or revoking of licences. The system for deciding on a suitable first aid provision is by use of risk assessments alone. There is currently no requirement for theme parks to be licensed by the HSE or local authorities. Such legislation, were it to be introduced, could assist in specifying conditions with respect to public safety, including the provision of trained first aiders. I do not know whether the Minister wishes to go down that road&#151;it may not be practicable&#151;but I hope that it will be on the agenda should the Minister feel that she is not getting full co-operation from all the parties involved.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 137WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para12"><a name="stpa_305">The current risk assessment system is meant to identify whether safety of the public and of employees is an issue, and whether it requires suitable action to reduce the level of risk. The system is meant to ensure that the level of first aid cover reflects the size and type of operation, and consequently the number of visitors. Mr. Colin Dawson, the chief executive of the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions told me that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;the level and qualifications of those providing first aid cover at BALPPA members&#039; sites is of course dependent on the size of the attraction, number of visitors etc. Larger BALPPA member attractions such as Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Alton Towers operate significant medical centres way above the level of first aid. In other cases a suitable external agency is on duty, such as St John Ambulance.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para13"><a name="stpa_306">He says that in all cases:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;BALPPA members provide suitable first aid cover, as identified by their Risk Assessments.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para14"><a name="stpa_307">The trade organisation, therefore, takes a very responsible view, which is also the view of most people who operate in the field. I am pleased to say that Mr. Dawson continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;However, we would support any proposal that ensured that all attractions provided suitable cover when open to the public. A four day first aid qualification would be the level we consider as the most appropriate minimum standard.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para15"><a name="stpa_308">I hope that the Minister, or Lord Hunt, will grab that offer from the industry and build upon it, so that our children can play in such places with greater security and greater safety. I understand that BALPPA is due to meet Lord Hunt to discuss the matter further.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para16"><a name="stpa_309">Voluntary level working, while helpful, will always mean that non-BALPPA attractions can slip through the net. The reference that I made earlier encourages such attractions to join a recognised trade association, which can then&#151;hopefully&#151;ensure that they comply with required standards by monitoring their effective enforcement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para17"><a name="stpa_310">I hope that the Minister will bear it in mind that the size of an attraction is not necessarily an indicator of its risk. A large site that is well managed and maintained may well be safer than a smaller one that is not.

<a name="51012h05_para18"><a name="stpa_311">I believe that a further opportunity will arise to make progress on this issue when the HSE meets the industry on 30 November at its annual meeting to discuss health and safety in the fairground industry. Membership of that body includes representatives from all quarters of the industry such as the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions, the Showman&#039;s Guild of Great Britain, the Society of Independent Roundabout Proprietors, the Association of Independent Showmen, the British Amusement Catering Trade Association and the Amusement Catering Equipment Society.

<a name="51012h05_para19"><a name="stpa_312">I trust that the Minister will be able to tell us today that she will ensure that the issues arising from Megan&#039;s death and from this Adjournment debate will be raised at that meeting, including a review of the advice on first-aid provision for members of the public in HSG 175&#151;the fairgrounds and amusement parks guidance. I also take this opportunity to ask the Minister if she will broaden the membership of the fairgrounds and amusement parks joint advisory committee and take action to enforce the recommendation that attractions that are not members of industry associations should join one.

<a name="51012h05_para20"><a name="stpa_313">I shall also make a brief point about fixed sites being treated differently from the temporary sites. I understand that for fixed sites, the current arrangements do not cover the public, whereas they do cover the temporary sites. That may sound rather strange to a layman such as me, but apparently that is the current situation. These issues and their remedies may sound technical, but they are literally the difference between life and death in relation to possible accidents at fun parks and other attractions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para21"><a name="stpa_314">May I make it clear that neither I, nor Megan&#039;s parents, to whom I have spoken in the past few days, are pursuing anyone. We are not trying to name people or attribute blame. On the contrary, our only concern is to improve safety and medical standards so that children in future&#151;I have an eight-year-old daughter&#151;can enjoy leisure attractions with the peace of mind that if an accident were to happen, adequate first aid would be available. That would be a lasting and fitting tribute, which the family would appreciate, to mark the bright, but all too brief, light of Megan&#039;s life.

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51012h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Mrs. Anne McGuire) </b> : Congratulations seems an inappropriate word to use in the circumstances that have provoked the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) has raised the issue and secured the debate in his usual courteous and committed way. By doing so he has raised an important issue and one on which I hope we can move forward together. I should also like to thank him for the opportunity presented today to consider the ways in which safety at fun parks can be improved. Obviously the case of Megan Wilcox is core to that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para22"><a name="stpa_315">As my hon. Friend mentioned, Megan Wilcox was a young child who died on 5 September last year. Before I go into some of what my hon. Friend has identified as fairly technical issues in terms of health and safety, I should like to extend my sympathy to her family and friends for their tragic loss. I am sure that other Members will join me in this. Nothing that we say here today can take away the pain that Megan&#039;s family and friends will feel, but we can look closely at the events and learn from them to build something better for the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para23"><a name="stpa_316">First, by way of background, it may be helpful to review the accident rate in fairgrounds and amusement parks. The Health and Safety Executive&#039;s published statistics from 1996 to 2003 show a welcome downward trend in major accidents to members of the public at fairgrounds and amusement parks. In 1996&#150;97, 432 people were injured. That fell to 100 in 2003&#150;04, and one estimate suggests that the risk of death from a fairground ride is now one in 83 million. While that trend has to be looked on as encouraging, I know that we all expect that everyone involved in the industry will work together to ensure that it continues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para24"><a name="stpa_317">Let me now say something about the legal position. Fun park owners and operators, like any other responsible employer, have to provide healthy and safe working conditions for their employees under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. They also have a responsibility to protect members of the public from their work activities. The provision of welfare facilities for members of the public, such as first aid, is not addressed by the Act, and the Act specifically limits welfare regulations to employees.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para25"><a name="stpa_318">The Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations require employers, including fun park operators, to provide first aid for their employees, but those provisions do not extend to members of the public. However, guidance on good practice that accompanies the regulations encourages employers to make such provision where there are significant dealings with the public. I will come back to this in a moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para26"><a name="stpa_319">Although it will be of little comfort to Megan&#039;s family, the question my hon. Friend raises about extending provision of first aid to the public was thoroughly considered by the HSE over the past few years. In September 2003, the HSE issued a discussion document on the first aid regulations. That was the first full review and evaluation since they were introduced in 1981, although there had been changes to the accompanying approved code of practice and guidance. The HSE was encouraged by the response to the discussion document; more than 500 responses were received.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para27"><a name="stpa_320">The review explored views on the current legislation and what changes could or should be introduced. There was a specific question on whether first aid for the public should continue to be provided by employers within a non-statutory framework or made compulsory through new legislation. I will return to that. The review was informed by prior research that also included the consideration of first aid for members of the public. It found that employers dealing with the public in large numbers, such as entertainment venues, generally make first aid provision for them, not least because of businesses&#039; perception of the positive public viewpoint that this creates in enhancing their reputation. Conversely, where businesses do not make such provision, that was perceived as having a negative impact, especially if the treatment was neither timely nor effective.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para28"><a name="stpa_321">The discussion document sought views on including a statutory obligation on employers to extend the provision of first aid to members of the public. The arguments were finely balanced, but the proposal was rejected by the majority of those who responded to it. The HSE concluded that there was already a good non-statutory response, especially in sectors that deal with large volumes of the public. Arguments that were weighed in the balance included the practicality raised by employers of having to cater for the public at large. First aiders were concerned about possible litigation, and said that they would reconsider volunteering if they were obliged by the law to offer first aid to the public. That is an indication of the litigious society in which we live. On 7 September 2004, the Health and Safety Commission agreed with the HSE&#039;s recommendations. Faced with that body of evidence, I do not believe that new legislation on first-aid provision is the way forward. I appreciate that that may be a disappointment to my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para29"><a name="stpa_322">It is important to note that the HSC has said that it does not necessarily see new regulation as the solution to all problems, particularly where there are other means of achieving the same end. Guidance, especially that developed in partnership with stakeholders, to which my hon. Friend alluded, may on occasion be a more appropriate solution. As he said, on 18 July I said that I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 140WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would ask the HSC to explore whether local authorities could be encouraged to use their licensing powers to make provision of first-aid facilities a condition of licensing of theme parks and funfairs. The HSE has concluded that the scope for first aid provision to be attached as a condition to licences under the Licensing Act 2003 is extremely limited. That is because the Act does not apply to categories of entertainment such as fairgrounds; rather, it applies to certain activities, such as dancing, the sale of alcohol, performances of plays or films, and musical entertainment. In practice, it would make little real difference to the provision of first aid in the vast majority of fun parks in England and Wales.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para30"><a name="stpa_323">The HSE therefore draws attention to the need to consider the provision of first aid to the public where organisations provide a service for others, such as places of entertainment, educational establishments and fairgrounds. That is set out in the guidance to the first aid regulations. The HSE has also issued authoritative guidance on fairgrounds and amusement parks, in collaboration with the fairgrounds industry, and advises on the provision of first aid to members of the public in fairgrounds and theme parks. Trained first aiders for the public can be seen as an important part, for example, of emergency planning arrangements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para31"><a name="stpa_324">In line with the HSC&#039;s strategy for workplace health and safety, the Government would like the industry to take ownership of and deliver solutions to such issues. A sensible approach to safety is to manage risk as far as possible, not to try to eliminate it entirely. As my hon. Friend also mentioned, the industry is best placed to ensure that risks are sensibly managed and that the public are protected from harm. That is the key to stopping accidents happening. The HSE and the Government are committed to doing all that we can to be good partners in achieving those aims. I have already mentioned that the HSE encourages employers, particularly those that have large numbers of the public using their facilities, such as fairgrounds and fun parks, to take account of the public and other visitors when conducting risk assessments and considering first aid provision. However, more can be done to encourage the fairground industry to ensure that current arrangements work as well as possible. The HSE&#039;s guidance is drafted so that it applies to all fairgrounds, not just those that are members of the trade association.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para32"><a name="stpa_325">The way forward lies in promoting the non-statutory adoption of good practice tailored to particular circumstances. The majority of fairgrounds and theme parks already have a high standard of first aid provision, as my hon. Friend said. Indeed, in some cases, those standards are exemplary. But I would also like to challenge the industry to see what more it can reasonably do to raise awareness and spread good practice more widely.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para33"><a name="stpa_326">The HSE has already raised this matter with some of the main stakeholders whose members make up the majority of theme and fun parks in Great Britain. The response, I am delighted to say, has been encouragingly positive. There have been more recent developments, too: my noble Friend Lord Hunt, the Minister responsible for health and safety in the Department, has recently had representations from the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 141WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
discuss health and safety guidance for fairgrounds. I know that Lord Hunt will be raising the issue of first aid for members of the public when the meeting goes ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para34"><a name="stpa_327">I have also asked the HSE to put the matters raised in this debate to the next meeting of the Fairgrounds and Amusement Parks Joint Advisory Committee on 30&nbsp;November. The committee is chaired by the HSE and is attended by all the major trade associations involved in the industry, including BALPPA. It is the main vehicle for agreeing standards of health and safety in the sector. There is also specific guidance that is currently being revised with the industry&#039;s participation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para35"><a name="stpa_328">I would like the HSE to do two things. First, it should consider whether the information about first aid provision to the public that is already in the industry-specific guidance could be revisited in light of Megan&#039;s case. Secondly, it should provide further information to highlight the first aid issues raised by this case on the HSE website, which is the HSE&#039;s principal means of communicating with all stakeholders. The comments of Colin Dawson of BALPPA were interesting in that context.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para36"><a name="stpa_329">Sadly, given the severity of Megan&#039;s injuries, it may well be that there would have been very little that any first aider could have done to save her, however quickly he or she arrived. However, I also recognise that Megan&#039;s parents, understandably, may never be entirely 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>12 Oct 2005 : Column 142WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
confident that that was the case. We have to understand their views. However, we should focus for a moment on the cause of the injuries and their prevention. Megan slipped and tripped over. That is the commonest cause of all injuries in the United Kingdom, both at work and outside work. Clearly, we have to look at how we highlight the issue of tripping. In this context, I welcome the initiative that the HSE is running this month called &quot;Watch your Step&quot; to highlight the issue to employers and the general public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para37"><a name="stpa_330">Finally, we should bear in mind that accident rates at fun parks remain low. That is due in no small part to the professional nature of the industry and the importance that it attaches to rider and visitor safety. We should never cease to learn from the lessons of tragedies such as these. Although we can never entirely remove risk from society, we can strive to ensure that people, especially children, live in a society that values and fully provides for their safety.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012h05_para38"><a name="stpa_331">I once again thank my hon. Friend for raising these issues with me and with Lord Hunt. I hope that, together, we can use the lessons of Megan&#039;s sad death to build a safer environment in which children&#151;and, in fact, all people&#151;can safely enjoy entertainment.
