 We now have a debate on the success of Leeds football club defeating Manchester United, or is it on the economy of Leeds?</p>

 It is no bad thing to mention Leeds and Man United at the present time, and it was in that spirit that I chose to debate the Leeds contribution the UK economy. I welcome my colleagues, and our regional Minister, who serves our region brilliantly. I thank her for her work, and for attending today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para1"><a name="10012062000013">I aim to spell out the huge contribution that Leeds makes not only to Leeds city and the regional economy, but to the UK economy as a whole, as that does not receive enough emphasis. I am known in the House and elsewhere for emphasising the poverty that still mars our city, and the statistics show that, sadly, Leeds is still in the top 10 of the most unequal cities in the country. It is still divided between those with the benefit of income, wealth, prosperity and property, while others-many of them in inner city areas such as my constituency-lose out on good jobs, good housing and quality of life chances for themselves and their families. I am certainly not complacent about the needs of my neighbourhood and of people in Leeds. Every job lost means that we must work hard to obtain another to take people into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para2"><a name="10012062000014">My impetus for today's debate was a former colleague's comment. Boris Johnson is now the Mayor of London, and last October he was reported to have said in a keynote speech in London:</p>

 I am pleased to intervene as a London Member, and I declare an interest, as my daughter is employed partly in Leeds, so the Leeds economy is important to me.

country together economically, metaphysically and through transport links. If we do not have a high-speed link to London, that will jeopardise not only the Leeds economy, but the UK economy. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the spirit in which he made his intervention, particularly as I may have been interpreted as being anti-London, which I am not. However, the contribution of Leeds as a whole must be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para5"><a name="10012062000019">Leeds's great economic strengths lie in its economic diversity and adaptability over the years. The hard work and ingenuity of the people who live and work in Leeds blend past manufacturing and production with enterprise and commerce. That blending is unique, and I shall refer briefly to historical tradition, the story of Leeds, and the current statistics, but I also want to press the case for Leeds to continue as an economic powerhouse. We need a stronger future focus on skills and training for the 21st century and better public transport, as the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling) said-and I am sure that we all agree with his comment-to link us to the rest of Britain. Crucially, we need the high-speed rail link. Without Government intervention in those two vital infrastructure areas, Leeds's continued growth will be held back during the 21st century, as will the UK's prospects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000020">Some of my colleagues are historians and know the story of Leeds. They may want to slip out for a coffee break because they have regularly heard me speak about its history. Leeds has a long tradition of regenerating itself from within since the Romans crossed the ford on the river Aire, and the Venerable Bede mentioned the market town of Leeds and the little hamlet. Henry VIII's chaplain, John Leland, referred to the Leeds market on the bridge. It was a centre for trade and commerce in the region throughout the ages, and the city was built up around that bridge with various industries and trades. The root of Leeds's economy is in my constituency in the great Cistercian abbey of Kirkstall, which was built in the 12th century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000021">The abbey had a huge sheep farm, and a fulling mill, and employed the whole neighbourhood in wool production, from shearing to drying. It developed smelting, forging, tanning, weaving and pottery making. The template was set for a diverse economy, and over 400 years Leeds developed into the textile centre of Britain, linked to the continental cloth markets. It was recognised in places such as Florence, Italy, France, Belgium and Holland as the place for commerce and trade in the textile industry.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="10012062000022"><a name="100120h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="10012062000373"><b>Colin Challen (Morley and Rothwell) (Lab):</b>
 I agree with all that my right hon. Friend says, but does he agree that back in the early days, Rothwell was a more significant commercial centre than Leeds? It is now enveloped by Leeds, but that is also part of history.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="10012062000023"><a name="100120h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="10012062000374"><b>John Battle:</b>
 I am tempted to say that debates on diversity and multiculturalism must stretch as far as places such as Rothwell, Garforth and Pudsey-places that were independent, and some of which were named in the Domesday Book before Leeds. Elmet was certainly there first, and my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon) is here today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para8"><a name="10012062000024">The notion that Leeds can blend a collection of urban villages around itself and could build on those strengths since its organisation into a metropolitan  <br>

district is significant, because it adds range to that diversity of industries. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Leeds moved away from wool textiles, which shifted to Bradford. It then became a centre of engineering excellence with great names, such as John Marshall, Benjamin Gott, John Barran, Matthew Murray and Blenkinsop. The rail industry, and locomotives were also important. The textile industry grew up with new manufacturing, and Armley Mills in west Leeds was the largest factory in the whole world. With that shift to become an engineering centre of excellence, Leeds produced hundreds of engines and trains that are still seen throughout the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para9"><a name="10012062000025">In 1892, Leeds had 900 factories and workshops, and was the workshop of Britain. The names of the great industrialists and engineers are on the walls of the town hall and the civic hall in Leeds. Leeds's great tradition involved not just production, but the trade link of commerce. In the 1890s, <i>Leeds Illustrated</i> said that it was in trade that Leeds began to shine, and that it was a town of a hundred different trades making everything from shoes to machinery, from furniture to Yorkshire Relish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para10"><a name="10012062000026">That diversity involved not just making, but trading. As we moved towards the turn of the 20th century, Leeds became known as the city of 1,000 firms. It had moved on from wool, textiles and engineering to the great diversity of a production economy. It was characterised as one of the most diverse economies in the world. It was not dependent on a single industry, company or mine, but was involved in textiles, clothing, engineering, printing, production of chemicals and toiletries, and financial services. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central referred to financial services. Price Waterhouse was founded in Leeds in 1865, so there was a tradition of financial services even in those early days. In 1911, printing employed more than 8,000 local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000027">On the diverse economic base of a self-made city, small and medium-sized firms grew up locally. Leeds became a regional centre of business, and thrived on the interaction between diverse industries and firms, which enabled Leeds to develop new ideas, to be innovative and to move forward, providing employment not only for the city, but for the whole region. As we moved into the 20th century, Leeds had a strong manufacturing and production base, and a long tradition of commercial activity. It had a thriving economy of its own, but it was the hub of a wider regional economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para12"><a name="10012062000029">By the time I was born in 1951, Leeds was a city of 5,000 firms. Today, it is a city of 29,000 firms, many of which are small and medium-sized, but that illustrates its energy for innovation and regeneration. In the '70s, there was a shift from manufacturing to services in both the public and private sectors. The universities developed-the huge Leeds university and Leeds Metropolitan university-as did hospitals such as St. James's university teaching hospital. Local government developed with that reorganisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para13"><a name="10012062000031">In the mid-20th century, there was a shift from manufacturing to retail and the great stores. Indeed, the whole notion of town centres, high streets and shopping was not too far removed from Leeds. The first great general store in the UK was Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society in 1893. Marks and Spencer grew from the  <br>

business of Michael Marks who, as everybody knows, had a penny bazaar in the market. Clothing was produced by Burton and Hepworth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para14"><a name="10012062000032">When I served as a councillor in the '80s, I worked on the economy of Leeds and on economic and employment development, and I remember a very significant figure. Between 1977 and 1987, 17,500 jobs were lost in manufacturing, particularly in the traditional engineering sector. At the same time, 17,500 new jobs were created in the service sector for both public and private professional services. Banking, accountancy firms and lawyers moved into the city at that time, but there was a shift from the inventive skills of 19th-century engineers to the flair of retail and business services. Creeping through at the end of the 20th century, we find the new science, technology and creative industries of the digital age based in Leeds, as the city transforms itself, quietly, as if within a chrysalis, to move into the 21st century. Today's city of 29,000 firms is still a diverse, permanently changing economic base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para15"><a name="10012062000033">Such diversity enabled Leeds to avoid the worst of the depression of the '30s. There was economic intervention to help people in Leeds. The unemployed were asked to build the civic hall as a job project, and to invest in public buildings. Because of its diversity, Leeds survived the worst of that depression. That was also true in the '80s through the local council's intervention and focus on job generation. I will return to that issue shortly. Diversity has helped Leeds to survive, but it does not happen by accident. The city needs support, encouragement, fostering and investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para16"><a name="10012062000034">In 1893, the Leeds chamber of commerce in its annual report recognised the</p>
<a name="100120h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="10012062000335"><ul><p class="tabletext">"good fortune of Leeds in having an economy based on a diversity of manufacturing and commercial activity.".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para17"><a name="10012062000035">Its editorial suggested that by keeping the two activities together, Leeds would thrive. That is the city's real strength.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para18"><a name="10012062000036">Today, Leeds is a city of over 775,000 people, and it is the fastest growing city in the country. It is not an ageing city; young people are moving into Leeds, and it is increasingly seen as a young city. The average age in Leeds is dropping, which is good news, because the ideas will remain. Leeds is halfway between London and Edinburgh, and is situated between Hull and Liverpool. If someone puts a dot on the map and says that they want to relocate Parliament because the River Thames is starting to flood, they could not find a better centre of Britain in which to do that than Leeds, but I shall not go down that route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para19"><a name="10012062000037">At present, Leeds employs 445,000 people in local manufacturing, commercial and public services. Every day, 100,000 people from the wider region of Bradford, Wakefield, Dewsbury, Halifax, Harrogate and York come into to Leeds, and every evening, 100,000 people leave. Their work is in Leeds, which acts as a giant economic lung, breathing in the work of the people from roundabout. It is still the third largest manufacturing centre in the UK, the UK's largest provincial printing sector and the second largest financial sector. It has 90 private legal practices and 12 head offices. Five FTSE 350 companies are based in Leeds, including companies such as Northern Foods and Asda. Yesterday, Asda sent me an unsolicited note to say that its contribution to the UK economy is £13 billion per year-0.9 per  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

cent. of gross domestic product. Of course, Asda's great operations are not only in Leeds, but it shows that some of the top companies are now based there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para20"><a name="10012062000038">Leeds employs 105,000 people in high-value, knowledge-based intensive industries of the future, which is good news. It also employs 29,000 people in the digital and media industry, which means that Leeds has that strength for the new computer age of the internet and new communications, and it is well positioned for the 21st century. Contributions to the UK economy are now measured in gross value added, rather than the old GDP. Latest estimates put the GVA figures for Leeds at £17 million, but once we add in the goods and services that the Leeds economy pulls in from the wider region, it is estimated that Leeds contributes over 1.5 per cent. of the country's GVA. It makes a larger impact economically than just that made by the local people. Bringing people into the city brings dynamism to the economy, not only for the region but for the country as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para21"><a name="10012062000039">Per head of population, GVA was £22,387 in 2007, which is 112 per cent. of the UK average, and 134 per cent. of the regional average. Leeds was the only area in Britain where GVA per head was higher than the national average. In other words, Leeds really does punch above its weight. The economic impact of the city means that its economic footprint-that is the phrase-goes far beyond the administrative boundary of the Leeds district and includes Rothwell, Pudsey, Garforth and other areas of the city. That has been recognised recently by Government in the City Region project, which works on things such as the Aire valley project, and which will generate another 27,000 jobs over the next 10 to 15 years. That has been recognised by the Government and the Yorkshire development agency, but I wonder whether the economic impact is being fully backed up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para22"><a name="10012062000040">I want to stress that Leeds is in a strong position and is expected to generate 34 per cent. of the region's future employment within the next decade. That was spelled out this week in a report published by Centre for Cities, which undertook research analysis of the economic performance of 64 English towns and cities and the outlook for 2010. The report stated that in 2008, 62 per cent. of jobs in England were in cities and 39 per cent. of those were in just five cities-London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and Leeds. Of England's high-skilled workers, 62 per cent. are in those cities, which is a 40 per cent. concentration in top cities such as Leeds. In other words, the report recognised Leeds as one of the country's top economic powerhouses, well placed to thrive as the UK emerges from the recession. It will be one of the big hitters that will make a difference to whether there is a strong sustainable recovery, or whether we have a so-called double-dip recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000041">I would like to quote from this week's <i>Yorkshire Post</i><i>, </i>which mentioned the Centre for Cities report that underlined the role of Leeds as an economic driver. The chief economist of Yorkshire Forward, Patrick Bowes, stated:</p>
<a name="100120h0001.htm_brev3"><a name="10012062000336"><ul><p class="tabletext">"We welcome the news that Leeds is among those cities expected to drive the UK's economy out of the recession as we believe that Leeds is central to helping the region move quickly out of recession."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para24"><a name="10012062000042">I could not agree more, but I would say that Leeds is central to the UK as a whole. Interestingly, the Centre for Cities report focused on two points-the need to boost local skills and the need to improve local public  <br>

transport links. Those are the two key areas that now need underpinning in the Leeds economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para25"><a name="10012062000043">I will briefly touch on skills and training. As I have mentioned, Leeds has a tradition of practical intervention-what we would now call "fiscal stimulus"-to make sure that it does not sink during a recession. I mentioned the building of the civic hall; during the '80s-in the face of the recession, cuts under Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Government, and radical reductions year on year in public investment in the local authority-we had a visionary leader, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie), who cannot be with us this morning. He understood that we needed to produce programmes for skills training to ensure that people were not left behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para26"><a name="10012062000044">My hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) is present; he worked with the next leader of the council, my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett), who built up the partnership to see whether the public and private sectors in Leeds could work together. That was innovative work at the time. There was intervention to develop skills, and to build public-private partnerships, to ensure that the diverse economy of Leeds survived.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="10012062000045"><a name="100120h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="10012062000375"><b>Mr. Pelling:</b>
 I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Does not what he is saying about the impact of the rate of cuts in public spending show that it is important that if public spending is cut, it is cut only at a reasonable rate? What damage would be done to the Leeds economy if there was too precipitate a cut in public expenditure in that important area?</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="10012062000046"><a name="100120h0001.htm_spnew7"><a name="10012062000376"><b>John Battle:</b>
 I am grateful but rather shocked to hear the hon. Gentleman's intervention. I warmly welcome it because he is right, but I prefer to consider the issue not in terms of the rate of cuts, but in terms of the areas that we ensure that we support, and I am suggesting support for skills training and transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para27"><a name="10012062000047">When my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East, was leader of the council, he pressed for exactly the kind of fiscal stimulus that the Government are now applying nationally. We were doing it then. That was what my hon. Friend the Member for Selby backed, and I dare say that my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) did so, too; he was a member of Leeds city council at the time. They understood the need for that kind of fiscal stimulus. It was not a case of letting the economy sink and seeing what happened. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central, might talk to people from his own party much more about the strategy, because we had it working in Leeds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="100120h0001.htm_para28"><a name="10012062000048">I heard comments on the radio the other day about education. My hon. Friend the Member for Elmet was one of the top educationalists in Leeds when he was a teacher there. I still meet people whom he taught when he worked in some of the toughest schools in Leeds. The suggestion was that education and training was the way forward. There is now discussion about that. We are not there yet. We have had some investment in primary schools and a little more in secondary schools, but we need to consider the training of older workers; we need to consider the post-16 generation.</p>

was no Government action in the 1980s; we on the local authorities acted on our own. Recently, 79 small businesses in Leeds got help worth £8.6 billion from the enterprise finance guarantee scheme. Seven of those are in west Leeds. Twelve businesses received investment of more than £17 million from the capital for enterprise fund equity scheme. With the pressure on Yorkshire Television, Screen Yorkshire and Studio 81 have helped to get the film industry going again. That is the kind of stimulating investment that I want to see. If I may make a jaded remark to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, it is that investment that we need, not Tory tax cuts just for those families bequeathed more than £2 million; those cuts will be worth nearly £500,000 to them. My priorities are about investing in the skills of the future.</p>

I plead with the Minister to consider the need for local skills centres, because in my neighbourhood, through subcontracting, the skills centre has been moved to another district of Leeds, and is now not accessible by my constituents in the same way. That means that we cannot develop the links with local employers that we need to ensure local skills training, so some pockets end up without the training that they need. Can we look again at local skills training, advanced apprenticeships and, indeed, the whole lot to ensure that people are not left behind, as the Centre for Cities report suggests we should?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="100120h0002.htm_para2"><a name="10012062000051">The report acknowledges that Leeds has a strong infrastructure. The infrastructure has been provided-primary schools, secondary schools, universities and hospitals. We have digital and fibre-optic networks. We have quality business, office and enterprise space. However, the area needs skills training to move us into the bio and nanotechnologies, the green technologies, the new jobs of the future in industrial biology, health care technologies and environmental technologies, as we now shift again from consumers to producers. We need to meet the new demands for products and services in response to not only technological innovation in the digital age, but changing social and living patterns in a fast-growing young city. We need to shift the skills training up a gear or two.</p>

I do not have time to go into internal public transport links, but if 100,000 people are coming into the city and 100,000 are going out, we need good public transport, and we are not there yet by a long mile. We need to do much more to ensure that Leeds has a proper system for bringing people in and out of the city. I tell the Minister that we need the link to London, as the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, said. Before a decision is made on high-speed trains, we need to be sure that there is a phased introduction of a network for the UK that does not jeopardise the east coast line. If we decide on the west coast, Leeds will be left out on a limb, so we need to ensure that there is a high-speed link between Leeds and London in the 21st century.</p>

my right hon. Friend agree that there is a fear in Leeds and the wider city region, of which Selby is a proud part, that if a high-speed rail link were announced predominantly for the western side of the country, Leeds and the Leeds city region could lose out? Is it not unacceptable to produce a plan that does not clearly state that the east coast will have a high-speed rail link and, ideally, that there will be a high-speed link across the Pennines? If it is a case of putting Crossrail on hold and saving £5 billion, that would be well worth doing if it meant that Leeds got its high-speed rail link.</p>

 Amazingly, the same suggestion that we keep those connections to Leeds going was made in 1968 to the Secretary of State at the time. It took the Government until 1972 to accept the report, and then there was still no action. I agree with my hon. Friend. May I say to the hon. Member for Croydon, Central, that if there is pressure on budgets, Leeds should come before the Crossrail project? It should take top priority; otherwise Leeds is cut off. That is why, if choices are to be made, I am in favour of the Leeds high-speed link. Crossrail would have to wait, because Leeds is more important.</p>

 As the right hon. Gentleman must recognise, it is important that Crossrail has a role.

 We could go down that road, but I am putting down a marker to say that Leeds has sometimes been left out because it has not been seen as being as important as London and the south-east. It is time to invert that ratio. That is what I am suggesting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="100120h0002.htm_para4"><a name="10012062000057">I thank the Minister for answering a wide range of written questions that I have tabled in the past few weeks on the Leeds economy. The subjects of those questions ranged from the effects of the recession on financial services in the city to an analysis of where everybody works in the city and the region, in terms of each of the standard industrial classifications. Those questions and answers have been helpfully set out in the Library debate pack. I am grateful to the Minister for her response, because it gives us a picture of where Leeds is up to now.</p>

Its role in the UK economy is acknowledged by Yorkshire Forward, which is doing a brilliant job. I want it to go forward, not, as I think Opposition parties have suggested, be shut down.</p>

 Most hon. Members would concur with that view; I certainly do. We need Yorkshire Forward. Like all organisations, it has to improve. It has to be more accountable and challenging.

becoming two cities, with thousands of people left out of the so-called economic miracle that we keep hearing about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="100120h0002.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000067">Obviously, some of the changes that have taken place have been good. As a teenager, I would never have dreamed of going into the city centre, which was quite a rough place. If people go there now, the only danger they face is being bumped into by groups of mainly young women who are having a nice drink and a nice time. So the city centre has changed for the better. However, the collapse of the manufacturing industry in Leeds has had an impact. I taught in east Leeds in the mid-70s and that was when the decline really started. The city's manufacturing base in engineering, textiles and clothing began to collapse and its place was taken, for the youth of Leeds, by what I can only describe as pathetic youth training schemes, which have left their mark on the whole notion of training in my city.</p>

I compliment the regional development agency on its work and I compliment the Minister, who has been a proud champion for our region. The figures-they are just rough figures-show that the city has about 100,000 jobs in the financial sector, 40,000 in manufacturing, 20,000 in construction, 80,000 in catering, distribution and related trades, and 130,000 in public services. Of those jobs in public services, 33,000 are in Leeds city council and about 14,000 are in the NHS, and I will draw a political lesson from that when I conclude my remarks. I do not want to go on too long, however, because other hon. Members want to speak.</p>

The paradox, however, is that we also have 12,000 younger people who are labelled as NEET-not in education, employment or training-and that is 2.8 per cent. above the national average. Why are 12,000 of our young people in that category when about 400,000 jobs are generated in the city? There has been a failure to focus properly on the youth of Leeds, to give them proper training and to create the economic conditions in which they can find work, and we must address that. By April 2010, the local authority will have got funding from the Learning and Skills Council to address the problem, and I assure Leeds city council that many of us will be closely monitoring the effectiveness of its work. We need to know now what plans are being put in place to get our 17 and 18-year-olds into employment.</p>

I very much doubt whether a kid in Gipton today would become, or think about becoming, a Member of the House of Commons. There has been a tightening of social mobility as significant sections of our city have been left off the map of economic development, and I refer particularly to my old stamping ground of east Leeds. That really concerns me because social mobility has virtually come to a stop in places such as east Leeds, where people used to move up the social ladder and out into places such as Garforth in my constituency. That has real implications for the cohesion of the city. Unless we address the poverty in our city, all the fanfare and all the statistics  <br>

 I would not like to give the impression that the skills in Leeds were all lightweight. One thing that made a difference in the '80s was the skills centres-the east Leeds skills workshop, the Harehills tech project, the Tech North project and the Seacroft skills project. The problem is that they have been allowed to decline. Although they did not tackle the whole problem, there was a focus on skills and training, and we need to refocus on that. These were not just lightweight jobs; some real jobs came out of those skills centres. That was a council programme and it should be replicated. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

That illustrates the fact that this is almost the tale of two cities. I do not want to be too negative, because we should point the way forward. However, my intuition says that the financial sector, despite the image that it has given of itself, will not address the needs of 10,000 young people or of others who are in semi-unemployment or poor employment conditions. Only a strategy of returning an expanded manufacturing base to our city will address their needs. </p>

indeed make a start on more democracy by having the largest party on the council taking control of it. That would be a good step away from its present problematic leadership.

Leeds as a whole now emits about 6 million tonnes of carbon a year, and the motion calls for a 10 per cent. annual cut in that. That would be an enormous stimulus to the economy of Leeds.

Even if, as we have heard, our manufacturing sector has diminished over the years, it still employs about 40,000 people-10 per cent. of the work force. Many of those people are in engineering. We have already heard about the hoped-for boom in offshore wind in the North sea, off the Humber, and I am sure there will be other marine technologies. That is where the RDA can step in and make a big difference. We need those turbines to be manufactured in the UK, but so far all the press coverage of that great bonanza suggests that many of the jobs will go to Germany and Denmark.</p>

 I agree. We tend to think of climate change in terms of renewable energy, but there are many other potential solutions and other things that can improve our energy efficiency. The university of Leeds is one of the country's leading research and development universities, and earns £113 million a year in research grants. Sadly, however, because of the cuts agenda that we seem to be facing, it could lose, even on the existing estimate of proposed cuts, up to 8 per cent. of its work force-nearly 700 jobs. That will be a big blow to the university's prestige and its ability to deliver economic drivers. The university has a marvellous record of setting up new entrepreneurial, inventive businesses that are right up to speed with the new technologies. I hope we can look again at the range of proposed cuts and say that we do not need them. What we need is investment, because it will produce longer-term growth and higher tax revenues. That, and not cutting the public sector, is the way to get out of recession.</p>

accepts the green agenda, and tried hard to ensure that Yorkshire would benefit from the carbon capture and storage competition. I think that work will continue and there will be work on CCS in Yorkshire. The whole point about Leeds as a city region, and the green economy, is that the Aire valley, which is also known as "power alley", stretching into Selby, produces about 25 per cent. of the UK's electricity generation: the green economy is an enormous opportunity and an enormous threat to the area. If we are to lose technologies because of European directives on emissions, and because manufacturing jobs go to Germany and Denmark, we could lose jobs in the old fossil fuel economy and not get the new jobs in the green economy. I urge the Minister to take that seriously. It is a big opportunity and I hope that we can review RDA strategies to ensure that they fully deliver for the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para5"><a name="10012062000093">Unemployment in my constituency of Morley and Rothwell is still less than in 1997. By and large, it is a bit different in other constituencies. It may be similar to the rate in Pudsey. Across the city, however, unemployment has fallen dramatically since 1997. I was looking at the figures yesterday and I see that in some constituencies unemployment has dropped by many thousands. In my constituency, the reduction since 1997 is only about 4.7 per cent. One way to reverse that is by going for green-collar jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000094">I shall mention three local companies. Ravenheat, a long-established company that makes central heating equipment and so on, is looking at making efficiencies. Integrated Technological Systems Ltd installs things such as solar photovoltaic roof tiles across Europe, and not only in the locality. InfraNOMIC Energy Solutions, another innovative company, is developing low-cost energy-efficient radiators that can be used in all-electric homes. That covers a significant segment of the housing market for the fuel-poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000095">Those are small local companies; the largest employs only 20 or 30 people. However, they are the building blocks for the new economy. The green economy is reckoned to be worth £106 billion in the United Kingdom, and about £3 trillion in the world. That is where we should be headed. We would like to see more incentives for new technologies and new sources of employment.</p>

It is that 43,000 people in Leeds are employed in manufacturing. It sounds like a large number; indeed it is.

pottery; a whole raft of manufacturing trades-it is an indictment of the untrammelled market forces and neo-liberal economics that have gripped the UK, sometimes by the throat, over the past 30 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para10"><a name="10012062000099">I may be genetically programmed to support manufacturing and to recoil at such statistics. In one way or another, the whole of my family have been employed in manufacturing. My father worked in a dirty little foundry as a moulder and core-maker. When I visited it as a child, the place seemed like something from Dante's "Inferno". I do not look back on that through rose-tinted spectacles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000100">We hardly need rehearse at length how global recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s, compounded by Tory slash-and-burn policies, dramatically undermined our manufacturing base. One of the worst problems was the self-induced disaster of the early 1980s, inspired by the tragic and dogmatic monetarist experiment when Margaret Thatcher was seduced by the siren calls of von Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is often said, I think rightly, that between them they did more damage to the British manufacturing base than the Luftwaffe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para12"><a name="10012062000101">It was not only bloated and inefficient industries and companies that were destroyed by that failed monetarist experiment. Many fell victim to the triple pincer of high exchange rates, which made exports prohibitively expensive, high interest rates that made investment extremely difficult, and cuts in public spending that effectively destroyed demand in the economy. The Tories removed not only the fat, but the vital organs-and even the soul-of manufacturing industries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para13"><a name="10012062000102">To my mind, it was refreshing that the Labour party in Government was able until recently to point out the callous economic crime that had been perpetrated against our communities. From the lessons learned, the party was able to justify the reflationary package rightly embraced by the Government. As a result, many of us, including my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet, got the wind in our sails and were able to go out and sell it to our electors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para14"><a name="10012062000103">Why should we now be changing tack? Is it because the vacuum left by the reduction of our manufacturing industry has, as we have been told, been filled by the financial services sector, which has its own set of rules and imperatives to which we now feel obliged to genuflect? I hope that that is not the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para15"><a name="10012062000104">I do not decry other sectors, but I wish to concentrate on manufacturing for a moment. My hon. Friends the Members for Elmet and for Morley and Rothwell cannot be caricatured as languishing in the past by harking back. My constituency still shows the vital relevance of manufacturing. I shall mention a handful of companies. Each, in its own way, is a UK, if not world, leader. There are others, but time prevents me from mentioning more.</p>

manufactures specialist fabrics, including flame-resistant fabric for firefighters' uniforms and baize for billiard tables; it weaves the cloth for the Woolsack-part of the furnishings in the other place; and its uniforms graced the field at Waterloo. Its most recent innovation is the wool coffin. Some have made the pun about "resting in fleece". The wool coffin has been embraced by the funeral industry, not only in the UK but across the world.</p>

It may not be the cheapest, but because of its durability, it provides value-for-money kit-something that the Government ought to take into account in their procurement policy.

However, it is not sufficient to pat them on the head and congratulate them on their resilience and innovation. My right hon. Friend was right to point out that they need the Government and their agencies not only to ride to their assistance in difficult times but to identify their value and to provide them with the support and expertise that they need to continue to prosper in difficult circumstances and beyond. For example, we should ensure that they can benefit from events such as the 2012 Olympics.</p>

Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell rightly said, we need to assist those industries to expand in order to meet the green agenda. Several of those companies have started to meet that agenda and have the capacity to do even more. However, we need to remove some of the bureaucratic obstacles that they have to surmount. For example, Leeds and Bradford Boiler Company is the exclusive manufacturing partner for a new process called resomation, a more environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. That is my second mention of death and burial. Perhaps I have an obsession with them. It was Benjamin Franklin who said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="100120h0003.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000112">I am aware of the time, so I will conclude by saying that I hope that my right hon.

he is proud-as we all are-both of the city and its achievements. The development of Leeds' economy has been a real success story over the past 15 years. It has become a leading financial centre as well as a real driving force in the communications, marketing and advertising industry. Moreover, the online economy is now hugely important to Leeds. Despite the real and serious concerns that have been outlined by some hon. Members, we still have a strong manufacturing industry; it is the third largest in the country.

I will be at Elland road to watch Leeds Rhinos hopefully win back the world cup challenge against Melbourne Storm on 28 January, so we could have world champions in the city again. I am sure that every single citizen of Leeds thoroughly enjoyed the battle of the Uniteds recently, which saw Leeds overturn their slightly more famous neighbours.

We will have some disagreements and differences, but that is democracy. None the less, despite the comments of the hon.

I tabled an early-day motion, which I hope she has noticed, that said well done for allowing the project to go ahead. It is worth mentioning that Yorkshire Forward showed great leadership as a regional development agency, that Leeds city council consistently pushed the case for the development, and that the city's newspaper the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post </i>led an excellent campaign entitled "Leeds needs an Arena".</p>

Member for Leeds, West. May I nudge the Minister to speak to her colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government about the use class order consultation on houses in multiple occupation, because that was supposed to have reported already? Again, many of us-including councillors, the business community, the local community and residents associations-see that as very important, because it gives local councils the power to influence the balance in communities, which is what all of us want.</p>

I must return to the issue of transport. Every time I speak to people from the business community, both inside and outside Leeds, they say, "Leeds is wonderful. It's a great place and I want to be based there." The problem is, however, that public transport is inadequate. We still have an unacceptable transport gap. We did not get our supertram in 2005, which we should have done. Will the Minister ensure that we get the funding for New Generation Transport, because things have gone ominously quiet? We want to hear that we will get the funding and can go ahead with the scheme. We also need better funding for Leeds Bradford airport, which is in my constituency. We need to expand that because we cannot get a train anywhere near the airport.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon.

The west midlands has a proud industrial heritage and it has a lot in common with Leeds. Leeds is rightly proud of its diversity and industrial heritage.</p>

I am sorry to hear about the postponement of the £65 million science park, which was to include bio-incubators and a creativity centre, because I believe that high added value is the way forward.

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para5"><a name="10012062000133">What I saw was a city centre that had been absolutely transformed by Conservative policies under Michael Heseltine and the urban regeneration corporations, like the centres of Glasgow and Liverpool, Manchester Hulme and the London docklands. I could go on. The combination of Leeds city council, the private sector and the urban regeneration corporation transformed the city centre. The hon. Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon) said that the city centre was smoke-filled before it was transformed by Conservatives in the 1980s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000134">However, let us move on, in the spirit of unanimity. What we have got out of this debate-the next Government, whoever they are, should pay attention to this-is that, if Leeds is to thrive as one of our major metropolitan centres and go from strength to strength in the future, two things are urgently needed: improved transport infrastructure, and improved skills to meet an ever-changing and more sophisticated world and export this country's goods to the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000135">As many hon. Members have said, Leeds is the second largest metropolitan district in England. It is the UK's third largest manufacturing centre, with 1,800 companies employing almost 40,000 people. What I did not know until I researched this debate is that Leeds is the largest hub for financial services outside London. It would do well to publicise that fact. When I challenged somebody in the financial industry who should have known better, they thought that Edinburgh was the second largest. Perhaps Leeds has some work to do on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para8"><a name="10012062000136">As has been said, Leeds has a thriving media, communications, advertising and online sector, which is growing at about 10 per cent. a year. The right hon. Member for Leeds, West quoted the Centre for Cities, which has highlighted how challenging recovering from this Government's recession will be for cities across the UK-</p>

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="10012062000137"><a name="100120h0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012062000399"><b>Colin Burgon:</b>
 Will the hon. Gentleman give way on that point?</p>

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="10012062000138"><a name="100120h0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="10012062000400"><b>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</b>
 No. I am not going to give way to anybody, because I have only five minutes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para9"><a name="10012062000139">The Centre for Cities report states that there is a clear disparity between the cities that will find recovery easier and the others, based on a multitude of factors. The report highlights that our major cities will play a vital role in helping us to recover from the recession. I would have thought that new Labour Members would agree. The report says:</p>
<a name="100120h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="10012062000341"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Major cities in particular have the potential to reinforce their position, and generate jobs and growth as the global economy recovers."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para10"><a name="10012062000140">That is what we all want. Leeds is clearly a major city, as the report states. It notes that Leeds, Birmingham, London, Liverpool and Manchester have 36 per cent. of the entire population of the UK but 39 per cent. of the jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000141">If we accept the importance of Leeds to the UK economy, it is vital to establish first how badly the  <br>

recession has hit Leeds and, secondly, how Leeds can respond in future. The right hon. Member for Leeds, West has assiduously asked a raft of parliamentary questions, but I must highlight one answer in particular, from the Economic Secretary to the Treasury:</p>
<a name="100120h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="10012062000342"><ul><p class="tabletext">"The Government recognise that the global economic downturn has affected all regions within the UK."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para12"><a name="10012062000142">Well, that is earth-shattering; we knew that already. She went on to say:</p>
<a name="100120h0004.htm_brev2"><a name="10012062000343"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Yorkshire Forward, as the regional development agency in the region, has taken forward a number of initiatives to provide assistance to families and businesses in these difficult times."-[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 October 2009; Vol. 127, c. 1411W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para13"><a name="10012062000143">Even Sir Humphrey would be proud of that answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para14"><a name="10012062000144">I am glad to say that the Minister who is here today has provided the right hon. Member for Leeds, West with many answers more constructive than that one. However, in one of her answers, on recognising Leeds's importance to the economy and the strength of its financial sector, she seems proud to note that the effects of the recession in terms of loss to the sector</p>
<a name="100120h0004.htm_brev3"><a name="10012062000344"><ul><p class="tabletext">"could be around £820 million".-[<i>Official Report</i>, 12 January 2010; Vol. 22, c. 944W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para15"><a name="10012062000145">Her pride seems to stem from the fact that the figure is approximately half that estimated in a Deloitte study in 2009. I am not sure whether that will provide comfort for the estimated 1,200 to 1,400 people in Leeds who have lost their jobs. As I suggested earlier, although the financial sector is important to Leeds, it is not the only important sector. The city has one of the most-if not the most-diverse economies in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para16"><a name="10012062000146">The number of liquidations at the moment is worrying. There were 26,978 voluntary corporate liquidations between the second quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009. The Minister should consider carefully that 241,000 businesses in the UK are on the Government's tax deferred scheme. At some point, that tax must be repaid and that will put more businesses in jeopardy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para17"><a name="10012062000147">My time is almost up, so I turn to the importance of Leeds to the future. The Centre for Cities report that I quoted makes it clear that Leeds has a clear role in the UK's future. Last March, a Leeds city council policy briefing note showed that during the last decade, manufacturing employment declined by 20 per cent. The socialist Members present are rewriting history. As one of the socialist Members said, manufacturing actually started to decline under the Labour Administration of the 1970s. There has also been a big decline in manufacturing over the last 12 years under this socialist Government. An incoming Conservative Government will be internationalist in their outlook; they will provide the infrastructure that Leeds needs; they will provide the skills that this Government have failed to provide; and they will give the people of Leeds a better future than this old-fashioned, tired Labour Government have managed to provide.</p>

of the pledges of Keir Hardie, the founding member of the Labour party? We have delivered the national minimum wage, devolution rights, House of Lords reform and rights for trade unions. The only one of his pledges we have not managed to fulfil is banning alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="st_35"><a name="10012062000150"><a name="100120h0004.htm_spnew4"><a name="10012062000403"><b>Ms Winterton:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes an important point that highlights the interventionist approach of this Government, who have come into their own during the recent difficult economic times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para18"><a name="10012062000151">I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West, and other hon. Friends that Leeds makes a huge contribution to the UK economy. Through the regional strategies and the establishment of regional development agencies, the Government have set out the fact that we need a balanced economy that harnesses the industrial potential and competitiveness of every region. The country's economy cannot rely on London and the south-east. There must be a balanced economy and we must have a proper regional strategy to deliver that. That is why we set up regional development agencies. We recognised the need for Governments to intervene at regional level to target investment, strengthen enterprise and support job creation. That approach has worked. An independent study showed that for every pound invested by Yorkshire Forward, there was a return of £4.50.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para19"><a name="10012062000152">That approach is one reason why the Leeds area has been able to diversify in the way that my hon. Friends have described. In many senses, traditional industries have given way to knowledge-led enterprises that are based on innovation, entrepreneurship and international competitiveness. Between 1998 and 2008, Leeds accounted for 51,800 of the 185,000 net jobs created in Yorkshire and the Humber. As my hon. Friends have said, it is now the largest centre outside London, not just for the financial sector, but for a number of sectors, including printing and construction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para20"><a name="10012062000153">Of course, the global recession had a huge effect on Yorkshire. The Government approach, which was rejected by the Opposition, has been to intervene during this period and to continue investing in the public sector. Many hon. Friends have described our investment in health and education. We have increased the number of people who work in the public sector. During the downturn, we have given specific help. Yorkshire Forward has carried out about 11,500 financial health checks for businesses. It has invested in the manufacturing advisory service and in local enterprise growth initiative funding to help manufacturing, which many hon. Friends mentioned, as well as other companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para21"><a name="10012062000154">Looking to the future, we must consider what can be done in new technologies, which were mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen), and for Elmet (Colin Burgon). Under the growth strategy that has been published, we are considering what we can do to assist each region in promoting new technologies, such as low-carbon and green technologies. We must do that in Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para22"><a name="10012062000155">Hon. Friends have mentioned carbon capture and wind farms. There are huge opportunities in our region to exploit such technologies. We have the €180 million investment for carbon capture. I visited the ATB Morley factory in Pudsey that my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) mentioned. It makes manufacturing  <br>

equipment for mining. If we harness carbon-capture and green technologies, we can increase our manufacturing base. That could also address the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet of how we can cater for lower, as well as higher, skills in developing such technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000156">There is the future jobs fund and the January guarantee for those not in education, employment or training. Those initiatives are about intervention not only at national level, but at regional and local levels. Many future jobs fund jobs come from local councils. Such intervention was aptly described by my hon. Friends, many of whom have been involved in council work. They know the importance of councils being on people's side, and of having support regionally and nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para24"><a name="10012062000157">The hon. Members for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland), and for Solihull (Lorely Burt), and many of my hon. Friends, mentioned the importance of transport links. I have had a number of meetings with the Secretary of State for Transport and others to impress on them the importance of high-speed rail links to our region. My Labour colleagues have been pressing for those links. There has been more investment in commuter links. I am sure we all want more, but we should not underestimate the additional investment that there has been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para25"><a name="10012062000158">Many hon. Friends mentioned the relationship between universities and industry. Lord Mandelson called recently for RDAs and universities to work together to show how industry can be supported through a joint approach. Our region is lucky to have universities that work closely together, and that understand the importance of working with industry to consider how they can establish the knowledge economy and ensure that they are providing the skills and knowledge that industry needs to thrive. I am talking about a strategic approach. We should not abolish RDAs, as the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have said they would do on a number of occasions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para26"><a name="10012062000159">Finally, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West, mentioned the golden triangle in the Leeds area. If we had followed the advice of the Conservative party in the past, and were to follow it in the future, we would see not a golden triangle for jobs, investment and growth, but a Bermuda triangle.</p>

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="10012062000160"><a name="100120h0004.htm_spnew5"><a name="10012062000404"><b>Mr. Mike Hancock (in the Chair):</b>
 I thank hon. Members for their contributions. I am sure that we all know a lot more about Leeds than we did. I echo the sentiments of those who spoke about hon. Members who are not seeking re-election, and I also wish them well for the future. I thank the Minister for her courtesy, and ask those who are leaving to do so speedily and quietly. We now move on to the next debate.</p>

<a name="time_8"><a name="100120h0004.htm_time2"><a name="10012062000358"><h5 align="left">11 am</h5>
<p><a name="st_37"><a name="10012062000161"><a name="100120h0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="10012062000405"><b>Caroline Flint (Don Valley) (Lab):</b>
 I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to discuss the importance of the Rossington inland port for the areas of Rossington, my constituency, Doncaster, and Yorkshire and Humberside. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) is here, as well as my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), who are supporting me in my endeavours to get a move on with the decisions that will help to make that inland port successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para27"><a name="10012062000162">A planning application for Rossington inland port was approved by Doncaster council's planning committee in November 2009. The application is a departure from the development plan and as such has been referred to the Minister, who is awaiting advice from the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber about whether it should be called in. I do not want the Minister to comment on the merits of the application, but I would like his assurance about the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para28"><a name="10012062000163">The Rossington inland port is a major rail freight interchange and, according to the council's assessment, it is capable of delivering more than 3,000 jobs-that figure is more if we accept the developer's forecast. Given the times in which we live-we rightly celebrate 100 jobs being created in local communities-we should take the prospect of 3,000 jobs with good heart and help to make the project happen. All statutory objectors either support the application or have no objections. The principal objectors are the Campaign to Protect Rural England and four parish councils. Only two letters of objection were received from the public. Other objectors supported the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, which withdrew its objections after discussions with the developers about nearby wetland land management. However, the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber has stated that issues with the Highways Agency need to be resolved before a decision is made on whether to call in the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para29"><a name="10012062000164">Apart from the green belt-although I do not underestimate that issue-the proposal is in line with national, regional and local policies. As such, I believe, as do my hon. Friends and many others, that exceptional circumstances have to be demonstrated, and are being demonstrated. The development should therefore be supported. The applicant has looked for alternative sites in the region and found that the Rossington site is the best. That assessment has been independently reviewed on behalf of the planning authority and has been found to be robust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="100120h0004.htm_para30"><a name="10012062000165">The local planning authority has taken the view that there are exceptional circumstances, because of the regeneration potential in the area, that the impacts on the green belt are acceptable and that there are no alternative sites on which the development can be located. In the past week, an important report has looked at the cities and important towns of our country, and Doncaster and Barnsley have been cited as places where not enough progress has been made. I acknowledge that that is the case. A great deal has been achieved in the past 10 years or so, but there is more to be done to ensure that those communities, which relied on mining for generations, have a future in which the numbers of private sector jobs are equal to those in the public sector. This is an opportunity that I believe can benefit both towns.</p>

 Communities such as Rossington and Denaby in my right hon. Friend's constituency and Mexborough in my constituency were totally devastated by the previous Government's pit closure programmes in the 1980s and 1990s. That proved Doncaster's economy was over-reliant on the coal industry. How important is this flagship project in allowing towns such as Doncaster further to diversify their economy, so that we are not over-dependent on any one issue and we can have a sustainable future and economic growth in Doncaster?</p>

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="10012062000167"><a name="100120h0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012062000407"><b>Caroline Flint:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. The project is essential to the future of communities that have relied on traditional industries, such as coal mining. Having said that, we hope to make a contribution to clean coal technology in future with the technology that is available today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para0"><a name="10012062000168">It is crucial to consider how the north of England can contribute to our strategy across the country as a whole. We have had many debates in the House about the opportunities that there are-or have not been-in the north of England. Given that the inland port would be a strategic rail-freight interchange that a number of Government reports have said is essential to the development of transport around the country and to the supply companies that would supply the freight to go on to the stock and the rails, I cannot think of anything more exciting than getting this inland port under way as the next step in Doncaster's future. That is what I want to press upon the Minister today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para1"><a name="10012062000169">The council is, as we are, keen to progress the matter, and a permission could be issued by 1 March 2010. I very much hope that that will not be delayed by an unnecessary public inquiry. The only unresolved issues relate to the Highways Agency and I believe, as does the council, that those can be satisfactorily resolved locally between the Highways Agency, Doncaster metropolitan borough council and the developer, without resorting to a public inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para2"><a name="10012062000170">Doncaster council has been in regular dialogue with the Highways Agency and the developer's consultant since the pre-planning application stage discussions. The purpose of those discussions was to work towards reaching a resolution acceptable to all parties on issues pertaining to the strategic road network. Notwithstanding that, the Highways Agency has said that it has no "in principle" objection to the proposed inland port and that it has full confidence that outstanding issues will be resolved based on its consultation response to the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para3"><a name="10012062000171">Work is being undertaken by all parties to resolve the remaining three issues: acceptance of the travel plan, agreement by all parties of the detail for the proposed signalisation scheme of M18 junction 3, and the upgrade of the westbound merge layout at junction 3 to accommodate the development traffic. I know that the Highways Agency is keen to consider traffic flows, as is the Department for Transport, but sometimes we are in danger of losing out on the strategic impact of proposals by not allowing them to move faster. That results in a huge cost for local authorities and the developers as the clock keeps ticking and time is wasted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para4"><a name="10012062000172">It should also be noted that the scheme developers will contribute to the upgrading of the M18, so we have a win-win situation, and delay can only cost more for  <br>

everyone concerned. I was therefore surprised to see a letter from the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber-I have very good relations with the office and I know that it tries to do things in everyone's best interests-stating that the decision on call-in was in abeyance, possibly for three more months, while the Highways Agency undertook modelling work in relation to the M18. The letter I received from Felicity Everiss stated that the decision is</p>
<a name="100120h0005.htm_brev0"><a name="10012062000345"><ul><p class="tabletext">"currently being held in abeyance. Doncaster MBC are aware of this. This is because, in our view, there are some substantial highway issues still to be addressed, which whilst unresolved would mean any decision now by the Secretary of State on whether or not to intervene, would not be based on the full facts raised by the application. The Highways Agency is currently working with Doncaster's Planning Department and the applicant to address these concerns and will let us know the outcome in due course. We anticipate that this will be within three months."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para5"><a name="10012062000173">I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that that is an unnecessary and costly delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000174">As I have said, the project is crucial to regeneration in this part of Yorkshire, particularly south Yorkshire, and would regenerate a former coal mining community. The site of the inland port is in a dip that lies alongside the disused Rossington colliery. As I have said, it is estimated that the proposal will deliver between 3,000 and 5,000 jobs. I would have expressed joy at the creation of 100 jobs, but we are talking about thousands of jobs. The development is directly accessible from a former mining community, where high levels of deprivation still exist-including employment deprivation-and where alternative prospects are limited unless we get the right development to sustain those communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000175">The proposal would contribute to the early implementation stages of the Finningley and Rossington regeneration route scheme, which is a proposed strategic transport scheme that improves accessibility to new job opportunities and contributes to the development of land. The proposal would support the development of a more competitive city region by improving the links between key components in transport infrastructure such as rail freight distribution, Robin Hood airport, the motorway network and the regeneration areas of south Yorkshire and Sheffield city region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para8"><a name="10012062000176">The proposal would also contribute to reducing 5.5 million lorry miles a year on motorway networks and 425,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. The concept of rail freight interchanges, including those set out in the proposal, is supported by Network Rail. In a letter to Doncaster council on 16 March as part of the consultation on the inland port planning application, Network Rail identified Doncaster as a</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para9"><a name="10012062000177">The concept is also complementary to Network Rail's Control Period 4 investment programme, which includes the upgrade of the Peterborough-Lincoln-Doncaster line to enable it to be used for efficient freight rail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para10"><a name="10012062000178">The proposal also supports the policy of the Department for Transport on strategic rail freight interchanges, particularly the need to establish major rail freight interchanges across the country. It is absolutely clear that the inland port would fit into the transport vision described in the Government's own document on the future planning of transport, "Delivering a Sustainable Transport Strategy", which was published in 2007.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000179">The proposals will result in a private sector investment of approximately £300 million in a regeneration priority area, as identified in the Yorkshire and Humber regional spatial strategy. That investment will support, as one part of the jigsaw, our economic recovery during and after the recession and our future competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para12"><a name="10012062000180">The proposal would contribute to the intermodal logistics sector in Doncaster, which was also identified in the Yorkshire and Humber regional spatial strategy as a priority sector for Doncaster due to our excellent position on the strategic transport network, our position near the Hull ports and, of course, work force availability. It should also be noted that the proposed development would include 22,000 square metres of green roofs, mainly on ancillary buildings, rather than warehousing; 158 hectares of woodland and agricultural land to accommodate a project to mitigate environmental impacts, including the replacement of ecological features and wetlands and indigenous tree and hedge planting; and funds to support and co-ordinate important training and employment schemes in the local community.</p>

Realistically, we are in a period of speculation about the general election and we all know that in such circumstances there can occasionally be a tendency for Departments to slow down. I hope that that will not be the case and that my hon. Friend the Minister will put his foot is on the accelerator to ensure that schemes that will help us out of the recession and build a better future can proceed without further delay. My hon.

 It has been a while, Mr. Hancock, but it is a pleasure to serve once again under your stewardship. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) on securing the debate. I know that the issue is important to her, her constituents and those living in the local area. I am also aware of her correspondence with the regional director of the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber on the development. I am in an unusual situation today-or  <br>

perhaps not so unusual-as my right hon. Friend is probably better qualified to respond to the debate than I am, so I will continue with that at the back of my mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para15"><a name="10012062000184">I will start by providing some background information on the proposed development of an inland port at Rossington in Doncaster. A planning application has been made for a new strategic rail-freight interchange called Doncaster inland port. The developers have assembled a 397-hectare site on land west of Rossington, and both north and south of junction 3 of the M18 at Doncaster. As my right hon. Friend stated, the development site would occupy approximately 171 hectares, with the balance being used for landscape, wildlife and flood alleviation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para16"><a name="10012062000185">More specifically, the proposal includes 562,000 square metres of rail-linked warehousing, with an intermodal rail-freight terminal designed to handle national and international consumer freight. A new access road from junction 3 of the M18 is proposed, partially constructing phase 1 of the Finningley and Rossington regeneration route scheme. The site is expected to generate around 5,500 jobs and to attract around £250 million of private-sector investment. As my right hon. Friend stated, given the challenges of the global economic downturn, the creation of any number of jobs, be it 10 or 100, is to be applauded. Given that we are speaking about so many jobs, she is right to say that the Government must take on board the strategic impact of the development on the economy in south Yorkshire. Improvements to the landscape and flood alleviation measures will be undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para17"><a name="10012062000186">I am aware that the proposal is somewhat controversial locally, with objections being raised about the suitability of the site for such a development. My right hon. Friend has put that in perspective by talking about the numbers, the objectors and how some of those concerned no longer object to the development.</p>

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="10012062000187"><a name="100120h0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="10012062000409"><b>Caroline Flint:</b>
 Is my hon. Friend aware that not one Doncaster councillor, from any party, objected to the scheme, and not one Doncaster councillor voted against it? In fact, as I said in my speech, the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, which did object and had valid reasons for doing so, removed its objection after successful negotiation.</p>

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="10012062000188"><a name="100120h0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="10012062000410"><b>Mr. Malik:</b>
 I fully accept that the number of objectors is quite limited, and that it has diminished since the proposal process began.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para18"><a name="10012062000189">It might be helpful if I commented on some of the relevant national policy issues raised by the application, some of which my right hon. Friend alluded to. The Government support the transfer of freight from road to rail where it is practical and economically and environmentally sustainable. We recognise that a consistent and effective framework is needed to support the competitive and efficient operation of the UK logistics industry. We also recognise that both private and public investment and consistent planning decisions will be needed to support the strategic development of freight infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para19"><a name="10012062000190">On the issue of support for longer-term freight growth by rail, rail can deliver goods quickly and reliably to where they are needed and help reduce both congestion on our roads and carbon emissions. For longer-term freight growth and further modal shift to occur, rail needs to be able to compete effectively with heavy goods  <br>

vehicles on the roads. Rail freight has become a vital driver of UK economic growth: it moves coal for electricity generation and aggregates for construction; it makes just-in-time deliveries for the manufacturing sector; and it takes an increasing share of the domestic retail and supermarket supply chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para20"><a name="10012062000191">Rail freight produces five times less CO2 emissions per tonne carried than road freight, and up to 15 times less noxious emissions. A container train can remove 50 HGVs from our roads. Emissions from HGV traffic have grown significantly since 1990-by 25 to 30 per cent., using the revised assessment from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. HGV traffic is a significant source of greenhouse emissions from transport; it is second only to cars and vans, and international aviation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para21"><a name="10012062000192">A network of strategic rail-freight interchanges is a key element in aiding the transfer of freight from road to rail and in supporting future rail-freight growth. Interchanges of all types will be required to support that, but the Government believe that there is a particular market need for a network of strategic rail-freight interchanges-for large new interchanges with intermodal capacity and rail-connected warehousing-to support the development of rail in the general freight market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para22"><a name="10012062000193">Yorkshire and the Humber is a growth area for the logistics, supply chain and distribution industries. It has good transport links, land and labour availability-including in the political sense. Clusters of activity are already developing in south Yorkshire and parts of the East Riding of Yorkshire. On modal choice and sustainable distribution more generally, we believe that it is important for all modes of transport to be able to compete on equal terms, so that customers can make an informed choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000194">Since road transport is currently not required to pay its full external costs, we provide targeted assistance for the use of rail, inland waterways and coastal or short-sea shipping to enable those modes to compete on a level playing field. We also continue to provide our capital support scheme-the freight facilities grant programme-which helps to offset the capital cost of providing rail and water freight-handling facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para24"><a name="10012062000195">That said, there are some markets for which mode shift is not appropriate, and for a large number of logistics movements, road haulage remains the only practicable option. We seek to reduce the impact of road freight transport by promoting more efficient freight operations, chiefly through best practice and driver training schemes. However, each planning application must be considered on its own facts and merits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para25"><a name="10012062000196">Let me turn to the role of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. It is important to recognise, as my right hon. Friend does, that in considering the application, the Secretary of State would not be responsible for determining the detailed merits of the proposal. The decision is rather whether, under the Government's call-in policy, the application should be called in for determination by the Secretary of State, or whether it should be left to Doncaster council to take the final decision. It is clear from listening to my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) that their preference is for the latter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para26"><a name="10012062000197">As my right hon. and hon. Friends may be aware, the kinds of cases that might be called in include those that,  <br>

in the opinion of the Secretary of State, may conflict with national policies on important matters; have significant effects beyond their immediate locality; give rise to substantial regional or national controversy; raise significant architectural and urban design issues; or involve the interests of national security or foreign Governments. Our general approach is not to interfere-I restate "not to interfere"-with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas, and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly and with the minimum of interference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para27"><a name="10012062000198">However, there will be occasions when it may be considered necessary to call in a planning application and have the Secretary of State determine the matter, instead of leaving the decision to the local planning authority. Our policy is to be selective about calling in applications. In general, we will take that step only if the planning issues are of more than local importance. It is worth bearing in mind that only 0.01 per cent. of all planning applications are called in. Between 2006 and 2008, the number of cases called in fell by more than two thirds, and the numbers are still falling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para28"><a name="10012062000199">It is clear, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley suggests, that a decision to call in adds significantly to the costs for all parties involved, and adds significant delay to the process. That is why we are keen to use the power selectively, especially in the current economic climate. She was absolutely right to stress that point. Looking forward, my Department has committed to leading a review of the call-in process, with the aim of achieving significant time savings. The review will report in early March. Obviously, that information is not directly relevant, but I hope that it will be useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para29"><a name="10012062000200">The current application was formally received by the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber on 1 December, following referral by Doncaster metropolitan borough council under the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Development Plans and Consultation) (Departures) Directions 1999. The application was referred because the proposals would be a departure from the provisions of the Doncaster unitary development plan, as the application site falls within the green belt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para30"><a name="10012062000201">On 3 December, the Highways Agency formally requested the Government office not to proceed to consider the application until such time as the motorway impact issues had been resolved. It was anticipated that that could take up to-I stress "up to"-three months. Obviously, it could take much less time, notwithstanding where we are. The Government office's view was that there were some substantial highway issues still to be addressed, which, while unresolved, would mean that any decision taken now by the Secretary of State on whether to intervene would not be based on the full facts raised by the application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="100120h0005.htm_para31"><a name="10012062000202">Consequently, on 10 December, the Government office wrote to Doncaster council and the applicant to notify them that the scheme would be put in abeyance while the transport assessment work was finalised.

I am certainly happy to meet her so that we can speak with relevant officials. She also spoke about ensuring that the foot is on the accelerator.

ECPAT, which services our all-party group, and does so very well, estimates that 60 per cent. of children rescued from traffickers later go missing from local authority care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para10"><a name="10012062000218">Between March 2003 and April 2009, the POPPY Project in London, which provides shelter to trafficked women, received 1,233 referrals of women over 18 who were acknowledged to have been trafficked. The Home Affairs Committee's report last year stated that at least 100,000 people are trafficked into and around the EU each year. There are rumours of boys moving from Russia through Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as sex slaves, but there are no numbers. In a high security prison in Bucharest, which I recently visited, one man admitted driving a transit van weekly across the Pyrenees transporting trafficked women from Romania into Spain. He would not give me any numbers, but he did that for several years. There is a combination of anecdotal and statistical evidence, and it is not surprising that Nick Davies recently questioned the scale of human trafficking in the UK in a challenging article in <i>The Guardian</i>. The statistics are spasmodic, unreliable and unproven. Unfortunately, modern-day slavery is not tidy, visible or neatly packaged, and it is not surprising that Mr Davies's article unleashed an outburst from non-governmental organisations, sex workers, former trafficked victims, women's rights workers, officials, MPs, and so on. Everyone weighed in to complain about his views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000219">By its very nature, modern-day slavery is hidden. Much of it is underground, most of it goes undetected, and much of it is orchestrated by sophisticated criminal gangs whose footwork is much faster than the lumbering steps of the law. The House must not underestimate victims' very real fear of coming forward-and anyway, how do they do so? If they are sex workers, they are prisoners; if they are forced labour, they are working covertly to get rid of debt; if they are domestic slaves, they usually have their passports taken away; if they are child victims, they are usually used as Fagins by their parents or distant relatives to carry out street crime.</p>

I am pleased to see the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell), in his place and about to give a powerful answer to some of my points.

of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are all involved in trying to tackling this difficult problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para13"><a name="10012062000221">It is important to acknowledge the Government's financial commitments. The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office awarded £3.7 million to the POPPY Project over two years, and funding for the human trafficking centre has almost doubled from £834,000 in 2007-08 to £1.7 million in £2008-9, and £1.6 million in 2009-10. However, despite those initiatives, the signing of conventions, and the involvement of 11 Departments, the problem remains as opaque as ever. Some people say that it is getting worse. Modern-day slavery will continue while people in undeveloped countries are forced to feed the appetites of populations in developed countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para14"><a name="10012062000222">We are witnessing a worldwide phenomenon. The largest number of children trafficked into the UK are from China and Vietnam. Many of the women trafficked into sexual slavery fly via the Netherlands from west Africa. An increasing number of victims trafficked into Spain come from south America. The French suffer from human trafficking, but do not like to admit it. Moroccans and Tunisians are viewed as illegal immigrants, rather than as people who are trafficked. As pilfering and violence become epidemic, and as the rule of law collapses in Haiti following the terrible national disaster, child trafficking will quickly emerge as children are left abandoned or orphaned, and predators move in. What is the state of play in this country?</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech on this issue, as usual. On his last point, does he really fear that the children who are orphaned in Haiti will end up being trafficked? What can be done about that?</p>

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="10012062000224"><a name="100120h0006.htm_spnew3"><a name="10012062000416"><b>Mr. Steen:</b>
 I was hoping to ask a question about that in the House this morning, but unfortunately we did not get that far. There is no doubt that during events such as tsunamis and earthquakes, children are separated from their families and parents, and sadly there will be many orphans in Haiti. It is a very poor country-one of the poorest in the world-and I cannot see that traffickers, who are predators, will fail to come forward and take children away, either from children's homes, or by deploying distant relatives who will say that they are going to care for them, but those children will never be heard of again. I wanted to ask the Prime Minister a question this morning about what is being done to alert international aid agencies to that prospect. There is no evidence for it yet, but it is inevitable, and the question is how it can be prevented, and on what scale it will take place. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para15"><a name="10012062000225">I was coming on to look at the situation in this country. Until the summer of 2008, it seemed that the Government were keeping up the pressure. However-and this has nothing to do with the Minister-I have a feeling that once the Council of Europe convention was ratified and implemented, that impetus might have been lost. Perhaps we need a new impetus from the Government in the dying embers of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para16"><a name="10012062000226">A good example is the implementation of the national referral mechanism in April 2009. In the first six months ending in September 2009, 347 people were referred as suspected victims of trafficking. There are 180 Government officials who have been specially trained as assessors. Dividing 347 by 180, we are entitled to ask what each of those officials are doing for the rest of the time when they are not looking into their two referrals. Those 180 Government officials are referred to as "competent authorities" and are tasked with the job of deciding whether any of the victims referred to them have been trafficked. I do not understand why we need 180 officials-that number could probably be cut by two thirds. Who trained them? What were they trained for, and are they the right people to do that job?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para17"><a name="10012062000227">There is a bigger question about the relevance of recognising someone as a victim of trafficking, and about the authority of the competent authority. Even if an individual is recognised as trafficked, the Ministry of Justice, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, can still pursue criminal cases against them. The pattern is well established, with the Crown Prosecution Service totally ignoring, and treating as irrelevant, the decision of the competent authorities employed by the UK Border Agency and, by implication, denying the existence or legality of the Council of Europe convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para18"><a name="10012062000228">Let us take the case of V, a Vietnamese boy who was assessed as aged 17 but who was 15 when he arrived in Britain. He was given a positive, conclusive-grounds decision in which the competent authorities identified him as a victim of trafficking. In spite of that, he was given a 45-day reflection period, as required by the Council of Europe convention, but once he had served that 45-day delay, he was sentenced. The fact that he had been subject to a decision by the competent authority, which stated that he had been trafficked, was completely irrelevant. The Crown Prosecution Service charged him with cannabis cultivation, and he was convicted at Huntingdon Crown court in August 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para19"><a name="10012062000229">There are many such cases; I have a number of them. I have raised the issue with the Solicitor-General and with the Director of Public Prosecutions. If somebody has been trafficked and described as such by the competent authority set up by the Government, how can they possibly be prosecuted and sentenced? The competent authority's statement that a person has been trafficked becomes an irrelevancy, because it does not have any meaning. The question then is: does it have any meaning for the Solicitor-General or the courts?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para20"><a name="10012062000230">Such cases make a joke of the 45-day reflection period. What is the point of recognising individuals as victims under the national referral mechanism if criminal cases are then pursued against those same people? What is the significance of the Government signing the Council of Europe convention, if children and young people found to have been trafficked-whether Roma children or Chinese boys-are left with no emotional, psychological or practical support to help them navigate the administrative and legal nightmare of human trafficking legislation? It goes totally against the words and spirit of the convention. Not only is the national referral mechanism being side-stepped by the law, the principles in the convention of supporting, helping and advising children are being totally ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para21"><a name="10012062000231">The Government state that their goal is to make the UK a hostile environment for human traffickers, but they have made it a totally hostile environment for the  <br>

victims. Domestic workers who come to the UK on diplomatic visas to work for diplomats are not able to change employers without losing their immigration status. That makes them particularly vulnerable to abuse because they have no escape route from such a situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para22"><a name="10012062000232">Kalayaan is a London-based, well-run non-governmental organisation that supports migrant domestic workers. It reports that it refers 6.9 per cent. of the diplomatic domestic workers it encounters to the UK Human Trafficking Centre as victims of trafficking. That is compared with 0.1 per cent. of domestic workers in private households. That dramatic difference is an obvious cause for concern, and I led a delegation to the Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Woolas) on 24 November last year. All the heavyweights on the issue of human trafficking were there, and the Minister buckled under the arguments. He could see no reason why the diplomatic visa should be changed so that those who were imprisoned or abused by officials in foreign embassies or delegations could escape. As it is, they cannot escape. If they do escape, they have no passport and are sent home where they came from. These people come from embassies and they are terrified about their future and the future of their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000233">I would like to mention other cases, but some victim support organisations are reluctant to release information. It is hard to raise the problem with credibility when one does not have the details. Of course we want to protect the privacy of victims, but we can do that and share information at the same time. There are increasingly difficult problems in getting even the vaguest information from some of the organisations that are specifically funded by the Government to look after victims of trafficking. Will the Minister consider whether he could provide some guidance to those organisations and suggest that acting like a guard at Fort Knox, preventing anyone from getting in, or meeting, listening to or speaking to any of the victims, is not a good way to encourage an open and transparent society?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para24"><a name="10012062000234">I have a case from one such organisation, the POPPY project. It could not give me the name, or details of the courts or the police, which was not very helpful; none the less, I will relate some of the information. This case took place last November, when a referral was made to UK Human Trafficking Centre regarding 21-year-old Chloe-apparently she was 21, although I do not know whether her name was actually Chloe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para25"><a name="10012062000235">Chloe had approached the central London Sapphire unit-a police unit-having been violently raped that night. Although she did not say that she had been trafficked, it became known that her "boyfriend" had links to the sex industry. She described owing a debt of £20,000 to the people who brought her to the UK-it is clearly a case of trafficking-which she had to pay off by working in restaurants. She claimed to be very afraid of those people and appeared highly traumatised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para26"><a name="10012062000236">The police officer at the Sapphire unit picked up on the indicators and tried to access support for Chloe. They put her in emergency accommodation for that night, but were unable to accommodate or support her after that. Chloe suggested that she would be able to stay with a "friend", but it was known that the friend was involved in managing a brothel. When the police officer called the UK Human Trafficking Centre to make the referral, she was informed that as Chloe had   <br>

been out of her exploitative situation for some time, she was not eligible to enter the national referral mechanism-one can see the bureaucracy that has built up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para27"><a name="10012062000237">The concerns are first about the UKHTC, which has been severely criticised in relation to the NRM and the many non-governmental agencies using it. That seems to be one of its weaknesses. The UKHTC, which has three staff-as opposed to the 178 or 177 in the UK Border Agency-should have recognised Chloe as an extremely vulnerable individual with immediate support needs. She had approached the police and was seeking assistance regarding the criminal justice system, support, accommodation and identification. That was last November. The date on which she escaped her exploitative situation should have had no bearing on her potential status as a victim of trafficking, and the rights and support to which she would be entitled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para28"><a name="10012062000238">Chloe clearly described several indicators of trafficking for labour exploitation, which were passed on to the UKHTC. In addition, the Sapphire officer noted several other indicators suggesting that she may also have been sexually exploited. As a potential victim of trafficking, Chloe should, at this stage, have been housed and supported appropriately, and then informed about the NRM. The significant point is that the UKHTC's refusal to refer her to the NRM effectively denied her the opportunity to access any support. As the Minister will know, the UK Border Agency deals with women from outside the EU, but it will also deal with women from inside it. Chloe probably came from an EU country, but because she was denied an NRM referral, she could not get any other support. I have a number of such cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para29"><a name="10012062000239">What happened in this case reflects a lack of concern for the safety of the individual. The victim should be accommodated in a place of safety, and an NRM referral should then be made, if appropriate. In this case the woman was close to being returned to someone who was known to have connections with the brothel management. I would like to be more specific, and I am sorry that I cannot be, but the problems I face prevent me from saying more. However, I think that the principle is well established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para30"><a name="10012062000240">Having raised the issue of domestic slavery and the problem that one Department did not follow law under the convention even though another Department was involved, I want to come to local authorities. Local authorities referred 57 children to the national referral mechanism last year. What happened to them? I do not know whether the Government or anybody else knows where they have gone, but I do not. Have they been assessed by the competent authorities? Who has been responsible for their welfare? Has section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, which places a duty on the UK Border Agency to safeguard the welfare of children, made any difference? Does the Minister have any information about how section 55 is changing the conduct of the UK Border Agency? Should it change it? Does the Minister have any statistics? They are one thing we probably do not have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="100120h0006.htm_para31"><a name="10012062000241">I am deeply troubled that, for some reason, Britain cannot look after its own children, let alone vulnerable children from overseas. In fact, our track record on losing children in care has put us near the top of the league, and it is not the sort of league that a developed country such as Britain should even be in, let alone lead. There is a lot of shame there, which we should acknowledge and do something about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para0"><a name="10012062000242">We know that it is impossible to find foster parents for foreign children who speak no English. We need a national campaign to find foreign language-speaking residents who are willing to foster. At the moment, the best that we can do for trafficked children is to place them in local authority child care homes, but that does not mean very much given that many of them, sadly, experience understaffing, which results in many hundreds of children escaping. Such children are not in care at all, because the homes are like an open hotel-often not a very good hotel-that they can leave whenever they like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para1"><a name="10012062000243">For that reason, I am convinced that it would make sense for every trafficked child to have a guardian ad litem appointed from the moment that they are acknowledged to be a trafficked child. Such a guardian would ensure their safety, as well as ensuring that they are not abused by the legal or administrative systems and that someone keeps an eye on their welfare. Guardians ad litem work well in Britain, their track record is good and their results are impressive. Why not use a tried-and-tested system, rather than trying to invent a new one?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para2"><a name="10012062000244">If we really mean what we say and want to implement the Council of Europe convention effectively-with a bias towards victim protection-rather than create a culture of deportation, we need fewer "competent authority" officials, with different training and a different approach. Child care workers would be far preferable to UK Border Agency officials. It is therefore important that we get the national referral mechanism right and then ensure that the guardians ad litem are in place to take over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para3"><a name="10012062000245">Inevitably, a victim's first encounter with the police or border officials will affect his future outlook. Our failure to change the culture of deportation and disbelief in turn explains why our record of prosecutions and convictions of traffickers is less successful than that of countries such as Holland, Italy and Austria, where the public authorities are known to be on the side of the victims, and where victims understand that the authorities are there to help them. It is worth mentioning that the most recent uncovering, by the Austrians, of a multi-country human trafficking ring took place only because all the victims were willing to give evidence. That was an impressive outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para4"><a name="10012062000246">By contrast, there have been worrying reports that UK officials are not on the side of victims at all. In one case, the competent authority identified a woman-I will call her P-from India as a trafficking victim as part of Operation Tolerance Pilot, which ran from May to December 2008. The UKHTC then informed the POPPY project that the decision was void because it had not been taken under the new national referral mechanism, and that it wanted to put her through the process again. That was despite the fact that the original decision had been issued by a Government agency. From what I have said, the Minister will understand both the appalling bureaucracy, rules and regulations and officialdom that have built up as a result of our signing the convention against human trafficking and the attitude of UK Border Agency staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para5"><a name="10012062000247">What is to become of the UKHTC? The 35-strong, south Yorkshire-based staff will be merged into the 4,000-strong, Home Office-run Serious Organised Crime Agency, and its specific tasks will be diluted, if not  <br>

washed away. The principle of establishing a multi-agency organisation, which would act as a central repository for all information on human trafficking and offer strategic and operational support and a 24/7 support line for advice, including on the care of victims, deserved a chance. I certainly supported the establishment of the UKHTC in Sheffield three years ago. The idea that the centre would conduct research, develop training, share best practices and develop an improved knowledge and understanding of the way in which criminal enterprises associated with human trafficking operate was perhaps somewhat over-ambitious, but its important task of co-ordinating statutory bodies, such as local authorities, the UK Border Agency and police, reflected sound thinking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000248">Following the centre's absorption into SOCA, however, any suggestion that it can achieve any of those objectives must be seriously questioned, and the possibility of its being independent has been shattered for ever. It will be neither independent, nor able to deliver the goods; it will be lost in a huge organisation of 4,000 staff. The Government like things bigger and centralised, which is perhaps why the UKHTC is being absorbed into SOCA and why the human trafficking team in the Met will be absorbed by the much larger clubs and vice unit. However, big does not mean better. As Schumacher said, "Small is beautiful", and I know that myself from the Schumacher college in Dartington in my constituency, which is very small and very good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000249">How successful has the UKHTC been? It is just over three years old. On the plus side, it is a one-stop shop for statutory agencies, local authorities, the police and the UK Border Agency. In that respect, it has proved valuable, but it has been less successful in achieving its other objectives. Nor has it been able to provide real help to the voluntary sector-it has just not had the resources. Some argue that it would be better if the Government spent £1.6 million a year funding non-governmental organisations with a proven track record in dealing with human trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para8"><a name="10012062000250">The time has arrived for the UKHTC to concentrate on what it does best: co-ordinating the statutory services. For the rest, we must make better use of the voluntary sector and establish a national human trafficking watchdog-some European countries would call it a national rapporteur, but we, being English, call it a watchdog. The concept of a national watchdog goes back to the 1997 Hague declaration, which was the first international document to recommend that EU member states establish a national reporting mechanism. In this country, we report to a watchdog, but people in other European countries report to a rapporteur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para9"><a name="10012062000251">The modern-day slavery watchdog would act as a central repository for all information on human trafficking. It would be charged with collecting facts, figures and statistics, monitoring weaknesses, speaking up for NGOs, ensuring the adequacy of victim accommodation, checking that the guardian ad litem system was working properly and the like. It would contribute to a better knowledge and understanding of the root causes of trafficking, the modus operandi of traffickers and their criminal networks, and the different forms of exploitation. Indeed, a more complete picture of the extent of the crime is precisely what we need. That would increase our knowledge and facilitate our work against this phenomenon, and we could more effectively identify victims of trafficking  <br>

and provide appropriate support to them. A watchdog would be part of the solution, and it should be based in the Home Office, although independent of it. Its task would be to see that Government agencies deliver on outlawing human trafficking.</p>

I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Damian Green) knows that; it is a quite interesting point about SOCA-one cannot get any information out of it. What are the implications of that for reporting to Parliament?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para12"><a name="10012062000254">If it is impossible for SOCA to report to Parliament, there is even more reason for us to establish an independent role for a national watchdog. The watchdog would report annually to Parliament and make recommendations on the development of national policies and action plans, without itself being a policy making agency. For example, what could be done to improve the situation regarding the confiscation of traffickers' assets that have been transferred overseas?</p>

I want to introduce a national anti-slavery day to reinforce the focus and the understanding of the general public. Such a day would continue to draw attention to the evils of human trafficking post-Wilberforce, and to how that is displaying itself in British society. An anti-slavery day would cost the taxpayer nothing, but could do a great deal of good. I hope that the Minister will say how he feels about that. I hope that all parties in Parliament will support me on 5 February and help me to get my Bill through the Commons quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para14"><a name="10012062000256">In summary, we need a national referral mechanism, to be administered by welfare or social workers rather than immigration officials; a guardian ad litem system for trafficked children, to support them through legal and administrative hurdles; and work permits and identity cards for victims of trafficking while they are resident in the UK, to give them the ability to work in the UK just as they do in Italy. That would encourage them to give evidence against traffickers without fear of being returned to their source country, where there would be a risk of re-trafficking. We need a national network of shelters for women and children, whatever their age, who are victims of trafficking, and a proactive and dedicated police force on human trafficking-the Pentameter initiatives were welcome and should be revived in every police force and carried out every year. We also need a national human trafficking watchdog, working with Government but independent of them; and a change in visa arrangements so that domestic workers brought into the UK to work for foreign embassy officials are free to seek other domestic work and not forced to return home. Finally, we need an annual UK national anti-slavery day, which will make sure that the crime is kept firmly on the agenda and does not get consigned to a dusty drawer.</p>

I hope also that I shall be able to give service to the groups from the human trafficking foundation charity I am establishing. It is deeply depressing that in spite of Wilberforce's achievements in outlawing slavery 203 years ago, modern-day slavery is a new canker in our midst, with human beings being degraded while society stands by and does little.</p>

 I shall be brief. I want to make three points. First, I echo the concerns of the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) about the closure of the Metropolitan police trafficking unit. In my view, that unit has hugely improved the policing of the issue. It is a great pity that it is not to continue, and is to merge with the clubs and vice operation, which, in my experience, has put insufficient focus on the experience of the victims of the vice trade. I do not have any particular beef with the Serious Organised Crime Agency; it is a question of effectiveness and victimisation. If that mistaken decision is to be proceeded with, I urge the Minister to institute a mechanism to ensure that any new arrangement has that victim focus and does not end up in the sort of cosy arrangement that I have seen in the past in vice policing, in which the exploiters and the police come to a deal that stops the neighbourhood nuisance, but not the exploitation. That is a cause of serious anxiety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para16"><a name="10012062000261">Secondly, I want to urge on the Minister the need for a powerful information campaign about the legislation, which he helped to introduce in the House of Commons, making it an offence for any man or woman-any customer-to pay for the sexual services of someone who is forced to provide them. One of the most powerful effects of that legislation, potentially, is that it could deter customers from such behaviour, and so reduce the market for those who have been exploited, thus reducing the profits of traffickers and exploiters and the extent of exploitation. That chilling effect will not occur unless the law moves from being secret-as it largely is at present, frankly-to being publicly and widely known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para17"><a name="10012062000262">In women's lavatories there are frequently stickers on the back of the door-it is not quite the same for loo doors in the gents'-giving the local Rape Crisis telephone number, or something like that. I want every urinal to have, at eye level, something to warn chaps who are thinking of paying for sex that if they do, and do not know with absolute certainty-without any doubt in their mind-that the person who offers herself to them does so of her free will, without having been bullied into it by a pimp or trafficked, they will be committing a criminal offence and will be prosecuted. I believe that if such an approach were taken, there would be a difference to the trade. I am normally rather sceptical about Government publicity drives, but I think that the one in question could reduce crime and exploitation significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para18"><a name="10012062000263">Thirdly, I want to mention the recent European Court of Human Rights decision in the case of Ms Rancheva. She had gone to Cyprus from Russia under an artiste's visa. She ended up in debt, and it seems clear to me that some people-trafficking operation was involved. She tried to leave the club that she was in, and a few days later was found dead on the pavement, after falling from a balcony. There was no criminal prosecution in connection with the events leading up to her death, but there was a prosecution under the European convention on human rights. Cyprus was found guilty of failing to protect Ms Rancheva and failing to put in place a proper framework to fight trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para19"><a name="10012062000264">One issue at the heart of that seems to be that Cyprus had allowed a sex industry to flourish in a semi-public place. People who thought that they would be artistes, or performers in public clubs, were actually operating in the sex industry. It appears to me from the judgment-of course I do not know any more than is in the published press release and so on-that the margin between Ms Rancheva selling herself in prostitution and exotic dancing had been diminished, or smoothed out, to such an extent that she was in effect being prostituted. She did not want to be; she wanted to go back to Russia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para20"><a name="10012062000265">The key issue in that case is the existence and public acceptance of gross sex exploitation, at an industrial level, in which people are allowed to participate. The case of Ms Rancheva is a very strong argument for the Government to intervene in a similar activity in the UK, by which I do not mean exotic dancing, although the activity happens in the context of exotic dancing. In almost every local newspaper in the UK there is a page of advertisement for "fresh Thai girls", for example, or "new girls today". That is advertising trafficked women for men's sexual pleasure. I believe that that should be prevented. Various Ministers have sought to reach settlements with the publishers of those newspapers, so that they voluntarily stop publishing the advertisements, but guess what? They carry on, because they are a source of much profit-oh, what a surprise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para21"><a name="10012062000266">I believe that unless the UK Government take action against that type of publication, they risk, following the Rancheva judgment, being in breach of our obligations under the European convention on human rights. I urge the Minister to examine that and, if his legal advisers conclude that I am right, to introduce urgent legislation to prevent such advertising, because if these adverts run in freely available newspapers, of course people think that the work is safe and legitimate, but it is actually not safe and legitimate work. It is work that has at its heart the most grotesque exploitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para22"><a name="10012062000267">The appalling thing about how human-trafficking for sexual exploitation works is that the degradation that trafficked women experience, and their experience of the sex industry, sometimes mean that, having escaped from it into impoverishment, isolation and loneliness, they re-enter the sex industry, in a so-called voluntary way, because it is the only way they know of generating income to survive. If women do re-enter the industry, they end up with some of the problems described by the hon. Member for Totnes, in relation to their immigration status and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="100120h0007.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000268">It seems to me that there is a duty on Government to stop providing comfort to those involved in the industrial-scale exploitation of people who, because of their  <br>

 I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). When the Select Committee on Home Affairs conducted the inquiry into human trafficking, we appointed him, even though he was not a member of the Committee, as a very special adviser because of his knowledge. May I raise one point with the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) about the merging of the UK Human Trafficking Centre with SOCA? I do not know whether he has seen the Select Committee report, "The Trade in Human Beings: Human Trafficking in the UK". SOCA is quite a new organisation and therefore ill equipped to deal with this new area of policy. Does he agree that that is a very important consideration in not merging the two organisations? Let SOCA do what SOCA is supposed to do, and let us have this independent organisation of which the hon. Member for Totnes spoke.</p>

Girls fly into Gatwick airport, coming from west Africa, thinking that they will become waitresses or work in a shop. They go through security. The people with them take the passports off them. They are then taken to the coffee lounge, where they are sold for £4,000 or £5,000. That is happening in our country, and it is happening  <br>

because the criminals can make so much money from their crimes. In fact, they can make more money from this crime than they can from drugs. That is why there is industrial-scale trafficking. There are a number of ways in which we have to tackle the issue.</p>

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="10012062000275"><a name="100120h0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="10012062000423"><b>Mr. Steen:</b>
 The information that I got recently, which I thought worth sharing with the House, is that more people are trafficked in the world every year than were ever in chains in the 350 years of the African slave trade.</p>

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="10012062000276"><a name="100120h0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012062000424"><b>Mr. Bone:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a powerful point; that is extraordinary. We think back to Wilberforce's time and we think that in those days people were somehow not quite as human as us, there was not quite the level of culture and people did not understand that slavery was wrong. Hang on: more people are being trafficked today than were ever in the slave trade back then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para1"><a name="10012062000277">I shall give another example of how close to home this trade is. Across the river at St. Thomas' hospital, a member of my staff observed at the sexual health clinic a young lady escaping from a trafficker, with the trafficker chasing her down the corridor. That is the hospital across the river. Obviously, I have mentioned London and the London area, but the problem is everywhere. In Northamptonshire recently, the police broke a trafficking ring and rescued two victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para2"><a name="10012062000278">I know that the Government have done a lot in this field and that Ministers have been very helpful. I have been writing a report on the issue for the past three years, and every time I think I have finished it, some horrible new aspect of it appears, including trafficking within the United Kingdom. However, there are one or two things that I do think could be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para3"><a name="10012062000279">The first involves what I have learned for the first time will be called the national watchdog. There has been some disagreement between my hon. Friend and me about what that should be called. He was rather in favour, being a good European, of "rapporteur". As someone who does not quite share his views on Europe, I did not think that that could possibly be acceptable to the British people and I suggested that perhaps it should be "commissioner", but what we want is a very small unit. I have been with my hon. Friend to Holland to see the Dutch rapporteur. Their office consists of two or three people and they report each year to the Parliament on the numbers. They have a statutory duty to do that. That is a check on what the Government are doing and whether things are getting better or worse. I referred to a very small unit. This is not another Conservative cost commitment. I am sure that the money can be found within the existing framework, that the cost will be much less than the cost of what is going on at the moment and that the money will be much more effective. That is one thing the Government could do to improve the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para4"><a name="10012062000280">The second issue is more delicate. We have very good border controls for people coming from outside the European Union, but of course people have free movement within the European Union. We are an island, so we have certain advantages. However, what happens is that people come into this country who clearly may be trafficking people, but they are not challenged because there is a fear that we might be breaking European rules. Let me give an example. I hope that people will correct me if I have got this wrong.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para5"><a name="10012062000281">I used to go to America because I had a business there, and on occasion I took with me young ladies of 16 or 17 who were trainees in the business and were going to visit our US office. On every occasion, the border agency there took those young people aside and interviewed them separately to find out whether it was a genuine visit, and that I was not trafficking them. That took half an hour. They used to take letters with them from their mothers and so on, but it was done on every occasion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000282">I know of an example in which a middle-aged white man brought into the country a black young lady who did not match the picture on the passport. They were not challenged. That girl was thought to have been trafficked; thankfully, she escaped. This is the sort of practical step we should try to take; it will not mean stopping everyone, but in obvious cases someone might say, "Hang on, why are those young women coming in with that man? They do not seem to be related; they do not seem to be a family." Such cases should be investigated. Those two practical things would make a huge difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000283">I fully agree that all the things listed by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes should happen. However, I have another huge concern. Those trafficked into this country who are over 18 are treated better than children who have been trafficked. Those aged 16 who are trafficked into this country, forced into prostitution and then rescued will finish up in a children's home, from where the traffickers will re-traffic them. Those over 18 will probably finish up with the POPPY project, where they will be properly looked after.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para8"><a name="10012062000284">I have long argued about what needs to be done. If a 16-year-old trafficked girl is found in Bournemouth, she should be moved to Manchester-or at least put somewhere completely out of range of the traffickers. There is also a strong argument for having secure homes for people who have been trafficked-not to keep the trafficked victims in but to stop the traffickers getting at them.</p>

I most sincerely ask my hon. Friend the Minister just to find £50,000 or £100,000; if he does not want to use pounds, he could send euros.

It would be no bad thing if, at any height, there were reminders that if I took advantage of trafficked girls-I am sure that such services are offered in Leicester, as they are in every other city in the country-I would be committing a crime. That action could be undertaken now by the police or by local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para16"><a name="10012062000295">We may have dealt with kerb crawling. We recently had the extraordinary example of a premier league football manager who was caught by <i>The Sun</i> coming out of one of those wretched industrial brothels before Christmas, but his name is not recorded because his lawyers are agitated about it. I grant that it is difficult to name him. I grant that naming and shaming may not be acceptable to many. I grant that there are many problems in that field. However, until we start the process of naming and shaming, which we have started to do with kerb crawlers, we will not start reducing the demand side. I am worried, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Slough, that the Bill that was passed by the House of Lords just before Christmas may not be made operational. There is a culture of macho-ism in the police; as a result, combating this area of crime is regarded as not being as interesting or rewarding as others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para17"><a name="10012062000296">I conclude with a reference to the anti-trafficking alliance. It promotes good literature, some of which is produced in Chinese. I have a copy here, but there is little point in reading into <i>Hansard</i>, as I do not understand Chinese. The alliance states:</p>
<a name="100120h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="10012062000348"><ul><p class="tabletext">"If you are a man who is about to sleep with a woman working in prostitution, think twice! She may be trafficked and you could be charged with rape."</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para18"><a name="10012062000297">It quotes Natalia, a Russian survivor of trafficking. She said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para19"><a name="10012062000298">I have to say to my right hon. Friend the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, for whom I have affection and respect, that he must speak up much more clearly on the demand side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para20"><a name="10012062000299">In an earlier debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes-if I may, I will call him my hon. Friend-who has been so shabbily treated by the press in what is his last period in the House, and the hon. Member for Wellingborough disagreed with me about the demand side issue. I hope now that we are beginning to change our minds. I thoroughly endorse all the recommendations. Given that the Home Office has undergone a complete culture change in the last couple of years and has become extraordinarily courageous under the present Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) and previous Home Secretaries, it would be exciting if it adopted one or two of the measures and then promoted them before this Parliament comes to its end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para21"><a name="10012062000300">None the less, the root cause remains demand. As long as there is demand-as long as one premier league football manager grants himself the privilege of going to a brothel and having sex with someone who may or may not have been trafficked-we will not stop the practice. We must focus on the demand side.</p>

 This has been an excellent debate with many well-informed contributions. Let me start by congratulating the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) on securing the debate. It was entirely appropriate that he should use this debate-one of his last opportunities in Parliament-to raise an issue on which he has been an active and articulate advocate in the House in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para22"><a name="10012062000302">Let me take the debate a little wider than the issue of the UK Human Trafficking Centre. Victims of trafficking are often viewed as possible perpetrators of immigration crime, as opposed to being, first and foremost, victims. They are unable to identify themselves as victims because of the risk of being pursued in relation to immigration matters. A number of Members, including the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), made it clear that it is difficult to get hold of accurate data on the subject, for the obvious reason that most of the problem is underground, which makes it hard to keep reliable statistics. The Home Affairs Committee's report identified that more work needed to be done by the UK Human Trafficking Centre to provide firmer information about the issue, so that all the different authorities are better placed to address the problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="10012062000303"><a name="100120h0008.htm_spnew6"><a name="10012062000429"><b>Keith Vaz:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman was a member of the Committee that produced that excellent report-if we can share in the compliments. One of the points that was raised in that report was the concern that the Metropolitan police's human-trafficking unit was going to lose its funding from the Home Office. That poses a problem, particularly for London. Given that the Minister is here, is it not right that we should make a plea that some-if not all-of that funding should be restored?</p>

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="10012062000304"><a name="100120h0008.htm_spnew7"><a name="10012062000430"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 Clearly, the Minister has heard that plea on a number of occasions, and he has now heard it again. Given the difficulty in tackling and addressing the issue, and in identifying the number of victims, it seems a great pity to lose or dilute expertise, or to reduce the funding that is required to finance the expertise. I can see the Minister frantically scribbling away. I am sure that he is writing into his notes a commitment to providing the funding that is required, and he will shortly have the opportunity to confirm that that is the case.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="10012062000305"><a name="100120h0008.htm_spnew8"><a name="10012062000431"><b>Mr. Steen:</b>
 Like me, the hon. Gentleman talks about statistics. The UK Human Trafficking Centre was the one place that was deputed to get statistics. It got them from local authorities and elsewhere. However, trafficking is not just about sex. Members have been talking about sex, but it is also about child trafficking, domestic slavery trafficking and debt bondage. A large number of men are involved in trafficking. The statistics were going to be brought together. The centre is only three years old, and it has gone. I know that the Minister will say that it has not gone, but in my view it will go in a few months' time. When it does, there will be no organisation in Britain deputed to get information. The very thing that we have all been requesting for years will disappear, and we will not achieve any of the things that we want to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="10012062000306"><a name="100120h0008.htm_spnew9"><a name="10012062000432"><b>Tom Brake:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his pertinent and topical intervention. Again, the Minister will have heard such a view before. It is up to the  <br>

Minister to identify who will be responsible for collecting the information and who will address the issues that the UK Human Trafficking Centre has not yet been able to address. Those issues include multi-agency working and how it will be possible to pull in not just the police but the UK Border Agency and other organisations, so that we can work collectively on this significant human tragedy, which occurs in many of our towns and cities each day of the year. There are issues that institutions need to address. Some seek to address the issue of immigration and all its attendant problems, such as people-smuggling, rather than the special problems of trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para23"><a name="10012062000307">I have very little time, so I will flag up some points to do with prevention, to which the Government should respond. The Home Affairs Committee report highlighted the fact that we have a system that conspires to allow migrants to come to the country almost with the expectation that they will not receive the minimum wage. It is almost universally understood that they will not receive it, which is an encouragement to trafficking. We often have good laws that are poorly enforced. The national minimum wage is one such example. As a number of Members have highlighted, there is not much public awareness of human trafficking for sexual purposes, child trafficking or trafficking for slave labour. I hope that the Minister will respond to the suggestion by the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) that we should ensure greater public campaigning on the issue, to make people more aware of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para24"><a name="10012062000308">I should also like to pick up on the point that the hon. Member for Slough made about our local newspapers, which feature many columns of adverts of the kind that she mentioned. I welcome the fact that the Newsquest Media Group has agreed that it will not carry such columns. I hope that those of us who get Newsquest papers will scan the columns carefully, not only for references to ourselves as Members of Parliament, but to see whether those papers do indeed no longer carry adverts of that nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para25"><a name="10012062000309">I have one slightly more controversial point. As there have been significant differences of opinion about the laws on prostitution, it would be right to draw attention to what the police have had to say about the difficulties in enforcing the law. I am not sure whether the Minister is in a position to give us feedback today on whether those difficulties are now perceived to be less of a problem, more of a problem or still part of a very significant issue that the police will have to address. I refer to the matter of the police being able to demonstrate whether men are able to establish beyond doubt that a woman had or had not been trafficked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="100120h0008.htm_para26"><a name="10012062000310">I should like to carry on at much greater length, but you will not permit me, Mr. Evans. I will therefore finish by congratulating the hon. Member for Totnes on opening this debate with his characteristic knowledge and expertise. I hope that the Minister can respond to our concerns, particularly on the issues about funding, what might come after the closure of the UK Human Trafficking Centre, and how he will ensure that we can retain and effectively use our expertise.</p>

Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen). All I would add is that what he has done is an absolute model of how one can use an all-party group to shift public policy forward an inch or two. I speak as someone who is sceptical of the proliferation of all-party groups in the past few years. One's faith in the system is almost restored by what my hon. Friend and others from all parties have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para0"><a name="10012062000312">I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who said that when, sadly, my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes leaves the House, he will be able to devote more time and energy to the issue. I do not think that it is possible for him to devote more time and energy to it than he has done over the past few years.</p>

 I hear that with some trepidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para1"><a name="10012062000315">We all agree that human trafficking is a despicable modern slave trade; that is clearly not an issue. There might be an issue between some of us about recognising its wide nature. I appreciate the passion with which the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) and the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) spoke about the prostitution-related element of slavery in particular. That is clearly a significant part of the problem, but it is not the whole problem. We need to take a view that encompasses child trafficking, domestic servitude, slave labour and debt bondage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para2"><a name="10012062000316">What is significant about the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes is that he pointed out many of the worst failings of the current system; I am sure that the Minister will address them all directly. It was striking that he painted such a bleak picture. I have participated in other debates such as this, having worked in the field for many years now. There was a feeling among all parties that we had moved forward significantly, having signed and ratified the convention, and that Britain was in a reasonable place on the issue. However, the picture painted by my hon. Friend is much darker and more pessimistic. If he is right-we all acknowledge that he is an expert in the field-we clearly need to give serious thought to the next steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para3"><a name="10012062000317">My hon. Friend discussed statistics. For obvious reasons, they are difficult, but we need to start from what we know. The International Organisation for Migration reports that between 700,000 and 2 million women and children are trafficked across international borders every year. We know that 60 per cent. of illegal immigrants here in the UK arrive illegally, most carried in the backs of lorries. A Government assessment published in October 2008 estimated that 360 children are trafficked into and within the UK each year. Despite those figures, we know that only 57 under-18s, out of a total of 527 referrals, were referred last year to the national referral mechanism as suspected victims of trafficking.</p>

 As I said, only 57 of the 527 under-18s have been referred under the national referral mechanism. In the five years to 2009, 452 people were arrested for human trafficking offences, of which only 110-less than a quarter-were convicted. I am sure that the Minister shares my concern over those figures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para6"><a name="10012062000321">I visited the UK Human Trafficking Centre in Sheffield last November and it was interesting to see its work. My conclusion is that having a central point for information on trafficking has been of great value to police forces, the Crown Prosecution Service and other agencies. UKHTC demonstrates the importance of specialisation when tackling new types of crime. An important aspect of its work was international co-operation, for example, through chairing the Interpol human trafficking group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para7"><a name="10012062000322">The team at UKHTC informed me that they were having more success in prosecutions than the figures appeared to show because traffickers were being prosecuted for offences other than trafficking-the so-called Al Capone approach. The Minister is nodding enthusiastically about that. However, that gives rise to the worrying thought, identified in the Select Committee report a couple of years ago, that the CPS has problems with the drafting of current trafficking legislation. I wonder if he has anything to say about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para8"><a name="10012062000323">As we have learned from other countries, in the run-up to the Olympics, we must pay attention to the danger that more people might be trafficked here for that period, when hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new people will be here. Perhaps the Minister would also address that point. Although I have kinder words to say about UKHTC than my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes, the work that it does must be linked to prevention work. The Conservative party has urged the Government to focus on countries of origin. We were pleased to see mention of that in the millennium goals. However, many who work in this area, in particular the very good charity, Stop the Traffik, are concerned that campaigns are being targeted in the wrong way. Instead of specific resources being allocated for anti-trafficking campaigns, Stop the Traffik argues that Department for International Development aid campaigns should incorporate messages about trafficking. At a time of restricted public spending, that would seem to be a valid method of warning those in poorer countries of the dangers. Will the Minister consider a more inclusive approach? Is he in contact with colleagues in DFID about such matters?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para9"><a name="10012062000324">The Conservative party policy document on this matter concentrated on better co-ordination between state agencies, in particular on ensuring that each police force and local authority has a strategy to deal with suspected victims of trafficking. Looking back on that, we are concerned that there appear to be problems with the national referral mechanism at a local level. Better information still needs to be provided to local authorities and police forces so that they are aware of the problem, are better able to identify victims and are more confident in using the mechanism. It is having a fairly patchy effect across the country.</p>

 The problem with the national referral mechanism and the Solicitor-General's office through the Director of Public Prosecutions is evident: someone is declared to be trafficked, and then they are prosecuted and sent to prison.</p>

 That is a fair point. I would like to elaborate, but I will not, given the time that is  available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para10"><a name="10012062000327">An area that is often ignored is trafficking for the purpose of forced labour. In 2008, the last year for which we have full figures, there were only four convictions for trafficking for the purpose of forced labour, despite the problems of organised immigration crime that we all know about. We believe that one failure in this field has been not cracking down on rogue employers. A lot more work ought to be done on that. We have heard warm words from a succession of Ministers, holding various portfolios, but so far there has not been much effective action.</p>
<a name="10012062000332">
<p>I will move on to new measures that I would like to see. I am conscious that my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes produced a full, extensive and-in some areas-expensive list of desires, outlining how he would like us to move in this area. I suspect that he produced the fullest shopping list he could in the hope that some of his requests would be picked up. He and I have had discussions in private about having a watchdog-indeed, the last time we did so, he was still agonising about how he could replace the word "rapporteur" with something else. That was clearly a matter of some controversy. I am entirely relaxed about the name, because the substance is more important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para11"><a name="10012062000328">I am not entirely convinced that setting up another unit in the Home Office is the best way forward, not least because of practical considerations. For example, we all agree that we should be most concerned about the trafficking of children, but we already have children's commissioners not just for England, but for the other nations within the United Kingdom. So in that area alone, there is clearly the capacity for serious, potentially annoying and damaging overlap between those two bodies. I am not sure that a proliferation of watchdogs is necessarily the right way forward, but I accept his point that we need better information and statistics, so that policy can be more evidence based. Most of all, we need ministerial will to drive the matter forward. In the end, the organisational problems are secondary to the priority given to the subject in the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para12"><a name="10012062000329">I agree not just with my hon. Friend, but with the point made by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) that part of the problem is the difficulty of multi-agency working. We agree that we need a more joined-up approach and we have published a policy proposal that details a more coherent approach, not just for policing our borders, but for protecting victims and prosecuting the offenders that includes instructing immigration officials to check the date on the return ticket of the adult accompanying minors to look for discrepancies; working with the countries of origin to help reintegrate victims; preventing re-trafficking; and educating potential victims. There should also be better law enforcement to bring more traffickers and employers of forced labour to justice, and better co-operation of national authorities within Europol and Eurojust.</p>

 That is where Europol is particularly important and where better use of Europol would be hugely beneficial. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I sense the discomfort of the Chair, so I will make just one more point. The most important defence we have is our borders. We want to replace ad hoc police operations with a national border police force, which would be much more effective at combating trafficking at the border. The Government's failure to tackle Britain's poorest borders has resulted in a disastrous rise not just in organised immigration crime, but in trafficking. My hon.

Gentleman was right to raise his concerns regarding the terrible events in Haiti. I have already spoken to the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), who has given a commitment to raise the matter with the necessary governmental and non-governmental agencies to see what can be done. On the question of the Olympics, again, we are aware of the potential threat. However, the Metropolitan police service Olympic security team and the Home Office keep such work under review, which is supported by the UK Human Trafficking Centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para15"><a name="10012065000006">We all agree that human trafficking is an appalling crime-people are treated as commodities and are exploited and traded for profit. I reiterate that the Government are committed to tackling the issue, to making the UK a hostile environment for trafficking and to identifying and protecting victims. I am genuinely sorry if the hon. Gentleman believes there has been a loss of momentum. I hope that is not the case. Outside the UK, I think there is a view that much of what we do can be held up as very good practice, but I take his point seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para16"><a name="10012065000007">Throughout the debate, reference has been made to the importance of victims. Of course, the UK action plan on human trafficking, which was updated in October last year, is very much based on a victim-focused strategy and on prevention, investigation, enforcement and prosecution. That action plan also focuses on providing protection for adult and child victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para17"><a name="10012065000008">On the issue of prosecutions, which the hon. Gentleman raised, the Crown Prosecution Service makes it clear in its guidance that victims of trafficking who have been forced to commit criminal acts should not be prosecuted if those acts are a direct result of their having been trafficked. However, such issues must, of course, be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, because blanket immunity is not necessarily offered. Many of those decisions are extremely difficult to make in practice, as is dealing with the problems surrounding victim identification. The hon. Gentleman raised the issues associated with what appear to be very young people from Vietnam often being brought over here to cultivate cannabis farms. For the people involved with making such decisions, it is extremely difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para18"><a name="10012065000009">At the heart of the debate is the future of the UK Human Trafficking Centre, which has played a pivotal role in tackling trafficking under the leadership of DCS Nick Kinsella. The centre was set up in late 2006 and has established itself as a good example of multi-agency working, with, importantly, a range staff from Government agencies working alongside those from the non-governmental organisation sector, who play a crucial role in many of the issues raised. On the subject of numbers, it is extremely difficult to get an estimate of the number of trafficked victims. We have given a commitment to bring forward a better estimate, particularly of those who have been trafficked for sexual exploitation, and I can give a reassurance that those figures, which are being worked on as we speak, will be published very soon. However, the issue of numbers is very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para19"><a name="10012065000010">On the question of statistics, the hon. Gentleman quoted the number of referrals as being 347. I want to update hon. Members by giving them the most up-to-date figure, which is 527 referrals between April and December 2009. On the issue of what appear to be relatively few convictions, the hon. Member for Ashford to some extent answered that point by saying that people who look as if they are caught up in trafficking are sometimes not charged and convicted of those offences, but of other offences, depending, of course, on where the evidence lies. UKHTC does important work with the National Policing Improvement Agency to make sure that police training is up to date. It has also worked with partners from the private sector in developing the Blue Blindfold brand, which has won a great deal of support-I believe that the hon. Member for Totnes was at the launch of that. Again, such an approach is recognised as good practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para20"><a name="10012065000011">UKHTC also houses one of the competent authorities established as a key part of the national referral mechanism  <br>

and is the central repository for all data on human trafficking. The hon. Gentleman raised his concerns during the debate on the Queen's Speech on 25 November and I wrote to him in December in, I hope, reassuring terms. However, I want to repeat the main point: we remain absolutely committed to the continued existence of UKHTC. The problem was that, when the centre was established, it had no legal status of its own and was hosted by South Yorkshire police, which is its current legal entity. When South Yorkshire police approached the Home Office, it was concerned that reliability issues were emerging as a result of having more to do and a higher profile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para21"><a name="10012065000012">We looked at where the best place for UKHTC would be in the future to guarantee its continuing to operate as it does now. We looked at a range of options and concluded that the Serious Organised Crime Agency is best placed for UKHTC, both for the centre and for our overall anti-trafficking efforts more generally. It is not a merger with SOCA and it will not lead to a dilution of the centre's focus on the victim-centred strategy on human trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para22"><a name="10012065000013">A number of details on changing UKHTC's status are currently being discussed by SOCA and the centre, but I have made it absolutely clear that the Government expect that the identity of UKHTC will be preserved, along with its character and functions, which will include its strategic objectives, brand identity and multi-agency composition, and its close working with stakeholders. Dealing with organised immigration crime is an important part of SOCA's work, so there can be some benefit from changing UKHTC's status in that regard, but we expect that the unique role of the centre will continue, and we want to support and develop it. I hope that that will be stressed if and when the Home Affairs Committee visits SOCA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="100120h0009.htm_para23"><a name="10012065000014">On the national watchdog or rapporteur, we agree with the conclusions of the Home Affairs Committee, which stated in its recent report that a national rapporteur would not benefit data collection and that such an introduction would merely</p>

 May I say how pleased I am to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Evans, particularly as it was almost 20 years ago that I played a key role in your first attempt to win the Ribble Valley seat? Unfortunately, you were unsuccessful in that attempt, but it is undoubtedly no coincidence that, once I stopped working for you, you succeeded in becoming the Member for Ribble Valley, to which you have been an adornment for many years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para0"><a name="10012065000021">This is the first time I have sought a Westminster Hall debate on an issue of national policy, but the number of Criminal Records Bureau cases that cross my desk, both as an MP and in my capacity as my party's spokesman on culture, has led me to apply for the debate, and I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para1"><a name="10012065000022">Several themes run through the cases that I have come across, and I suspect that the Minister will be all too familiar with them. The first theme is the delay in getting a CRB check, which often directly affects the livelihood of the constituent involved. The second theme is the number of CRB applications someone has to make to cover the various roles that they might have that involve working with children. The third theme is the often inappropriate application of CRB checks for what I would describe as casual and informal arrangements. Finally, there is the iniquitous provision within the Police Act 1997 that allows unproven allegations to appear on a CRB file.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para2"><a name="10012065000023">As the Minister knows, the CRB was established in March 2002 under part V of the 1997 Act. Under the Act, newly employed personnel may be asked to apply for one of two checks, depending on the nature of their position. Specifically, the CRB can provide information held on a police national computer, including convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings in England and Wales. It can also provide information held by local police forces and other agencies relating to relevant non-conviction information. So a vast amount of information can be provided, the implications of which I will turn to in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para3"><a name="10012065000024">I will deal first with the delays that I have come across and their impact on people's lives in my constituency. The CRB's website claims that, in 90 per cent. of cases, it takes from 10 days for a standard check to come through, to four weeks for an extended check. That is not my experience. For example, that claim is of little comfort to one of my constituents who, after successfully applying for a job last July, had to withdraw his application a few months later when his CRB check had still not materialised. Finally, after extensive waiting and some intervention from me, it arrived in November, five months later, by which time it was entirely useless. My constituent had lost his time, his money and, indeed, his job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para4"><a name="10012065000025">Another constituent of mine had been unable to return to work as the renewal of her work permit required an up-to-date CRB check. That check took another five months, during which time she was unemployed and found it very difficult to care for her children. Her employers did not know that they could apply at the time to the protection of vulnerable adults scheme,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

which apparently would have let her work while her CRB check came through. I gather that POVA's role may now have been superseded by the Independent Safeguarding Authority, although I will wait to hear from the Minister on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para5"><a name="10012065000026">Incidentally, I think that it is symptomatic of the incompetence that seems to surround this entire Administration that, on the Home Office's website, the word "independent" is spelt wrongly, with an a, rather than an e. That is a change the Minister can effect immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para6"><a name="10012065000027">I find it utterly exasperating that there is a second Government body designed purely to cope with the delays of the first, but it is even worse to realise that that service was at the time unheard of by a company that regularly uses the CRB. Another constituent found that Thames Valley police took more than 10 weeks to complete their part of the check, because they did not have the appropriate resources and, indeed, had built up a backlog of 40,000 cases, which is an astonishing number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para7"><a name="10012065000028">What is the Minister planning to do about what I regard as completely unacceptable delays? I am sure that she will read out the statistics supplied by her officials, citing the 85 to 95 per cent. success rate that the bureau itself cites, but perhaps it might be more revealing if she stated how many hon. Members have written to her about delays in the CRB, or indeed how many people have made complaints to the CRB about delays. That would be an equally telling statistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para8"><a name="10012065000029">The second issue that I will address is the all-too-familiar one of multiple CRB checks, in relation to which I suspect that every hon. Member has had constituents approach them in exasperation. Another constituent of mine, while trying to get a job in a difficult economic climate, rightly chose to keep his options open and applied for two jobs-one at a school and a second at a museum. Both jobs were ultimately under the aegis of Oxfordshire county council, yet two separate checks had to be applied for, each costing between £35 and £55. Those checks were both the same, were being carried out simultaneously and looked at the same things, such as his criminal history. Both checks analysed his competence to work around children and both would have been valid for exactly the same time, so I should like to ask the Minister what she is doing to minimise what are, in effect, duplicate checks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para9"><a name="10012065000030">Why cannot a CRB check be portable once it has been carried out, at least for a period of time? Why could not subsequent CRB checks be carried out much more quickly, simply by confirming that the person applying for the job is the same person who received the original check? Surely, that would be quicker and cheaper for all concerned. I should also like the Minister to consider what impact that must have on the job market in sectors that frequently require such checks. To pay £35 or £55 every time one applies for a job must surely be a severe strain on anyone who is unemployed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para10"><a name="10012065000031">My third theme relates to the example of a constituent in a position of responsibility who was accused of a serious assault on a minor but never charged. He was the headmaster of a special school for boys with emotional problems. Indeed, the school is one level below a secure unit, so one can imagine the kind of boys who, perhaps through no fault of their own, are at the school and the kind of behavioural problems encountered. It seems to  <br>

me inevitable that there would be clashes between staff and boys, and of course staff are highly trained to deal with those circumstances. My constituent, who was involved in such an altercation, is described by his union representative, who has known him for 10 years, as a man with an impeccable reputation-indeed, an international reputation-in the field in which he works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para11"><a name="10012065000032">My constituent left his job for reasons wholly unrelated to the incident that took place, yet when he applied to do voluntary work for a charity that he had been involved with for 15 years and on whose management committee he has sat, he had to apply for a CRB check. After huge delays, which of course I had to get involved in, the CRB form finally arrived. Imagine his surprise when he read a detailed two-page synopsis of the allegations that had been made against him: not only were they reproduced, in essence, as facts, but as facts themselves they are entirely inaccurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para12"><a name="10012065000033">The Minister will have noticed that I am keen to keep confidential the details of all my constituents who have run up against the CRB, but I have the bureau form here, and she can see the length of the details of the allegations. In one part, the form states that Mr. X restrained the victim, took him to his office and slammed him against the wall and that the incident was witnessed by another member of staff at the school and so on. All the allegations are listed as fact, despite the fact that they are inaccurate about what happened and the number of people who witnessed the incident. Furthermore, they were thoroughly investigated and completely dismissed.</p>

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="10012065000034"><a name="100120h0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012065000118"><b>Mr. Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and concur very much with his concerns. Does he agree that the real problem is the inconsistent application of section 113 of the Police Act 1997? A chief constable may wilfully refuse to amend or remove allegations against people who have never been charged or convicted of a criminal offence, and as a result of malicious or vexatious accusations, those allegations cast a pall over their professional life?</p>

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="10012065000035"><a name="100120h0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="10012065000119"><b>Mr. Vaizey:</b>
 I completely agree with my hon. Friend. That is similar to an issue that I suspect both he and I have encountered of innocent people having their DNA taken by the police. The default position for the police is that they simply will not change or amend the details. They have no sense at all of the effect that that might have on individual. One suspects that they take the view that it is convenient for them and increases the information available to them, but there is no sense beyond that of their wider duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para13"><a name="10012065000036">This is completely outrageous and a huge offence against natural justice. As a result of what happened to my constituent, he is, in effect, unemployable. I admit that I would not employ him on the basis of simply reading his CRB check. A new offence seems to have been created by the 1997 Act whereby an allegation against someone can blight the rest of their life. That old film cliché, "You can walk from this court without a stain on your character," is no longer true. It seems that under the CRB, once an allegation is made, a person is guilty as charged, even if they are found not guilty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para14"><a name="10012065000037">Another issue that I want to address is the inappropriate use of CRB checks. I recently discussed the effect that they were having on children's authors with a well-known  <br>

children's author who regularly visit schools. I appreciate that some of these points may be out of date, because I gather that the issue has been reviewed as a result of the uproar caused by the creation of the Independent Safeguarding Authority. However, as a snapshot of what people are up against, the author's letter is telling and, given that she is a well-known children's author, very well written. She stated:</p>
<a name="100120h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="10012065000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Recently, there has been a huge upsurge in the number of schools insisting that visiting authors have CRB checks. This is despite the fact that we are never (not least for insurance reasons) left alone with children, and that we are usually only in a school for a few hours. Many of us do have CRB certificates, but some do not, and getting one is not easy-they have to be secured through an 'umbrella' organisation, and authors, as self-employed freelances, tend not to belong, nor to want to belong, to such things. Even when they do, it can take ages for clearance to come through."</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para15"><a name="10012065000038">I have covered that point already. She continued:</p>
<a name="100120h0010.htm_brev1"><a name="10012065000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">"In the meantime, visits are being cancelled and children, while being 'protected' against an infinitesimal risk, are being denied the far greater benefit of meeting an author and possibly being inspired to read".</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para17"><a name="10012065000040">She then makes a telling point about the whole climate created by the CRB:</p>
<a name="100120h0010.htm_brev3"><a name="10012065000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">"On top of this there is the question of what we are doing to children by implying that all adults, and even their favourite writers, are potential threats."</p>

To coin a phrase, we cannot go on like this. The Government have created a monstrous and-I use the word advisedly-Orwellian bureaucracy. Between 9 million and 11 million of us fall under the remit of the CRB; in fact, I am astonished that I myself, in my capacity as a Member of Parliament, have not been asked to provide a CRB check when visiting a primary school. The CRB costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. It processes about a million people a year. It is decimating voluntary working, creating a climate of fear and putting people off getting involved in civic duties. Does the Minister truly believe that it is making us safer?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para20"><a name="10012065000043">At the very least, can the Minister commit today to providing clear guidance for employers and voluntary groups to deal with the confusion that seems to arise about schools asking for CRB checks and to make employers aware of the processes? Can she provide a clear threshold, based on time spent working with children, for when a CRB check should be applied?</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Evans, I believe for the first time. I shall not repeat the facts about the establishment of the Criminal Records Bureau as they have been outlined by the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey). Instead, I shall get straight on to some of the points that he raised, and in particular go into detail on why we have repeat disclosures, and on disputes about information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para24"><a name="10012065000048">The hon. Gentleman has not tried to discuss an individual case; regardless, I point out that I cannot discuss individual cases, but I am happy to facilitate a meeting between him and the leading people at the CRB and to be present at it myself, if that would be helpful. I hope that we can catch each other after the debate to make arrangements to do that as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para25"><a name="10012065000049">The main subject of the debate is the enhanced disclosure. The CRB currently issues standard and enhanced disclosures. Standard ones include information about criminal records but also information about cautions and other police information. Enhanced disclosures include, critically, other local intelligence-the kind of local intelligence that was not released in the case of Ian Huntley. That is one of the reasons why it is particularly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para26"><a name="10012065000050">The hon. Gentleman discussed delays of five months. I shall go into performance statistics in a little more detail, as he indicated I might. Five months is an unusually long time, as most checks are done quickly, and must mean that there has been a need to acquire information from different police forces and perhaps elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para27"><a name="10012065000051">The hon. Gentleman asked specifically whether the protection of vulnerable adults list will be taken on by the Independent Safeguarding Authority. It is at present undergoing transfer so that any cases on the POVA list from last autumn will be transferred to the ISA. Some will be case-worked again-there may be issues around the decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para28"><a name="10012065000052">I wish to make it absolutely clear that a work permit does not require a CRB check. I am not quite sure whether that is what the hon. Gentleman was asking, but it is worth reading it into the record that a work permit itself does not require a check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para29"><a name="10012065000053">The Thames Valley police force has a backlog, but it is one of six forces where the CRB has made a special arrangement to allow staff to access police records directly so that most cases can go through quickly. It is going well with the six forces. In addition, 20 CRB staff are embedded with the Metropolitan police due to the difference in IT systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para30"><a name="10012065000054">We hope to see more of that, because it means that most checks will be done quickly by trained and dedicated staff. In some small forces, there are very few people to do them. All it takes is for one person to be sick, and the force's ability to deal with the backlog can be affected. I have the latest performance figures of the Thames Valley police; if I do not have time to read them into the record, I can provide them to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para31"><a name="10012065000055">I want to correct a slight misapprehension about fees. Perhaps it is not a misapprehension; maybe it is based on fact. The fees for a disclosure are £36 for an enhanced disclosure and £26 for a standard disclosure. They are, of course, free for all volunteers, who account for about 22 per cent. of the total, or one in five. Any additional fees may be charged by the bodies that collect the forms and submit them to the CRB on behalf of the applicants. Some local authorities and others provide that service for a fee; others do it for free. It is up to the individual to shop around, should they want to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="100120h0010.htm_para32"><a name="10012065000056">There is quite a lot of public support for the CRB. Nine in 10 people agree that those who do paid or voluntary work with children should be checked and would be willing to be checked themselves, and nearly three out of four members of the general public think that the CRB is making a difference. I contend that the fact that 98,000 people have been prevented from working with children and vulnerable adults is an argument for the success of the scheme and a challenge to some of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman at the end of his speech.</p>

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="10012065000057"><a name="100120h0010.htm_spnew3"><a name="10012065000121"><b>Mr. Vaizey:</b>
 That seems to get to the nub of the argument. In theory, one of those 98,000 is my constituent. As I said, in normal circumstances, he would not have a stain on his record, because the allegations against him when he was working in a highly complex environment with vulnerable children were investigated and dismissed. However, because the enhanced disclosure form includes those allegations, he cannot work with children. That is what the Minister is describing as a success.</p>

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="10012065000058"><a name="100120h0010.htm_spnew4"><a name="10012065000122"><b>Meg Hillier:</b>
 That is one case. I will talk a bit more about the total number. Some 6.7 per cent. of checks reveal information of interest to the employer, but only 0.5 per cent., or 21,000 cases-I acknowledge that that is a significant number-contain information from a police force. The accuracy level is very high, at more than 99.96 per cent. The factual information in records provided by the police and attached to the right individual is accurate. In a moment I will discuss in detail the number of people who lose their jobs as a result. It is very small. To touch on the individual case, although I will not discuss it in detail, there is a dispute process. I am happy to talk privately with the hon. Gentleman about what might be happening in that individual case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para0"><a name="10012065000059">To pick up on some of the hon. Gentleman's later points, I should clarify that there is no need for a CRB check when the person is not alone with children. That   <br>

<notus-date day="20" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>20 Jan 2010 : Column 133WH</b><br>
is commonly misapprehended by many organisations. One leading light in a large voluntary organisation said to me, "There's a problem. Everyone thinks that if you do gardening in a hospital, you have to have a CRB check." It is important that we get the message out that the risk of decision making lies with the employer, agency or voluntary group that employs people. They must still go through the normal checks and procedures to ensure that someone is safe. The CRB check is simply a tool. It provides information. In a moment, I will give some examples of people with information who have gone on to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para1"><a name="10012065000060">The hon. Gentleman alleged that the system reduces the number of people who volunteer. Many organisations, such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have gone on the record publicly to explain that there is no reduction in volunteering. About one fifth of all CRB checks are done on volunteers. There is no evidence of a massive reduction in volunteering. We are a nation of volunteers, and it is not having a negative impact. I will talk about portability and its effect in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para2"><a name="10012065000061">On the Independent Safeguarding Authority, the regulations do not apply to private and family arrangements or ad hoc arrangements. Anything more frequent than once a week would be seen as a regular arrangement. For example, someone who goes to a school to read to pupils under supervision would not be required to register with the ISA or undergo a CRB check. I have gone to make paper flowers with my daughter's Brownie group. The Brown Owl was present at all times, so I did not require a CRB check, although I have had one for the Scouts, as I attended a residential event in my spare time. There are different circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para3"><a name="10012065000062">I am a mother, and I see the practical reality of why this works. I am not a vulnerable adult, but I want to know that when my children are out of my care and in the hands of professional strangers, those strangers are vetted and cleared to be safe with my children. Arrangements for care that I make with my neighbours, family and friends are a matter for me personally, and it is right that the state draws a line in the sand at that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para4"><a name="10012065000063">The hon. Gentleman raised many issues, and in the seven minutes remaining I will canter through them. The number of job offers withdrawn as a result of disclosure is only 0.5 per cent. of the 4.4 million per annum. An Ipsos MORI report from 2008 showed clearly that the primary reason for withdrawal of job offers is that details of the individual's previous convictions are on the form, which applied in 71 per cent. of cases. That could be an unspent conviction, or one that was relevant to the job in hand. Only 20 per cent. of those job offers were withdrawn due to the police force information released as part of the CRB check. That included cautions and non-conviction information, and involved only about one in five of that small number. Only 4 per cent. of that small number-about 0.5 per cent. of the total-were withdrawn due to police information released in a separate letter. That pertains to the example given by the hon. Gentleman about his constituent. A very small number of people are in the same situation as his constituent. That does not mean that we do not take the matter seriously, but it is  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

important to safeguard children, and we must recognise that there are consequences from an arrangement such as this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para5"><a name="10012065000064">I can give examples of disclosure information that has been revealed to employers, but not led to withdrawal of a job offer. Information released to provide clarity involving a rape conviction-rape is a serious crime, and none of us would treat that lightly-may show the ages and relationship of the victim and offender, and may inform a decision. If an 18-year-old boy and a 15 year-old-girl were in a consensual long-term relationship, a different light would be cast on that, and there have been examples of employers taking on someone with a conviction or allegation of rape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para6"><a name="10012065000065">In one example involving the mental health of an applicant, an individual had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983, and the police had been called to an incident. The information states that the individual was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and that individual was employed. There may be information about drug treatment programmes and so on that an applicant attended as part of a disposal of sentence. That has not prevented people from entering employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para7"><a name="10012065000066">The key point is that the final and most important decision is made by the recruiting body. The CRB check plays a role, but the Government do not provide a gold-plated guarantee. That is not the role of the CRB. We can do more cross-party-the Government need to do more, as do all of us-to ensure that we recognise and challenge CRB checks if they are made inappropriately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para8"><a name="10012065000067">I have little time left, and I want to canter around the issue of delays. There have been perceived problems, but the service standards are good. Most cases of enhanced checks-87.7 per cent.-will be issued in 28 days. The time they take varies, because sometimes an employer or registered body that processes applications may hold on to the application form. I sometimes receive letters complaining about a delay and it turns out that the employer has held on to the form for perhaps six weeks or more, which has caused a delay in getting it to the CRB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para9"><a name="10012065000068">Sometimes the form is not as accurate as it could be, which is why we have reduced the number of bodies that are able to process them. We had evidence to show that those who did not deal with them regularly were less accurate. Having fewer, better trained registered bodies dealing with higher volumes means that they are better at the job, and that has helped. Clarity of information provided may be an issue that we must go back to and check, so getting it right first time is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para10"><a name="10012065000069">The key issue is whether there is conviction or non-conviction information. The deal is that police forces where someone has been living for the past five years must make a check. For many people the return is nil and the check is done quickly. When the CRB has information, it can be turned round quickly, but so far only six forces and the Metropolitan police are involved. There is an issue concerning the operational effectiveness of police disclosure units, and that may be because they are small in number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para11"><a name="10012065000070">Work is being done, and I shall not go into it in more detail, but I would welcome hon. Members visiting a disclosure unit. The Metropolitan police are only down the road from Parliament and would be happy to host hon. Members, and I am sure their local police forces  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

would do so. The Metropolitan police are particularly useful because the unit is large and it can be seen how minutely they look at non-conviction data. Such a visit would be helpful, and I would be happy to arrange it for the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para12"><a name="10012065000071">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of complaints. Complaints about disclosures amount to 0.18 per cent.-just less than 0.2 per cent.-of the total number of disclosures issued. We take any complaint seriously, but most in the public service would think that a pretty good standard. As I said, customer satisfaction is very high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para13"><a name="10012065000072">The role undertaken by police forces goes to the heart of safeguarding.</p>

 I will move on to multiple checks. I just wanted to say that the police take this seriously and that I would welcome the hon. Gentleman's visit to the disclosure unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para14"><a name="10012065000075">On portability, there appears to be a common misconception that CRB checks cannot be taken elsewhere. CRB checks that have been done elsewhere can be accepted, but if the job it was done for was very different, the information released might be different. It is for the employer to decide. If a check is very old, it might be out of date. If a check is a few weeks old, another one might not be required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para15"><a name="10012065000076">It might be that people are over-asking for checks. I have met organisations that say it is their standard policy to ask for checks. They do not need to do so, but should look at each case individually. They should be prepared to take that risk-balance judgment in a sensible way. Broadly, for a similar job in a similar time frame, the check is portable. We are looking to make it a continuous, updating process. That is under way at the moment with the CRB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para16"><a name="10012065000077">The CRB cannot endorse the use of portability due to the risks involved. It must let the employer make the judgment. The CRB used to make the decision, but it is not appropriate for that to be done centrally. It must be done at the local level, where the employer has a relationship with the employee or potential employee, access to their referees and all the other information involved in a normal recruitment process. An organisation will have to consider the additional information that was released.</p>

 I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Evans. I think this is the first debate I have attended that you have chaired and I look forward to your guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para17"><a name="10012065000080">I do not know whether the Cadbury announcement makes this an opportune moment to raise these issues. There has been a lot of concern in the west midlands over the Kraft takeover of Cadbury. Kraft does not have a good reputation for retaining employees, or on plant closures. Perhaps when the Minister gets here he could consider putting pressure on Cadbury to at least meet representatives of the labour force. Just before Christmas, I met the trade unions along with a number of other west midlands MPs. They were having great difficulty getting information regarding the takeover bid. Perhaps he could arrange with Kraft the start of discussions with the trade unions. They certainly have concerns about jobs and plant closures and they need reassurance. I hope he can do something to get those discussions going.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para18"><a name="10012065000081">In initiating this debate, I knew that the Government had been working hard to deal with the west midlands economy. This is not an attempt to denigrate the Government's attempts to help the west midlands economy. I am sure the Minister knows that despite the Government assistance, the west midlands, which I have always said is the powerhouse of the British economy, has been struggling over the past few years. The recession has affected the west midlands more seriously than any other region because it is a manufacturing area and an innovative area. It has a great reputation for the production of skills and contains a number of great universities. Nevertheless, in the west midlands, manufacturing is allied to trade. When world trade goes down, manufacturing in the midlands is a victim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para19"><a name="10012065000082">Running alongside that, the west midlands probably has the highest unemployment rate in the UK at approximately 10 per cent, and we are obviously concerned about that. The area also has the fastest rate of job-shedding in the UK, and there are 12 per cent. less jobs in manufacturing compared with 2008. Employment is not predicted to return to 2008 levels until 2015. The 18 to 20-year-old age group has seen the largest rise in unemployment, to 32.2 per cent., and the area has the worst performance of all regions in terms of business activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para20"><a name="10012065000083">The Minister will know that in recent years we have had the cases of MG Rover and Peugeot; there is the looming closure of one of the Jaguar Land Rover plants, and there is a lot of discussion about that. However, there is some good news regarding Jaguar, as it has said it has a 10-year programme for the midlands. That is good news given all the uncertainties. Recently, Ericsson decided to pull out of Coventry, despite the fact that the Government are still in discussions with it to see whether they can persuade it to stay. We must pay tribute to the Government for that, and my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) has played a major part in those discussions. We hoped that he would be here today, but he has obviously been held up. I pay tribute to him for his efforts, along with those of Ministers and trade unions, to see whether Ericsson could be persuaded to stay in the west midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para21"><a name="10012065000084">The decline of manufacture is nationwide and not only in the west midlands, although that area has borne the brunt. To be fair, there has been a lot of diversification in the west midlands over the last 20 years, which has been an important element. As I have indicated, car manufacturing has declined in the past, and only recently Aston Martin announced the cutting of 300 full-time jobs and 200 temporary jobs at the Gaydon plant as a result of falling sales figures. However, the good thing is that Aston Martin is stopping in the midlands, and we could get growth in that area in the future. It is not necessarily all doom and gloom, although it is for those employees who are affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para22"><a name="10012065000085">Anyone who has gone through unemployment-and I have-knows what it is like to be unemployed. People lose their dignity and worry about their family, and that can create family situations that are not very pleasant to say the least. The husband and wife are constantly under pressure and worried about their children and their mortgage. Those are some of the effects of unemployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para23"><a name="10012065000086">Although, as I said, Jaguar Land Rover has given us a lot of good news, it had an extended Christmas closure in one of its west midlands plants. There is a lot of bad feeling about what happened with Peugeot and the way that "consultation" was carried out in Coventry. It was arbitrary; there was no consultation at all. Trade unions feel that many continental manufacturers treat their employees differently from the way British employees are treated. In other words, British employees feel that they do not have the same protection as their colleagues on the continent. That has been a concern for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para24"><a name="10012065000087">We must also take globalisation into consideration. Despite the Government giving companies tax credits, work still goes abroad. It is difficult to prevent that work from going abroad because of what is called outsourcing. The regional development agency in the west midlands has invested a considerable amount of money to mitigate the recession in the area, and it has also given Ericsson money. As I said earlier, we are still trying to prevent that closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para25"><a name="10012065000088">The work goes, of course, to economies and countries where the costs are lower. The British worker is competing against employees abroad who are working for far less-in China or Singapore, for example. Recently, we have had the case of Kraft, and as I said, workers in the UK feel that they are not getting the necessary protection. That cannot be said too often. With every closure, workers have been kept in the dark. France and Germany have used short-time working subsidies to protect manufacturing jobs. Those countries have a massive trade surplus, and we have a deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para26"><a name="10012065000089">We must accept that the construction industry has gone through a bad time, but we recognise none the less that the Government have a number of schemes to kick-start the construction industry. We need affordable houses in this country, but we will not get them by building on green areas such as Kings Hill on the outskirts of Coventry, where the green belt is in jeopardy. The area is environmentally valuable. Residents in the area are not saying that we should not have new houses in Coventry; they are saying that there is capacity for about 25,000 houses on Coventry's brown belt, so there  <br>

is no real need to bring Kings Hill into the equation. The matter has gone to a planning appeal. We do not know the outcome, as it is being reviewed, but I wanted to highlight it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para27"><a name="10012065000090">I understand that any eco-housing proposals for Coventry would have to be agreed by Coventry city council. In other words, a voluntary scheme has been proposed for Coventry, as it has throughout the country. It will not be imposed on anybody. If Coventry does not want it, we will not get it. That is what I understand from the Minister for Housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para28"><a name="10012065000091">We need to do more to retain skills in the west midlands in the UK. We will need them whenever the economy starts to take off. In past economic downturns, we have often found that we lack skills when the upturn comes, which can create many problems for small and large businesses. We also need a strong science base. Coventry, with its two universities, has a lot to offer in that respect. Other universities in the west midlands-I am not too familiar with them-are probably in the same position. A lot of innovation and effort have gone on in the west midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para29"><a name="10012065000092">Coventry has a skilled work force, but 20 per cent. of people aged 20 to 24 have a national vocational qualification of level 1 or below. They are the most likely to be unemployed. I know that the Government are considering what can be done to get such groups into employment. As I said, I welcome Jaguar Land Rover's 10-year plan. Not only has it created 100 jobs; those jobs are graduate jobs, which shows that Jaguar Land Rover is taking remaining in Coventry seriously. What happens after the 10-year programme? We will deal with that as we go along.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para30"><a name="10012065000093">Advantage West Midlands is running a graduate internship scheme. There is also a national internship scheme. We must congratulate the Government on launching new initiatives to create new apprenticeship schemes, and we should support them as much as we can. In the past, apprenticeships have been neglected. They were certainly neglected by the previous Government. I remember that Rolls-Royce got rid of its apprentice schemes many years ago. I am glad to see that the schemes are coming back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para31"><a name="10012065000094">We had discussions with Rolls-Royce this morning about its future in this country, which looks positive despite the recession. The company has a number of interesting ideas about developing new plants. Ansty in Coventry will be one of the plants to be developed. It gives us a lot of heart to know that Rolls-Royce is planning to stop in Coventry for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para32"><a name="10012065000095">When we look on the positive side, we must give a bit more credit to Advantage West Midlands, which created Ansty technology park on a new site. We have had a setback with Ericsson, but when the upturn comes, as I am sure it will, Coventry will be in a good position for that area to take off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="100120h0011.htm_para33"><a name="10012065000096">We have had problems at Coventry airport, but whatever people think about that airport, the fact remains that many small businesses are on that site. Because of the structure of the lease, they have to negotiate with the airport company, which is in liquidation, so there is concern about the jobs and businesses on the site. I am told that Coventry city council is negotiating with two partners; I do not know who they are. It seems to be quite positive about the fact that it can save that site and possibly the airport.</p>

<notus-date day="20" month="1" year="2010" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>20 Jan 2010 : Column 139WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para0"><a name="10012065000097">My concern is not necessarily about the airport itself, but about the consequences if the airport expands. Because there is no infrastructure, expansion would create major problems in the area, and I have always been suspicious that it would be a substitute for Rugby. Nevertheless, whatever I think about the airport, there are many small businesses there and they depend on that site. There is a lot of concern about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para1"><a name="10012065000098">We went through a period of post office closures in Coventry; everybody has been through that. We welcome the fact that the Government have invested £150 million per annum to support the Post Office. The fact remains that the Government certainly did not pursue their proposal on privatisation, and we do not know what will happen in the future. The Opposition certainly want to privatise the Post Office. That could have consequences, but nobody ever voted for post office closures in the House, as far as I can remember.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para2"><a name="10012065000099">Nevertheless, many positive things are going on in the Coventry area, as I have said. Not only in the Coventry area but nationally there is empty property relief, for which many small businesses campaigned for many years. I know that the Minister will want to give me a detailed response, but I have a few more points to make before I finish. It is heartening that Rolls-Royce has been awarded a £258 million contract to build engines for Royal Navy sea helicopters, some of which will certainly go to Ansty. We should consider some of the other things that the Government have done. The car scrappage scheme has been a major success, with about 15,000 transactions in the west midlands alone. I therefore welcome the scheme and the fact that the Government will extend it, as that is a positive measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para3"><a name="10012065000100">Let us consider the green economy. Lots of exciting work is going on in low-carbon technology, particularly in the Coventry area. E.ON is working in partnership with a Coventry company-Advanced LEDs-to develop a low-carbon LED streetlight, known as Marlin, providing local authorities with low-carbon and energy-efficient streetlights. Another good aspect is that Remploy, which has struggled to survive for many years, will play a major part in the production and shipping of the lights. Again, there are lots of positives about what is happening in Coventry and other parts of the west midlands. In fact, some of the technology to which I have just referred will be used not only in Coventry but in Rutland and, later this month, possibly Blackpool. Such innovation needs to be promoted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para4"><a name="10012065000101">The CABLED-Coventry and Birmingham low emission demonstrators-project is an electric car trial in the west midlands run by E.ON. It, too, has been awarded Government funding from the ultra low carbon vehicles demonstrator competition, and is a trial of 110 electric vehicles with ordinary drivers in Coventry and Birmingham, with 25 cars being tried out in Coventry. The idea is to study how practical and efficient those vehicles are. Charging points will be installed in Coventry in a mix of car parks and kerbsides. That will no doubt generate quite a bit of debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para5"><a name="10012065000102">We need to encourage such innovation and keep the results in the west midlands-we need to ensure that nobody tries to pinch the patents, use them abroad, then export things back to this country. Other investment is going on. Regional bodies such as Advantage West Midlands contributed regeneration funds of £296 million from 2006 to 2009. I end by saying that it is very  <br>

important that the Minister unlocks the banks, as it were, particularly to give support for small businesses in the west midlands and nationally. Unless that is done, we in the west midlands will face major problems. Again, it is the small businesses that suffer the brunt of decisions taken by companies such as Ericsson. It is vital to get that money to them as soon as possible.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) on securing this important debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para6"><a name="10012067000002">My hon. Friend is an excellent constituency MP. He has made it his business, in a lifetime of public service, to ensure that the challenges and opportunities that face the local economy are at the top of everyone's agenda in Coventry and the west midlands. I do not know whether it is widely known that he left Scotland in 1959 and travelled south in search of work. He wanted to go to America, but his parents would not let him. America's loss was Coventry's gain. Since arriving in Coventry, he has-first as a worker at Rolls-Royce, then as a trade union leader in the city, a councillor, and leader of the city council, and now as an MP-always fought unstintingly for more jobs and greater prosperity for people in his area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para7"><a name="10012067000003">My hon. Friend is right to say, as he did today, that the west midlands has been hit hard by the recession. We have been hard hit, like every other region. However, some areas have been hit harder, not as a result of mistakes or decisions made over the past few years, but because of mistakes made over the past 40 years, with the accompanying structural weaknesses in skills, transport, trade, and levels of innovation in the regional economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para8"><a name="10012067000004">The structural weaknesses of the past four decades mean that, on a like-for-like basis, output in the west midlands has lagged behind the national average since 1976. That is why the economy in our area has been hit harder than that in some other areas. However, the good news is that today's figures show that unemployment in the west midlands fell by 20,000 over the last quarter-the second-highest fall in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para9"><a name="10012067000005">Every job lost during the recession is a tragedy for the families affected. Nobody can promise-no one would believe us if we did promise-to protect every job and save every company, but we must be able to say to those who lose their jobs that the Government are on their side. We will step in with more help, and more support with training and so on, to help people back into work as soon as possible. That has been our approach in the region over the past 18 months or so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para10"><a name="10012067000006">Our No. 1 priority has been to help the region's businesses through the downturn and get the region focused on modernising our economy. Ours was the first region to establish a taskforce to bring all public-sector partners together with the business community, trade unions, local authorities and universities, so that we could co-ordinate the region's response to the downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para11"><a name="10012067000007">My hon. Friend spoke about Ericsson. Like him, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), for the work that he is doing on the issue. I am pleased to say that a similar approach to that which my hon. Friend the Member for  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="20 Jan 2010">

Coventry, South, spoke about is now being taken in Coventry by the Ericsson partnership to address the redundancies. I thank and pay tribute to him for the support that he has given to that partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para12"><a name="10012067000008">By working together, ours was the first region to extend lending to businesses, saving thousands of jobs through the regional loan fund. Ours was the only region able to extend funding to businesses in that way. We brought banks and businesses together, as my hon. Friend asked us to do, to try to get lending moving again. As a result, 680 businesses have been offered loans worth almost £70 million through the enterprise finance guarantee scheme. In Coventry, 22 companies have been offered loans totalling almost £3 million. Ours was the first region to launch a regional housing action plan to keep the construction industry moving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para13"><a name="10012067000009">As my hon. Friend said, our region has benefited from additional Government investment-£1.5 billion extra-to keep the housing industry moving and to save jobs in the construction trade with a number of new schemes, including the kick-start scheme and the local authority new-build scheme. They have all provided much-needed new homes for people in the west midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para14"><a name="10012067000010">Ours was the first region to launch a programme of subsidised jobs, training places and low-cost university courses for graduates struggling to find work last summer. That initiative is now being copied by other regions and extended by the Government nationally. Since November 2008, the Jobcentre Plus rapid response service and the Learning and Skills Council have worked with 700 employers to help more than 54,000 employees at risk of redundancy try to ensure that their jobs are not lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para15"><a name="10012067000011">Bids for support from the future jobs fund will create almost 10,000 jobs in the west midlands, 500 of which will be in the Coventry area. That is the second highest number of any region in the country, which means that I am delivering on my pledge to ensure that the west midlands gets more than its fair share of available resources.We have accelerated spending on major public-sector infrastructure projects, such as Coventry's new deal for communities, to ensure that new investment can go ahead and new homes can be created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para16"><a name="10012067000012">My hon. Friend talked at great length about the car industry, using his expertise and knowledge. He lobbied hard for the introduction of the car scrappage scheme, so he will be pleased to hear that it has generated more than 240,000 orders already, and has helped many component companies in the west midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para17"><a name="10012067000013">Through the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, we are providing £30 million over the next three years to support the low-carbon vehicles plan from the new automotive innovation and growth team. There are also encouraging signs that Coventry is well placed for recovery because of the work that people in the region have done to modernise the sub-regional economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para18"><a name="10012067000014">At a national level, a whole range of measures will assist businesses in Coventry. For example, the pre-Budget report extended the enterprise finance guarantee scheme for a further 12 months. That will hopefully address the access-to-finance problems that my hon. Friend highlighted this afternoon. "Going for Growth: Our Future Prosperity"  <br>

builds on the strategic approach set out last year in the policy document, "Building Britain's Future-New Industry, New Jobs".</p>

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="10012067000015"><a name="100120h0012.htm_spnew0"><a name="10012067000027"><b>Mr. Jim Cunningham:</b>
 One of the things that the Minister might consider, and which would be helpful to Coventry and have a knock-on effect in the midlands, is the NUCKLE-Nuneaton, Coventry, Kenilworth and Leamington-project, or Ricoh Arena project. The business plans have still to be submitted, but could the Minister keep his eye on the project? There is a fear that with a looming general election, that project will be shunted away somewhere and never see the light of day, but it is vital to the people in Coventry.</p>

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="10012067000016"><a name="100120h0012.htm_spnew1"><a name="10012067000028"><b>Mr. Austin:</b>
 I know how hard my hon. Friend has worked to build support and lobby for the NUCKLE project over the past few years, and he is right to identify it. As I understand it, we are still waiting for the business plan. As a result of his question this afternoon and the lobbying that he has done, I will ask for the scheme to be considered. We will go to the partners to ask for the project to be accelerated as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para19"><a name="10012067000017">On the new industries and new jobs agenda, we are considering how we can turn opportunities in the digital media, and in low-carbon, high-tech manufacturing, into jobs and business opportunities in the west midlands. Late last year, I announced four working groups in the region to see how we can exploit the new industries and ensure that the west midlands does not lose out on investment opportunities in the future. I have asked Advantage West Midlands, through the taskforce that I established, to set up four working groups that bring together representatives from private industry and the universities to look at opportunities for the west midlands in those specific areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para20"><a name="10012067000018">First, there will be a new low-carbon group chaired by Julia King from Aston university. Members will include Ministers from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Secondly, we will have a digital creative industries group, which will be chaired by Jonnie Turpie from Maverick TV. The Minister with responsibility for creative industries has agreed to join that team. Thirdly, we will have a health-care technologies group, chaired by David Gleaves of MidTECH. I have asked the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), to play a part in that, as we work out how to bring the jobs and the new medical developments to the west midlands.</p>
<a name="10012067000023">
<p>Finally, an advanced manufacturing group will be led by Harry Reilly of Brintons Carpets and my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho). Mr. Reilly also chairs Beacon Manufacturing Group, which is planning how we can lead the way in new manufacturing technologies, just as we did in the past-something that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South, mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="100120h0012.htm_para21"><a name="10012067000019">There are opportunities that Coventry can benefit from. We are supporting and encouraging innovation and investment-based projects in Coventry through AWM. For example, £4 million has gone to the Serious Games Institute at Coventry university, which has helped the west midlands become a leader in digital media. There was an investment of £6.4 million in the Rugby Power academy to meet the demands of the new low-carbon  <br>

There has been an investment of £77 million in the Birmingham-Warwick research alliance, through Birmingham science city, for the areas of energy, advanced materials and translational medicine.
