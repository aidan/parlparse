 Although I am glad to have this important opportunity to discuss the rural economy as it faces the dreadful recession that our nation is collectively facing, the title of the debate is, to some limited degree, misleading in the sense that I am not sure that an absolutely clear, easily definable difference can be spotted between the rural economy and the urban economy, so, to some degree, it is a slightly false dichotomy and even risks being, in a way, patronising to our rural communities. It seems to indicate that the rural economy is all about farming, food production, tourism and rural crafts&#151;that kind of thing&#151;whereas by far the largest part of employment in the countryside today is manufacturing. Therefore, to a significant degree, the rural and urban economies are similar. I will come back to the stricter part of the rural economy in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90324h0001.htm_para2"><a name="09032425000012">Without being unduly constituency-minded, I thought I might use some examples from North Wiltshire, which is predominantly rural in terms of acreage&#151;although most of the people tend to live in market towns and villages&#151;to show how the national recession is affecting rural areas. North Wiltshire is not as rural as some parts of Cornwall or other parts of the west country, or other parts of England; none the less it counts as a rural or semi-rural constituency. Therefore our experience in North Wiltshire may be indicative of the kind of thing that is happening elsewhere.</p>

Who knows what the future of Honda is? It is astonishing to see the biggest employer in Swindon&#151;Honda&#151;shut down entirely. No cars are being produced at all until May. Many of the people in my constituency who work there are concerned about what will happen after May. Will we see an improvement?</p>

and going to Indonesia, saying that it was impossible to manufacture vacuum cleaners in a rural area such as mine and preferring Indonesia instead. The net result of all that is that, between June last year and January the number of jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants in Wiltshire jumped from just under 3,000 to just over 5,000. In six months that figure has nearly, but not quite, doubled and is showing every sign of growing further in the months to come.</p>

Whether rural or urban, those businesses are symptomatic of what is happening elsewhere in the economy, both in towns and in the countryside.</p>

 My hon. Friend will be aware that even London constituencies have rural parts. Upminster, for example, is 50 per cent. green belt and has farms on its border, where it has a boundary with rural Essex.

 My hon. Friend is right. The difference between rural and urban is often blurred, as it is in her constituency. I am glad that, as she inspired me to ask for this debate this morning, she has taken the trouble to come along and contribute to it. I hope that the decimation of the businesses in her constituency is less bad than she is predicting at the moment.</p>

Some 22 per cent. of firms surveyed in Cumbria have reduced staffing levels and 11 per cent. have made redundancies. The number of people applying for the JSA in Craven has increased by 66 per cent. In the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), the shadow Foreign Secretary, which is probably one of the most prosperous, leafy areas in England and which has one of the largest Conservative majorities of any constituency, the number applying for the JSA has increased by 67 per cent.&#151;just look at the increased unemployment in the most leafy part of England.</p>

He says that there has been a 106 per cent. increase in redundancies in rural areas compared with 57 per cent. in urban areas. Of course, in rural areas the sparser employment patterns mean that job losses are felt even more keenly. In a village with a small number of jobs a relatively small number of redundancies feels like an enormous number compared with an urban area where even a large number might disappear into the background, as it were.</p>

The Minister is shaking her head, so I hope that she will not say that. However, there are people who would say that farming is doing remarkably well. By comparison with the last 10 desperate years, farming is slightly better than it was. Nevertheless, the Minister should remember that input prices mean that arable profitability is now looking shaky, that milk is some 8 per cent. down from its high last year and that the average hill farmer&#146;s income is &#163;15,000, which is less than the Government&#146;s official threshold for poverty&#151;so they are below the Government&#146;s poverty level. Lowland farmers are at about &#163;20,000 profitability, which is only just above the Government&#146;s poverty level. So farming may be off its low point, but it is by no means profitable.</p>

It is all in the mind and there is no reason to do that, but I am doing it. Lidl and Aldi are reporting booming profits and are doing incredibly well, but they mainly buy their food from overseas.

 I expect that my hon.

Does he agree that one way around that might be to improve labelling so that people at least have the choice to buy British pork, which is reared to extremely high welfare standards, because at the moment that are unable to do so as they do not know what they are buying?</p>

 My hon. Friend and parliamentary neighbour makes a good point. He could easily have quoted from the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs inquiry into the pig industry, which, among other things, concluded that it is simply absurd that pork sausages, for example, can be labelled &#147;Made in Britain&#148;, when in fact they come entirely from Danish pigs. He makes a good point. The situation that he mentions will make farming ever worse. We are merely exporting our high standards of animal welfare elsewhere.

 The Minister is right. I last shopped at Aldi last Saturday. There is a good new Aldi, and also a Lidl, in Melksham, which is in the constituency of my parliamentary neighbour, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), 2 miles from my house. My other half religiously sends me to Aldi and Lidl in Melksham, despite not having a reason to do so because we could happily afford to go to Waitrose, and should be going to the local farm shops. I shall tell her that when I next speak to her, because we have three or four local farm shops, and we should pay that little extra to support local farmers. Lidl in Melksham will not see me coming through its door as a result of this debate, so I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s intervention on that front.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90324h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000028">What about the other great urban myth that prosperous rural people live in quiet, prosperous, comfortable market towns? The Commission for Rural Communities&#151;bless it&#151;says that unemployment in market towns is higher than ever before and that the recession is taking a stronger grip there than elsewhere. <i>The Daily </i><i>Telegraph</i> recently reported that one in six high street shops will be empty by the end of 2009, and that &#147;retail deserts&#148; are a real risk in most of our semi-urban, semi-rural constituencies. Ofcom recently announced that 15 per cent. of households in the country&#151;the vast bulk of them being in rural areas&#151;have no access to broadband. My constituency office cannot have broadband, which makes it difficult to operate, and small businesses, which are the backbone and the life blood of our rural areas, depend on broadband, and if they cannot have it, they cannot compete with bigger, urban-based businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90324h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000029">Compounding all that is the historic inequality of rural areas&#146; access to essential services of all sorts. In rural areas, 1.6 million people live below the poverty line. The image is of rich people living in the leafy countryside, but 1.6 million of them live in poverty, much of it grinding poverty. Many of them have no car, and they live in terrible conditions and are extremely poor, but because of the image of leafy, green and pleasant countryside the presumption is that areas such as mine are prosperous. That is simply not true. Stuart Burgess described rural poverty as</p>
<a name="90324h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09032425000440"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a forgotten city of disadvantage&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="90324h0001.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000030">Rural poverty and our &#147;retail deserts&#148; are made much worse by the loss of local services such as surgeries, post offices, pubs, village shops, village halls, churches and public transport. All are progressively disappearing from our villages, which makes the poor who live there even more disadvantaged because they rely on those essential services, and the Government have done nothing to support them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90324h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000031">One in 13 rural primary schools has closed since Labour came to power. Only about half of rural households are within 2.5 miles of an NHS dentist or jobcentre, and this year the Government have closed down 20 per cent. more jobcentres, most of them in rural areas such as mine. There is a chronic shortage of affordable rural housing. Not only that, local government in rural areas is among the worst-funded in Britain. Wiltshire receives the lowest revenue support grant of any local authority in England, with the net result that it is difficult to break even on its budgets.</p>

Rural areas and rural dwellers are facing just as much of an economic disaster, and perhaps a greater one, as urban ones, but our local economy and services are less well poised to survive it.

I feel strongly that we caricature the rural economy in that way to our cost. We also too often fall into the trap of believing that there is one rural economy and that we can have policies that embrace that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000050">That is one reason why some of us were never happy about having any form of Ministry of rural affairs. It tends to make people believe that they can pull levers, but as the Select Committee has found time after time with our inquiries, DEFRA is unable to pull those levers in the rural economy, because so many of them are with&#151;dare I say it?&#151;higher-order Departments such as the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department of Health and the Department for Transport. Nevertheless, DEFRA can have an influence, and one of the good things that it has introduced is the idea of rural-proofing to see how wider policies are playing a part in the rural economy. That has become part of our lexicon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para2"><a name="09032425000051">The second point of inquiry was to consider the potential for economic growth. Again, I am a wee bit disappointed that although the hon. Member for North Wiltshire quoted Stuart Burgess on a number of occasions, he did not refer to what Stuart Burgess said on that issue. He came up with astounding figures when he said that the unlocked potential of the rural economy is worth between &#163;236 billion and &#163;347 billion. All parties need to consider that as their starting point. One problem is that we are not considering how development can be a keynote element in what we talk about and do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000052">My area is suffering because, again, there is a misunderstanding of the Strouds of this world. My area has a higher percentage of people employed in manufacturing than the national average and it is higher than anywhere else in Gloucestershire. At the moment, a number of the bigger firms face difficulties, which has a knock-on effect on the smaller firms. That said, one of the strange elements for someone such as me, who calls continually for a local supply chain, is that not having as much of a local supply chain as we want has meant that there has not been as great an impact on some of those smaller firms as I had feared. However, we do need to find ways to forestall some of the worst impacts of the recession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000053">Like other hon. Members, I am involved every week in negotiations to try to protect jobs&#151;principally to secure training opportunities in two of the larger companies in my area, Renishaw and Delphi. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will take this point away, although of course it is not her responsibility: we need to ensure that we get wage compensation into the automotive industry, so that we can give value to that training. I and a number of other hon. Members are calling for that.</p>

That can only be a good thing at the moment, because that  <br>

money is going into the rural economy. The Committee&#146;s current inquiry is on food security. Without wishing to prejudge it in any way, I think that the future must be in our growing more of our own food. That means more farmers and more land. Although I could argue with the Government about the set-aside rules at the moment, perhaps we need to move on and consider the opportunities to which I have just referred, because that will help our rural economy and it really concentrates our minds on what opportunities there are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09032425000055">There are other impacts on the rural economy. I think that the Government have a good record on protection of public services&#151;bar the Post Office, which I shall deal with separately. In my area, we have blocked the closures of village schools, other than in one case, in which there was an amalgamation. In other parts of Gloucestershire there have been closures, but that is because there are, in effect, no young people living in those villages any more. All parties have to face up to the fact that there has been rural depopulation. There has not necessarily been a huge movement of people away, but there has been a change in terms of social class&#151;we know about the cost of living and the cost of housing in those areas&#151;and we have also seen the ageing of the countryside. That is having an enormous impact, and the more rural and peripheral the areas, the greater the impact has been. We must do something to overcome that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para7"><a name="09032425000056">When Labour came to power in 1997, some of us set up the Back-Bench group of rural Labour MPs and we did a rural audit. I think that that document has stood the test of time. I pay tribute to Peter Bradley, who was the chair. He is sadly no longer with us. We found that the overwhelming issue in rural Britain at that time was access to good public transport. Lack of such access was the reason why people either could not or did not live there. When we examined the issue again, housing had clearly moved way up the agenda. I suspect that at the moment the issue of jobs would be paramount in most people&#146;s minds. Again, we have to turn that into an opportunity, rather than just seeing it as a threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09032425000057">As the rural advocate, rural tsar or whatever we want to call Stuart Burgess has been saying, there is clearly untapped potential in the rural economy. That has as much to do with jobs as anything else. We must recognise that we have to create jobs in rural Britain, and that we can do so. If we do that, we have to have people who can live in rural Britain, and we have to have reasonable transport so that people can move about there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000058">The Government, with their rural transport grants and some of the things that they have done on health and a rural policy domain, have done well. The issue of the Post Office, however, is a running sore. I believe that the closures were often unnecessary and hurried and could have been dealt with in other ways. I have to say that dealing with Post Office Ltd or Royal Mail is part of the problem because they seem to have a death wish in terms of the services. I am pleased that at long last&#151;through ideas such as the post bank and offering postal services, rather than the complete panoply of things that one would expect in a post office&#151;we are beginning to move on and see how a flexible approach can begin to lock those services in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000059">Let us move on to the private sector. The situation is in a sense gloomier there, partly because of the current state of the economy, but more than anything because  <br>

of the way in which many of our villages have changed in terms of social stratification. We have seen the closure of shops and pubs, and we have seen other services dependent on them suffer. We could argue all day about the causes of that. I am pleased to see the work being done by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland). With the help of some of us, he has just made a submission regarding the Select Committee on Business and Enterprise inquiry into the future of pubs. That looks at, very straightforwardly, the role of pubcos&#151;pub companies&#151;which I think has been largely negative, and the way in which they have encouraged the closure of many pubs. The impact on shops has a lot to do with the lack of a market threshold and people not buying in their local shop. That is causing immense problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000060">That brings me to where I see many of the answers. We need social enterprise because that is the way to keep services open. I have three voluntary shops in my constituency, and I am likely to get two more. The three existing shops are at North Nibley, Cowley and Whiteshill. Another is operating as a pseudo-social enterprise at Chalford, and I hope that a further shop will shortly open in Horsley. All of that has come about because of the will-power of the local population, with some help from outside. That is the way we need to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000061">I want to link that to another issue. I pay tribute to two academic colleagues from the university of Gloucestershire, Nigel Curry and Stephen Owen, and to Kate Braithwaite from the Carnegie Institute, who have taught me what really goes on in rural areas. I want to advertise their work and I encourage the Minister to look at it, because there are some very interesting ideas about how we can provide, protect and improve services in rural Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000062">The other issue that I want to link to is asset-based rural community development, which uses the property base in rural communities. Like other hon. Members, I have argued strongly that some buildings are underused&#151;the church is an obvious one, and there are also the village halls. We need to look at that asset base and do some interesting things with it. That is crucial at this time in the recession. That asset base gives us an opportunity, and that is where the state can help centrally. Innovative grants and support in the form of advice and encouragement are long overdue. That is where we need to go. We need to learn the lessons from what has gone wrong. Too often, the rural economy is seen as an anchor that pulls things back, but it can be a driver. There are opportunities, and I want us to act on them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000063">The key areas of housing, transport and jobs keep coming back, and we need to act on those and act quickly.</p>

 I hesitate to prolong the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech, but I am slightly puzzled.

some, but as far as I know, their only point of policy is to reintroduce hunting, which rural Britain needs like a hole in the head. I will take lectures from no one about who is doing things in the rural economy, because there is a vacuousness in the official Opposition&#146;s approach, which is depressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000066">To conclude, I am looking for the Government to recognise that the rural economy manifests the same problems as the wider economy. However, there are real opportunities at the moment, and we must not lose them in all the wider talk. We have problems with manufacturing that need to be addressed, but we also need to look at other issues, which come down to the usual things: providing leadership; recognising that there are no one-size-fits-all policies&#151;policies need to evolve from the bottom up; concentrating on co-operation and on building a consensus; and making sure that we put resources in. That will not sort the recession out this time, but it will pay dividends in the long run when people are encouraged to live and work in rural areas and to deal with some of the problems there, including the ageing of the population, which causes huge problems in terms of care provision. That is what I hope DEFRA will do.</p>

 I would not have intervened had it not been for the fact that the hon. Gentleman was clearly not listening to my contribution, in which I laid out precisely what we would do. Is he seriously saying, however, that the two or three things that he mentioned&#151;providing leadership, working from the bottom up and social enterprise&#151;will help? The debate is about the effect of the recession on the rural economy. We are talking about tens of thousands of people across Britain losing their jobs and businesses going bankrupt right, left and centre. Does he seriously think that the two or three very laudable little enterprises that he mentioned will make a blind bit of difference to the recession in general?</p>

I am glad that we have had a difference of opinion. Normally I work on a consensual basis, but if the official Opposition want to say that they feel they can wave a magic wand at the issue, that is up to them.

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09032425000071">I should say at the start that there is rurality and rurality&#151;the hon. Gentleman alluded to that&#151;and there are differences in the communities that we represent. We have heard about the farms on the periphery of Upminster and we have heard from Wiltshire and Gloucestershire. However, I represent a very rural, sparsely populated constituency of 440,000 acres and 147 villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000072">The recession affects all parts of the country, of course, and national political and economic dimensions permeate every part of our constituencies. However, my point to the Minister&#151;I am sure that she understands this&#151;relates to the fragility of the rural community and particularly of its sparsely populated communities. I do not necessarily subscribe to the view that the recession is hitting rural areas harder than urban areas, but we none the less need to respond to that fragility. Rural communities find themselves on the brink and are struggling to ensure their future viability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000073">Like all hon. Members, I have been having discussions with small businesses in my constituency. Such businesses play the most vital role in our rural communities. More than half the people employed in my constituency are employed in micro-businesses&#151;businesses that employ fewer than nine people. About two thirds of the people employed in my constituency are employed by businesses with 49 or fewer employees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09032425000074">The chief concern of such small businesses is still the lack of credit from the banks. They are also concerned by the charges that the banks are levying. A Federation of Small Businesses survey found that 16 per cent. of small firms have seen an increase in their bank fees in recent months, while 33 per cent. said that the banks were imposing changes in their financial arrangements that would prove detrimental to their futures. The case has been well rehearsed, but there is a mismatch between what we hear from the Government in this place and what is being done on the ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09032425000075">As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) suggested, there is also concern about the forthcoming 5 per cent. rise in business rates in England and Wales. The RPI in September 2008 was the determining factor, but inflation was then at its peak. Although my hon. Friend did not use the word today, he described the situation as &#147;madness&#148; during the last week&#146;s Welsh questions, and indeed it is&#151;it is difficult for any of us to disagree with him. It is bad enough to hit businesses with a massive rise in business rates at any time, but when we are in the grip of the worst recession for a generation, it is entirely counter-productive. If our intention is to kick-start the economy, we should encourage businesses far more proactively. I urge the Minister to take back to the Treasury the message that we need an averaged RPI when we look at business rates, rather than a figure at a particular point in time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09032425000076">My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for North Wiltshire alluded to empty property rates. The introduction of a &#163;15,000 threshold is helpful, but many businesses are still suffering from having to pay full rates. Again, I ask the Minister to take that concern back to her colleagues.</p>

its excellent report, so I hope that they will not mind me, as an interloper from Wales, briefly touching on it. The report focused on the potential in the rural economy, rather than just on the concerns that many of us have. I find it odd, as, I think, the Select Committee did, that DEFRA has not quantified the potential in rural communities. I hope that the Minister will give her backing to that recommendation. The sum that has been mentioned of, I think, &#163;237 billion, represents huge potential for the rural community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09032425000078">The report rightly highlights the position of rural issues within the Government, and points out that instead of making a rural affairs target a departmental strategic objective, those matters should be part of a cross-Government public service agreement. Of course, while DEFRA must pay attention to rural needs, other Departments certainly do not rural-proof their policies. I can give two parochial examples of that from west Wales. The new motorcycle testing regime requires testing to be carried out at a multi-purpose test centre. There will be none of those centres in Ceredigion or Powys, so my constituents will have round trips of 150 miles. The other example is the closure of tax offices. The closure of the office of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in Aberystwyth, in my constituency, was justified on the grounds that it was the smallest tax office in the country. Neither of those decisions was rural-proofed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para25"><a name="09032425000079">I have only one, very mild, criticism of the report, and that is its focus on the Commission for Rural Communities as the body that will have to consult on rural benchmarks and indicators. The CRC is an excellent body, with an excellent rural communities tsar, but it is an England-only body, and given that aspects of DEFRA policy are not devolved, I hope that Welsh bodies and Ministers will be consulted about non-devolved matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para26"><a name="09032425000080">It is not possible to overstate the importance of broadband in the future of the rural economy, which would be significantly boosted by a universal service obligation, as Lord Carter identified in his report &#147;Digital Britain&#148;. We await the final report for details about how that can be achieved. There are significant issues to overcome in some of our communities, not least of which is topography. We want a thorough report, but I hope that that will be swift. The new universal service obligation could certainly alter BT&#146;s current position as the supplier of internet infrastructure, and my concern is that with uncertainty about the future of the new USO, BT may be reluctant to carry out the work until the new system is in place. We need action on that now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="90324h0002.htm_para27"><a name="09032425000081">Much of rural Wales is blighted by &#147;not-spots&#148;. It is not just a case of the speed at which broadband can be accessed; it is more that there are no broadband connections at all. Broadband is vital for rural communities, and they are mindful of its importance. The broadband think-tank Point Topic recently released a figure showing that 26.9 per cent. of people in Wales are unable to get 2 megabits per second connection. In that respect, Wales is second only to Northern Ireland, which has a figure of 32 per cent. BT claims that 99 per cent. of homes in Wales can access broadband, but that is not the experience in my constituency.</p>

although of course much of the benefit has been dulled by increased costs. There are, of course, other severe impediments to the farming sector. The chief concern among my constituents is the proposed introduction of compulsory electronic identification of sheep, even though that may seem like a peripheral issue. I was alarmed when, during a recent Prime Minister&#146;s questions, the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) raised the issue and he was roundly laughed at from the Labour Benches. The issue is a critical for hon. Members representing the farming community. The National Farmers Union revealed in a recent survey that 84 per cent. of sheep farmers in Wales said they would reduce their flock, and 32 per cent. said they would consider quitting altogether. The hon. Member for Stroud is of course right that we need to attract new people and young people into the farming sector, but that is not the way to do it in the less favoured areas of much of the country. The NFU has provided a vivid illustration of the concern in the industry about the plans in question.</p>

The nationalist party in Wales, the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative party, and Labour voices as well, all sympathised very much with the view opposed to the proposal.

 My hon. Friend raises an important point. As I understand it, the Minister may have been discussing the matter yesterday, so perhaps she can give us some news.

area for good reason. Many of my rural and urban communities have the National Assembly for Wales designation of Communities First area, because they have some of the highest rates of deprivation in not just Britain, but the entire European Union. Perhaps my vision of the essential ingredients of village communities is old-fashioned, but it is one in which there is still a functioning post office&#151;not the van that trundles in intermittently and disappears, and which, I suspect, will disappear altogether in three years&#146; time&#151;in which there are churches and, to add to what the hon. Member for North Wiltshire said, chapels as well, and one where if there is still a last village shop, it has a sustainable future. We have heard about young people moving into a community. I suggest that if those essential ingredients of community have gone, if the village hall or old church or chapel has been sold to development when people have moved from outside and is no longer there for community use, if the community facilities and post office have gone, if the last shop has gone, if there are pressures on rural garages&#151;something that has not been mentioned in the debate&#151;and if the pub is under threat, there is very little incentive for young families to move into a community. That is, of course, all compounded by the economic situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000089">In parts of rural Wales there is migration of young families away&#151;goodness knows where to, given the enormity of the economic problems. The hon. Member for Stroud alluded to the fact that elderly people are moving in. That means elderly people living on the interest from their savings which, in the present climate, affects their purchasing power as well. That is the reality of rural life now. It is not in a box that is distinct from national pressures, but there is a sense of fragility about our communities, and we ignore that fragility at our peril.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) for securing this valuable and timely debate. Rural communities are often the hardest hit during a recession, and a large factor is unemployment. People in rural areas are often at a natural disadvantage compared with those in urban areas. Large towns and cities have some advantages; for instance, comprehensive transport links and a multitude of employment choices. Many in rural areas are less able to seek employment at a considerable distance from their homes. Rural residents often have to rely for employment on a large number of small businesses, whereas urban areas provide a large number of large and medium-sized employers. When I say small, I mean really small: the average size of workplace on the island is one or two employees plus the owner. If those businesses are forced to lay off staff, or even to close, rural residents have few other options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000091">Many small businesses in rural areas exist in a symbiotic relationship with each other, and if one fails they all suffer. That can be a major problem for rural areas when unemployment or even recession takes hold. My constituency has had a history of relatively high unemployment, even during good economic times. We are in the bottom third in the number of residents that have employment. The recession is not helping. Indeed, the research paper &#147;Unemployment by Constituency, February 2009&#148; shows that we are 202nd in the United  <br>

Kingdom. We are in the fourth quintile for unemployment, and are eighth among the Conservative constituencies, so we understand what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09032425000092">However, matters could be worse. It is interesting to note that other nearby rural constituencies are feeling the effects of the recession more keenly. Isle of Wight was about four-fifths up the list for unemployment in February, but over the past year we have been well down the list. Other areas have a significantly increased yield: from Devon to Kent and from Cambridgeshire to Worcestershire, other constituencies are feeling the pinch more than us, although they may have less unemployment. Those areas of course are not islands, and they do not share our particular problems. Nevertheless, we will all head to rock bottom if more is not done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09032425000093">Of great concern to me is the disadvantage that islanders in my constituency and elsewhere have over and above the average rural resident. Those not in employment do not often have the means to seek employment or retraining on the mainland. Isle of Wight residents have to travel to the island&#146;s ferry terminals, cross the five or so miles of the Solent at a cost of about &#163;10 and travel on from the mainland terminal, and then repeat it on the return journey. That is significant, and I would like it to be taken more into account. If employment dries up on an island, the unemployed literally become trapped. It is a vicious circle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09032425000094">I agree with the right hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall), the Treasury Committee Chairman, on one matter. He said yesterday that the recession will leave lasting scars if more is not done to solve rising unemployment. More help is needed for rural and island communities to help them through the recession.</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="09032425000095"><a name="90324h0003.htm_spnew5"><a name="09032425000541"><b>Mr. Dunne:</b>
 My hon. Friend is making a powerful case for Isle of Wight and island communities generally. At this time of rising unemployment, particularly in rural areas, the Government are removing employment in departmental offices in rural areas&#151;for instance, as others here today will know, offices are being closed by HMRC in rural areas, particularly along the Welsh borders&#151;but the Jobcentre Plus offices that were closed last year now need to be reopened to cope with the increase in unemployment. Does my hon. Friend not agree that the Government are scoring own goals, and that they should put a stop to it?</p>

 I do, indeed. I understand well the point that my hon. Friend makes, and I congratulate him on inserting those words into our debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09032425000097">The Government need to get their act together, and get their economic policies, such as the loans guarantee scheme, up and running as quickly as possible. We need to protect small businesses against the recession in order to keep the economy in rural areas going. I hope that the Government will bear that in mind when deciding which businesses to bail out. If something is not done, I suspect that those areas will lag behind the rest of the country when it comes to getting back to work; and it and may even slow recovery.</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I am not sure whether to be flattered, but at least the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) has a few more minutes to prepare his speech. None the less, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000100">I congratulate the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) on making a powerful opening speech. The debate is of immense importance to the House. Frankly, it ought to have been attended by more Members. However, as Members representing rural areas, we are not engaged in special pleading. We have many strengths, as well as facing many challenges. However, we feel that the rural economy presents a slightly different picture to the urban one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000101">We are concerned that the Government, and the apparatus of government in general, lack an understanding of the workings of rural communities. For instance, a number of the excellent civil servants that I meet see the countryside as something that is to be visited on the odd weekend; they do not understand the vitality of the rural community. That is part of the malaise; it is part of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000102">As the Member of Parliament for a large chunk of the Lake district, part of the Yorkshire dales and a large swathe of south Cumbria that is just as beautiful but not in either, I have a body of evidence to draw on in my remarks. It is important to stress the strength of the rural economy. It is important to remind people that, much more than in urban areas, businesses and industries in the rural community are more likely to have a more positive balance sheet. We export more; we do more business outside our shores than the average business in an urban area. Our contribution to the bottom line of UK plc is therefore greater.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000103">Over the past 10 years, the growth in rural areas of knowledge-intensive services, often home-based, has been at twice the rate of that in urban areas. Contrary to public perception, the percentage of people employed in manufacturing in rural areas is roughly the same as in urban areas. There is an innate strength in the rural economy, and it is important to acknowledge that before considering the fact that the recession is hitting us, and hitting us hard&#151;and in some ways hitting us differently from urban Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000104">Unemployment is undoubtedly rising. I draw up experience in my constituency. Kendal serves the bulk of my constituency, and the local jobcentre has seen a tripling in the number of people claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for the first time. As we heard from other Members, we also struggle because the other jobcentre that serves my constituency closed a couple of years ago. It is at Ulverston, just outside my patch, in the constituency of Barrow and Furness, which is represented by the Secretary of State for Defence. That is having a critical effect on the ability of people living in the rural areas on the Furness and Cartmel peninsulas to find employment. The quality of Jobcentre Plus has undoubtedly increased, but it is not good if one cannot get to it. I think that that was incredibly short-sighted.</p>

interest rates have a massive impact on the spending power of ordinary families in rural Britain, which, obviously, leads to a negative multiplier effect and people spending less money in their communities. We heard about the fragility of the rural economy from my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams), who made an impassioned plea on behalf of his communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000106">The drop in demand comes at a time when many of our rural services are already under threat. We have lost rural post offices owing to a deliberate closure programme and the removal of vital services that underpin post offices. As the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said, we have also lost village pubs, which is down not only to a reduction in demand, but to unfair competition and ownership legislation. That needs to be addressed immediately. Furthermore, over the past 20 or 30 years, we have also lost community shops, in part, due to unfair advantages granted to out-of-town supermarkets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000107">The recession has hit an infrastructure already weakened by bad Government policy over a number of years, but the ultimate strength of our rural communities centres on their creativity and resourcefulness. We should be proud of that and play to those strengths. I shall provide three quick examples from my constituency: the first is the Greyhound pub at Grizebeck, where I spent Friday night. It is a community-run pub that would have shut had it not been for the community volunteers running that enterprise. Secondly, I also went to the Storth post office, which is a community-owned, co-operative enterprise employing its own postmaster. Had it not been for those people, it would undoubtedly have shut. The third example is the Witherslack shop. The former post office closed down, and Post Office Ltd. would not allow it to reopen, so the local people&#151;this is a small community of 400 houses&#151;raised &#163;150,000 and worked with the local community land trust to reopen that outstanding local shop. All those wonderful examples, which demonstrate the vitality of rural communities, happened despite, and not because, of the Government. We need to play to the strengths of rural communities, not cause greater difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09032425000108">One of the great problems faced by rural areas is that we appear more affluent than we are, a point to which the hon. Member for North Wiltshire referred. Unemployment in many rural areas is relatively low, but we must not forget that employment, certainly in places such as mine, is very much part-time, low-paid and, because it is often in the tourism sector, seasonal. Another important indicator of poverty and well-being that is rarely acknowledged is the differential between average incomes and average house prices. In rural Britain, the gap between those two figures is greatest. In my constituency, the average house price, even with the drop in house prices, is 12 times the average income, which leaves the average person completely unable to afford their own home. Some 12,500 houses in my constituency were once council houses, and a few more than 3,000 still are, but now, with the great tragedy of repossession, more people are moving on to the waiting list. It is a real pressure-cooker situation and a problem that we need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000109">The development of more affordable housing would not only meet the needs of the hundreds of thousands of people in rural Britain who are desperate to escape the abysmal housing, or who have to move away from  <br>

rural areas, which robs them of their vitality, but give a vital boost to the construction industry. That has to be done in a bottom-up and effective way. There is the will within rural communities&#151;we are the opposite of nimbies&#151;to build new more affordable homes, but the Government&#146;s one-size-fits-all regional spatial strategy is not the answer. It is counter-productive and a nonsense in a district such as mine, where more than half the land mass is in a national park so cannot be touched. That is why the regional spatial strategy should go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000110">We need to support rural communities in coming up with their own solutions. For example, in my area, we have trailed a &#147;home on the farm&#148; initiative, which allows farmers to develop under-used or disused farm buildings and turn them into affordable homes for local families. In the past few weeks, the first was built at Selside just north of Kendal. We also need to maintain consumer demand in rural communities and acknowledge the damaging impact on some of them of excessive second-home ownership. We need to consider ways of managing that problem, putting covenants on new builds and perhaps giving local authorities some tax-varying powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para20"><a name="09032425000111">It is vital that farming, which is the backbone of the economy, be put at the top of the agenda. It tends to survive recessions&#151;it tends not to do too well out of the booms either&#151;because even in developed economies people still have to eat. They might change their demands and where they shop, but the bottom line is that they still need to eat. We are also blessed by the fact that British farmers are some of the most entrepreneurial in the world, producing the highest quality food and meeting by far the highest environmental and animal welfare standards in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para21"><a name="09032425000112">It is important to note, however, that British farming is at a crossroads, because despite the industry&#146;s huge strength in quality and innovation, the unit of production&#151;the family farm&#151;is under enormous pressure from the overly powerful players higher up the chain, such as, most notably, the supermarkets. The impact on the farming economy of this unfair market is huge. Despite British farming&#146;s many strengths, we have still lost 900 million litres of dairy production in the past three years, and dairy farmers still leave the industry at a rate of two a day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para22"><a name="09032425000113">Anecdotally, in my constituency, six out of every seven hill farmers have no line of succession. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire referred to livestock farmers&#146; incomes, but it sounds like his livestock farmers are doing better than mine. Average hill farm incomes are significantly less than &#163;10,000 a year, so no wonder that many question whether they have a future in the industry and struggle to persuade their children to follow them. Furthermore, I endorse the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Ceredigion and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) about sheep tagging, and I hope that the Minister will refer to the situation in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para23"><a name="09032425000114">It is important that the Government accept the Liberal Democrat proposal for a supermarket regulator, rather than a toothless ombudsman, to provide control and power within the market and to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce. It is also important that we make good use of the public money invested in agriculture. It seems a nonsense that we are wasting &#163;7 million a year handing out tiny cheques to people at  <br>

the bottom end of single farm payments&#151;people who, bless them, are not farmers&#151;when that money could be redistributed and spent on, for example, setting up a new hill farm apprenticeship scheme. We should certainly do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para24"><a name="09032425000115">I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) about public sector jobs in rural areas. It is beyond me why the Government are pressing ahead with their tax office closure programme at a time like this. During British tourism week, it is important to ensure that we support British tourism and recognise that, in England, the funding for the marketing of tourism is dire compared with other parts of the United Kingdom. We should also recognise that, in the Lake district alone, we have a &#163;1 billion industry giving vast amounts of money to the Exchequer, but getting very little back for marketing support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="90324h0003.htm_para25"><a name="09032425000116">There are real ways to boost our rural economy. We can make the food market fair through a supermarket regulator. We can ensure that taxpayers&#146; money designed to support farmers does actually do so, and that it is not wasted on bureaucracy, but directed at helping a new generation of farmers to bring new vitality to the industry. At a time when we are wasting more than &#163;10 billion of food a year, we could help farmers by investing in new anaerobic digestion facilities on farms&#151;where people want them&#151;to create clean energy and to dispose of waste. We could back companies in rural areas that want to reduce energy usage while creating employment. I must mention the croppers who provide the paper for <i>Hansard</i> who want a biodigester for their site in Burneside, but need &#163;200,000 of public of money to buy one. That would be a massive service to the community, if only they could get it. We need a new deal for the countryside. Rural Britain should be seen as a living and vibrant set of communities that must be able to reach its potential and play to its strengths. We need a Government who understand rural communities and who are on the side of the many in those communities.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) on obtaining this debate, which, as several hon. Members have said, is perhaps long overdue. It reflects issues that concern nearly a quarter of the population of the United Kingdom. Obviously, much time is spent in this House debating issues of national importance, but usually as a generality. If we go any deeper, it is nearly always related to large-scale manufacturers or the industrial areas of the country, but rarely to the almost 25 per cent. of people who live in rural areas and the issues that affect them. I say to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) that, of course, countless issues affect all people regardless of where they live, who they are and what they earn, but certain aspects of living in rural communities are totally unique and have to be considered as such. He does such communities a disservice by saying that we should not even have a Ministry of rural affairs.</p>

of village stores and farm-based businesses. All sorts of different businesses, including a carriage maker, are making a great success of life in rural areas. However, even some of them are facing very real pressures. Such pressures are particularly unique to rural areas, but, obviously, have their own reflection in the wider urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000119">In rural areas, there are more businesses proportionate to the number of people than there are in urban areas. I would argue that that reflects a higher level of entrepreneurship. As has been said, rural businesses are more likely to be selling into the international markets, but the vast majority employ fewer than 10 people, and a very large proportion employ fewer than five. The most important statistic, which underlines so many issues, is that the average earnings of people who work in rural areas&#151;I am not talking about those who live in a rural area and commute to an urban area&#151;are &#163;4,655 a year less than the national average wage; that is very significant. The Government have not done much to understand that pretty fundamental distinction. We have heard several times about the closure of jobcentres. Some 23 per cent. of the population have just 4 per cent. of the jobcentres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para2"><a name="09032425000120">On the impact of the recession, the proportion of rural households living below the poverty line has risen from 16 to 19 per cent., which is almost one in five rural households. The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) referred to the tough social situation facing many of his constituents. He would probably agree with me that part of the problem in rural areas is that that poverty is so often hidden because it stands cheek by jowl with affluence. For example, an elderly person could be living in a run-down cottage that they may own, and nobody realises how badly off they are because next door&#151;on both sides, perhaps&#151;there are people with three cars who live a very different lifestyle. Therefore, we must pay particular attention to ensure that we address the problems of the smaller groups of individuals, because they form a large proportion of the population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000121">There is increasing evidence of a downturn in the turnover of village shops and others. The fact is that, although some would argue that this is not directly related to the recession, over the past 12 months there has been an almost 20 per cent. increase in robbery in rural areas. Bearing it in mind that we have had senior police officers warning society that crime would rise in the recession, I do not think that we should completely ignore that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000122">Let me now touch on farming. As hon. Members know, I stand second to nobody in my respect for the British farming community, but we should not overestimate its role in the rural economy. It is very important, but accounts for less than 5 per cent. of the rural work force. However, that ignores the supply chain and food manufacturing, which is often based on our own agricultural production.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para5"><a name="09032425000123">The reality is that British agriculture is facing a relatively good situation at the moment. However, it is all very well to talk about a 40 per cent. increase in income, but 40 per cent. of virtually nothing does not add up to a great deal. We must be careful about such distorted statistics. You will know from your own constituency, Mr. Atkinson, that this great improvement in the fortunes of most sectors of agriculture has been brought about as a direct result of Government  <br>

incompetence. The fact is that the currency has collapsed, and imports of red meat have become much more expensive. That means that prices for our own red meat&#151;beef and lamb&#151;which is already in shorter supply than it used to be, are now at a much higher level. They have drawn up pig meat with them because they are linked. The price of feed wheat is around &#163;100 a tonne, but it would have been only &#163;80 a tonne had it not been for the collapse of sterling, and that would have destroyed the arable sector. Even the milk sector&#151;it is probably facing the most difficult problems, with further price cuts anticipated in the coming months&#151;would be far worse off were it not for the astonishing weakness of sterling, which is a direct consequence of Government policy.</p>

I do not know about other hon.

One of the largest animal feed manufacturers recently told me that it had been instructed by its board not to trade with anybody who has not got credit insurance. That is a perfectly reasonable business decision to make, but it means that countless farmers are desperately trying to get credit insurance at a time of financial difficulty when nobody is tempted to provide it.</p>

Those are specific issues relating to rural businesses. In addition, the fall in house prices is nowhere near sufficient to rejuvenate the opportunities for first-time buyers in rural areas. The multiples that I last saw were that the average rural home is about seven-and-a-half times the national average wage, and the average urban home is six times the national average wage.

We advocated a national loan guarantee scheme over and over. The Government, having criticised it for weeks, eventually announced the introduction of a pale pink imitation, but it does not yet exist. We are told that it may be introduced next week, but businesses are struggling now.

Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), would have responded to this debate in detail, but he could not be here this morning as he is on Government business. However, I hope to be able to respond to the genuine concerns that have been expressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000133">It is true that the recession is making life hard for many communities and businesses. As we have heard this morning, that is just as true of rural communities as it is of our towns and cities. It is important that we do not treat the two separately. I heard the comment that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire made from a sedentary position about my urban constituency of Liverpool, Wavertree, and I thought that it was somewhat ungenerous.</p>

working in businesses in rural areas has risen by nearly 300,000, which is more than twice the increase in urban areas. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said, rural areas are home to about 1 million businesses&#151;a quarter of England&#146;s total&#151;providing just over 5.5 million jobs. Together, they have a turnover of more than &#163;300 billion a year. In fact, there are more businesses for every 10,000 people in rural areas than in urban areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000136">The evidence to date suggests that the impact of the current economic situation on rural areas is similar to its impact in urban areas. Not a single Member who has spoken has failed to mention concerns about rising unemployment and job losses. Many have listed the impacts on their constituency. The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), who is not in the Chamber just now, and other hon. Members drew attention to, and criticised, Government decisions to move Government work, as they described it, from rural communities into more urban settings. However, in my previous roles, I have spent many hours debating such issues, particularly how we collect taxes in this country. We need to modernise our tax collection systems, and that involves employing fewer people. In this economic climate, it would not be right for the public sector to be less efficient than it could and should be simply to provide employment. I know that hon. Members who have participated in this debate would not urge that of any Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000137">The employment rate in rural and urban areas is similar, but there are proportionately more retired people and fewer unemployed people in rural areas. The proportion of people claiming unemployment-related benefits is rising at a similar rate in rural and urban areas. The number of redundancies is lower in rural areas in both absolute and proportional terms, but not by a great deal.</p>

As someone who represents a Liverpool constituency, I have particular reason to know the threat of serious unemployment, although I will not waste time drawing attention to the previous Government&#146;s attitude to dealing with unemployment. We need a better understanding of risk if we are to enable rural communities and businesses to survive the economic downturn. It may be that we should discuss those risks and how they should be managed on another occasion when we have more time.</p>

would not say that I was over-encouraged by other member states&#146; responses, but it was encouraging, at least, that many countries spoke in favour of the Hungarian motion to introduce e-ID on a voluntary basis. The Commission also responded relatively positively to my suggestion that it should consider further our proposals that would reduce even further the burdens of that otherwise costly regulation. Although I accept that not all rural businesses involve farming, businesses such as upland farmers and sheep farmers are critical to some of the most beautiful areas of the British countryside, and I accept the points made about such farmers&#146; income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000140">We need to ensure that any regulation that we make is proportionate to the policy problem that we are trying to fix. There is unanimity not only among parties in the UK, but in the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament, that the e-ID proposals, as they stand, are disproportionate and that the Commission&#146;s assessment of the impact is inadequate and should be revisited and renewed so that we can get a better understanding at Commission level of the proposals&#146; potentially damaging impact. I am hopeful that we can make further progress with the Commission. The commissioner indicated that she was prepared to consider further details, including locating reading equipment at centres where sheep are brought in the normal course of business, whether in marketplaces or in abattoirs or processing plants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para20"><a name="09032425000141">As always happens in such debates, time is running away. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who made a good and thoughtful contribution, referred to ways in which we could help rural communities through the recession. He promoted the idea of social enterprise&#151;I agree. If anything, other parties demonstrated their lack of understanding of the potential benefits of such ideas in their responses to his proposals. The social enterprise model has strengths and could be adopted in a rural setting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para21"><a name="09032425000142">There are great pressures on the housing market at the moment, which is why the Government are taking steps to help home owners and first-time buyers in urban and rural areas, expanding the availability of shared equity, and working closely with lenders to keep people in their homes. For example, we are extending income support for mortgage interest payments to help people when they fall on hard times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para22"><a name="09032425000143">Finally, as I have only a few moments left, let me say that I agree with the comments of the hon.

Every day, 150,000 people are being shelled in the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s designated no-fire zone, and tens of thousands more are trapped in a thin strip of land&#151;just 13 square miles&#151;where the battles are taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90324h0004.htm_para24"><a name="09032425000146">Despite those huge numbers, we must not forget that this is also a deeply personal tragedy. Every Friday, I hold an advice surgery for about five hours. As is the case for many MPs, barely a week goes by without me meeting constituents who have family members back home in the Tamil region of Sri Lanka. More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict; the numbers are so big that the crisis is almost impossible to comprehend. Each week, I meet constituents face to face who tell me their stories and fears for their families, which makes a complex international crisis very personal.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The work of the Tamil community in highlighting a cause to which people tend to close their eyes has been admirable. The Tamil community in my constituency works hard. People send their kids to university in overwhelming numbers. At this time of year, they come to my surgery desperate for places in grammar schools within the London borough of Sutton&#151;as a secondary modern girl, I often find that challenge difficult. One constituent came to me to say how outraged he was that the Government were discriminating against pupils from public schools getting places at Oxford and Cambridge. That was a Tamil sub-postmaster in my constituency who had managed to afford to send his daughter to Wimbledon High school. How many people of our community in similar circumstances would be in a position to do that? That shows the emphasis placed on education within the Tamil community.</p>

Amnesty says that that Government will allow displaced people to leave Government camps, even for emergency health care, only if they leave a family member in the camp as a safeguard against their escape, and that that policy violates the international legal prohibition against hostage taking. More significantly, Amnesty says that repeated shelling of the last working hospital in the town of Puthukkudiyiruppu&#151;I apologise for my pronunciation&#151;might constitute a war crime.

 Amnesty also says:</p>
<a name="90324h0005.htm_brev9"><a name="09032425000454"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There has been no proper accountability for the killings that have happened in the last two years, so there is impunity for the perpetrators.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000176">Such breaches of human rights are not acceptable. Governments must live up to the very highest codes of behaviour, but the Government of Sri Lanka are not doing so. Earlier this month, I joined protesters and other MPs, many of whom are in the Chamber, at a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, at which we called for Commonwealth Ministers to suspend Sri Lanka for its human rights abuses against the Tamil community. The group was established in 1995 to deal with serious or persistent violations of the Harare declaration. It is clear to me that Sri Lanka has violated the terms of the declaration, and it must be clear to everyone that it has violated the spirit of the declaration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000177">There is now an opening for a truce. At the weekend, in an interview with Marie Colvin of <i>The Sunday Times</i>, Balasingham Nadesan, the political leader of the Tamil Tigers, called for an urgent ceasefire. He said that the Tigers would enter negotiations with the Sri Lankan Government &#147;without pre-conditions&#148; and:</p>
<a name="90324h0005.htm_brev10"><a name="09032425000455"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We call for a ceasefire, loudly and clearly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000178">The Sri Lankan Government could grasp this opportunity of a ceasefire, or else face international opprobrium. If Sri Lanka does not take this opportunity, it will need to be forced to the negotiating table through diplomatic means. The British Government should simply state that Sri Lanka should be suspended from the Commonwealth, and the process of suspension should commence. That is the purpose of this debate&#151;I hope that the Government will listen to the concerns of my constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000179">I hope also that the debate will offer an opportunity to highlight on the world stage the truly appalling state of affairs there. Sadly, the media have not taken much interest in the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka, so it falls to us to draw attention to it. As Amnesty has said:</p>
<a name="90324h0005.htm_brev11"><a name="09032425000456"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One of the real concerns is that this is a war without witnesses...We just don&#146;t know what&#146;s been happening&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000180">That is why Sri Lanka is, in many ways, a forgotten crisis. As I have said, 60 people a day are dying due to army bombardment in Tamil areas, and more people have been killed in the past five weeks than died in Gaza last autumn. I do not wish to diminish the importance and horror of what has happened in Gaza, and it is quite right that the conflict was front-page news and the first item on TV and radio bulletins for weeks on end, but there has been no such coverage of Sri Lanka. That is appalling, because astonishingly cruel things have been happening there and, as the Red Cross has said, things are getting worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000181">The Sri Lankan Government do not allow independent monitors or members of the press into the affected areas, and journalists have been threatened or even murdered. Surely that is even more reason for the international media to report on this conflict. The  <br>

media also have a hard time reporting in Zimbabwe and Gaza, but that usually hardens their resolve. When it comes to Sri Lanka, only a few notable exceptions print anything other than public relations material for the Government there. Award-winning war correspondent Marie Colvin is one such exception. She was attacked by Government forces when reporting in Sri Lanka and, as a result, suffered head and chest wounds and lost an eye. She spoke at a meeting of the all-party group on Tamils last week, and explained the dreadful conditions on the ground and the lengths to which the Government would go to wipe out their opponents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="90324h0005.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000182">However, for every Marie Colvin, there are dozens of papers with no coverage at all. As a daily reader of <i>The </i><i>Times</i>, I was disgusted by its article last Friday complaining about demonstrations in which people waved Tamil flags. The article said that the Sri Lankan Government were unhappy about the flags being waved at demonstrations in countries such as Britain and that the people doing so represented terrorists from the Tamil Tigers. In fact, they did not, but that is beside the point. What is going on with a paper&#146;s sense of proportion when it prints stories about flags, but not about thousands of people being killed or displaced every month? Amnesty is right to say that this is a conflict without witnesses, and it is our role, as Members of Parliament, to provide a testimony. The Sri Lankan Government have done an amazing job of repressing dissent internally, and have done a brilliant PR job around the world. They are wiping out an ethnic minority and saying that the Tamils want a bloodbath so that there will be international intervention. They have also cowed the UN, which is now apparently afraid to speak out in case it is expelled from the conflict zone.</p>

 The hon. Lady is making a strong case. Throughout the conflict, but especially at this stage, independent human rights monitors should be in the north and east of the country. Indeed, they should have been there for a long time. Does she agree that if the Tamil Tigers are prepared to enter negotiations, there should be no pre-conditions, as they have discussed? That is the only way in which any kind of progress will be made. Does she agree that negotiations should engage the whole Tamil community in the north and east of the country, not just the Tamil Tigers?</p>

 Yes, I agree that all sides should be included in any negotiations. As <i>The Sunday Times </i>reported this week, the deputy leader of the Tigers has said there are no pre-conditions to their call for a ceasefire. What was not printed in the paper, but was certainly said to Marie Colvin, is that they would abide by and accept the outcome of a referendum of the people of Sri Lanka. That goes further than anyone could previously have anticipated.</p>

I am starting to doubt seriously the veracity of that propaganda&#151;not that I had an enormous amount of belief in it in the first place&#151;because it there is simply too much and it is too indiscriminate.</p>

 I agree with my hon. Friend, but the unfortunate thing is that the Sri Lankan Government are tremendously successful at propaganda. I have gone around the House to ask Members from all parties to sign early-day motions asking for the suspension of Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth, but hon. Members in the Chamber would be amazed by the number of people who want nothing to do with the matter and do not want to talk about it.

 On the Commonwealth issue, does my hon.

 My right hon. Friend is right. She has worked as hard as anybody on the issue&#151;in fact, we worked together on the whole matter. It is so frustrating that this is happening&#151;it is almost beyond words.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing the debate. It is vital that we raise these issues, but I promise to be brief, Mr. Atkinson.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para0"><a name="09032425000194">My constituents are, like those of the hon. Lady, concerned about their families and what is happening. We are the only voices who can put forward those concerns because, as has been said, our media are not doing so. With every other conflict of recent times, people have turned on the news and it has been a No. 1 or No. 2 item. However, I cannot remember the last time I have seen anything on any news bulletin about this issue. A tragedy is unfolding and innocent people are losing their lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000195">Like the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), I have always spoken up against terrorism and will continue to do so. However, we are not talking about that; we are talking about innocent women, children and men being killed every day. The world seems to be saying nothing and is completely silent. I agree with the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden: pressure must be brought to bear on the Sri Lankan Government. If that pressure has to take the form of a suspension from the Commonwealth, and that is what it will take to get the message through that a ceasefire must happen now, so be it.</p>

Members from all parties have been calling for that ceasefire. We attended a meeting with the Foreign Secretary, and a number of us also met the Prime Minister to discuss the issue. Everyone is calling for a ceasefire, but it seems that the Sri Lankan Government are not taking a blind bit of notice of what anyone anywhere in the world is saying. That has to stop and it has to stop now. In four or six weeks&#146; time we cannot still be saying exactly the same thing, because a lack of action will mean that more innocent people will have been dying.</p>

However, a few weeks ago, they gathered to raise money and humanitarian aid to help the young people and those who are suffering so terribly. I sincerely hope that that aid is allowed through to the people who so desperately need it now. The world should hang its head in shame if it allows what is happening to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000198">Like the hon.

The high commission&#146;s public relations machine has to be commended, because, like other hon. Members, I get e-mails from it perhaps two or three times a day. Some of the things that the Sri Lankan Government have said about anyone who dares to speak up about providing humanitarian aid for those who are suffering are deplorable. They should ashamed of what they have said about hon. Members who are purely doing their jobs and representing their constituents&#146; concerns about humanitarian issues.

carnage now. Perhaps there can then be a peaceful future for everyone in Sri Lanka and people will be able to live in harmony together. Perhaps they can be educated, have food on their tables, a roof over their head, hospital treatment when they need it, and motorways opened. If that can happen, we will have done some good in this House of Commons.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on not only securing the debate, but putting the case for action so eloquently. That is what is crucial about this morning. It is not just about a debate or words; it is a call for action. My hon. Friend has called for Sri Lanka to be suspended from the Commonwealth. In recent weeks, there have been calls for our Government to seek a UN Security Council resolution. None of those things are happening. However, the Prime Minister is, I believe, the first world leader to call for a ceasefire. That call was very welcome and genuine. We were all pleased to hear that call, but it was some weeks ago, and we know that fine words and good intentions on the part of all of us here will not save a single life.

It is worth repeating some of my hon. Friend&#146;s points. I refer particularly to the leaked report by the United Nations Office of the Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator that put the total minimum number of civilian casualties between 20 January and 7 March 2009 at 9,924, including 2,683 deaths. It was later conceded that the figure was likely to be a gross underestimate. Those are numbers, but if 2,683 people were lined up to greet us in Westminster Hall, we would see exactly what the number means&#151;and that is just since 20 January.</p>

As has been said, the political leader of the Tamil Tigers, Balasingham Nadesan, pleaded for a ceasefire, and I understand that less than three weeks ago a ceasefire offer was put on the table, again by the Tamil Tigers, but was rejected out of hand by Sri Lanka. The excuse is made by the Sri Lankan Government that they made offers a year or more ago that were not taken up. That does not make it okay not to listen to a ceasefire offer now. Given the number of people who are dying or being injured, a ceasefire is required immediately. If it was right for the Sri Lankan Government to suggest some time ago that there should be a  ceasefire, surely it must be right for them to take up such offers now. It is completely contradictory to ignore the pleadings for a ceasefire, in the face of the situation and the suffering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000204">An important point that is worth noting&#151;it has been made by several Members&#151;is the willingness to enter negotiations without preconditions. I do not understand how Sri Lanka can refuse that offer. It gives our Government every possible opening to put on as much pressure as they can, and to urge other Governments around the world&#151;not least the Government of India, who should be playing a much more high-profile role in this matter&#151;to put pressure on the Government of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000205">Undoubtedly, if the evidence could be collected, we would see that war crimes are being committed. The Government of Sri Lanka have unambiguously and wilfully failed to meet their obligations. The Geneva convention states:</p>
<a name="90324h0006.htm_brev0"><a name="09032425000457"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In order to ensure respect for and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects, the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000206">On any reading of the situation, we could not say that the Government of Sri Lanka are meeting those obligations, given their indiscriminate attacks and use of cluster bombs, multi-barrel rocket launchers and white phosphorous. Indeed, the Sri Lankan Government have publicly abrogated their duty to protect civilians. On 2 February, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order stated:</p>
<a name="90324h0006.htm_brev1"><a name="09032425000458"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While the Security Forces accept all responsibility to ensure the safety and protection of civilians in the Safety Zones, they are unable to give such an assurance to those who remain outside these zones. Therefore, the government, with full responsibility, urges all civilians to come to the Safety Zones&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000207">Of course, we have heard time and again in recent weeks of the bombing of safety zones and hospitals. Indeed, the last hospital has now been bombed and is no longer operating. We have had reports of casualties on the beaches, and feet blown off by land mines. Those aid agencies that are there and are able to operate have to choose between the most severely injured and the badly injured, and have to leave the badly injured lying on the beach. That cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered humane treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000208">This is a humanitarian crisis and a violation of human rights. It is beyond our imagining, but we must try to put ourselves in that place, because no one is speaking up for those people. They have no voice, but, surely, giving them a voice is one of our first responsibilities.</p>

I do not have a large Tamil population, but those families who do come to my surgery are absolutely frantic. They do not know whether their family and friends are displaced, injured or, worse, dead. They have no contact whatsoever, but they know what we know and what the world chooses to ignore about severely injured people lying on beaches.</p>

Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) outlined the horror and fear of people who have to survive day to day&#151;if they manage to survive. That is a reality. We stand here in comfort and warmth and discuss the situation, but we do not see any action. We need action.</p>

I believe that it was the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes), who said at the last Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs questions that Russia would veto such a resolution, or was making it clear behind the scenes that it would do so. There is a discussion to be had as to whether we should be opening this up. We should be speaking to Russia through diplomatic channels. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister cannot comment on that&#151;perhaps it is happening and he is not able to go into much detail. However, I want to put it on the record that many Members of Parliament and others&#151;Professor Boyle, for instance, who recently circulated a paper&#151;feel that it might be about time to put the matter on the agenda or at least to have a discussion about it, instead of allowing Russia, if Russia is the problem, to hide behind the fact that it is not on the agenda. I sincerely hope that my hon. Friend and his colleagues are having such discussions.</p>

 Hon. Members have made a powerful case for suspending Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth, and there has been talk of the Harare declaration. Of course, Zimbabwe has been suspended from the Commonwealth with very little effect. I wonder whether suspension from the Commonwealth only really makes sense as a stepping stone and a rallying point to a UN resolution, and whether in practical terms&#151;other than giving voice to a subject that does not have a proper voice in the UK&#151;it would not actually be that substantive to the Government of Sri Lanka unless it led to the next stepping stone, which would be a full UN resolution.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman, who makes my case for me, and I agree with him. Suspension from the Commonwealth is an important step, and the Commonwealth is an important organisation. It is hugely respected by its members and those outside it. Such a move would be a stepping stone, but an important one. An important organisation consisting of a group of countries that work together would be saying, &#147;We will not tolerate this in our midst. This is not acceptable.&#148; Sri Lanka would be told that it must desist from such activity, stop genocidal warfare and sue for peace. That would be an appropriate thing for the Commonwealth to do. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. My case is that suspension would be an important step but it cannot be the only measure because, of itself, it might not bring the results that we need. That is why the UN is so important and why we need to move the debate on to this issue. Even if it does not go to the Security Council at this time&#151;although I think that it possibly should&#151;we should be having the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para17"><a name="09032425000214">We have been wary of moving towards such a debate. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden said, the UN seems to have been cowed and we  <br>

all seem to be wary of raising the issue with the UN, but does that not show that this is a testing time for the UN and that it needs to take up the issue? The Sri Lankan Government have attempted to reject a special representative appointed by our Prime Minister, on the ground that they were not consulted&#151;as if they are consulted on the ministerial appointments or any other appointments that the Prime Minister makes. It is an outrageous argument. We have seen them do that, and the UN needs to take steps. Whatever the UN may be, it can do more than it is currently doing, and I want our Government to push it to do just that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000215">The Sri Lankan Government have accepted that there is no political solution; they have said as much themselves. So, if there is no political solution, what are they doing perpetrating&#151;pushing forward&#151;the war? I do not deny that the Tamil Tigers have also committed atrocities, and none of us present would defend them, but, they are asking for a ceasefire and it is for the Sri Lankan Government to respond. If they do not do so now, and they say that there is no political solution, why are they prosecuting the war? What is the purpose? Why are journalists not allowed into the Vanni region? Why are aid agencies, which are so badly needed, not allowed in? If the Sri Lankan Government have nothing to hide, why do they not allow in those who need to go there to assist people and let the eyes of the world see what is happening? Why is that not happening now? The Sri Lankan Government cannot complain if we condemn them and assume that the situation is worse than they say it is, if they will not let people see for themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="90324h0006.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000216">We have four immediate goals. We want Sri Lanka suspended from the Commonwealth for the reasons that I have given; a ceasefire; a UN monitoring mission to be given unfettered access to the country; and a resumption of peace negotiations. Those things must happen now. Finally, aid agencies must be allowed in to help those people on whose behalf we stand here today and raise our voices&#151;the people who are innocent and suffering, the people of the future. There is no military solution to the situation, but if there is no political solution, there will be no end to it.</p>

Finally, is the Minister sympathetic to the view that I believe my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton will express, similar to those from all parts of the House, that there must be a specific initiative by the Commonwealth, showing that it is a serious organisation that takes membership seriously? It is not an organisation without principles or rules, and those of us who are keen supporters of it believe that it must show its colours and its principles. If it does not do so now, for the people of Sri Lanka, it will not be an organisation worth belonging to.

 I first spoke about the problems in Sri Lanka in this very Chamber, during the debate about the Foreign Affairs Committee&#146;s report on human rights. Since then, things have got worse not better, and, if action had been taken then, it would have saved thousands of lives. Thousands of people have been maimed and tens of thousands have been made homeless. The position has simply got worse.</p>

I surveyed the Tamil people who live in my constituency, and what came out loud and clear was their fear and worry for the relatives in Tamil areas whom they are unable to contact.</p>

I am afraid that I have to inject a slight party political point here, because I have seen the reported remarks of the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who seems to be endorsing wholeheartedly the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s campaign against the Tamil areas. I hope that the Conservative party spokesman will dissociate himself from his party&#146;s Front Bencher&#146;s remarks, which are unfortunate to say the least and are, at worst, encouraging this genocide. We must have a common front in favour of humanitarian relief and a ceasefire, and we need real progress to try to sort these problems out.</p>

We need access for humanitarian relief from both non-governmental organisations and Governments. Most importantly of all, we have to recognise the underlying political cause of what is going on and what has been the problem for more than 25 years&#151;indeed, going back to when Sri Lanka, which was then Ceylon, gained its independence from the British Empire. The fact remains that no political solution has so far been offered to the just demands of the Tamil people for self-determination. They are entitled to have their say in their own future, but the Sri Lankan Government have denied them that consistently, ever since the foundation of the state. That has, ultimately, led to the creation of the LTTE and its campaign against the Sri Lankan Government.</p>

That is no answer. There is no military solution to this problem. There has to be a political recognition of the rights of the Tamil people. Part of that process must involve the calls that my hon. Friends have made for action by the United Nations and the exclusion of Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth. Sri Lanka has already lost its place on the UN Human Rights Council&#151;quite rightly so&#151;but that is far less than what is required to try to bring home to it the scale of the problem.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to comment in this important debate. The message that will have gone out clearly from this debate is that no hon. Member in this Chamber supports the violence. There have been condemnations of the LTTE as well. However, the most important thing, as the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) said, is that we Members of Parliament must bear witness to oppressed minorities wherever they exist in the world. It is important to recognise that the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka is being oppressed by its Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000241">First, I want to press the Minister and ask about what action the Government are taking to impress on the Sri Lankan Government the need for capacity for evacuation for innocent women, children and men. He cannot have been deaf to the comment made by the representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross only last weekend:</p>
<a name="90324h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09032425000470"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The capacity for evacuation is far below the need...We have to decide to take the casualties who are more badlv injured and leave behind the ones who are less badly injured&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000242">or leave behind people who are not injured at all who are then unwittingly used as human shields. The Tamil community is being abused in that way. The Government need to take direct action in respect of the Sri Lankan high commission in London to impress on it the need to allow the evacuation of innocent Tamil citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000243">Secondly&#151;the Sri Lankan Government should hear this&#151;mercy missions are on their way from the community and from international organisations. I cite the mercy mission ship that could land in Vanni if the Sri Lankan Government allowed it to do so. Surely, if that Government had any humanity towards their citizens they would allow that ship to dock, for it has on it representations from the international community. This is not a ship that could in any way be called a front for terrorism; it would deliver much-needed food and medical aid to that area. The UK Government must stand up and make a representation to the Sri Lankan high commission on that point, as so many hon. Members who have contributed to this debate have done today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000244">Thirdly, the Sri Lankan Government may be cautious about what Balasingham Nadesan said at the weekend, but unless they take the brave step towards a ceasefire, accept that the offer might be genuine and does not contain preconditions, and come to the table, there will be no political solution. The political solution is the only way forward, because a military solution cannot ever win. Equally, with a ceasefire, it should be incumbent on the Sri Lankan Government to accept international validation on certain points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000245">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) made some telling remarks about the role of the Commonwealth, and all hon. Members in the Chamber will be listening to what happens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000246">Fourthly, post-action and post-ceasefire, the UK Government must impress on the Sri Lankan Government that the ceasefire must include not only the LTTE, but all sections of the Tamil community. There is a role for the Tamil National Alliance, and other democratic people, in that process. Equally, the UK Government could suggest to the Government of Sri Lanka&#151;tied in with  <br>

their request for a ceasefire and the threat of suspension from the Commonwealth&#151;that there could be a genuine international reconstruction fund. For if the Tamils are to be able to play a full part in the life of Sri Lanka, they will need not only the political solution but the economic solution. An international reconstruction fund would be a part of that process and the Commonwealth could lead it. If not, our Government should lead the process of putting that fund in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000247">I am aware of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson. Like so many other hon. Members I could speak for rather longer. I hope that the Minister will respond to those four points.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing the debate and on her remarks. Both she and the right hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan) have been tireless in their campaigning in recent weeks and months and it has been a pleasure to work with them to put forward the Tamil case, and the case for human rights and a ceasefire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000249">The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden shares my anger and the anger of my Tamil constituents and the whole Tamil diaspora, and she is frustrated that nothing seems to be happening. The killing seems to be going on and the humanitarian catastrophe seems to be getting worse, even in the safe areas, as she so graphically described. We have these debates and we ask questions, but I say to the Minister that the frustration is getting deeper every day. People keep hearing about the communities with which they have connections back through the generations being devastated and about family members disappearing and being killed. We have to speak out, and the Government have to speak out far more than they have done to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para17"><a name="09032425000250">I commend the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary on the comments that they made a few weeks ago and for calling for a ceasefire. However, that call has fallen on deaf ears, so we urgently need to take more action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000251">No doubt colleagues have received many reports&#151;not just PR from the Sri Lankan high commission&#151;from Tamil constituents and campaign bodies, and from people who are in the Vanni. One of the most graphic reports that I have received is entitled &#147;Voice of the Voiceless and Helpless People of the Vanni&#148;. It talks about the horrific conditions in the so-called safe area. It seems that the Sri Lankan Government have set up not a safe area, but a concentration camp, which it is even prepared to shell. That cannot go without huge criticism from the British Government and the international community. It is a crime, and we must speak out loudly against it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="90324h0007.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000252">I hope that the Government will take three concrete actions. First, they have not exerted enough pressure through the Commonwealth, which can often act behind the scenes and put moral pressure on Ministers of other Governments. My hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said that at the recent meeting in London, the British Government were represented by only a Parliamentary Under-Secretary. The Government could have done more, given that  Sri Lankan Government representatives were here  in London.</p>

Friend and I have discussed whether we should join the calls for Sri Lanka&#146;s suspension from the Commonwealth, because that would be a major move and the Commonwealth traditionally uses behind-the-scenes moral pressure. We have come round to the point of view of the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden. We must begin that process, and the leader of my party, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg), has agreed to write to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth today asking for an immediate inquiry into the action of the Sri Lankan Government and whether it is compatible with Commonwealth membership, the Harare principles and so on. That inquiry needs to be set up as the start of the process for Sri Lanka&#146;s suspension, and I hope that the Minister will join my right hon. Friend in that call to Commonwealth leaders. There should be an investigation, and it should happen now.</p>

 I apologise for not being present at the start of the debate because I was at a constituency meeting. I suggest that we should set a time limit. A deadline should be set for peace talks to start, and if they do not start, Sri Lanka should be removed from the Commonwealth.</p>

It is all very well calling for a ceasefire, but if our representatives in New York will not table a resolution for the international community to vote on, we are just bandying words. I have clashed swords with the Foreign Secretary on this because, as the right hon. Member for Enfield, North said, excuses are being made for not tabling such a resolution. We are told that a failed resolution would somehow strengthen the Sri Lankans and that that would be worse. How could it be worse? How could the situation be worse than it is now? We should table that resolution and put pressure on Russia and China. Let them vote against our resolution. Let us expose them for supporting the Sri Lankan Government and the violence. Let us lead the international community in calling for a ceasefire. Diplomatic weasel words about failing at the Security Council are no good. That is the proper body for addressing such matters. A huge amount of killing is taking place, and the international community needs to speak out. When Mexico recently tried to put the matter on the Security Council&#146;s agenda, some countries, including Britain, prevented it from happening. That is simply not good enough.</p>

 I apologise for arriving half way through the winding-up speeches. I share the deep frustration that is felt and I, too, have constituents who are extremely angry about the situation in Sri Lanka, but I want to probe the hon. Gentleman on the process in the UN. Does he accept that unless the P5 collectively and unanimously, or at most with one or two abstentions, agree a form of words, his proposal is simply a gesture? It may make him feel better&#151;it may make my constituents feel better&#151;but it will not lead to a Security Council resolution unless Russia and China can be persuaded at least to abstain.</p>

 I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. We would send a huge and important signal from Britain, the US and others. Let us remember that when the British Government tabled a resolution on Zimbabwe at the Security Council, they knew that China would veto it, so let us not be told that we are asking for gestures. The British Government rightly said that we should hold China to account, and we should be saying that about Sri Lanka to other P5 members. We should be holding other members of the international community to account for not speaking up for the Tamil people of Sri Lanka.</p>

 My hon. Friend knows that I agree with him, and he may like to inquire of the Minister what representations we have made bilaterally to China and Russia to ensure that they are feeling the pressure so that Sri Lanka knows that there is no hiding place. Only when the European Union, the Commonwealth and the UN hold Sri Lanka up for examination will it get the message that it must change its ways.</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. The Minister should tell us today what diplomatic efforts Her Majesty&#146;s Government have made to secure unanimous support from the P5 and others for such a resolution. It is no good giving us excuses. We want to know that the whole strength and force of the Government&#146;s diplomatic effort is to secure that resolution. At the moment, we have no sense or feeling that that is happening, and that is simply not good enough.</p>

The Congress party and the Bharatiya Janata party have different views, but the situation is so urgent and significant that those diplomatic niceties should be put aside. If the Government will not do that, Members of Parliament should ask the Indians to exercise their influence&#151;they are incredibly influential in this area. India&#146;s history regarding the Sri Lanka problem is tragic, but it is time to use our offices to address the matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="09032425000266"><a name="90324h0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="09032425000594"><b>Mr. Keith Simpson (Mid-Norfolk) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on raising this debate, and on how she put forward her views. Only a few weeks ago, on 5 February, we debated Sri Lanka in one of the aptly named topical debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para0"><a name="09032425000267">The immediate issue that has been brought forward by all hon. Members is how to ensure the safety of the tens of thousands of people caught up in what is effectively a fighting zone&#151;the so-called no-fire zone/safe zone. Both sides have been guilty of the indiscriminate and discriminate use of violence. I say &#147;indiscriminate&#148; because if the Sri Lankan army is using area weapons such as assault from the air and artillery fire, it will kill large numbers of people in a very densely populated zone. I mean discriminate violence in the sense that so-called prisoners are shot by the Sri Lankan armed forces and, equally, the LTTE has ended up shooting people that it has tried to force into fighting units. This is a human tragedy on a vast scale and our immediate problem is how to bring pressure to bear not just on the Sri Lankan Government but on the LTTE to make certain that the civilians are evacuated and protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000268">As the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden and the right hon. Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan) mentioned, the LTTE has come to the table suggesting that it wants a ceasefire, with no conditions attached to it. The sadness is that both sides have played that game over the years. Both sides have tended to propose a ceasefire when they have perhaps been at a point of weakness and want to bring the other side to the table. However, there are powerful arguments now for the Sri Lankan Government to recognise that they have the LTTE on the ropes and that, in terms of not only domestic public opinion but international public opinion, they should show a degree of magnanimity and produce a ceasefire that puts the LTTE on the back foot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para2"><a name="09032425000269">It seems to me that, as other hon. Members said, the Sri Lankan Government are determined militarily to destroy the LTTE. There is no doubt that the reason for their refusal to allow in a UN force and most international media and for the constraints that have been placed on the non-governmental organisations is that they believe that if there is one final push, the LTTE will be militarily destroyed. However, as many hon. Members pointed out, that military victory will not produce the lasting settlement that they want. History is littered with examples of that. The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) pointed that out. My experience from teaching this to British armed forces over many years is that the tube of toothpaste is squeezed in a different direction. There will be a new generation of Tamil Tigers, who will end up fighting by unconventional warfare against the Sri Lankan Government and, more importantly, their people, not only in Sri Lanka but worldwide, and on a scale that we have not seen so far. They will escalate that on a scale that will be quite frightening.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 45WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000270">I urge the Sri Lankan Government to think very seriously about that. The irony is that in the next two or three weeks they will undoubtedly achieve that military victory, in that they will capture the final strongholds of the LTTE, but they will actually snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. We should be thinking of how we persuade the Sri Lankan Government that they are about to achieve a tactical victory that is in fact a strategic defeat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000271">Let me explain where I disagree with hon. Members. At one level, I am impressed by the fact that the Sri Lankan Government have put out vast amounts of PR and publicity, just as the Tamil Tigers have, but I have not found it very sophisticated. If I were advising the Sri Lankan high commissioner, I would say, &#147;The one way you do not go about influencing the debate in the House of Commons is by defaming hon. Members. You try to produce arguments that will convince them that at the very least you have some arguments on your side.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para5"><a name="09032425000272">The Sri Lankan Government have damaged their case by refusing entry to the area of combat for journalists and they have an ambivalent attitude towards aid workers. At least the British can speak from experience on this matter. I suspect that if we had decided in the long conflict in Northern Ireland to do just that, we would have lost what in effect was a conflict 20 or 30 years&#146; ago. We would have certainly lost any form of support from within Ireland, southern Ireland, or indeed in the United States of America. In their own interests, I urge the Sri Lankan Government to reconsider. However, we should bear it in mind that it is not exactly easy for a journalist or an aid worker to have operated in the zones controlled by the LTTE, either. Putting aside those moral issues, I have sympathy for any Government who are fighting unconventional warfare when they have to reach a moral bar that is often far higher than that of the unconventional side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para6"><a name="09032425000273">I want to give the Minister as much time as possible to respond to the debate, so I shall briefly pull some thoughts together about what is to be done.</p>

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="09032425000274"><a name="90324h0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="09032425000595"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>

 If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will not, because I have very little time left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para7"><a name="09032425000276">The first question is how to persuade the Sri Lankan Government to allow the media and aid workers into the area now, that it is in their own interests to do so and that by not doing so, they are, ironically, aiding the LTEE. That should be our first priority, and I hope that the United Kingdom Government are doing that. Secondly, we should pressure them to evacuate civilians. Again, it is in their own public relations interest to evacuate civilians outside that area. Thirdly, we need to persuade them to let in a UN observer mission. If the Sri Lankan Government are convinced that they have right on their side and that the other side does not have right on its side, they should have nothing to fear from bringing in a UN observer mission. We should say to them that if they are unable to do all that, ultimately there may be a resolution at the United Nations Security Council and if they are unable to convince some of their own friends not to veto that, they will be facing serious problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para8"><a name="09032425000277">The fourth point concerns the role of the UK Government. I support what other hon. Members have said: the UK Government, unlike some Governments,  <br>

have, on the whole, taken an honourable lead in attempting to put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government, but also to mediate between the Government and the LTTE. There is a long history&#151;</p>

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="09032425000278"><a name="90324h0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="09032425000597"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>

 Please, I have just two more points to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000280">The proposal to send in a UK special envoy, the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne), was vetoed. Where are we on that now? Is the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s name still on the table? Have the Sri Lankan Government given any indication of the terms on which they might allow him in?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000281">The final point concerns the role of the Commonwealth. It does seem strange that in the Commonwealth ministerial action group, the Government were represented only by a junior Minister. There may have been very good logistical reasons why the Foreign Secretary or the Minister of State could not be at that meeting, but given its importance in terms of policy towards Fiji, let alone towards Sri Lanka, I find that strange. Perhaps the Minister will answer that question.</p>

 May I start by genuinely congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) on securing and leading the debate? She has been consistent in her advocacy on behalf of her Tamil constituents. I saw that at first hand when I addressed a meeting of a group of her constituents whom she brought to Westminster. I know that she will continue to make that case.</p>

One of the blunt realities is that we cannot just mandate actions on behalf of a Government in a different country.</p>

Spurious personal attacks on the character of individual Members by any high commission or embassy in this country are not only wrong and unacceptable, but completely counter-productive in advancing the cause of those involved, and I can assure hon.

the grave humanitarian situation and particularly about the fate of the large numbers of civilians caught up in the fighting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000287">As many hon. Members in the Chamber who are extremely knowledgeable about the situation know, the conflict in Sri Lanka has been raging for more than 25 years and has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 Sri Lankans. The dramatic advances by the Government forces since January have claimed the lives not only of Sri Lankan soldiers and LTTE cadres, but, most shockingly, of innocent civilians, including women and children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000288">The lack of independent reporting from the conflict area makes it impossible to obtain definitive figures. However, the UN estimates that more than 2,600 civilians have been killed and more than 7,200 have been injured since 20 January alone. Those figures are truly appalling. I very much agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden that nothing justifies what happened in Gaza, but the figures in this case are more significant. Given the conflict that is taking place, there has not been enough attention in the international media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000290">There are more civilian casualties every day, including those who were killed or wounded when a hospital, which had been declared a no-fire zone, was repeatedly hit by shells over a number of days in February. As I made clear in the House when Sri Lanka was last debated on 5 February, we expect and urge the Government of Sri Lanka fully to investigate any allegations of abuses by their forces. We would support a full and independent investigation into all concerns about war crimes, including the shelling of the hospital and other civilian deaths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000291">Hon. Members have understandably voiced concerns about accusations that Government forces have used cluster bombs and resorted to indiscriminate bombing, and we have raised those allegations with the Sri Lankan Government. Although they have stated that they do not use cluster munitions, we have made very clear to them our strong opposition to the use of such munitions and to indiscriminate bombings. We condemn the killings of civilians unequivocally and in the strongest possible terms, however they happen, and we have urged all parties to the conflict to avoid action against civilians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para20"><a name="09032425000292">We are now at a critical phase. The last remaining territory held by the LTTE measures less than 30 sq km, and large numbers of civilians&#151;internally displaced persons&#151;are trapped in that area. Since January, more than 40,000 IDPs have left the conflict area and moved into Government-controlled territory. Estimates of the numbers who remain vary from 70,000 according to the Sri Lankan Government to 200,000 according to the UN. These people have been repeatedly displaced over the past 18 months each time the front line has moved.</p>

them from doing so. A number of NGOs working in northern Sri Lanka have publicly stated that that is happening. The UN has also condemned the LTTE for forcibly recruiting civilians, including women and children. We must attack that on all fronts and we must express our concerns to the Sri Lankan Government. I urge anyone with influence and with access to the LTTE to put those concerns forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para22"><a name="09032425000294">Civilians have been under direct threat not only from the fighting, and there is enormous concern about the ability to get aid into the area. Much more needs to be done about that. It was because of our concerns about the humanitarian situation in the conflict area that the Prime Minister first called for a ceasefire on 14 January and wrote to President Rajapakse. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary followed that up by telephoning the President and urging him to declare a humanitarian ceasefire. We have been consistent in advancing that cause in all forums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para23"><a name="09032425000295">We have also rightly been releasing resources. Given the urgency of the situation, we have allocated a further &#163;2.5 million&#151;on top of the &#163;2.5 million that we committed in October 2008&#151;to support the efforts of humanitarian agencies in Sri Lanka. We have also sent a Department for International Development humanitarian expert to bolster the capacity of our high commission in Colombo to deal with the unfolding humanitarian situation. The hon. Member for Wimbledon asked about the post-conflict situation. The international community will inevitably need to assist with reconstruction efforts in communities affected by the conflict, and we will certainly play our part in such efforts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para24"><a name="09032425000296">We have not been working on this issue alone. One very helpful development in recent weeks was the joint statement by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State in the United States Government, which called for a &#147;temporary no-fire period&#148;. The co-chairs group&#151;the US, the EU, Japan and Norway&#151;has also called for the delivery of humanitarian aid and for the LTTE to discuss ways of ending the current hostilities.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for the forthright way in which he is presenting the Government&#146;s case. I also apologise to you, Mr. Williams, for arriving very late for the debate. We have reached a critical point in Sri Lanka. Reference was made earlier to the importance of India and the influence that it can bring to bear on the Government of Sri Lanka. Will my hon. Friend take up with the Indian Government the possibility of a joint initiative to bear down on the Sri Lankan Government so that they recognise the coming humanitarian disaster?</p>

 My hon. Friend has anticipated my very next sentence, because I was going to highlight the fact that the Indian Foreign Minister has visited Sri Lanka to discuss the humanitarian situation with the President. We continue to talk and work with the Indian Government on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para25"><a name="09032425000299">We have also been working with a wide range of multilateral forums. EU Ministers have called for a ceasefire. The key issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden was the Commonwealth, and although Sri Lanka was not on the formal agenda of the Commonwealth ministerial action group meeting this month, it was nevertheless rightly discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para26"><a name="09032425000300">The issue of our level of representation at that meeting has been raised. It was absolutely right that the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs was present. She is the Minister responsible for our relations with the Commonwealth, and I can assure hon. Members that she emphatically articulated the concerns that have been raised. She took the opportunity to brief CMAG and expressed our concerns about the humanitarian situation and the safety of civilians caught up in the fighting. She stressed the need for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow civilians to move to safety and for full access by the international humanitarian agencies. She also called attention to the letter that we had received from 11 hon. Members expressing their concerns about the Government of Sri Lanka and calling for Sri Lanka&#146;s suspension from the Commonwealth. CMAG did not call for a suspension, because there has not been an unconstitutional overthrow of democracy&#151;rightly or wrongly, that has been the basis for previous suspensions. Nevertheless, we have rightly raised our concerns in CMAG and directly with the Commonwealth secretariat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para27"><a name="09032425000301">The second key bone of contention that has been raised in the debate is the role of the UN. At the Security Council, we have sought discussion and regular briefings about the situation in Sri Lanka. We welcomed the visit to Sri Lanka in February by John Holmes, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. However, if we took a resolution to the Security Council, the reality is that we would not get the nine votes that were necessary or that it would be vetoed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="90324h0008.htm_para28"><a name="09032425000302">That brings me directly to the criticism from the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who leads for the Liberal Democrats. He talked about diplomatic weasel words, and if international diplomacy is just about feeling good about ourselves and what we say, that is the point that needs to be made. However, if we actually want to make an impact, we have to take a different course of action. My real concern is that if we went forward with a Security Council resolution and it was vetoed, we would no longer have the status quo, but an even worse situation, because the Sri Lankan Government would simply turn around and say, &#147;The United Nations has agreed with us that no action should be taken.&#148;</p>

I am sure that the Minister will, in replying, be keen to talk about the investment that has gone into the west coast main line. Undoubtedly, there has been considerable investment. However, the concern is that the entire focus of the investment seems to be on long-distance travel. In the past two or three years, while my constituents have suffered over-running engineering works, industrial action, delays and poor rolling stock&#151;problem after problem&#151;it has seemed that their concerns have come as very much a second thought to the Government, who have been focusing on long-distance travel. For example, shortly before the last general election, there was an announcement about the new Milton Keynes upgraded station, with extended platforms and an extra platform. Yet now that the upgrade is in place it is clear that the real reason for it was to help with through-travel through Milton Keynes, rather than particularly to help Milton Keynes commuters. Indeed, we seem to be going backwards in Milton Keynes now that we face the prospect of the closure of the travel office. Is that a sign of future service cuts?</p>

can no longer get on the rather efficient 32-minute trains provided by Virgin. There is no access to them at all, but it is actually worse than that. The appalling situation&#151;I say this with a slight smile on my face&#151;is rubbed in the face of commuters, who line the platform of Milton Keynes station as a Virgin train pulls up to allow passengers off but not allow anyone on, even though there are empty spaces and seats in the carriages. Can the Minister imagine seeing, on a cold winter&#146;s day, a nice, half-full Virgin train, as he waits to get on his overcrowded London Midland commuter train with no seats, and being told that he is not allowed to get on? It is frankly mean. I understand that at the moment Virgin Trains is more interested in the long-distance routes, but there is spare capacity on the trains. Why, in the interim, when there is such overcrowding on commuter trains, can we not continue to allow people to get on to some of the trains that stop in Milton Keynes as the last stop southbound to London?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000312">Virgin Trains, however, is not the focus of my remarks. I want to say more about London Midland. Since London Midland took over the franchise for the Milton Keynes Central to London Euston route&#151;and it still covers the Bletchley to Bedford route&#151;it is a matter of record that the service delivery has deteriorated markedly. Trains are unreliable. Many are subject to technical difficulties and there are crew shortages, rostering mistakes resulting in severe delays and many cancellations. Punctuality is poor and with many peak trains full, with standing room only, Milton Keynes commuters feel badly let down. Figures released by Network Rail in January 2009 show beyond any doubt that London Midland is the worst performing train operator in the UK. I have over the past few months received a deluge of correspondence from disappointed constituents, as has my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous). Many of those constituents are now considering car-sharing schemes or, ironically at a time when the Government are forcing Milton Keynes to expand, even relocating away from the city. I could occupy the whole debate with London Midland, but I will just make a few key points.</p>

<p><a name="st_91"><a name="09032425000313"><a name="90324h0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="09032425000607"><b>Andrew Selous:</b>
 In Leighton Buzzard London Midland has extended the car park without any regard to residents. Does my hon. Friend think that there should be some consideration of the effect of the structure, and what it looks like, on neighbouring residents?</p>

 My hon. Friend makes a valid point. There should be much greater consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para2"><a name="09032425000315">As to London Midland&#146;s performance for the route into London, its figure for trains arriving within five minutes of their scheduled time is 62.1 per cent., compared with an annual average of 76.5 per cent. and a target of 86.4 per cent. I am sure that the Minister agrees that those figures are unacceptable on what has been heralded as a brand new, refurbished railway using the latest trains. I am equally sure that he is aware that the delay-repay scheme is proving to be both lengthy and cumbersome. That is an issue that I have raised before in the House. Not only must passengers wait a considerable time for a response; with trains regularly delayed by 15 to 25 minutes, it is particularly irritating to commuters  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

that compensation is paid only for delays over 30 minutes and that season ticket holders are not entitled to a refund. The scheme appears to offer no incentives for London Midland to improve, although I hope that that is one of many points that the Minister will respond to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000316">Another bone of contention for commuters is the fact that London Midland has been cutting out stops on some services but not announcing that until passengers have boarded and left the station. The accusation is that that is being done to try to prop up the public performance measure. Despite London Midland&#146;s efforts, the most recent PPM puts its Northampton to Euston route at the bottom of the league table for the UK. Indeed, the latest PPM is actually worse than when London Midland first took over the franchise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000317">Is the Minister really happy that London Midland appears to be heading in entirely the wrong direction? If he really wants to know just what my constituents think of London Midland, he need look no further than the recent Passenger Focus survey on customer satisfaction, which shows decline in a number of areas since autumn 2007. They include ticket buying, helpfulness of staff, punctuality and reliability, connections with other services, poor management at times of disruption, particularly at London Euston&#151;I have several times experienced the fact that when a 12-car train arrives the automatic ticket barriers at Euston simply cannot cope&#151;and poor communication with customers and its own booking office staff, who are regularly left to deal with the fallout when things go wrong. Perhaps the Minister could comment on the fact that the Govia Go-Ahead Group train operating companies take up all three bottom league table places for the London and south-east area&#151;London Midland, Southern and Southeastern. What due diligence was exercised by the Department to satisfy the Minister that London Midland could deliver the quality of service it promised when the franchise was awarded?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will know that some of his constituents, and a number of mine, use the Marston Vale line, the Bedford to Bletchley service. He is no doubt also aware that in May Govia, or London Midland, closed the Bletchley train maintenance depot. Subsequently the performance and service on the Bedford to Bletchley line has deteriorated so much that its rail users association has given me a petition, which I intend to hand to the managing director of London Midland later. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a need urgently to review the policy of closing that depot, and the policy of taking train crews from Bedford to Bletchley to try to bolster a failing service on the main line?</p>

of additional senior and train crew management from Birmingham New Street and London Midland headquarters to the west coast depots. Together with various medium-term actions, such as a review of the timetable to address passenger and stakeholder-promoted improvements, London Midland hopes to improve performance; but, frankly, we will have to wait and see. However, it is clear that ongoing train crew rostering and industrial relations matters are slowing the progress of change.</p>

Does he believe that London Midland is meeting its franchise obligations? My constituents believe that it is not; if it is, perhaps the benchmarks have been set too low. As I have tried to explain, London Midland train services have been poor for several months. How long does the service have to remain at that level before the Minister will act?</p>

Why are there no non-stop services between Milton Keynes Central and Euston during the peak travelling period, as there used to be, yet there are non-stop services between similar-sized cities on other routes, such as Peterborough and Kings Cross or Reading and Paddington? Given the difficulties that London Midland and some other franchises are experiencing, coupled with the micro-management of those franchises by his Department, does the Minister believe that it is a proper way to run a national railway?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para8"><a name="09032425000323">I turn my attention to the impact of the demand management regulation of fares on train services between Milton Keynes and London. Although full details of the plan do not yet appear to be in the public domain, I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to add some meat to the bones and confirm that the broad intention is as follows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000324">By charging higher fares during the demand management period&#151;to laymen like me who are not versed in transport-speak it is the peak period&#151;the Department for Transport hopes to persuade commuters to travel in the shoulders of the peak, slightly earlier or later. Passengers travelling during the peak of the demand management period will see fare rises by up to RPI plus X&#151;currently 1 per cent.&#151;plus another 5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000325">The supposed advantage is that passengers who travel outside the peak period may pay less for their journeys. We should be clear about this; under the plan, commuters who lack work flexibility, who are forced to travel during peak hours, face yet another inflation-busting fare rise next year, on top of that already suffered this year, yet they will still have to suffer the appalling service that I have outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000326">Although the plan to be implemented is complicated, with any peak period potentially being split into more than one demand management period, I understand that during those periods the bidder will be free to do various things. The bidder will be able to vary the price charged for travel in the peak, by time and/or day, as they see fit, subject to the demand management fares regulation. The bidder will be free also to vary the nature of the products offered&#151;that is, tickets&#151;for travelling in the peak; for example, it will no longer be  <br>

compulsory to offer the classic, unlimited-journey, seven-day, monthly or longer season tickets. Although the London commuter fares basket will continue to operate, those flows designated as demand management flows currently within the basket will be removed, as will those that currently sit within the Birmingham commuter fares basket and the protected fares basket.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000327">I understand that under the timetable for introducing this policy, London Midland is expected to reach agreement with the Department for Transport on its plans by October 2009, with a likely introduction date of January 2010. Indeed, I believe that London Midland has already placed an order with a company to deliver the smartcard ticketing technology necessary to measure the number of passengers travelling at particular times. Particularly alarming, however, is the fact that the Department for Transport does not intend to consult passengers before the introduction of that policy. Will the Minister confirm that that is not true, and that there will be full consultation before any such plans are introduced?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000328">Given the broad thrust of the policy that I have outlined, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the comments made by Lord Adonis in response to questions during the Transport Committee&#146;s hearing on rail fares and franchises on Wednesday 25 February. Lord Adonis said:</p>
<a name="90324h0009.htm_brev1"><a name="09032425000473"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The point of regulation is to protect the passengers, especially commuters and others, who have little choice but to travel by rail.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000329">He went on to say:</p>
<a name="90324h0009.htm_brev2"><a name="09032425000474"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I can tell the Committee that we propose to accept one of the main Passenger Focus recommendations. Although the average fares cap is RPI+1% a year in most areas, many people face higher increases in regulated fares because operators have freedom to increase some fares by up to 5% above the average increase. Passenger Focus have recommended that restrictions should be placed on this flexibility and I am happy to tell the Committee that the Government proposes to do just that. In a time of economic stringency I do not think it acceptable for individual commuters to face significantly above average fare increases. The Government&#146;s intention is, therefore, that in future the cap should apply to individual regulated fares, not just to the average of each fares basket. My officials will talk to the train operators about the practical implications of making this change, but we are determined it should take effect from this coming year&#146;s fare changes.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000330">Although I and my local rail users group welcome that announcement, and Lord Adonis&#146;s view that he does not think it acceptable for individual commuters to face significantly above-inflation fare increases, I am struggling to reconcile that with the fare rises proposed under the Department for Transport&#146;s policy on demand management regulation, which could result in fare increases of 6 per cent. above RPI for travelling during peak hours. Crucially, I hope that the Minister will clarify that Lord Adonis is indeed correct, and that the current fare structure outlined by the demand management regulation will not be introduced. If it is, I fear that it may well be the final blow for the long-suffering Milton Keynes commuter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000331">If the Minister answers no other question, will he answer this one? Will the demand management of fares be coming to Milton Keynes any time soon?</p>

Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) in the few moments that remain. I congratulate him on securing the debate about an important issue for his constituents and other rail users on the west coast main line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para17"><a name="09032425000333">It is right that we have invested substantially in the west coast main line. That line is experiencing a record number of passenger and freight journeys. In the White Paper &#147;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&#148;, we set out the high-level output specification&#151;HLOS&#151;and how we intend to introduce improvements over the next control period, which ends in March 2014, and the moneys required to do so. The public performance measure to which the hon. Gentleman referred was that of London Midland, but overall the investment that we have been making in the railways is paying dividends in bringing higher levels of reliance and performance for a record number of passengers travelling on the railways. However, those successes raise further issues that need to be dealt with, not least in the interest of passengers represented by hon. Members in the Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000334">The Department does not consider the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents to be second rate compared with long-distance travellers, and it does give them more than a second&#146;s thought. I am also happy to put on record that London Midland&#146;s performance is unacceptable, which is why steps have been taken, and continue to be taken, to rectify the situation. I shall run through those steps and outline the sustainable changes, not short-term quick fixes, that are required. The Government&#146;s clear policy is financial commitment to improving performance across the network, and I share hon. Members&#146; concerns about the performance of both commuter and long-distance services using the west coast main line. The Department is taking a very active role in pushing for improved performance from the operators using the main line and from Network Rail, which is responsible for infrastructure, as hon. Members will be well aware.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000335">The &#163;8.9 billion west coast main line upgrade has brought tremendous improvements for many travellers, including those in major population centres such as London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. The line also conveys more than 40 per cent. of the nation&#146;s rail freight. In 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority laid out its strategy for the west coast route modernisation project and emphasised the importance of providing the extra growth required in London outer-suburban services, while taking account of population growth plans in the Northampton and Milton Keynes areas. It was also necessary to accommodate commuter trains affected by the increase in the number of long-distance passenger trains, because slower commuter trains could no longer share the fast lines between Euston and Milton Keynes with longer distance trains operating at full-peak frequencies at 125 mph.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para20"><a name="09032425000336">Furthermore, it was foreseen that the ability of the long-distance services to handle peak commuter loads from Milton Keynes would be reduced, primarily because line capacity would not permit many peak hour stops, and also because the capacity of the new trains on the route would be needed for the traffic growth in the long-distance markets. To address those problems, four particular steps were taken: first, the maximum speed on the slow lines between Euston and Northampton was increased to 100 mph to maintain the best possible  <br>

journey times, despite the change from the fast to the slow lines; secondly, high-performance electric trains&#151;the 350 Desiros&#151;were introduced on the Northampton, Milton Keynes and Euston services to exploit the faster line speeds; thirdly, 12-car trains, instead of eight-car trains, were introduced and platforms were lengthened between London and Northampton; and fourthly simplified timetable patterns were introduced with greater in-built resilience and fewer conflicting moves across busier corridors to ensure improved reliability and punctuality.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="09032425000337"><a name="90324h0009.htm_spnew5"><a name="09032425000612"><b>Andrew Selous:</b>
 With respect to London Midland, how many extra seats will be available to passengers at Leighton Buzzard? The amount of available seating is critical, given housing growth and the fact that the services start further north and have more people on them. Can the Minister help me on that point?</p>

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="09032425000338"><a name="90324h0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="09032425000613"><b>Paul Clark:</b>
 I am certainly willing to help and shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para21"><a name="09032425000339">Although the overall performance of the railways has improved tremendously, the performance of commuter services on the west coast main line in the south has indisputably fallen. On 14 December 2008, a planned commissioning timetable was put in place on the west coast main line to allow a phased introduction of the high-frequency timetable. At the same time, the London Midland franchise made several changes and improvements: it reinstated direct services from Birmingham to London; and it introduced a new hourly service along the Trent valley lines, as part of the new direct Crewe-Northampton-London service. In addition, a new service from Milton Keynes to East Croydon was introduced, operated by Southern railway, which came into being in the middle of February and provides additional connectivity for commuters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para22"><a name="09032425000340">As hon. Members have said, however, some operational performances have been unacceptable. The commissioning timetable, which has placed additional pressures on the work loads of London Midland train crews, combined with high levels of sickness and low levels of staff volunteering for overtime, led to an unacceptably high level of cancellations prior to Christmas. In addition, engineering and infrastructure failures impacted on engineering works at Milton Keynes Central during late December last year. All that affected performance. Again, in the first few weeks of the year, a number of engineering infrastructure failures and incidents occurred. Network Rail is investigating them, but they do not appear to have been linked. However, steps will be taken and lessons learned. In addition, of course, we must remember the heavy snowfall in early February. All that has led to unacceptable performances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para23"><a name="09032425000341">The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes referred to the delay-repay scheme, which he believes is not working acceptably, but it was supposed to be a simple and quick scheme. The figures for London Midland, which I particularly wanted to see, show that, in period 11&#151;prior to February&#151;a substantial number of reclaims were made, as one would expect, bearing in mind the difficulties experienced. However, that led to a delay in processing, and for the first time there has been a small build up in outstanding claims. Refunds are available on 30-minute delays and beyond, and of course season ticket holders can claim. They are entitled to the same scale of refund based on the daily proportional cost of the ticket.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para24"><a name="09032425000342">My noble Friend Lord Adonis is due to meet London Midland and Network Rail. We are keen to govern and monitor the performance of all train operators and regular meetings are held to that effect. I expect London Midland and Network Rail to appear before his performance group shortly. I have put on record the steps taken with other franchisees to introduce remedial plans. First Great Western is one example where improvements have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para25"><a name="09032425000343">Demand management falls under the franchise agreement, but it could not be introduced without the Government&#146;s full agreement and without going through the necessary processes. No indications have been given that that will happen, but we have taken steps before to delay the introduction of demand management, and we could do so again. However, that is not currently exercising London Midland to the extent implied by the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes. It is concerned with improving performance, and that has started to pay off with the introduction of new rolling stock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="90324h0009.htm_para26"><a name="09032425000344">I reiterate what my noble Friend said to the Select Committee. Prices will fall if the retail prices index is negative in July, even with the plus 1 per cent. Furthermore, the basket will be removed to deny the flexibility for increases on selected regulated fares of RPI plus 1 per cent. plus 5 per cent. That flexibility will not exist in future timetables. We have taken a number of steps to begin to rectify the situation, but issues remain to be addressed. I guarantee to hon. Members in the Chamber, and to others who have made representations, including the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Milton Keynes colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), that we will continue to take the steps required.</p>

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="09032425000345"><a name="90324h0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="09032425000614"><b>Mr. Ian Cawsey (Brigg and Goole) (Lab):</b>
 May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams? I am grateful to have the opportunity to debate Government support for the steel industry. It is a timely debate, and I am pleased that my colleagues, who share my interests in the steel industry, are in the Chamber with me. I am sure that we will all be interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say when he responds to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para0"><a name="09032425000346">I start from the simple premise that manufacturing is important to the UK economy. Steel is a fundamental part of manufacturing and, as such, it must be retained in this country. As an industry, steel has been badly hit by the global economic downturn, yet it underpins our manufacturing base and is critical to construction, infrastructure and the automotive industries. Simply put, UK steel is vital to the recovery of manufacturing in the UK, and we must do all that we can to protect it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000347">The last few months have been traumatic for everyone in the industry. Corus reports that business is down by an average of 40 per cent. Steel prices have fallen, and 40 per cent. of production capacity is now idle. Yesterday&#146;s figures showed that output from the Scunthorpe plant, where my constituents work, is at a 50-year low. Workers have had their number of shifts reduced with a corresponding cut in income. Across the country, 2,500 steel jobs have been lost. One could look at any steel company in any country and see that it is experiencing similar problems. In seeking this debate, my purpose was to open a discussion on how we, in the UK, can ensure that steel is helped through this period and that we retain capacity for the future. It is important that as the world economy picks up&#151;as sure as eggs is eggs that day will come&#151;the UK is in a position to benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para2"><a name="09032425000348">This morning, I was interviewed by my local radio station, Radio Humberside. It was put to me that the Government could not be expected to bail out everyone at the taxpayer&#146;s expense. However, I am not talking about a return to the days of endless subsidy. This is about sensible support for a key industry through a unique and challenging period to ensure that it is still there when business around the world begins to recover. As further food for thought, let me say that other countries in the EU are allowing their steel manufacturers to access state help for those on short-time working, including training assistance. Clearly, that puts the UK steel industry at a competitive disadvantage if there is nothing similar in our country. Of course, there is a cost to that, but there is a cost to unemployment, too, and to short-time working. The taxpayer ends up paying for both, either through benefits for people who are on the dole, such as those claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance, or by an increasing reliance on income-related tax credits as short-time working reduces basic pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000349">In an industry that is essential to the country and that will come round as the world economy picks up, I would argue that it is better to use taxpayers&#146; resource to keep people in work and to retain our steel capacity than it is to pay for people to be unemployed and to lose the capacity to other countries which are taking steps to protect their steel production.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an excellent argument and some very important points. People are being hard hit by shift reductions and the loss of their incomes. Does he agree that it is an investment to use support for training, in the same way that it is when companies try to maintain their work force and their skills? We can invest in skills and skill training while, at the same time, giving both the workers and the industry some support in a difficult time.</p>

 Although I do not want to start a long history lesson on the trials and tribulations of steel production in the UK over the years, I would say that in the days of the old British Steel, in the recession of the 1980s, one of the big mistakes was the complete lack of training. The industry was instantly culled as a way of surviving in business at that time. Even to this day, we see the holes and skills shortages.</p>

and infrastructure projects. Hopefully, we will see more of that. Even in my own area, which is covered by North Lincolnshire council&#151;I am pleased that the leader of the council, Mark Kirk, is here for this debate&#151;and the East Riding of Yorkshire council, it is not just the Government who are introducing schemes, but the councils as well. North Lincolnshire is rebuilding secondary schools and constructing a big new entertainment centre and sports academy. East Riding council is building 300 council houses, which is a good construction project providing much-needed social housing. Such things are needed if we are to support the industry through this difficult phase.</p>

That would help in the challenges ahead and make productive use of the fact that there are fewer shifts available. As well as improving the skills base for the steel companies, it would also mean that if there are future job losses, we will be helping to reskill workers while they are in employment rather than waiting until they are out of work. In that way they will be able to pick up the new economies and new businesses that will come.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is often forgotten in this argument that the big changes involved in restructuring the steelworks 25 years ago moved a lot of people out of direct employment with what was then British Steel into contracting. Although they might not be on the books and in the figures, they are still a key part of local employment and rely heavily for work on a successful steel industry and supply chains.</p>

In my view, steel qualifies. Would it not be the case, though, that any scheme would have to target carefully, even within the steel industry, in order to ensure that the industry is ultra-skilled and absolutely ready to exploit any upturn that comes along, particularly in relation to the new green technologies and the new generation of nuclear power plants that we are hoping to build in the next few years?</p>

 I agree. Clearly, new technologies are potentially exciting for the steel industry. As one drives out of Scunthorpe one can see, on the border between my constituency and that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), wind turbines sprouting like daffodils in spring. Every week when we go back, there is another one. They are enormous structures, and we want British steel to be part of the manufacturing base for them and for other forms of renewable energy. The challenges are there for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para6"><a name="09032425000362">In terms of what a support package could be, many other countries are already putting such ideas into practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) mentioned the Welsh Assembly&#146;s ProAct scheme a few minutes ago. As I understand it, the scheme was originally intended for the automotive industry and provided both &#163;2,000 worth of training and &#163;2,000 in wage subsidy to each eligible individual. Next month, the scheme will apply to other industries in Wales, including steel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para7"><a name="09032425000363">Last month, the Prime Minister said of the scheme:</p>
<a name="90324h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09032425000475"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Through the Assembly, Wales has developed a new programme called ProAct to help people to stay in jobs rather than be made unemployed, and a great deal of work is being done by us to look at that scheme and at how it could apply to other parts of the United Kingdom.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 4 February 2009; Vol. 123, c. 487.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para8"><a name="09032425000364">Perhaps the Minister can update us on the progress of that work when he replies to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000365">Corus has made use of a Dutch scheme for its Netherlands plant. Under that scheme, the work force has access to state aid for employees and companies in cases of national crisis, and the Dutch Government have decided to relax the criteria to cover the current global events. The scheme is now being put into place. Germany has a similar scheme to support income for those in a period of short-time working, as does Austria. In France, Mittal Steel, car manufacturers Renault and PSA, and tyre manufacturer Michelin have called on the French short-time compensation programme. President Sarkozy has proposed to extend the scheme to give significantly more assistance to keep people in work until the worldwide situation improves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000366">There are plenty of schemes to consider. Increasingly, Governments are coming to the conclusion that in these unprecedented times, it is a better use of taxpayers&#146; money to ride out the downturn, keep capacity in core industries and keep people in work rather than on benefits. My hon. Friend the Minister may have seen the joint proposal from the TUC and the Federation of Small Businesses for constructing a short-term working subsidy. If not, I have a copy that I can pass to him. In their submission, they say of their scheme:</p>
<a name="90324h0010.htm_brev1"><a name="09032425000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Such support would enable employers to avoid immediate redundancies and retain essential staff and skills, making business success more likely in both the short and longer terms. It would also reduce the personal and social costs incurred by long-term unemployment...and increase economic demand by limiting the income reductions faced by workers on short-term hours or temporary lay-offs. If linked to training, it would enable longer-term workforce investment.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para11"><a name="09032425000368">I cannot disagree with any of that. Surely all those outcomes would be desirable for the Government to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000369">There is, of course, a cost to the scheme&#151;it is costed at &#163;1.2 billion&#151;but it would keep 600,000 people in work. I have never subscribed to the view that unemployment is a price well worth paying. One of the things that separates the governing party from Her Majesty&#146;s official Opposition is our view on that. If we can spend &#163;1.2 billion to protect 600,000 jobs, that would be a price well worth paying. It strikes me that although we all face the same problems around the world, how we respond is crucial to how soon and how extensively our recovery will be. Those who use this   <br>

period imaginatively to keep people in work, to retrain and to protect incomes and economic activity will win the battle and come out of the downturn with their core industries in place. We in the UK must show that we have the ideas and imagination to do so for our key industries, such as steel. Our workers and our country deserve no less.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey) on securing this debate. I am deeply conscious of the importance of the steel industry not only to his constituency but to those of other colleagues who have come here to express their concerns about the difficulties faced by the sector as a result of the current economic situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000371">The Corus plant at Scunthorpe employs many people in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency. The company&#146;s plans to restructure its businesses, announced on 26 January, will clearly have worried the employees concerned, their families, the communities in which they live and the region as a whole. I fully appreciate the potential implications for the economy in Lincolnshire. The decision was, of course, a commercial one for the company. I understand that Corus has been forced to make such difficult decisions in order to remain competitive and safeguard the future of its operations in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000372">My hon. Friend will know very well that the steel industry is notoriously cyclical. Major slumps in  prices and output occurred regularly throughout the 20th century. However, the current recession is considered by many industry insiders to be more extreme than any in living memory. In the first half of 2008, the global steel industry experienced unprecedented price increases due to a combination of global factors, including excessive input price inflation. By July, prices were 70 per cent. higher than at the start of the year. In September, high prices combined with the economic slow-down signalled a sudden depression in demand. During the latter half of 2008, the industry globally failed to anticipate the sudden drop in demand and did not lower output rates quickly enough. As a result, significant stocks have built up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000373">By January this year, prices were back to their January 2008 levels, but demand has settled at 30 per cent. lower than capacity. Stock levels are still extremely high, and the situation is depressing prices. We are going through a process of de-stocking that will provide some support for prices and should help output to return to a more reasonable level of about 70 per cent. of capacity by the end of 2009. None the less, the steel industry has had to take some tough decisions. Some analysts predict that it could take up to four years before output returns to full capacity. Steel companies around the world have made huge cuts in output in an attempt to weather the storm. Sadly, the UK sector has lost approximately 2,800 jobs in an attempt to balance supply with demand and reduce costs. In addition, short-time working and pay freezes have been introduced across the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000374">As my hon. Friends will be aware, the UK&#146;s largest steel producer, Corus, announced in November last year that it had begun to make significant production cuts, which will continue to have an effect. On 26 January,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Mar 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>24 Mar 2009 : Column 63WH</b><br>
it announced the loss of 3,500 jobs&#151;2,500 in the UK and 1,000 in Europe. However, Corus still employs some 41,000 people group-wide, mostly in Europe, of which 24,000 are employed in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para17"><a name="09032425000375">Help for people affected by those job cuts has been put in place. Where significant job losses have occurred, a local taskforce has been established to co-ordinate the support services and help people find new jobs. That taskforce is led by Jobcentre Plus, and includes the Learning and Skills Council, Business Link, the regional development agency, local authorities and trade union representatives. The package includes careers advice and information, skills training, CV and interview preparation, advice from Business Link for those considering setting up in business and advice on benefits. Help from Jobcentre Plus and the rapid response team will also be available to those who face redundancy in the Corus supply chain in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para18"><a name="09032425000376">My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole focused a large part of his speech on wage subsidies. As he will be aware, the Government&#146;s long-standing position has been that each country should make policies to suit its own economic framework. Although some countries have introduced wage subsidies in order to retain jobs, we have promoted training for firms&#151;something that my hon. Friend indicated as being the right approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para19"><a name="09032425000377">The UK has permanent structural advantages in the labour market compared with many other countries. As well as labour market flexibility, the UK system also delivers on-costs&#151;employers&#146; social security contributions that are not only temporarily lower in the way that wage subsidies are, but which are permanently lower than in Germany, France and the Netherlands. In this country, the gap between total labour costs and take-home pay is much less than in some other countries because social security contributions from employees and employers, and direct taxes, are lower.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para20"><a name="09032425000378">The UK could not introduce wage subsidies in the same form as in Germany and the Netherlands, for example. First, the Dutch and German systems can, through the social security system, make payments to the company. By contrast, benefits in the UK are paid to the individual, who is required to look for work while in receipt of those benefits. It is a fundamentally different system. Secondly, benefit systems in those other countries are earnings-related and typically provide 60 to 70 per cent. of earnings. In the UK, unemployment benefit is very different in its level and in the way it operates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="90324h0010.htm_para21"><a name="09032425000379">In surveys on labour market policies, the OECD concluded that wage subsidy schemes are extremely costly&#151;that is why my hon. Friend mentioned the importance of training. One of the reasons why such schemes are found to be costly is that the dead-weight is high; many eligible firms would have retained workers without the subsidy, and the reduction in profits and wages is now being paid for by the Government. The subsidy acts to create distortions and perverse incentives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="90324h0011.htm_para1"><a name="09032425000381">We will continue to look at ways of extending help. I know that Yorkshire Forward is working on training subsidies with Jobcentre Plus, and we are looking at what more the Government can do. My hon. Friend mentioned the Welsh ProAct initiative. That programme provides training for employees who have been put on short-time working, and offers an alternative to redundancy through retraining on days that are not being worked. It also includes support to ensure that apprentices complete their training.</p>

 As I mentioned, during Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time, the Prime Minister has indicated that he was looking for ways to push a scheme such as ProAct out across the country. I accept that the Minister might not be in a position to answer that point today, but perhaps he could write to hon. Members to let us know what progress is being made.</p>

That can be avoided through careful control, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) alluded to. We can get the benefits without the disadvantages. It is about subsidy and links to training, which we need while people are in work rather than on jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

 I understand my hon. Friend&#146;s point. The Government have talked to Welsh colleagues about the ProAct scheme. We are familiar with how it operates and we are aware of the request that was made in the submission to which he referred. He mentioned the comment made by the Prime Minister about the ProAct scheme; that issue is currently being discussed in other Government Departments. Our position has always been that a general wage subsidy scheme would not be appropriate for the UK&#146;s economic circumstances. However, we are keen to look at how we could provide further support, principally through selective training assistance. My hon. Friend will be aware of a number of things that we have already done, such as introducing greater flexibilities in the Train to Gain system.</p>

We have supported more than 1,000 steel company sites this academic year, ranging from producers of basic metal to manufacturers of fabricated metal products. I appreciate the point that my hon.

 My hon. Friend is right. One of the important things about the university challenge bid is that the locations for a further education offer are already in place in Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough. A university could be bolted on to such locations. The template exists locally in the three major towns in north Northamptonshire to provide doorstep access to higher education for many local people who currently do not aspire to it. If people do aspire to higher education, they currently have to go further afield to access the higher education that they seek.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing the debate. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) and the Minister of State, Department of Health, my good and hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope) on their work towards and long commitment to getting a university centre in north Northamptonshire. The hon. Member for Kettering spoke on the subject no less convincingly than he has spoken on previous occasions when he has raised the matter in the House and made direct representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para3"><a name="09032425000423">I must make it clear for the public record that the final decision on whether to establish a university centre in the Kettering-Corby-Wellingborough area will not be taken by me or my right hon.

That body will take that decision on the basis of assessing the bids against the published criteria and according to their comparative quality. It would not, of course, be proper for members of the Government to intervene in that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para4"><a name="09032425000424">I know that the hon. Member for Kettering is already aware of all of that.

colleges Moulton college, Northampton college and Tresham institute. The strategy is an important initiative, and I was pleased to launch it. It would be right to say that it and the ambition for the wider area are partly based on the hope and expectation that a new university might come to the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para6"><a name="09032425000426">I should make it clear that I do not wish to take issue with the basic argument that a new university centre would bring great benefits to north Northamptonshire. I clearly recognise that a new university centre would make a key contribution to the regeneration of the area by unlocking the potential of the local towns and people and by driving economic growth. I say that as someone who spent seven wonderful years at school in Peterborough, just next door. I am acutely aware of the nature of the people and the environment, of the histories of the area&#146;s market towns, and of the contribution that a university could make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para7"><a name="09032425000427">There was a time when most people regarded universities as separate from everyday life, and certainly as largely separate from the lives of the communities in which they were situated. That is no longer true. Universities and their communities have drawn closer in recent years and, if anything, the effects of the economic downturn have given added impetus to that process. Businesses and ordinary working people are becoming increasingly aware that the world of higher education has something important to offer them. I was pleased when I was in Northampton that so many local businesses and the local chamber of commerce were there alongside the university and the colleges. That indicated the strength of ambition in that important growth area of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para8"><a name="09032425000428">At the same time, the universities have come round to the view that the unprecedented levels of public funding that they now enjoy confer a responsibility on them to demonstrate their value to the generality of the population, not just the 2.5 million or so people who are taking degrees at any one time. That was demonstrated graphically by Universities UK&#146;s aptly named brochure on higher education and the economic downturn, &#147;Standing together: Universities helping business through the downturn&#148;. It was published at the end of last year and contains many examples of how universities are working in partnership with local and regional employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para9"><a name="09032425000429">All over the country, universities are now getting involved with local authorities, regional development agencies, chambers of commerce and bodies such as Business Link. They are sitting down at the table with those who are making strategic decisions for the local area. They are representing future skills needs in those conversations, and it is hugely important that they are able to drive the ambitions of our local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para10"><a name="09032425000430">The universities are looking to take more of their knowledge and innovation out to the marketplace through knowledge transfer. They are taking more of their tuition off campus and out to the workplace itself. That should be welcomed by everyone who is interested in social and economic development. In short, it means that universities are becoming an ever more integral and, indeed, indispensable part of the economic supply chain and our social fabric.</p>

with the rural-industrial past that his has needs real drivers to achieve ambitions. We all know that it cannot be about housing stock only. It has to be about infrastructure that lifts the aspirations not just of young people but of adults and parents as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para12"><a name="09032425000432">That is why HEFCE is now offering new support for co-funding of courses by universities and employers.

Friend the Secretary of State announced last year will bring a higher education presence to communities in parts of the country that have not previously benefited from or been served by one at all. Our ambition is that 20 new university centres will be opened or committed to over the six-year period up to 2014. They will provide places for 10,000 extra students when fully operational.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para13"><a name="09032425000433">The new university challenge has generated significant enthusiasm in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s area and elsewhere. Applications from no fewer than 27 areas were submitted to HEFCE last November. That demonstrates the appetite for high-level skills and understanding across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para14"><a name="09032425000434">Formal applications for university centres must be made to HEFCE which, as I said, will judge them on a fair basis against the criteria. HEFCE published its detailed guidance for applications on 9 March and made it clear that applications must address a range of priorities, including increasing high-level skills, creating a highly skilled work force for the local economy, and supporting progression and sustainable demand for studying. Applications must also meet criteria for collaboration between universities and further education institutions. I know that that is an area of activity where Northamptonshire already has a strong record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para15"><a name="09032425000435">Crucially, applicants need to be able to demonstrate support from local partners, as well as long-term sustainable planning and management capacity. Those are all good reasons for hon. Members to continue to lead in making the formal case for developments to the funding council with the support of local people, local businesses and funding bodies such as the regional development agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="90324h0012.htm_para16"><a name="09032425000436">Although challenging, the criteria are sufficiently flexible to be adaptable in principle to any part of the country. I can therefore assure hon. Members that the final choice of successful applications is in no way a foregone conclusion. There is no single model for a new higher education centre nor a defined set of acceptable models. In most cases, we anticipate supporting new higher education centres that are based in or linked to existing providers offering new opportunities. We do not rule out the possibility of the creation of a genuinely new university in the longer term if a strong case can be made for one.</p>
