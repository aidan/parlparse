 It is a pleasure to open the debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. When I go door to door, talking with local residents, as I do every week, few issues are raised with me as often as the pressures and problems caused throughout my constituency by houses in multiple occupation and flat conversions in residential areas. The problems are all too often noise, poor refuse disposal, unkempt gardens and parking nuisance, and sometimes poor living conditions, too. If one house in a street is like that, it is a problem for neighbours. If there are half a dozen, that corrodes people&#146;s quality of life to the point at which they start thinking about selling, and if they do sell, the chances are that it will be to another landlord seeking to let HMOs. As the problems compound, areas can be locked into a vicious circle, with a downward spiral in local amenity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000012">The private rented sector accounts for 26 per cent. of dwellings in Oxford&#151;about twice the national average&#151;and the pressures and problems of multiple occupation are having a major impact on residential amenity and even on the sense of community in parts of the city. Multiple occupation, which used to be concentrated in one or two areas, is spreading throughout the city, with an unacceptable impact on the quality of life not only for neighbours but for many of those who reside in HMOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000013">One of the first things that I did in the House 20 years ago was to introduce a private Member&#146;s Bill on fire safety standards in multiply occupied houses&#151;the Fire Safety Information Bill&#151;which was killed off by the Conservative Government. It is scandalous that council inspectors still find that as many as 17 per cent. of properties lack smoke alarms or basic fire safety precautions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000014">The immediate catalyst for my seeking today&#146;s debate was the fact that the Department for Communities and Local Government is considering an application from Oxford city council for the extension of HMO licensing across the city. I should like to concentrate on the case for such licensing, some thoughts that I have on enforcement and how it should be paid for, and the need for much tighter planning control over HMOs&#151;a matter pressed last year by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) in his excellent ten-minute Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000015">I do not suggest that all the problems in my area can be solved by tougher control and regulation. They arise partly from what I often describe as the pressure cooker effect in Oxford of an artificially tight green belt constraining the supply of housing, alongside a very successful economy, two universities stimulating huge demand for single-person housing, and large-scale inward commuting. We need  <br>

urgently to release more land for housing on the edge of Oxford to meet the need for that accommodation as well as for family housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000016">I stress that I do recognise the positive contribution of good landlords as well as the problems caused by bad ones. Most of what I suggest would, I think, be supported by responsible landlords. Indeed, one letting agent in my constituency has written in support of the Oxford city bid, pointing out that a robust licensing scheme, along with the accreditation of letting agents&#151;which I also support&#151;would prevent the good landlords being undercut by the bad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000017">Let me focus on licensing. I welcome the Government&#146;s introduction of licensing through the Housing Act 2004. I welcome the current review of the private rented sector, looking generally at standards of accommodation and the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, and I welcome the more recently announced specific review of HMOs, which will feed into the wider private sector review. I also welcome the progress being made with the scheme to protect tenancy deposits. Important and positive steps have been taken, but we still, certainly in Oxford, need to go further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000018">The Oxford experience is that where licence applications are required and have been made, that is making a difference. Mandatory licensing has resulted in improvements to more than 70 per cent. of the houses for which applications have been received. However, the mandatory scheme applies only to houses of three or more storeys and with five or more occupants. The city council has applied to the DCLG for general city-wide licensing of HMOs, and I strongly support that proposal. It is the only way in which we will have a scheme that is readily understood by the public, tenants and landlords alike. If approved, it will provide valuable experience of a model that will certainly be applicable elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000019">There is already evidence&#151;we always have to be alert to perverse consequences&#151;of some landlords adjusting the number of tenants in their HMOs to avoid mandatory licensing. If additional licensing were introduced only in specific areas of the city, there would be a real risk of that displacing unlicensed HMOs to the other parts of the city. That happened under an earlier registration scheme.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on securing this important debate. I wonder whether he has seen in Oxford a situation similar to the one that I have seen in Hove and Portslade, which has the highest number of HMOs outside London. Tenants can move into an area, but the issue is not specifically the number of tenants in a house; it is the number of occupants. If there is a large number of such HMOs in an area that was made up of family streets, that can drive families out of the area.</p>

 I agree. I am sure that my hon. Friend&#146;s experience in her constituency is similar to what we are encountering in Oxford. She is right. I referred to the vicious circle effect as the growth of multiple occupation compounds itself, often greatly to the detriment of community life and general and residential amenity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000022">There is a further advantage to a general licensing scheme in Oxford. Although councils do currently have responsive powers, tenants in HMOs are often vulnerable, unable to complain, or concerned that doing so will  <br>

prompt an eviction. There is a wider issue in that respect, which I will come back to, but for HMOs proactive licensing by the council would be an enormous help. I have heard that Ministers are cautious about designations that cover whole local authority areas. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to take a close look at that&#151;</p>

 That sedentary intervention might have come from the direction of the Parliamentary Private Secretary. I greatly welcome his support in this matter. Care and effectiveness, rather than caution, is what we need. Residents are understandably looking to us as Members of Parliament and to the Government to get a grip on the issue. I put it to the Minister that that will not be done on a piecemeal basis in areas such as mine, where all parts of the city are to some extent affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000025">A related issue that I would urge the Minister and those undertaking the current reviews to take a close look at is the operation of planning law with regard both to those HMOs that do not currently require planning consent, and to the guidance on what is acceptable in terms of planning approvals where those are required. The present position is unacceptable, both because many conversions of family houses to HMOs do not require planning permission and because, even where they do, local authorities are often apprehensive about decisions being overturned on appeal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000026">In a ten-minute Bill last year, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test proposed that the Housing Act 2004 definition of a family be brought into planning law so that all relevant conversions to non-family housing involving more than four tenants would require planning consent. I urge the Minister to revisit that proposal, or indeed to look at any other practical means of bringing such conversions within the scope of planning control if he is not convinced that my hon. Friend&#146;s proposal is the way forward.</p>

 Does my right hon. Friend accept that the problem that he has outlined relates to the fact not only that there are different definitions of a household in planning and housing law but that the numbers of households covered by planning and housing law are very different? What most people would regard as HMOs will therefore escape any regulation unless the two definitions are aligned. Indeed, about 11,500 of the 12,000 HMOs in Southampton effectively escape the registration system because of the difference in the definitions.</p>

As he says, it cannot be good for people&#146;s understanding of the rules or their compliance with them if they do not know where they stand in relation to the housing legislation on the one hand or the planning legislation on the other.

through their communities is producing enormous pressure, but they can regulate, and they have the power to shape, only a small number of developments, while the rest just carry on. That makes people feel powerless and, in some cases, angry that the system is not more responsive to their needs.</p>

Friends the Members for Southampton, Test and for Hove (Ms Barlow) could too&#151;where one house after another is being converted from family to multiply occupied use. That totally changes the area&#146;s character, but there is next to no planning control.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman might be aware that the aspect and character of large parts of Manchester were completely changed in the early part of the 20th century, when houses went from being owned by fairly wealthy families to multiple occupancy. It looks as if that is a one-way street and that those houses and areas will now never be anything other than multiple occupancy.</p>

 Indeed, and it is that apparently irrevocable change in the character of areas that leaves people so concerned. Hon. Members should not, however, get me wrong on this, because I of course accept that those who live in multiple occupation need somewhere to live. In university cities, we certainly want to keep up the pressure on the universities to provide as much purpose-built accommodation for students as they can on their own land. However, changing demographic patterns in society, such as smaller households, mean that a whole variety of people need accommodation, and they are also entitled to the decent standards that a properly licensed and regulated system can provide.</p>

 I welcome the responsible manner in which the right hon. Gentleman is approaching this real problem, but we must take great care to avoid regulation that removes low-cost housing, because the tenants who need it are often very vulnerable. However, the root cause of the problem has been the massive demand for low-cost housing over recent years, and the biggest factor driving that is not demographic change but uncontrolled immigration from certain countries in the European Union. I do not wish to be provocative, but we must address that because it is a valid area of public concern and public policy.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman advances a familiar argument. Of course, migration is part of this. In Oxford, it certainly plays a small part, alongside pressure from students and changes in the nature of households. The hon. Gentleman will perhaps call a debate on immigration, but I should point out that the Government are introducing the points-based immigration system. Furthermore, when he speaks of migrants&#151;certainly in the context of Oxford&#151;he should look at who does much of the essential caring work in our hospitals and care homes. If he does, he will see the benefits that migrants bring to our community. I celebrated Filipino independence day the other Saturday at a huge event at the John Radcliffe hospital.

contribution of members of the Filipino and other communities, and those people are entitled to somewhere decent to live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000034">A bone of contention in areas of multiple occupation where the houses are occupied by students is that no council tax is paid. The Minister can point to the adjustments in revenue support grant, which are supposed to compensate for that, but I am sceptical about whether those adjustments fully reimburse local communities for the direct and indirect costs of concentrations of multiple occupation by students. I proposed to the Lyons review of local government finance that owners of multiply occupied properties should pay a supplementary council tax or charge, which would be dedicated to meeting the costs of a fully enforceable licensing scheme, including the knock-on effects on parking and the nature of the streets and the additional cost of refuse collection. I urge the Minister and his colleagues to look again at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000035">One argument that is sometimes made against such proposals, and indeed against licensing in general, is that the cost would be passed on to tenants. In a competitive rental market, however, the cost might not be passed on&#151;at least not in total. In any event, the extra safety and security and the improvement to the living environment that such a scheme would provide would be excellent value for tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000036">I also press the Minister to look at the problem of retaliatory eviction, which is of wider relevance in the private rented sector. Fast-track eviction is used against tenants who try to secure their statutory rights to repairs or improvements on health and safety grounds. It cannot be right that people go in fear of eviction just for raising repair and safety issues, but evidence from the English housing survey shows that although 21 per cent. of private tenants were dissatisfied with their landlords&#146; repairs and maintenance of the property, only a quarter tried to enforce their rights. The fear of eviction was a significant factor in explaining why people did not raise such issues with their landlords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000037">As the Minister will be aware, Citizens Advice, together with the Child Poverty Action Group, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and others, are campaigning against this abuse of section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. It is important to note that they are saying not that section 21 should be abolished but that its use should be restricted where a reasonable request for repairs has been made by a tenant but has not been addressed by the landlord. Other mandatory and discretionary grounds for eviction would continue to apply. I very much hope that the Minister can give an assurance that the matter is being looked at and that he will add it to the list of issues that I am asking him to ensure that the Rugg and Rhodes review covers. As I am sure he is aware, it is important to deal with the issue if we are to guarantee the reasonable rights of tenants and ensure that standards in private rented accommodation are raised, as we all want them to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000038">Given the growth in student numbers, changing demographic patterns&#151;for example, the increase in single households&#151;the crisis of affordability in the south-east and particularly in Oxford, and the acute shortage of social housing, it is clear that the regulation of private rented housing is a challenge of growing importance. Our legal framework and our planning and enforcement procedures must be urgently updated to meet that challenge.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on his good fortune in securing the debate, on his choice of subject, and on the reasoned and persuasive way in which he presented his case. A long time ago I spent three years in the city that he has the privilege of representing. Whether the college that I occupied was a house in multiple occupation I am not quite sure; however, the issues that he has mentioned, of poor-quality accommodation outside the colleges, are as live now as they were then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000041">Housing is nearing the top of the political agenda at the moment, having spent quite a long time in the relegation zone. The Government&#146;s ambitious target of 3 million homes by 2020 is looking increasingly ambitious. One could argue that of the three main housing sectors&#151;owner-occupation, social renting and private renting&#151;the one that we are debating is the only one operating effectively at the moment. Supply is way behind demand for social renting&#151;below the levels of the 1990s. In the owner-occupation sector, builders have stopped buying land and are closing building sites, and mortgage finance is scarce and expensive. One could argue that the sector that is broadly in balance is private renting, with some 2.6 million homes being rented from more than 500,000 private landlords. Of course we need more good-quality rented accommodation, and since the market for private renting was liberalised in the 1980s there has been a continuing and steady expansion in supply. Indeed, I see from <i>The Independent</i> of 9 June:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000042">In a debate about the private rented sector, of course one needs to consider the issues of regulation that the right hon. Gentleman has touched on, but one should also look at the broader issues of the role of the private rented sector, to see what more might be done to encourage responsible supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80624h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000043">I confess that when I saw that there was to be a debate about the regulation of the private rented sector a frisson ran through me, because we must not go back to the bad old days of statutory rent control and lifetime security of tenure, often lasting through two generations. There may be some who want to turn back the clock to regulation of that kind. I am delighted that the right hon. Gentleman did not make that case. With the housing market in the fragile state that it is now in, and with the need to reinforce measures to increase the supply of housing, we should not deter potential investors with unnecessary bureaucratic controls and regulations. Let us indeed have a sharp look at the abuses, some of which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned; but I need to be persuaded that the universal and rather bureaucratic registration scheme advocated by some is the right way forward, not least because I suspect that the costs would filter through to the tenants.

should debate measures to promote the continued healthy growth and expansion of the private rented sector. It provides flexibility and choice and helps people in housing need. Indeed, with rents underpinned by housing benefit, the private rented sector has a key role to play in helping local authorities to meet their statutory obligations on homelessness.</p>

I found it a good and balanced report. I should have liked a little more on pages 96 to 98 about what more could be done to encourage the private rented sector, to balance the slightly longer section on how we might regulate it.

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para0"><a name="08062481000045">I want to spend a moment examining that proposition. Ever since the sector was liberalised in the 1980s there has been an imperative to get serious, respectable, long-term institutional funds invested in property for rent. If quoted companies and pension funds would invest in that sector of the market, that would provide responsible and stable institutional funding, underpinning or replacing the rather fragile investment to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. Of course they would employ good agents to manage the property&#151;possibly registered social landlords. That would generate additional investment in housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000046">The right hon. Gentleman focused on HMOs in Oxford, but I hope that he will forgive me if I consider the slightly broader aspect of his debate&#151;the regulation of the private rented sector&#151;rather than wandering around Headington, Cowley, Blackbird Leys and other attractive areas in his constituency. When the Conservatives left office 11 years ago most of the spadework for the new framework for the private rented sector had been done. We had consulted the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the British Property Federation and the City, and the response was very positive. There was all-party support for a new fiscal regime for what were called real estate investment trusts.

<a name="80624h0002.htm_brev4"><a name="08062481000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to stimulate greater development activity in the residential market providing a vehicle into which new properties can be converted and managed more efficiently.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000051">It is a matter of deep regret that some two years after the Finance Bill 2006 changed the regime for REITs, there has not, to my knowledge, been a single REIT investing in residential property. There have been several REITs, but they have been for commercial property, where there is not the same demand for fresh investment. If one wants to invest in commercial property there are many vehicles for that, and there is no shortage of institutional capital for commercial property as there is for accommodation for rent. Why has the Kate Barker vision not been achieved? Why have the Government&#146;s ambitions, as described in the passages I quoted, not been secured? Will the Minister now kick-start the debate to get respectable institutional funders engaged in the market, to the benefit of those who need good-quality accommodation for rent?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000052">The right hon. Gentleman referred to the review of the private rented sector that the Government have announced. I am not absolutely convinced that the issue of increasing investment and supply is at the top of its agenda. The fourth in a series of bullet points asks:</p>
<a name="80624h0002.htm_brev5"><a name="08062481000418"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Given the recent regulatory changes, what more should or could be done to ensure a professionally managed and quality sector to meet demand pressures?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000054">I have a brief final point to make. We need to harness the resources of the private rented sector much more effectively than we have so far, to help those in desperate housing need. Many local authorities have developed a dialogue with their private landlords, who have rent deposit schemes, rent guarantee schemes and the like. All too often, however, local landlords are still reluctant to take nominees. I hope that the Minister will do all that he can to promote a wider and deeper partnership between local authorities and responsible private landlords, to make sure that good-quality accommodation is made available to those who are confronted with homelessness, and that there is not exclusive reliance on the social rented sector. I wonder whether it is time to dust down a scheme called HAMA&#151;housing associations as managing agents&#151;by which the local authority or housing association takes a lease on a property owned by a private landlord and guarantees the private landlord the income stream from the rent, vacant possession when he wants the property back, and the return of the property in the same good condition as when it was leased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000055">The scheme has much to commend it. The landlord gets a reliable tenant with a guaranteed income stream, namely the local authority, and, crucially, the tenant, who may well be vulnerable, gets a responsible managing agent, namely the housing association or local authority. It seems to me that there is merit in driving forward that scheme, or re-activating it if it is not being used as extensively as it might. Given the amount of property overhanging the market, some of it might be acquired using back-to-back finance from the local authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000056">I welcome this debate. There is a case for reconsidering the regulatory regime; it is somewhat ramshackle. I have no objection to the sort of review proposed by the right  <br>

 I was anxious to be present at this debate, although I apologise to you, Mr. Benton, and to hon. Members that owing to Committee commitments, I cannot be present for its entirety. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on securing this debate. I shall add a few thoughts to his excellent contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000058">The problems in my right hon. Friend&#146;s constituency are problems that I share in mine. Communities and streets in his city and mine change in character over time as a result of how homes change in use. Often, landlords purchase properties, undertake no work on them whatever and change their character completely by placing six or seven people in them, where perhaps a family or two or three people had lived there before. That has an effect on the property not only in terms of the change in management, the exterior view and how it fits into the community around it but in terms of the planning aspect, how many cars are outside and how the health and safety arrangements and environmental health are managed. It has a variety of effects in areas that, if not for that change of use, would be the proper province of our planning laws.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="08062481000059"><a name="80624h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="08062481000469"><b>Mr. Andrew Smith:</b>
 I am prompted to intervene by my hon. Friend&#146;s reference to parking. I do not know whether this is the case in Southampton&#151;I imagine that it is&#151;but parking is another problem in what are often dense residential areas. The solution is often the introduction of a residents parking scheme. Under such schemes in Oxford, each of the residents of multiply occupied houses is entitled to apply for a permit, and then we wonder why there is not enough space on the road to park all the cars. It is because they are crowding out other residents.</p>

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="08062481000060"><a name="80624h0002.htm_spnew2"><a name="08062481000470"><b>Dr. Whitehead:</b>
 My right hon. Friend makes a strong point. If half the residents who move into such a property have cars, the number of cars on that property doubles, as does the number of spaces required to park them if there is no off-road parking, with the effects that he described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000061">I should say immediately that it is not that steps have not been taken in recent years to recognise how rented accommodation affects communities and how tenants in rented accommodation, and indeed good landlords, can be protected properly. I take on board the suggestions made by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), who emphasised that a good and viable rental sector must operate in order to fill the needs of a section of the population, and that the landlords of those properties need reasonable circumstances in which to rent them. I suggest that the Housing Act 2004, among other things, created circumstances that benefit good landlords and disbenefit the occasional bad landlords who, unfortunately, purchase properties with no thought for how they might be managed and then simply let them run down, with the consequences that I have described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000062">The tenant deposit scheme has benefited good landlords and tenants alike, and has worked well. Under the registration system introduced in the Housing Act 2004,  <br>

good landlords can be licensed and participate in arrangements to ensure that properties are well maintained as far as health and safety and environmental features are concerned. I suggest, however, that those schemes do not take into account a good proportion of what any member of the public realises to be homes in multiple occupation. That is a central feature of this debate. A house occupied by six or seven people is, by anybody&#146;s reckoning, a house in multiple occupation, yet in law it may not be, depending on what kind of law is applied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000063">The Housing Act 2004 introduced a new definition, for registration purposes, of a house in multiple occupation: it is a house in which a number of people live who are unrelated to each other, whether or not they live as one household. Under planning law, a house in multiple occupation must be divided into separate flats, and each person in that house must have separate services. Otherwise, in most circumstances, the house is regarded under planning law as a house in shared occupation and not a house in multiple occupation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000064">That means that virtually all student houses in cities such as Oxford, Southampton and Brighton are not regarded as houses in multiple occupation for planning purposes, when everybody can see that they are. A landlord who wishes to purchase a property and move in six or seven people&#151;they may well be students, although I do not wish to make any anti-student comments, because it is extremely important that students have somewhere to live in the cities where they study&#151;can do so without making any changes to the house or being subject to any planning regulation whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000065">A full registration under the Housing Act 2004 makes it possible to register smaller HMOs under the definition in the Act. As my right hon. Friend said, there is still some concern about whether the registration of a whole city is what was envisaged under the Act&#146;s special registration arrangements, or whether particular red-lined areas of HMO stress might instead be the concentration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000066">The effect on Southampton can be seen in terms of those two possibilities. It is certainly true that Southampton has areas of high HMO stress. On one street, for example, some 55 out of 75 homes are now HMOs. In one small estate, built relatively recently in my constituency, out of 25 houses, 19 have now been purchased as HMOs, and as a result the whole nature of the estate has changed rapidly within just a few years. In Southampton, out of an estimated 12,000 HMOs, only 500 are registered under the Housing Act with its current definition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000067">If we were to align the definitions in the Housing Act with those in planning, and recognise that in reality there is a change of use when a house is purchased and placed under the sort of management that I have described, matters could be very different, and local authorities could regulate to a much greater extent how that change takes place. Of course, that would place an onus on local authorities to institute a sensible planning framework in which those changes could be reflected. They would also have to address questions about, for example, the number of HMOs in a particular area relative to properties in other kinds of use and about planning arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000068">The simple fact that planning and housing legislation were aligned would not mean, of course, that all local authorities would have to put in place those arrangements. Many local authority areas have a low HMO density, so it would not make much sense, and would serve no great  <br>

purpose, to have an excessive regulatory regime in such areas. However, to provide local authorities with the ability to say to a landlord, &#147;You need planning agreement for your proposed changes; we will not necessarily withhold it, but we will consider their wider effect on the community first,&#148; would represent a modest but important change to the regulation of this market.</p>

 Would it not be useful to consider housing needs as well as the HMO density? I come from a city with more than 10,000 people on the waiting list, and a large number of families in my area are living six to a two-bedroom flat, for example, and need larger properties. The size of properties on offer is also important.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point, and we ought to consider the economics of many such arrangements: seven people paying fairly substantial sums per room in a property where they live and share facilities will always effectively outbid a family under the same sort of circumstances. I do not blame landlords for choosing that route&#151;that is the economics of their housing arrangement&#151;but nevertheless it changes the complexion of neighbourhoods. Furthermore, families who might otherwise reasonably expect a house to be available on the rented market find themselves excluded. Although it is important that the rented market overall is kept healthy, surely it is not right ultimately that such distortion should be endemic, as it appears to be, in the rented market.</p>

I welcome the Government&#146;s recent announcement of a review of the presence and effect of HMOs, and I hope that consultation papers will follow. If that ameliorates the situation, I will welcome it greatly. None of the suggestions heard today are panaceas that will return communities to an imagined past in which people skipped down the street happy and contented, with their front walls beautifully kept up and hedges trimmed. However, they might change the circumstances under which people view their communities, so that everyone&#151;be it those living in student houses, rented properties, either as families or individuals, or owner-occupiers&#151;can live in greater harmony, understanding the circumstances applying to each of their forms of tenure. If we can make that change, we will have taken a very welcome step forward for housing and communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000073">HMOs are obviously an important element of the overall housing stock, and without them the pressure on that stock would be even greater. However, HMOs are also home to some of the most vulnerable tenants, including those with mental health problems, drug or alcohol dependency and learning difficulties. Furthermore, occupants of houses comprising bedsits are six times more likely to die as a result of fire than adults in an ordinary house. Some 35 per cent. of all fire deaths, and 39 per cent. of all fire injuries, occur in HMOs. In 2001 alone, more than 22,500 fires broke out in HMOs resulting in 116 deaths and more than 4,700 injuries. A risk assessment on fire safety in HMOs carried out by Entec for the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions concluded that in houses converted into bedsits the risk of death is one in 50,000&#151;six times higher than in comparable single-occupancy houses. However, in bedsits comprising three or more stories, the risk is one in 18,600&#151;16 times higher than in single-occupancy houses. Those figures are really quite shocking.</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="08062481000074"><a name="80624h0002.htm_spnew6"><a name="08062481000474"><b>Ms Barlow:</b>
 I have worked extensively with Sussex fire brigade on the problem of fires in HMOs and had experience of a terrible fire in an HMO in Hove before becoming an MP. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the statutory introduction of fire sprinklers in HMO conversions and new builds would solve some of the problems?</p>

 The hon. Lady speaks from personal and tragic experience in her constituency and makes a very sensible point. Her strategic suggestion is that regulation is required to reduce the risk of death and injury resulting from fires in HMOs. I am sympathetic to such an idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000076">Why are the Government willing to preside over such a differential in relative risk between single-occupancy houses and those under state regulation, and the private rented HMO sector? Are the Government really not willing to legislate? In the Minister&#146;s defence, Britain is in the grip of a housing crisis. We need to be more imaginative in finding solutions to that problem, and that means increasing housing density and making the most of brownfield development and the maximum use of the UK&#146;s 850,000 empty homes. However, we must recognise that the Government are under pressure, because although the Minister is unlikely to admit it, if they were to regulate HMOs and deal with overcrowding, it would add to the housing crisis. If accommodation density were reduced to improve its quality, the people displaced from such overcrowding would necessarily have to join the homeless list. I am sympathetic to the unspoken argument that the Government have to address, but we must recognise that they have a choice: either they can tacitly accept that the absence of regulation is, in some ways, necessary if the housing crisis is not to be exacerbated; or, more courageously, they can admit that because the private rented sector plays such a vital role by providing homes for more than 2 million families, it is difficult to see how one can square the circle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000077">My second question is therefore whether the Minister is willing to be candid and to acknowledge that one consideration, limitation and resisting factor to such regulations is the Government&#146;s private acceptance that to introduce them would make the homelessness problem  <br>

even worse. There is no shame in admitting that. If the Minister were to say so, I do not see how it could be harmful, because after all, successive Governments have done exactly the same. If the Government do, and the Minister can, admit it, however, we can start talking about what we can realistically do to use the private rented sector&#151;regulated, as it could be&#151;as part of the solution, while handling the difficulty of causing more displaced individuals and homeless people. If we can improve the image of the rented sector by encouraging best practice and making the most of new legislation, the benefits for Britain&#146;s housing market could be significant. The benefits for the residents would be unquestionable, but more than anything, we could seriously start to close the differential between houses and homes under state regulation and those in the private rented sector, which as right hon. and hon. Members have pointed out, remain largely unregulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000078">I want to think about some specifics and to ask the Minister three further questions. The tenancy deposit scheme that was introduced in the Housing Act 2004 offers real opportunities for landlords and tenants&#151;the issue has been touched on indirectly already&#151;because it will protect both the reputations of good landlords and those tenants who might have had bad experiences. It will also encourage landlords and tenants into the sector. The scheme should be not an encumbrance but a promoter of good practice and a safeguard for tenants and landlords if problems arise. As far as I can see, however, it has not had a very wide take-up. Does the Minister have a view on that? If so, does he agree that we should more assertively drive that very useful element of the 2004 Act, which the Government introduced, in order to improve the relationship between landlords and tenants and to give landlords more confidence to rent out their property, even if they have previously had bad experiences? That could release accommodation and improve the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80624h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000079">The Minister may know that with one quarter of the energy that we use in this country being consumed in our homes, the Liberal Democrats believe that energy efficiency in the home is fundamental to tackling climate change. As part of the drive to create homes that are more energy-efficient, we would introduce a scheme to reassure householders that standardised packages will improve energy efficiency. We propose an energy mortgage: a long-term loan, secured on the property and repaid through the household&#146;s energy bill. Such a &#147;warm home&#148; package would normally ensure that the householder&#146;s energy bill falls by at least as much from the reduced energy use as it rises to pay for the energy saving package. Does the Minister have a view on that? It would take away the large up-front cost when the money was invested and ensure that it was paid back in a sensible and measured long-term way. It sounds like common sense to me, and I cannot see how the Government can achieve their environmental targets unless they take on a similar scheme. I hope that the Minister will say whether he has any sympathy with that Liberal Democrat proposal.</p>

large in the energy efficiency situation, because private tenants are now least likely to have double glazing, central heating, insulation or draught-proofing.

In dealing with antisocial behaviour, for instance, the Government have tended to focus on monitoring the behaviour of the tenant. I have argued that the promotion of good standards of housing would also lead to a reduction in antisocial behaviour by helping to create a climate of responsibility that encouraged responsible tenants and owners. My final question to the Minister therefore is whether he would be willing to enter a serious dialogue about the opportunities for creating sustainable communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000083">I am very sceptical about whether antisocial behaviour orders are doing much good. Indeed, they are a badge of honour in many places. Considerate construction&#151;bearing in mind the human need for association&#151;and natural flow lines have created successful local communities and done much more to reduce antisocial behaviour than any investment in policing and in suppressing the opportunity to be a bad tenant or neighbour. Is the Minister willing to enter a sensible and, I hope, cross-party dialogue to see whether we can establish what, in terms of the built environment, differentiates successful from unsuccessful communities? That would be very important for the private sector, because, assuming we hit upon some general guidelines, we could require such good practice to be built into it. We do need to build more social housing, of course, but we do not have to depend on the majority of it being built in the public sector. Similarly, we do not have to run away from the benefits of the HMO sector simply because, currently, it is difficult for some people to achieve the standards that they wish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000084">I am glad that we are having the debate and very pleased to have had the opportunity to ask the Minister those half-dozen or so questions. I hope that he will engage in dialogue rather than sidestep them or say that we cannot reopen the issue and that he is fundamentally opposed to regulating the private rented sector. If he must take that line, he will need to explain why. Conversely, if he sees some merit in ensuring that the same standards apply to the private rented sector as they do to the public rented sector, notwithstanding the fact that we have missed the opportunity with the Housing and Regeneration Bill, I hope that we can find another way to ensure that those standards are improved. No one can doubt that multiple occupancy will continue and that we will continue to depend on the private rented sector for a significant proportion of housing, but no one can doubt either that unless there is some regulation, there will still be the lamentable differential between the private and public sectors in terms of the risk of fire  <br>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Benton. I concur with the remarks of the hon.

Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on his well-presented, well-researched and passionate contribution, which was based on his unique experiences representing a seat in the city of Oxford that faces the problems that he mentioned. He focused substantially on houses in multiple occupation, which resonated with me. I shall focus more on the wider sector, but I shall speak about HMOs later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000089">The private rented sector accounts for about 10 per cent. of all homes in the UK and has the potential to play a much fuller and more effective part in meeting future housing needs. Private landlords could play an important role in bringing under-utilised or empty properties into occupation. The sector is diverse and based on flexibility, and it offers tenants choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000090">There is some consensus between the parties about the Housing Act 2004, and we concede that we agree with a lot of things in it.

Local authorities have finite resources to deal with specific demographic and social changes of an unprecedented level and time scale&#151;in this case, since May 2004.

There will be huge resentment if people are seen to benefit from tax breaks and incentives. People can do the sums&#151;how many tenants they have jammed in the house, how much they are paying every week, what a mortgage costs, how much profit they are making&#151;but must there not be some reciprocity whereby they also have responsibilities for the upkeep of the property, for keeping it tidy and for ensuring behaviour that is reasonable in its impact on neighbours?</p>

to drive up standards and deliver what we all want&#151;better homes for people who have made their own choice that they do not want to be housed in social housing or become owner-occupiers.

 However, I think that there is a broad consensus across the House that there needs to be further incentives. We welcome the landlords energy saving allowance, which dates from 2004, but perhaps it has not been as well-publicised as it needs to be, and we need to expand the publicity for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000108">Overall, we need to get the balance of rights and responsibilities between landlords and tenants right; the same is true of the balance between enforced self-regulation and further legislation. We must be careful not to target good landlords with burdensome regulation while letting unscrupulous landlords operate with impunity. Further regulation will pile on time and cost pressures in a market that is already potentially precarious.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000109">I agree with hon. Members who have referred to the tenancy deposit scheme.

the private rented sector by means of houses in multiple occupation; that includes my own local authority in Peterborough, for instance, where we have had 15,000 to 20,000 new EU migrants coming into the Greater Peterborough area in the last four years. Local authorities do not have the staff and they certainly do not have the money to deal with these huge pressures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000111">Again, the hon. Gentleman, who is the Liberal Democrat spokesman, is quite right on this question: it is about not just absolute numbers but cultural issues. The hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow) also touched on it in her brief intervention earlier. It is something that the Government need to look at, following on from their review of houses in multiple occupation and the university of York review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000112">If the housing market was stronger, I do not think there would be such an imperative to examine this area, but there is such an imperative. The Residential Landlords Association has made the point that we need to develop more comprehensive self-regulation, so that local authorities can then focus more time and energy, through environmental health officers, selective licensing schemes and so on, on those rogue landlords who are mistreating and abusing tenants, often illegally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000113">It is also as well to concede the very important point that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire made: it seems unbelievable that, after 11 years of a Labour Government, we have not moved on in developing more innovative schemes to free up the market, using market mechanisms. In particular, he referred to real estate investment trusts and institutional investment, which have gone nowhere since the Barker report was published two years ago. He also referred, quite rightly, to the dialogue between local authorities and local landlords and the potential development of the housing association management scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000114">I would also like to mention the importance of leaving in place, at least until the review, and in my opinion beyond that, section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, because that measure is the centre of the legislative framework for the private rented sector. I believe that we do not need to amend the 1988 Act, because if we did it would send a significantly negative message and have a negative impact on the market, particularly on investment in the private rented sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000115">In conclusion, we await the university of York review and hope that it will properly inform a debate on the future of the private rented sector.

contribution this morning set the tone for the rest of the debate, given that it was considered, measured and reasoned. All the contributions this morning have demonstrated those traits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para28"><a name="08062481000118">As a Government, we want to ensure that people have access to the right sort of homes, and the private rented sector makes a real contribution to that aim. The sector is by no means a homogenous market: nearly two thirds of households in the private rented sector are categorised as economically active; and more than three quarters of tenants in the sector are under the age of 35. For these people, who are often in the first stages of their career, the attraction of private renting is its flexibility. However, as has already been mentioned, the sector also provides housing for vulnerable people; just under a fifth of all tenants in the private rented sector are on housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para29"><a name="08062481000119">The introduction of the new local housing allowance is giving those tenants greater choice about where they live, as it will allow them to see in advance the properties that they can afford. It was particularly apt that my right hon. Friend secured this debate, because I cannot really think of anywhere else that has as diverse a range of housing supply as Oxford, particularly within the private rented sector. In Oxford, there are the universities, there are affluent professionals, who may be working in the City or commuting to work elsewhere in London, and there is also a range of vulnerable people. So it is incredibly appropriate that he was able to secure this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para30"><a name="08062481000120">One point that has been mentioned is the importance of landlords being able to secure a return on their investment. It is important to stress that we recognise that private landlords are running a business and therefore expect to secure that return. However, what I am clear about, and it is a point that has been touched on already in this debate, is that that should not be at the expense of adopting a professional approach to letting, and offering a quality product to the tenant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para31"><a name="08062481000121">In an important part of his contribution to the debate, my right hon. Friend mentioned the issue of retaliatory eviction. I am very aware of the possibility of landlords evicting tenants who seek to enforce their rights, and also that some tenants may be reluctant to complain about poor conditions for fear that their landlord may then seek to end the tenancy. That situation seems to be an unintended consequence of section 21 of the 1988 Act. I have such a situation in my own constituency, with constituents coming to me in my surgeries and telling me about such problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80624h0003.htm_para32"><a name="08062481000122">The practice of retaliatory eviction should be stopped. However, I think that all hon. Members will also be aware of the fine balance between landlord and tenant rights. I am very keen to see an end to the practice of retaliatory eviction. Equally, however, I want to ensure that landlords do not face problems with tenants failing to pay the rent and committing antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000124">We had a commitment to bring appropriate levels of regulation to the private rented sector and we fulfilled that commitment in the Housing Act 2004, an Act that has been mentioned a number of times this morning. In introducing that legislation, we took a measured view of the costs, benefits and deliverability of statutory regulation of the private rented sector. We were very keen not to stunt the growth that had been seen in the sector over the last decade or so. However, we were equally keen to send out a signal that poor management and unsafe property conditions were absolutely unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000125">The changes are based on an assessment of how risks can best be identified and addressed. They empower local authorities to act to secure good standards on both a statutory and a voluntary basis. Targeted regulation can be used to underpin the development of sustainable partnerships between landlords and the local authority. I shall mention several measures in the 2004 Act that demonstrate our commitment to those principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000126">Mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation has been a major theme of the debate. The Act defines HMOs as buildings of three storeys or more that are occupied by five or more people in two or more households. Real progress is being made by local authorities using their powers to tackle potentially the most problematic parts of the sector, but I recognise that there is much more to do, as has been said this morning. Local authorities cannot rest on their laurels. They have to get out and enforce against landlords who have not come forward to be licensed. We should not forget that the Act also puts in place legislation about the management of HMOs more generally which all local authorities can use if they find problems in particular properties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000127">We are now starting to get applications from some councils to establish discretionary licensing regimes to cover smaller HMOs and ordinary private rented property. We have made it clear that any schemes should be for small, discrete parts of an authority, be targeted at specific problems, and have agreed outcomes. For such schemes to be successful, they have to be a tool within a wider package of intervention and regeneration initiatives in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000128">So far, we have approved seven selective licensing schemes. Several more selective and additional licensing schemes are being developed by local authorities including my own&#151;Hartlepool&#151;and Oxford. I took on board what my right hon. Friend said in support of the application in his area. The knowledge that local authorities can and will take targeted steps to deal with problem areas will give people confidence when they make their decision about where to live.</p>

 The Minister says that a wider scheme could be problematic but implies that in some circumstances it might not be problematic. Can I press him on the case that I made in respect of Oxford and ask him for assurance that he will look constructively at the proposal, noting in particular the points that I made about the perverse consequences of delineating small areas? The unregulated HMOs could be pressed into adjacent areas. Will he consider that carefully when assessing the Oxford application?</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister. Actually, I feel quite intimate towards him as well. In response to all the interventions, he implies that the Government would sort of like to regulate the private sector and so on, which is great. He said that they would like to regulate on the basis of considerations of costs, benefits and deliverability. Further to what the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) said, surely it is obvious that the Government are loth to regulate the private sector to the same standard as the public sector, primarily because they are frightened that, if they take away or harm the profit motive, there will not be enough private sector accommodation to help alleviate the housing crisis. It is a simple matter for the Government to admit that. If the Minister will not admit it, can he tell us what the motive is for the differential between the private and state sectors?</p>

 I disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s line of questioning, to be honest. I thought that I had made it clear that I would like bad landlords moved away from the sector altogether. That might reduce the amount of stock, but I would be more than happy to see it. I know that it would cause housing supply pressures, but bad landlords are not good for the sector or for housing policy, full stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000137">I would like targeted regulation that builds on the good work in the 2004 Act, to ensure that we incentivise good landlords and penalise bad ones, and to ensure that the private rented sector is a good housing choice for some people, even if it is not appropriate for others. I want to encourage the private sector. It is a good offer in the 21st century, and we would like more of it, but not at the expense of good, professional standards. I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000138">The third element, which was touched on by the hon. Gentleman, is the protection of tenants&#146; deposits. That is a good example of regulation, and I sense from the debate that it has the general approval of the House. We introduced schemes to safeguard tenancy deposits just over a year ago. They target another potential abuse of  <br>

tenants. Since the launch, more than 1 million deposits have been protected, and almost &#163;1 billion of cash has been safeguarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000139">The hon. Gentleman said that it seems the scheme is not working very well. I take issue with that: I think that the figures speak for themselves, and that the scheme has been a big success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000140">A major part of today&#146;s debate has been about the so-called &#147;studentification&#148; problem and issues relating to HMOs. I believe we can all agree that students can make a substantial contribution to sustaining and regenerating communities. However, I appreciate, as I imagine all hon. Members do, that high concentrations of students living together in certain parts of university towns can lead to problems such as antisocial behaviour, the possible closure of under-used community facilities such as schools and churches&#151;I saw that vividly during my recent visit to Loughborough&#151;and reduced opportunities for first-time buyers to enter home ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000141">I stress that my Department and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills are working closely together on the matter. I had a meeting last week with the Under-Secretary with responsibility for it. We have a cross-governmental approach to ensuring that this Government&#146;s policy of university expansion and the expansion of student numbers, which is right, goes hand in hand with considerations about housing policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000142">I was taken by some of the points made by my right hon. Friend and by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) about HMOs and possible changes to planning designations. I am considering at present how the problems associated with high concentrations of HMOs, particularly in areas of student housing, can be addressed. I am focusing on possible changes to planning legislation as well as exploring existing measures. I propose to consult later this year on proposals to amend the use class orders in respect of HMOs, which I think will be a welcome step. It will allow us to have a full and frank debate on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000143">Several hon. Members mentioned the independent review of the private rented sector. Again, I detected cross-party consensus and approval. The review has a wide remit to consider how the sector meets current needs and expectations, and whether and how the experiences of landlords and tenants might be improved. In the context of future demand and supply pressures in the private rented sector, the review will investigate what needs to be done to ensure that private renting offers people the right type of homes of good quality, both now and in the future, and what more should or could be done to raise professionalism among private landlords&#151;a point that I addressed to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000144">The review will also consider the important matter of security of tenure when exploring whether more needs to be done to improve the experiences of private sector landlords and tenants in respect of their rights and responsibilities. I get from my constituency surgeries, as I imagine other hon. Members do, the idea that people would like some sort of security of tenure. I think that that means increasing the supply of social rented homes, because people like the idea of security of tenure but it might not be on offer in the private rented sector. Providing a wide spectrum of choice is important.</p>

 Good morning, Mr. Benton. I am delighted to have secured this debate on the important issue of the future of the Post Office network in Somerset. I shall start by considering some of the recent trends in Somerset and will focus later on the post office at Hinton St. George in my constituency, which continues to be under threat of closure at the present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000148">I welcome the Minister to his position. I imagine that this is a familiar experience for him. This is not the first debate on this topic to which he will have responded and I suspect that it will not be the last. In spite of that, I hope that he is still in listening mode, not in auto mode. I promise that what I have to say, particularly about Hinton St. George, will raise particular issues and local factors that he may not have heard about before.</p>

Friends the Members for Taunton (Mr. Browne) and for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), my colleague who speaks on these matters from the Front Bench, who has spoken in many such debates previously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000150">We are all aware that there has been an enormous decline in the Post Office network in Somerset and across England for some time. That has been associated with improvements in transport services, particularly the use of private transport, which means that people are more willing to travel great distances than they used to be, and more willing to travel outside their own local areas. Strong competitive pressures from supermarkets and other retailers have also borne down on the Post Office network for a number of decades. The recent history is that we started in 1970 with just under 25,000 post offices nationwide and, in the decade up until 1979, we lost some 2,000 of those post offices from the network. The pace of decline continued at a similar rate between 1979 and 1997, when some 3,500 post offices&#151;around 15 per cent. of our network&#151;were closed throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000151">The losses that we have experienced on the ground in Somerset, as well as in other parts of the country, have had a real effect, particularly in the rural communities of which they used to be an important part. I recall that when I was first selected as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Yeovil constituency a number of years ago, I went out with my predecessor, now Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon, who was then Member of Parliament for that area, to participate in his annual villages advice centre and we stopped often in the centre of communities, either at the post office or the village hall, to be there for anybody who wanted to see him. It was notable that, in a few communities, we stopped at places where there was no obvious reason to park. When I explored with the then MP the reasons for our being located in those particular places, it almost always turned out that they were previously the home of the local post office, which had been closed two, five or 10 years beforehand and which had been such an important part of those communities. Those post offices that had already gone by the time I became a prospective  <br>

parliamentary candidate include the one in the beautiful village of Corton Denham on the border with Dorset, which I hope will soon be a part of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome, and those at West Chinnock, Lopen and Broadway, all of which closed more than 10 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000152">Since the period around 1997, the pace of decline has accelerated markedly in Somerset and across the country. We started in 1997 with a network of just over 19,000 post offices and we are now down to some 14,000. The pace of decline is so rapid that it is possible that the figures that I am using, which are about a year old, are already out of date. So 5,000 post offices have gone in just 10 years, which is a loss of around a quarter of the entire Post Office network that matches the loss in the previous 25 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000153">I do not want this to be an unduly partisan debate&#151;I shall not focus just on the framework of Government policy&#151;but this recent acceleration in the pace of closures seems to be not just a consequence of the competitive factors that were impacting on the size of the network in the previous decades, but a calculated act of rural, and to some extent urban, vandalism by a Government who have not only presided over the continuation of those competitive pressures that previously affected the network but have sought to divert business away from post offices&#151;particularly the pensions and benefits business&#151;and have actively discouraged many of the people who used to use the Post Office network to access those pensions and benefits, for example, through the Post Office card account, from doing so. I do not want to rehearse debates on this issue from a couple of years ago. However, it was notable that, at the time when the Post Office card account came in, the Government seemed to make it as difficult as possible for people to transfer over to that means of payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000154">In my constituency, since 2001, there has been a further spate of post office closures, including at Odcombe, Chilthorne Domer, Tintinhull, Misterton and three urban post offices have been closed&#151;one in Chard and two in Yeovil&#151;as part of the urban reinvention programme, as I believe it was called. That was all before the most recent network reinvention, which a recent letter to me described, with no apparent sense of irony, as</p>
<a name="80624h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08062481000425"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;measures to modernise and reshape the Post Office network and put it on a more stable footing.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000155">The latest reinvention is meant to lead to the closure of another 2,500 post offices over a short period. That is now having an impact across the country. It is certainly affecting the shape of the network in Somerset, including in my constituency. Frustratingly and depressingly, it seems that that network reinvention, as it is called, is targeted not just at post offices that are the most marginal in terms of profitability, which one would have thought found it most difficult to survive in the current environment of Government policy and competitive pressures. In my area&#151;I do not know whether it is the same in other parts of the country or of Somerset&#151;Post Office Ltd, and perhaps even the Government, seem particularly to be targeting many medium-sized post offices, comprising what ought to be a sustainable part of the network. Such post offices are now being closed and receiving compensation as part of that closure programme. The Government, or Post Office Ltd, are deliberately leaving out of that closure programme the most marginal post offices, presumably on the assumption that those will go to the wall of their own accord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000156">A recent consultation in Somerset about post office closures, which was a consultation only in name, led to the closure of all the post offices in my constituency that were earmarked for closure, including the ones at Barwick, East Coker, Mudford, Haselbury Plucknett and at Goldcroft in Yeovil. Of those post offices, at least the first four are the last shop and post office in their villages. All are in villages of considerable size, and all are fairly well-used retail units. The Goldcroft post office in Yeovil had a large amount of customer business. All those post offices are in the process of being closed, more or less as we speak, this week and next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000157">The closure programme is proceeding, and the Government and Post Office Ltd have identified post offices for compensation, so we are beginning to see a further round of potential closures by sub-postmasters who might have expected to be included in the closure programme because they were in some of the most marginal post offices economically. I believe that this week the post office at Buckland St. Mary on the border of my constituency is closing, supposedly temporarily, but I wonder whether we shall find another sub-postmaster for it. I hope so, but we cannot be sure. The sub-postmasters at East Chinnock on the outskirts of Yeovil have given notice of their plans to quit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000158">We are in serious danger of losing at least 12, and probably 14, post offices in my constituency in just seven years. We will soon end up with a national network of 10,000 or 11,000 post offices, a fall of about 8,000 since 1997, or 40 per cent. It will be around half the size of the network that we had three decades ago. My constituency will have around 19 post offices and when they are examined in detail and mapped across to other post offices that are closing of their own accord or through the closure programme, I am not confident that, based on the other post offices that we are losing, eight or nine of them would be able to survive the next five or six years if the same criteria were applied to them as are applied elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80624h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000159">Since 2001, there has already been a decline of 40 per cent. in the number of post offices in my constituency. If we continue in the same way for the next few years, we will lose all but 25 per cent. of the post offices that we had just seven or eight years ago. In my part of the country, that is not merely a decimation of the post office network but the calculated destruction&#151;almost the obliteration&#151;of the post office network that used to play such an important part in the life of many communities. In many cases, it will lead to the closure of the last retail outlet, and presumably to more of the private transport that the Government are so determined through other Departments to dissuade us from using due to its environmental impact. It is fair to say that other Governments have presided over a marked and gentle decline in the network, but this Government are responsible for deliberately causing the demise of the network.</p>

I say that not just because all our villages are beautiful&#151;no doubt they are in all constituencies&#151;but Hinton St. George is particularly striking. It is an historic heritage settlement with a population approaching 500, not including the many people who pass through daily to get to the school, and the many tourists and others from the surrounding catchment area of 1,500 people. The main part of the village is a wide main street lined with hamstone cottages, many of which are thatched. The guide book states that it has a &#147;thriving shop&#148;, which is true, but unfortunately that thriving shop is where the post office is located. It is threatened with closure, although it has been a post office since 1840 and the era of the penny black.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000164">The village is not on a main road, and the roads that come into it are single track with no pavements. That adds to the village&#146;s quiet and calm and the feeling that it is from a pre-car age, but that also means that it is difficult for my constituents to access services outside the village because of public transport and because they cannot walk along roads with no pavements. I shall come to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000165">There is a popular village school, an excellent tea shop, a pub with a national reputation, and, notably for the purposes of the consultation, one of the largest retired populations of any village in Somerset, with 37 per cent. of its inhabitants being of pension age, which is a high proportion by any standards. There is a strong sense of community in the village, and that has been on display since the announcement that the post office was included in those earmarked for closure a couple of weeks ago. There has been a lot of media attention, both in the local area and in the region, about the possible closure. A packed public meeting in the village was attended by half of its residents, and people overflowed from the main village hall to outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000166">The postmasters, Peter and Sue Knight, are both popular and have run the post office store for more than 20 years. They are keen to continue the business, and an active campaign committee has already been established in the village. I pay tribute to the committee, which is leading a non-political campaign. It consists of Les Farris, Derek Esp, Liz Davis, Matthew Bryant, David Clements, Andrew Norton and Kerry King, as well as three representatives from the parish council, chairman Fred Voss, and members Jane Bourne and Brian Smith. The campaign hopes to have a public meeting with Post Office Ltd and to meet the Postwatch group.

normal. The extremely strong business case for keeping it open is particularly striking, even by the Government&#146;s criteria, and I shall touch on three or four of the issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000168">One issue is distance and proximity to other post offices. There is a small postal service at the garage in the village of Merriott, which is about 1.5 miles away, but it has not been earmarked by Post Office Ltd as one of the two alternative post offices in the branch access report because it does not provide the range of services necessary to meet the access requirements. Indeed, it has gone out of business in two different forms and under two different managers during the past 18 months. It has only just found its feet again in the petrol station and retail unit in the centre of the village. I understand that it is doing extremely well under its new managers, but like all units located in larger retail and petrol station outlets in rural areas, it is bound to face many pressures over the years to come. However, because it does not supply a full range of post office services, it does not meet the criteria specified in the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000169">The other post offices that Post Office Ltd has suggested as alternatives for that community are at South Petherton and Crewkerne. South Petherton is 3.5 miles away, and there is no direct public transport link; and Crewkerne is 3 miles away. The Government&#146;s minimum access criteria, which are supposed to have informed the consultation and closure programme, are that 90 per cent. of the population should be within 1 mile of the nearest outlet, and that clearly will not be met if the closure goes ahead; and in rural areas that 95 per cent. of the population should live within 3 miles. It seems to me that the case for closure fails both tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000170">On the question of access and public transport, the Post Office was very open, saying that access to the alternative post offices was not good. The lanes out of Hinton St. George are narrow, single-track roads without pavements. It would be unrealistic to expect anyone, particularly the elderly or those with young children, to walk along those lanes, as they are extremely dangerous. South Petherton has no direct public transport link. On the option of not using public transport, the branch access report states that</p>
<a name="80624h0005.htm_brev0"><a name="08062481000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the terrain between the branches is hilly along a narrow country lane with no pavement.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000171">It also states that parking is difficult near the post office, which as I said is 3.5 miles away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000172">Merriott, which is not the main alternative, would be impossible to reach on foot, and the only public transport service that would bring passengers back to the village from which they had departed runs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays&#151;and that involves waiting two hours for the next bus back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000173">As for Crewkerne, which is 3 miles distant, the branch access report states:</p>

The parking facilities in Crewkerne are restricted and under pressure. The branch access report claimed that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000175">but there are only four or five spaces, with limited time, and in my experience they are almost always full. The distance to the branches is great, there is little or no public transport, people are not able to walk to them, and the parking facilities are poor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000176">Disabled access and access for elderly people is another big issue. The existing shop and post office in Hinton St. George is ideal for the elderly and disabled because it gives them easy access, with generous parking facilities outside. However, as I said earlier, 37 per cent. of people in the village are retired, and a large number are very elderly and find it difficult to walk long distances. The village also has a large number of people with physical and learning disabilities. Although it is easy to gain access to the existing facility in Hinton St. George, that is not the case for the alternatives. Access to South Petherton is a long journey over hilly terrain. The branch does not have disabled access; indeed, there are steps up to the post office, and there is no wheelchair access. As I said earlier, there is no direct bus service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000177">As I said, it is not possible to reach Crewkerne on foot, and disabled access is not readily available on the bus. Only one bus in the local fleet has a wheelchair lift, but apparently it is broken and the bus company has said that it cannot afford to replace it. Even if it is replaced, there is no guarantee that it would be available on that route. Although there are some low-platform buses in that part of Somerset, there are not many, and they cannot be used on any of the services to and from Hinton because of the narrowness of the lanes in the surrounding area. On distance, public transport and disability, the alternative post offices have serious impediments, so they should not be considered as viable alternatives to the existing post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000178">The assumptions that the Post Office makes on the transferability of services&#151;I understand that they are an important part of judging which post offices should stay and which should go&#151;may not be sound. The Minister may be able to clarify the matter, but I understand that we are not allowed to know what those assumptions are, nor to see the ranking list of post offices. They are ranked according to four sets of criteria, and those criteria are fundamental in determining which post offices should stay and which should go. I ask the Minister to consider giving us sight of the criteria for Somerset, because it might help in determining whether assumptions are based on a realistic judgment of the Hinton post office and the alternatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000179">I also raise the issue of other post offices in the area that are at risk of closure. I hope that Post Office Ltd will be able to find new sub-postmasters for the post offices at Buckland St. Mary and East Chinnock, as one has left and the other has said recently that he will be leaving. What will happen, given that East Chinnock is relatively near to the area that we are discussing, if either or both of those post offices close? Although East Chinnock is a substitute closure, will there still be a determination to press ahead with finding an additional office to close&#151;even if, by default, another post office closure turns out to be unavoidable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000180">Given that those other post offices seem similar in some ways, or have even smaller catchment areas than the one in Hinton St. George, could we not see the ranking list at least for the Yeovil constituency element of Somerset in order to determine the relative ranking of those post offices that appear to be at risk of closure by their own means? I am far from convinced that we would find a rational basis for ranking them that far apart. Will the Minister say whether it would be possible to establish how far apart they are, and the basis of that calculation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000181">I hope that I have made it clear that we have seen not only a huge decline in the sub-post office network in Somerset over the past 10 or 20 years, but that it has been particularly acute in the past five to 10 years. That is having a devastating impact on many of the rural communities that rely not only on the sub-post office service but on what are often the last retail outlets in quite large villages. I hope that pressure from many hon. Members will eventually persuade the Government to think again about their national strategy, which is well under way. I also hope that by raising these issues today, the Minister and Post Office Ltd can be persuaded to think again about the post office closure at Hinton St. George, which is highly valued in the local community. It seems totally inappropriate to consider it for closure, given the details that I have set out today and given what has been clearly set out in the branch access report.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on securing the debate. He has a pressing issue in the case of Hinton St. George and he is absolutely right to make the case for the post office in that village. I know it well and I also know well some of the individuals who are fighting vigorously for its retention. Is it not most extraordinary that a post office that was not on the closure list was added to that list at a late stage simply because a single post office in Street, in a totally different part of the county, was reprieved because the Post Office had apparently not done its homework sufficiently well on the population in the area? I am sure that if the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) were here, he would say, &#147;But many other post offices in the Wells constituency have been closed.&#148; That has also been the case in Bridgwater, and I am sure that if the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) were here, he would make that point. The idea that we have this tit-for-tat closure of a post office that until a few weeks ago was considered safe is sufficient to be of concern, and I want to give any support that I can to the villagers in Hinton St. George in trying to retain their post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000183">Overall, I have the most overwhelming sense of despair and anger at what is being done to the post office network in Somerset. Let me spell out what has happened in my constituency. We have lost seven post offices to outright closures and a further two are closures in all but name&#151;they are to be replaced by so-called outreach facilities. I see no evidence in the whole so-called consultation process that a single word of what was said to the Post Office against the closure of those post offices was given proper consideration. I do not believe that the process could have gone as far as it did if the Post Office had taken into account the feelings of the community and of every elected representative for the area and the points that were raised, quite properly, in support of those post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000184">We are to lose the post office in Kingsdon. The villagers of Kingsdon were told that they had alternative facilities in Yeovilton, but there are two problems with those alternative facilities. First, the post office is on Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton and therefore people have to get past two armed marines to access it. Secondly, Yeovilton is also on the list for closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000185">We have also seen the closure of the village post office in Holcombe, which is also the village store. The Post Office had failed to take into account the fact that there was a sheltered housing scheme almost directly opposite the post office, which was serving the needs of those elderly people. It failed to take account of the fact that the post office was also the place at which medicines were dropped off from the general practitioner dispensary at Coleford and that that facility would no longer be available to those who relied on it. None of that was taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000186">We have the closure of the post office in Bower Hinton. Bower Hinton is about a mile and a half from the centre of Martock, but it is a very hilly mile and a half. The post office serves a quite distinct community. Martock post office, which is a very good post office, is already overused, and there are always queues. The elderly people who were served by the shop and post office in Bower Hinton now have to trek a mile and a half down the road to use a post office where they will have to queue&#151;there are always queues there&#151;and that is considered progress in the service provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000187">We have the closure in Bayford. The situation in Bayford is unique. We had letters opposing the closure from not only Somerset, but Dorset, because it was recognised that the post office in Bayford served several Dorset communities, but of course Dorset was a different closure programme, so those communities were not formally consulted. Only the villages in Somerset were consulted, despite the fact that the post office was on the border.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000188">Keinton Mandeville, a very large village, will now be without its post office and is gradually seeing a reduction in the services available to it. We also have the closure of the post office in Sparkford, which I opened a few years ago. Post Office management attended, and they thought that it was a wonderful thing to open the post office there, but they now think that it is an equally wonderful thing to close it. How can we make any sense of such economic planning?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000189">Two of the post offices that will be closed will be replaced by so-called outreach, although there is no clarity about how it is to be provided. It is not clear whether there will be a van, although the service apparently will not be provided through the shops in North Cadbury and Charlton Horethorne. I have asked repeatedly what will happen at the end of the three years, but the Post Office will not tell us. We all assume that three years is what we will get and that the post offices will then close&#151;it is not a reprieve, but a delayed closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para27"><a name="08062481000190">The consultation was a sham. I would be interested to see the information that my hon.

Let us see first hand what people had to say about their local post offices so that we can make a judgment about whether their views were taken into account. Will the Minister give me an assurance that the letters of objection and the plans that were submitted will be available? Do I have to make a freedom of information request to get them? Will my request be blocked for reasons of commercial confidentiality, even though this was supposed to be a public consultation?</p>

 I, too, would be interested to see the objections raised by local residents. In that respect, I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether there have been problems with consultation letters reaching the consultation team from sorting offices. I have been tipped off that some sorting offices in my area&#151;I do not know whether the problem is the same in Somerset&#151;do not know where to send the objections because the address that they have been given does not include a postcode. As a result, objections are not sent directly to where they should go.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His area is very different from mine, but that is a valid point. Let me corroborate what he says by mentioning a constituent of mine who was keen to ensure that his objections were taken into account. On the last day of the so-called consultation, he tried to send his letter by registered mail to ensure that it was delivered, but he was told that it was impossible to send registered mail to an address without a postcode. The post office would not, therefore, guarantee delivery of a letter of objection to the closure of a post office. That is an absurd way of doing business, and I hope that the Minister will respond to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para28"><a name="08062481000193">What has happened underlines the fact that the Post Office and the Government&#151;the Government cannot hide behind the Post Office, because we all know that we are talking about Government policy&#151;are turning their backs on our communities and failing to recognise the valuable role that our post offices play in them. For heaven&#146;s sake, we do not have much in our village communities any more. The pubs and schools are closing, and the churches are becoming redundant, so we are losing our community facilities. The post office is one of the last remaining facilities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil said, the shop is often dependent on the post office; we cannot have the shop without the post office and we cannot have the post office without the shop, so to lose one is to lose both. We therefore end up with dormitory communities in rural areas that have no services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para29"><a name="08062481000194">The Government and the Post Office are turning their backs not only on our communities, but on environmental policy. What on earth is the point of forcing people to drive further? People will not be using public transport. My hon. Friend explained the paucity of public transport in some of our areas. In my village, there is one bus a week. What use is that in providing a service to anywhere else? We should be encouraging local facilities in villages to cut down on the amount of driving that people must do. Instead of local facilities for local people we have a policy that flies in the face of that and forces people into the hands of Mr. Asda, Mr. Sainsbury and Mr. Tesco in the nearest big town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80624h0005.htm_para30"><a name="08062481000195">Lastly, the Government and the Post Office are turning their back on the elderly. What is happening is a particular blow for the elderly population who often cannot get access to private motor cars. Often they are dependent on the village shop and post office for their needs. It seems that we simply do not care, as a society, about people who happen to be elderly, who are not very well off, and who live in the countryside. That seems to me to be a dereliction of duty on the Government&#146;s part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para0"><a name="08062481000196">There is still one outstanding issue on the table&#151;the award of the Post Office card account contract. I do not know why it is sitting in the Government&#146;s pending tray, but I have my suspicions. I do not know why they say that they will come to a decision in the summer, when the House is conveniently not sitting, and when there will be the minimum of publicity, but I have my suspicions. We have already heard from my hon. Friend about how the Post Office card account was forced through, and the Government gritted their teeth because they did not want anything to do with it; but it was embraced by many people who wanted to continue to use post offices for drawing their pensions and benefits in cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000197">Every obstacle was put in the way of people&#146;s use of the account. Now we are told that the Post Office network may not win the contract for Post Office card accounts. We hear from the National Federation of SubPostmasters that the consequence of that decision would be the closure of 3,000 more post offices, simply because of the loss of revenue. If I total up what we have lost already, and add to it the post offices under threat simply from natural wastage&#151;the sort of thing that my hon. Friend has already pointed out&#151;and add another 3,000, I conclude that that is the total loss of the rural post office network. It is no good the Government boasting about all the money they say they are putting into the network, if the result is that it is closing. That is the reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000198">I want an assurance from the Minister&#151;he will not give it but I want it&#151;that the Post Office card account will not just be awarded to the Post Office network, but will be enhanced to provide better services for those who are not well off, and to fight actively against social and financial exclusion in a way it fails to do now. I know that that is not likely to happen, and that is what worries me. It reinforces my view that old people, poor people and people who live in the countryside do not count in new Labour Britain. That is profoundly worrying. If the Post Office card account is awarded to anyone other than the Post Office, it will be an act of economic and social vandalism of the highest order, and if the Government do that, they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil said, that the nature of rural life in Britain has undoubtedly changed in the past 50 years or so. Indeed, the nature of rural and urban life is constantly evolving. We are not and ought not to be in the business of trying to maintain rural communities as though they were some sort of museum piece. It is reasonable to acknowledge that the invention of the car, of the mass retailing most obviously typified by supermarkets and, more recently, of the internet&#151;to some extent, and among some people&#151;has had an impact on how people in both urban and rural  communities choose to spend their money and interact with one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000201">I am not against all post office closures in all circumstances, and I think that most people take the same view. There may be a case for opening a post office in a new community where many extra houses have been built as part of the Government&#146;s plans to expand the number of houses. In other areas, a post office may have lapsed into relatively little use compared with what it previously enjoyed. Cases are no doubt brought to the Minister&#146;s attention in which the postmaster himself or herself no longer wishes to maintain the post office because he or she does not believe it to be a viable proposition. I do not come to this discussion in the way that I fear the Minister might have assumed&#151;with the starting point that nothing must ever change, in any circumstances, in Somerset or anywhere else in the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000202">However, acknowledging that does not mean that I acknowledge that the Government&#146;s process has been anything other than appallingly flawed and misconceived from the outset. Examples from my constituency illustrate that point. Five post offices have been designated for closure in Taunton Deane, plus other post offices in the part of West Somerset that I represent, and two others in Taunton Deane have effectively been designated for closure. West Monkton post office is a small post office in a small village, but that area of Taunton&#151;which, as everyone will know, is the county town of Somerset&#151;has been designated for considerable extra development. A proposition to build almost 1,000 more houses in Monkton Heathfield, which is adjacent to West Monkton, has been given the go-ahead and is due to commence shortly. The case for maintaining a post office in that area is overwhelming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000203">Had the Post Office come along and said, &#147;We don&#146;t think the post office in West Monkton is suitable for the needs of this expanding community, but we&#146;re going to replace it with a purpose-built post office in a slightly different location that does meet its requirements,&#148; that would have been exactly the type of constructive engagement that people in West Monkton, Monkton Heathfield and the surrounding community would have welcomed. Instead, the post office was put on the list without any apparent engagement with residents&#146; concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000204">My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome made the point that shops and post offices are intertwined, and that one is necessary to sustain the business of the other. That is true in places in my constituency such as West Buckland. Other places, such as Lydeard St. Lawrence, have no shops, pubs or amenities of any sort apart from a village school, which of course is not a suitable place for people to visit routinely unless their children are pupils. The post office therefore acts as a hub for that  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000205">There are also examples in my constituency of the sort of activity in which I would have thought the Government would be keen to support residents, yet they appear unwilling to do so. In a village between Taunton and Wellington called Bradford-on-Tone, local residents have organised themselves as volunteers to sustain the post office and shop for many years now. It is greatly appreciated by the people in that area. I am sure that everyone in this Chamber would applaud and support such self-reliance and people&#146;s willingness to roll up their sleeves and make a success of their communities, and yet the rug is being pulled from under their feet by the closure of the post office component of their business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000206">In my constituency is a village called Churchinford, which sits on the Devon border at the top of the Blackdown hills. They tell me there that it is one of only two villages in the UK with a six-way road junction&#151;although I have not checked whether that is the case by visiting every other village. However, it is certainly a notable village in many ways, as well as being very remote. It strikes me as a particularly strange choice to be on the list of post office closures. I know that its residents are considering other options, such as a temporary post office service elsewhere in the village, but I echo the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Somerton and Frome and for Yeovil that it is quite hard to fathom the basis on which some of the post offices were selected for closure. Kingston St. Mary is another village in my constituency with a part-time post office that was extremely well-supported. It is a vibrant village of some considerable size that one would have thought could comfortably support such a post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000207">I refer also to a closure announced in Taunton itself&#151;in a part of the town called Shuttern, which is close to the centre, but not quite close enough for those living there to get into town comfortably if they are elderly or infirm. More to the point, however, it is right next to the offices of Somerset county council, the police station and quite a large number of private businesses. Every time that I have visited the post office, I have got the impression that it sustains itself economically and commercially on business from the surrounding offices and those using its services either to post business mail or privately in their lunch hour. I am mystified, therefore, by the basis on which some of the post offices were selected for closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000208">I strongly support the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome that the whole process seems to have been extraordinarily flawed from the outset. I saw a letter from Postwatch, which I always understood to be tasked with defending the interests of the consumers of post office services, that made the point to anybody protesting against a post office closure that their efforts would almost certainly be futile, because it was very unlikely that the Government&#146;s consultation process would decide to alter policy as a result of residents&#146; objections. It also stated that if objections were sustained, another post office would be selected for closure somewhere else in the county to make up for the one that had been saved&#151;so anybody trying to save  <br>

their post office would be damning another one. We heard just such an example in relation to Street and Hinton St. George.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000209">It seems extraordinary that, for example, were a group of residents in Taunton able to make a persuasive case for retaining their post office, they could do that only in the knowledge that another would close, even if nowhere near the one that they were seeking to protect. There appears to be no rational explanation for that, other than the fact that Somerset, or any other county, might have been given a target to meet as part of a larger national target&#151;targets derived from a top-down figure based on a total number selected for closure, rather than on a case-by-case basis, as residents had been led to believe.</p>

 Was my hon. Friend as astonished as I was that Postwatch could not support the case for any of the many post offices across the county other than the one in Street? Is Postwatch not pointless if it does not put forward views expressed strongly by so many communities, and the supporting evidence?</p>

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="08062481000211"><a name="80624h0006.htm_spnew2"><a name="08062481000503"><b>Mr. Browne:</b>
 I strongly agree with that point. I hoped and imagined that Postwatch would be a doughty defender of the interest of people who use postal services, but instead, it seems to be a compliant organisation that wishes to do the Government&#146;s bidding. If post office users and community residents can make a persuasive case for retaining their post office, it is completely illogical, unreasonable and unfair for some other community elsewhere in Somerset to be penalised. Each case should be judged on its own merits, and people on the consultation process should make an effort to listen to the representations that are made, rather than assume that the initial published list is flawless and incapable of improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000212">Before I finish, I wish to mention the residents who have expressed their concerns to me about the removal of postal services in Somerset and, specifically, in the constituency that I represent. It has been said, but I wish to echo the point, that the people who lose out most are often those who are most unable to access alternative services. For example, they may be an elderly person who either cannot afford private transport or, owing to failing eyesight, for instance, is no longer able to drive; or, they may be a widow who never learned to drive because her husband did all the driving, and when he died, she was unable to use private transport. That is an old-fashioned notion, but it remains the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000213">The voices of many people are rarely heard, because they are not considered sufficiently metropolitan or fashionable to attract the attention of newspapers and other media. But many people live in such circumstances, particularly in isolated rural communities. They rely heavily on post office services and will feel a great sense of dismay about the Government&#146;s programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000214">I shall leave the Minister with a final example. A group from the Somerset Association for the Blind, which covers the entire county but, like many county-wide organisations is based in Taunton, the county town, is coming to meet me in Parliament in about half an hour&#146;s time. It is a perfect illustration of an organisation that represents people who are unable to access services easily on the internet or by private transport. Many hundreds of people in the county are in such circumstances. Somerset&#146;s population is older than the national average,  <br>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on securing this important debate. He very eloquently and rationally described the huge frustration in his constituency at the Government&#146;s closure programme. I also welcome the Minister to his usual place on a Tuesday morning. Those who do not attend these debates every week will not realise just how common they are. In fact, Members from all parts of the House bring their complaints to the Minister, and he must listen to such debates sometimes four times a week. So far, they do not seem to have had any effect on the Government&#146;s decision, however, so I hope that this debate may have given him pause for thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000217">What emerges from all the debates is the real anger that people in different communities and areas, be they rural or urban, feel about the latest cuts&#151;2,500 on top of the 4,000 that the Government previously made to the post office network, which of course, came on top of the 3,500 cuts that the Conservatives made when they were in government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000218">The real sense of frustration comes from the feeling that the Government do not recognise the social value that post offices have in our communities. My hon. Friends the Members for Taunton (Mr. Browne) and for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) spoke about how the most vulnerable in our communities&#151;the elderly, the disabled in particular and the poor&#151;are most affected by the closure of post offices. My hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil described the Government&#146;s closure programme as a calculated act of rural and urban vandalism, and my constituents in Brent would concur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000219">At the heart of the anger is the fact that the Government are not just proceeding with this set of cuts but seem incapable of listening to the complaints that communities bring both to the Post Office and to the Minister when their MPs speak in debates such as this. My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton mentioned the ridiculous nature of the consultation process and the fact that if one post office is saved, another must inevitably close. The Minister has previously denied that that is always the policy, but my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil secured the debate to bring to his attention the example of Hinton St. George, which exemplifies the problem. He asked the Minister whether, if he and local campaigners succeed in saving the post office there, another in Somerset will face the chop.</p>

local facility equally. It feels as though we were just going through the motions. Six weeks is clearly not long enough to put together a rescue package. Some councils have begun work to try to rescue post offices, but it is difficult to do that when there is only six weeks between consultations being put into the public domain and post offices facing the chop. Community organisations have no prospect of raising the capital needed to save important post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000221">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) made a point about the detail of consultations. In London I have found that the names of post offices that are published in consultation documents bear no resemblance to the names that the communities involved would give them. It is as though the Government were attempting to ensure that local communities could not tell which post offices were facing the chop. None of the post offices affected in my area was named using a name that we would recognise, and none of their full addresses was given in the consultation documents. I fear that that is a calculated act of deception.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000222">My hon. Friends who have spoken represent both urban and rural areas, and in my constituency the impact of closures has been seen in the past week. Last week, a post office that had been open for 100 years closed. We held a party to thank the postmaster for his work in the local community, but it was not a happy occasion. Today another post office, in Stonebridge, will close as a result of a consultation on a proposal that went through unchanged. We have lost 60 per cent. of our post offices since 1997, and since the closures there have been massive queues in post offices in the area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000223">As a number of my hon. Friends have said, the impact of the closures is a real change in local communities. The New Economics Foundation has estimated that the cost to an urban area&#146;s local economy is about &#163;277,000 for each post office that is closed. Of course, the Government lose out as well as local communities. They lose revenue that they would have gained in VAT&#151;perhaps the best part of &#163;50,000. It is estimated that in rural areas, for every &#163;1 of subsidy that is given to post offices there is a benefit of between &#163;2 and &#163;4 to the local economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000224">An enormous amount of misery is being heaped on local communities, at great expense to their local economy, for a relatively small saving to the Government&#146;s coffers of just &#163;45 million. Considering the amount that the Government were willing to spend before the by-election in Crewe to buy off people there&#151;their earlier decision was inadequate and would inevitably have affected the poorest&#151;the amount that we are talking about today seems like a drop in the ocean. What is happening is causing huge misery to the very poorest in our community. Similarly, even after the expensive buy-off in the Crewe by-election, it will still be the poorest who lose out. There is a bit of a pattern here. I will not say that the Government target the poorest, because that would be unfair, but they seem to be blind to the plight of the poorest and most vulnerable in our community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000225">The Minister hates me to mention the figures for bonuses because they offer a stark contrast, so I shall do so again. The Government are saving &#163;45 million, but the man responsible for driving through the closure programme gained more than &#163;3 million in benefits and salary last year. That was enough to save all the post  <br>

offices in London. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i><i></i>And all the post offices in Somerset twice, my hon. Friends tell me. There are considerable double standards in the Government&#146;s thinking on where it is important to save money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000226">My hon. Friends the Member for Yeovil and for Taunton spoke about shops. Post offices in rural areas will often inhabit the only shop, so when we lose the post office, we also lose the shop. In my experience, we can often lose a parade of shops, even in an urban area, because the post office is responsible for footfall in the entire area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08062481000227">My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome spoke passionately about the sense that the Government are closing everything or presiding over the decline of everything in local communities, and he mentioned the closure of pubs and shops. In my constituency, the post offices have gone along with the police stations, health centres and jobcentres. There is a sense that the Government are retreating from the areas that most need an interface between individuals and the state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para28"><a name="08062481000228">I fear that the current proposals are not the end. We have a closure programme involving 2,500 post offices, but will that be the end of it? I suspect not. The Government have no plan to sustain the post office network. Just a few weeks ago, the Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform raised the spectre of further closures. The Post Office had refused to state a lower limit for the number of post offices that would make for a viable network. The Government have refused to commit to any long-term plan to provide a subsidy or ensure that post offices gain revenue. Only 7,500 post offices are required to meet the Government&#146;s access criteria, so I fear that we have not seen the last of the closures. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80624h0006.htm_para29"><a name="08062481000229">Finally, I want to say something about the solutions that I hope that the Government will adopt. Ministers are conducting a review of postal services, and although it is looking principally at Royal Mail, I hope that it will recommend solutions that have an impact on the Post Office. First, I hope that the Government will consider separating Royal Mail from the post office network. One is a private business, while the other is a social asset with social value, so I hope that the Government will consider treating them differently. That would, for example, allow the Post Office to work with Royal Mail&#146;s competitors. At the very least, it would help many people, particularly in remote communities, if Royal Mail&#146;s competitors could use the local post office as a parcel depot. That would make it a great deal easier for people to pick up parcels, and that is particularly true of those who have a small business or who work from home. It would make a great difference to such people if they could pick up from the post office anything that they had bought over the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para0"><a name="08062481000230">Secondly, the Government need to consider a massive lump-sum investment to ensure that the network can modernise. My party proposes to finance that investment through the part-privatisation of Royal Mail, and I hope that the Government will consider that during their review of postal services. If they choose not to, they will have to find another way of investing considerably in the network, by which I do not mean that they should invest large amounts in a consultation that does not go  <br>

anywhere. Post offices need to modernise; they need better equipment and better training. The Crown network in particular is in desperate need of investment so that it can compete on the high street, because its post offices are haemorrhaging support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000231">Finally, I hope that the Government will consider what other sources of revenue they can make available to individual post offices. Of course, we have the prospect of the tendering of the contract for the Post Office card account. I cannot see what other company could possibly have the network across all rural areas to compete adequately with the Post Office and therefore I hope that the Government will give the Post Office that contract. Furthermore, I hope that the Government will consider making the Post Office the cornerstone of a new universal service obligation to provide basic bank accounts in our communities.</p>

 I too congratulate the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on securing this debate and on putting the spotlight on the impact of post office closures on his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000234">Although I am not a Somerset MP, my family comes from Somerset and I went to schools in Crewkerne and Taunton, so I know that this debate has been not just about a series of, if you like, quaint west country villages being named but a policy of harsh consequences for the communities affected, some of those post offices being in villages where members of my family live. If one looks at the figures, they are quite daunting. About 64 post offices face closure throughout the Bristol and Somerset region, representing about one in six post offices in the region, a very high proportion, the effect of which will certainly be harshly felt by the communities involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000235">The communities have at least had an opportunity to express their views, brief though that opportunity has been; I will touch upon the nature of the consultation itself later. A quick perusal of the consultation document is very revealing. I will not go through a long list of passages from the document, but I will suggest two or three passages that the Minister should be made aware of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000236">For example, concerns have been expressed that when local branches close, residents are forced to go further to access services, which was a point made by a number of hon. Members. However, routes to the nearest alternative branch are often long and hazardous. That was certainly the concern of local people opposed to the closures of the Barrow Gurney and the Keinton Mandeville branches, to give but two examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000237">Meanwhile, nearly every consultation highlighted the disproportionate effect that closures would have on the elderly and on vulnerable people, particularly those who rely most heavily on post office services and have the poorest means of accessing alternative branches; that was another point made today by hon. Members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000238">Another concern is where post offices are being closed but the local population is expanding. One often thinks that in these quaint villages population is declining, but  <br>

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 41WH</b><br>
in many cases they are thriving communities in which the population is expanding. That is certainly the case, for example, in Basson Bridge, where I believe that several new housing developments are being planned and yet the local post office is being proposed for closure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000239">Where branches proposed for closure are run by volunteers, such as the branches at Bradford-on-Tone or Bicknoller, residents understandably believe that a vital community hub is under threat. The extent to which the voluntary community runs a number of post offices must not be underestimated either, and a similar point was made by many respondents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000240">In the brief time that I have, I would like to focus on two key issues for the Conservative party. For one thing, we would suggest that the 3-mile criterion has too often been calculated on the basis of &#147;as the crow flies&#148;, taking insufficient account of local geography and transport connections. Indeed, 3 miles measured in a straight line on a map often turns out to be much further when roads, terrain and public transport facilities are taken into account. I do not know exactly what the position is in Somerset, but certainly in Essex, where my constituency is, this problem is compounded by the fact that it is often the case that certain bus routes are under threat. Therefore, there is no security against future developments, where, for example, bus routes are closing, which would make the access to these alternative branches even more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000241">Access criteria also have the unintended and perhaps absurd consequence of closing profitable branches simply because they happen to exist in the wrong location. It is remarkable that Ministers have used financial considerations to justify their latest raid upon the network and then closed some branches that are clearly profitable. I mentioned one or two in areas where populations are expanding. If the rationale is to save the Post Office money, it seems absurd that we are closing profitable branches. Again, a number of hon. Members touched on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000242">I suggest that this is not just about access methodology and the fact that it is flawed but about the consultation process, which also appears to many, particularly those at the receiving end of many of the closures, to be flawed. Cabinet Office guidelines clearly state that consultations should take a minimum of nine weeks to allow for full participation, yet the Government have approved a programme of consultations lasting only six weeks in each local area. That is not right, and the Minister needs to look at it again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000243">Not only is the consultation too short, I suggest that it is highly cynical. Post Office Ltd has made it clear that even where a post office is saved from closure as a result of consultation, another post office should be earmarked for closure in its place, creating a man-eat-man environment. We seem to be in a macabre game of pass the parcel with the much-feared closure of vital services. If one community manages to save a post office, another must pay the price. That cannot be right. It simply shows that the Government and Post Office Ltd are trying to meet a target rather than cater for and listen to local communities with regard to how badly post offices are required and the vital role that they play. That pass-the-parcel approach encourages everyone involved in the consultation to adopt the view that it is nothing but a sham.</p>

Often, the shop and the post office are interdependent, and if the post office is taken away, the shop must go as well, because there simply is not enough business. Again, I am not convinced that the Government have taken that into account in deciding how many post offices to close and what effect that will have on local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000245">By the next election, this Government will have closed more than one third of the entire network. There is an element of hypocrisy in their approach. We know that as many as seven Cabinet Ministers and 17 junior Ministers have actively campaigned in their constituencies against post office closures, despite having forced a closure programme on everybody else. It seems to many looking in from the outside that the approach adopted has been one of do as I say, not as I do. It also has the perverse effect of forcing closures on neighbouring communities, as we have discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000246">To compound that crime, the Government and Post Office Ltd seem to have no strategy for the longer-term future of the post office network. The Post Office card account was mentioned as an illustration. The contract ends in 2010, and the National Federation of SubPostmasters believes that if it is not awarded to Post Office Ltd, the network could implode. I have raised that issue myself at the Dispatch Box during questions. The Government have kicked it into the long grass by saying that an announcement is forthcoming, but I share the scepticism about why it is taking so long to come to a decision when the simple answer would be to give the account to Post Office Ltd in order to secure the long-term financial future of many of the remaining post offices. Again, however, there seems to be a hidden agenda that none of us is quite clear about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000247">As a brief aside, I suggest to hon. Members who have spoken that we in Essex are trying to do a little bit more to keep our post offices open. I convened a meeting between Essex MPs and the Minister, after which Post Office Ltd was forced to open its books to Essex county council with a view to examining the financial possibility and feasibility of the county council helping to keep some branches open. The county council has pledged &#163;1.5 million to the scheme. It will result in reopenings; we are not sure of the exact number. I suggest to hon. Members in a spirit of co-operation that they look at that operation. If they want to have a chat with me afterwards I shall be happy to discuss it with them. Post offices will be reopened in Essex because of the involvement of Essex county council, which I congratulate on taking that initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000248">I hope that the Minister will show a little flexibility in responding to the issues raised in the debate, by way of contrast to the very rigid programme of closures that has been forced on communities.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on securing the debate. As we have heard, the subject is debated often in the House; I do not know whether it is quite four times a week, but certainly it is pretty often. The hon. Gentleman raised several specifics, particularly with respect to the  <br>

post office at Hinton St. George, which I shall come to in a couple of moments. I want to make some more general points first.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000250">The hon. Gentleman acknowledged, as did the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne), that life in this country has changed, which marks this debate out as somewhat unusual among the others on the subject. Patterns in the way people do things have changed a lot. That is a big factor behind post office closures. Consideration of the context and the Post Office&#146;s current position will give some idea of why the Government would sanction the closure of up to 2,500 post offices, given that, as hon. Members have said, it is clearly unpopular in communities and occasionally&#151;perhaps Hinton St. George is a case in point&#151;arouses fierce protest. That has happened on occasion throughout the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000251">Why, therefore, would the Government take their present course? The context is an extremely difficult financial position for Post Office Ltd. The Post Office network is losing &#163;500,000 a day. That is not a static picture. Those losses have been increasing in recent years. The number of customers using the Post Office has declined by about 4 million people a week. The lifestyle changes to which the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Taunton referred are having a profound impact on the Post Office. It is easy for hon. Members to say that it is all the Government&#146;s fault. At one point in the debate I thought that I was being blamed for the decline in church attendance; but changes in lifestyle are a result of choices that society makes about how to do things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000252">The hon. Member for Yeovil said that the process has accelerated under the present Government. Of course, the period of Labour Government, the past 10 or 11 years, has coincided with a complete revolution in communications; the factors are different from those that existed decades ago. To use one example that has had a profound impact on the Post Office&#151;I apologise to regular attenders at these debates, who have heard me use the same examples before&#151;the online car tax service did not exist four or five years ago. It is now used by 1 million people a month. For decades it was not available and everyone went to the post office to renew their car tax. A million fewer people a month go to the post office on account of that item alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000253">That leaves aside the fact that eight out of 10 pensioners now have their pension paid into their bank account; among new retirees the figure is nine out of 10. It leaves aside also competition from other networks, such as PayPoint, the organisation that won the contract for the BBC television licence. Between lifestyle change, technology and competition, the Post Office faces a profound challenge. Of course that means that the country cannot sustain a network of the size it used to have when those transactions were carried out very differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000254">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said that the Government boast about the amount of support that they are providing. I have no intention of boasting, but that support is significant, because without it thousands more post office branches would be under  <br>

threat. We are in the midst of a programme of support worth up to &#163;1.7 billion in the run-up to 2011. Without the annual subsidy of &#163;150 million, the securing of Post Office debts and other funds available, the network would be in a much more serious position. That might provide precious little comfort for his constituents experiencing post office closures, but without that level of Government support, far more branches would be under threat. Opposition parties&#146; positions might be that a cheque book should simply be opened and that no matter what the subsidy it should grow year on year regardless of lifestyle changes. I do not think that any responsible Government can take that attitude to funding. At some point, one must have regard to the choices that society is making and the subsidy must have regard to the public purse. We have put in place a very large subsidy indeed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000255">I come now to some of the specific points about closures, replacements and consultation that have been raised. Replacement closures came up many times in this debate, and I acknowledge that in this inherently unpopular process the idea of replacement closures can by even more unpopular. So why implement a policy for which hon. Members say there appears to be no rationale? To reduce the network&#146;s losses&#151;the &#163;45 million to which the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather) referred is only part of this&#151;we plan to take out some &#163;200 million in costs. If no action were taken, the losses would increase year on year. The 2,500 closures are necessary because three out of four post office branches run at a cost to Post Office Ltd. If it is decided, following representations from the local community, Postwatch and so on, that a particular closure need not go ahead, an alternative branch will occasionally be selected for closure. I understand that that is unpopular, but hon. Members asked an honest question about why it happens. In truth, if the end number of closures is significantly less, the Post Office will be unable to reduce the huge losses that it is sustaining day in, day out.</p>

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="08062481000256"><a name="80624h0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="08062481000507"><b>Mr. Laws:</b>
 Should unplanned closures saving a significant amount of money not also be taken into account?</p>

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="08062481000257"><a name="80624h0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08062481000508"><b>Mr. McFadden:</b>
 We have funded the network so that Post Office Ltd should be able to sustain a network of about 11,500 branches, after the current closures. If people leave, retire, sell a business or leave the network for ordinary reasons, the Post Office should make every effort to find a replacement sub-postmaster. However, it is not national service. Sometimes it might be difficult to force a situation, but the funding is in place to make that much more viable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000258">Hon. Members asked me a great many more detailed questions, to which I shall turn in the time available to me. I was asked about the nature of the consultation. The Select Committee picked up on this. The consultation is not a local referendum on post office closures&#151;that decision has been taken&#151;but about how the closures are implemented locally. Post Office Ltd needed to be clearer about that, and I hope that it is in the future. I am afraid that time does not permit me to cover every other point raised. I understand that this is a difficult situation, and I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on raising the issues around the post offices in his constituency.</p>

<h3 align="center">Bath Scalds</h3>
<a name="time_12"><a name="80624h0007.htm_time2"><a name="08062481000449"><h5 align="left">12.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_53"><a name="08062481000259"><a name="80624h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="08062481000509"><b>Mary Creagh (Wakefield) (Lab):</b>
 It is a pleasure to be here with you this afternoon, Miss Begg. I thank Mr. Speaker for this opportunity to raise my concerns about the Government proposals to reduce bathwater scalds in the home. As my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, I have been pursuing the issue for more than three years. I have dealt with several Ministers along the way and I should warn my hon. Friend that those who have previously occupied his current portfolio have had a terrible habit of being promoted. No doubt a similar fate awaits him, but I hope that he will leave a lasting mark on the position by being the Minister who agrees to changes in the building regulations that will spare hundreds of children the appalling scald injuries that I have sadly become all too familiar with over the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000260">Previously in the House, I have told the story of a little girl called Holly Devonport from Wakefield. Holly was just five years old when she suffered scald burns to more than half her body. Her mother, Julie, was running her a bath and went to get a fresh towel. Holly was sitting on the edge of the bath, playing with a computer game. In the split second when her mother left the bathroom, she lost her balance and fell in. Julie told me that when she pulled Holly from the bath, her legs looked like they had been dipped in acid. Holly&#146;s agonising injuries meant that she endured a seven-hour operation to graft skin from her stomach on to her legs. She spent six weeks in the burns unit at Pinderfields hospital in Wakefield and a further six months in a wheelchair. She was off school for four months, and she will be scarred for life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000261">Holly is now a cheerful, vibrant 12-year-old. Two years ago, she and her mother came to Parliament to launch the &#147;Hot Water Burns Like Fire&#148; campaign, which is backed by the British Burn Association&#151;the plastic surgeons and anaesthetists who deal with such burns&#151;the Child Accident Prevention Trust, the Children&#146;s Fire and Burn Trust, Help the Aged, Age Concern and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. They, and I, want to ensure that what happened to Holly does not happen to another child, but unfortunately what happened to Holly will happen to another child today and every single day this year. Some 600 people a year suffer third-degree burns from scalding-hot bathwater, and three quarters of them are children under five. There is an issue about social justice here, because research on scalding shows that children from poorer households are much more likely to suffer such an injury and are more likely to suffer, in particular, the very severe forms of scalding injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80624h0007.htm_para27"><a name="08062481000262">This year, 20 people will die from burns that they received from bathwater. Most of them will be over 60. Pensioners and children are the most vulnerable to scald injuries because their skin is thinner and burns more quickly. Also, as any parent of a toddler will know, little children have no perception of risk. Elderly people have less physical ability to deal with dangerous situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para0"><a name="08062481000263">I know that the Minister is aware of my position on this matter and I thank him for the conversations that we have had in private and at the meeting, which took  <br>

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 46WH</b><br>
place almost by accident, with the &#147;Hot water burns like fire&#148; group a couple of weeks ago. I would like the Government to change the law so that thermostatic mixing valves, or TMVs as they are known in the industry, such as the one that I have with me and which I am happy to leave with the Minister as a paperweight, are fitted in all new, refurbished and change-of-use homes. Those valves set the bathwater temperature to a maximum of 48° C and it emerges from the taps at about 46° C, depending on the water pressure elsewhere in the home. That is not new technology; it was developed in the Glasgow laundries in the 1920s and &#146;30s. It is an old piece of engineering that has been updated over the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000264">I shall put those temperatures in context. At 66° C, hot water burns through skin in two seconds. At 56° C, it burns through skin in 15 seconds. At 46° C&#151;the temperature at which the valves would be set&#151;it takes five minutes to burn through skin. If hon. Members take the temperature of their own supposedly scalding-hot baths, they will probably find that it is 40 to 42° C. Nobody can sit in a bath at 46° C, but, at that temperature, there would be a little bit of time for parents to rush back and pull out any child who fell in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000265">We wash our clothes at 40<sup>(o)</sup><sup>( )</sup>C, and we have to educate people to wash their children and themselves at the same temperature. I pay tribute to Wakefield metropolitan district council, which, as far as I have been able to establish, is the only council in the country to have installed TMVs as standard across its housing stock. The main reason for that decision was the fact that it had a seriously high level of scalding injuries. Wakefield is an old mining community, and because the miners used coal to heat hot water through inefficient big back boilers that delivered water at high temperatures, we had a higher than average level of scalding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000266">A new scalding in the home risk is emerging with the installation and increasing popularity of solar panels. People rightly want to fit them to save energy and the environment, and to use the sun&#146;s energy. The panels heat water to up to 100<sup>(o)</sup> C, and I have heard stories from people who say that the water coming out of their tap is incredibly hot. So there is an emerging risk from the increasing popularity of solar panels. People are saving the environment but they are unwittingly putting their family&#146;s health at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000267">Since I began campaigning on this issue, I have been contacted by many people with tragic and heart-breaking stories of what has happened in their family. A 17-month-old child fell into his bath in Sunderland when his mother left the room for a few seconds to fetch his pyjamas. I have heard stories of children dropping toys into the bath and going in to get them. A recent high-profile scalding case involved Katie Price, otherwise known as the model Jordan, whose son Harvey, who is blind, was badly scalded after getting into a hot bath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000268">I have also heard stories of pensioners getting cramp in their legs while topping up their bath with hot water. Dr. Keith Judkins of the Pinderfields burns unit told me of one unfortunate patient he treated who had been scalded in his bath. He had gone into burns-related shock and was unable to get out of his bath. By the time his neighbours alerted people the next day, he had sat overnight in bath water that had turned cold, so he was admitted to hospital with third-degree burns but also suffering from hypothermia, which made his treatment extremely difficult. He had an appalling injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000269">A person could have a heart attack or an epileptic fit or suffer a stroke in the bath. People may climb into the bath having had too much to drink or an overdose of prescription or illegal drugs and suffer terrible consequences. Each of those horrifying incidents could be prevented by a &#163;40 TMV fixed to the bath.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000270">The name of the campaign, &#147;Hot Water Burns Like Fire&#148;, is not just some cheap catch phrase. Scalds really do burn like fire. My friend Keith Judkins, who has been working on the issue with me, is a consultant and anaesthetist at Pinderfields hospital. He is also the chairman of the British Burn Association burn prevention committee. He says that scalds are equivalent to a petrol burn, and he should know. He sees terrible injuries every day and has often said that he would love the law to change and to put him out of business and out of work. He wishes for nothing more from our Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000271">Keith Judkins told me that a scald over more than one fifth&#151;20 per cent.&#151;of the body has the same metabolic impact on a person&#146;s physical chemistry as being hit by a bus. That change in the body&#146;s chemistry can be life threatening. People can go into burns shock, and the suffering experienced by bath scald patients is substantial. Pain is a significant feature in the first two years after a scald. It can become chronic, with pathological pain mechanisms involved. Itching can also be a serious chronic problem and may disturb sleep, especially in the first two years. Patients of Mr. Judkins have been known to scratch their newly healed skin raw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000272">The most persistent scar-related problems are the need to wear pressure garments for one to two years and the need to moisturise all burned areas every night for ever, because burned skin loses its sebaceous sweat glands. Because of the loss of those glands and because healed skin is much more sensitive to sunlight, burn patients cannot stay in the sun for very long at all. They obviously have to be much more careful in the sun.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000273">There are other issues around burns, apart from the physical ones. Psycho-socially, unless people have facial or hand burns, their injuries and scars will affect them whenever they are expected to expose them, for example, when swimming at school or on school sports days&#151;they will obviously get comments from their classmates about their scars&#151;and as they enter their teenage years, when faced with the beginnings of sexual attraction. Bath scalds in children almost invariably affect the groin area. I have no need to spell out the extreme anxiety and consequent social withdrawal that a scalded teenager feels when they realise that they are attracted to someone and are getting close to revealing previously concealed ugly scarring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000274">Legislation requiring homes to have TMVs came into force in Scotland in May 2006, after a magnificent campaign run by the lawyer, Alan Masterton. I pay tribute to the fantastic work that Mr. Masterton did in Scotland. Similar legislation has been passed in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, so why can we not do the same in England, Wales and Northern Ireland?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000275">Over the past few years, I have pleaded with Ministers to widen the scope of consultations on building regulations to include the installation of TMVs. I am sorry to say that the Government&#146;s position on this matter has not been consistent. I have with me today ministerial correspondence stretching back to 2004. In January  <br>

2004, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Phil Hope), then a Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, issued a press release entitled &#147;Government moves to stop bath time scalding injuries&#148;, which stated:</p>
<a name="80624h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08062481000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Safe water temperatures would be addressed by a review of part G of the building regulations and could come into force in early 2006&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000276">Clearly, our being here today shows that that did not happen. In March 2006, I introduced a ten-minute Bill. That is when Holly Davenport came to the House of Commons and launched the &#147;Hot Water Burns Like Fire&#148; campaign, along with the actress, Amanda Redman, who has given fantastic support to our campaign in the House and outside in wider society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000277">In 2006, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson), then a Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, wrote to me saying that a review of part G of the building regulations had been undertaken in 2005, although it had not included the TMV issue, but he reassured me that he would consider further the need for regulation to require TMVs at specified water outlets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000278">In January 2007, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith) assured us that the Department for Communities and Local Government understood our concerns and wanted to reach a solution. I thought that we had finally persuaded DCLG when in a written ministerial statement in summer 2007 she stated:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000279">So I was disappointed when my hon. Friend the Minister, who is responding to the debate, released a written statement in March 2008, indicating that he was not minded to include TMVs in a review and would request further information only from stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000280">If we can prove that the cost-benefit analysis can be changed, will the Minister guarantee that he will include TMVs in the current review of part G of the building regulations? Even if the cost-benefit analysis is not conclusive, does he not agree that the costs cannot begin to cover the human costs of a scald? Most people, when asked to put a price on the skin of their child, would first shudder with horror and then say, &#147;My child&#146;s skin is priceless.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000281">I was disappointed when this measure was not included in the consultation. The published impact assessment, which I have with me today, claims that the costs of TMVs far outweigh the benefits. That contradicts the other cost-benefit analyses carried out in Scotland, which I also have in front of me, in Australia and in the United States, where studies have proved the efficacy of TMVs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000282">I understand the rationale for producing an impact assessment and I am aware that officials from the Minister&#146;s Department have worked hard to produce an accurate report. I pay tribute to the work that has gone into this report; it is a thoughtful, meaty and considered document. However, even those officials would admit that it is difficult to apportion costs to the treatment of scalds. The impact assessment is written in a way that invites comments and I have comments to make. The report notes that, where calculations have been made in reference to surgical costs,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000283">I get the feeling that the Department would like us to make the economic case for it. We are, of course, delighted to help it with its calculations. We are in a position to challenge some of the assessment&#146;s key assumptions and to alter significantly the balance between cost and benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000284">Let us examine what have been described as the costs to the economy of reducing the number of children and elderly people scalded. The impact assessment established an annual average cost of &#163;10 million a year, or &#163;82 million in net present value terms over 10 years. Our industry partners in the &#147;Hot Water Burns Like Fire&#148; campaign agree broadly that the &#163;40 cost quoted in the report for a TMV is correct. However, the impact assessment does not provide for the cost reductions that would be afforded by increased production of TMVs and greater competition if the regulation were changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000285">I have been contacted by several firms that produce the devices. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, I shall not name the companies involved, but some have conducted detailed research into the likely reduction in cost of TMVs if the sales volume were to increase significantly. The industry believes that cost reductions of more than 30 per cent. are possible, and probably more when the market is commoditised and margins are squeezed. The cost could fall from &#163;40 per TMV to &#163;30, or maybe even &#163;28 or &#163;25.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000286">Although the effect would not be immediate&#151;it would not happen on day one after the law was changed&#151;we believe that the costs quoted in the impact assessment could be reduced by more than &#163;20 million, to less than &#163;60 million over the 10-year period for which net present value is measured. I acknowledge that the house building industry is entering a difficult time, but despite that, an estimated 223,000 new homes will be built this year, at a very conservatively estimated cost of &#163;2.5 billion. The &#163;10 million-a-year cost would be absorbed by house builders, reflecting a less than 0.5 per cent. increase in the cost to them of building a house. That is a tiny amount of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000287">The other part of the impact assessment that we believe is easy to challenge involves the costs associated with treating those dreadful injuries&#151;costs that would no longer have to be borne by the NHS and the individual. At the moment, the costs to the NHS are economic, but the costs to the individual are social and environmental. As I said, I have a great deal of respect for the officials who prepared the impact assessment, but it is difficult for lay people to estimate the cost impact of scalds. Even the medical professionals with whom we have worked cannot attach a definite cost to complicated treatments. Scalds can include several skin grafts, repeated consultations and the application of medicines and creams for the rest of the patient&#146;s life. The impact assessment considers only the immediate cost of treatment and perhaps the cost for the next six months, during the acute phase. However, most scald victims are under five, and thus require operations throughout their growing years, as skin grafts cannot grow and stretch like normal skin and the grafts must be repeated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000288">The good news for victims is that far fewer procedures are needed than in the past. However, we estimate an average of three substantial operative procedures over a 15 to 16-year period until the individual stops growing, each with a median in-patient stay of five days. That does not include at least one out-patient attendance a  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Jun 2008">

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 50WH</b><br>
year for 13 to 15 years, nor the cost of more frequent out-patient attendances or pressure garments in the first two years. Those are substantial extra costs. A conservative cost range is &#163;15,000 to &#163;20,000 for the average patient, but in severe cases, it could be as high as &#163;50,000. That is a conservative calculation of the medical costs not included in the document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000289">The other significant cost not covered involves the possibility of quality adjusted life years, which measure the burden of a condition according to the quality and quantity of life lived as a means of quantifying the benefit of a medical intervention. Burn and scald victims suffer some loss of dexterity that limits activities, as well as varying degrees of pain, dependence on others for some personal care and the need to apply creams and dressings for the rest of their years. Our early estimates indicate a possible cost of as much as &#163;150,000 in reduction of quality of life in the severest cases, and of &#163;60,000 for an average patient. Those costs are not included in the impact assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para27"><a name="08062481000290">Other costs are not included: the cost to the NHS of scar management techniques such as silicon gel or custom-made face or hand conformers, the cost of disruptions to family life as a result of the need to attend hospital, the costs to families of transport to and from regional burn units or outreach clinics and, of course, the loss of earnings by family members who need to take time off work. Those are significant costs to the economy that have not been considered, and we believe that those extra medical and quality of life costs should be included. If they are, we can demonstrate much greater benefits to the NHS than are currently identified in the impact assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para28"><a name="08062481000291">I am happy to put all that I have said in writing, in detail, in a formal response to the consultation, before the 3 August deadline. We are keen to work with Department officials in formulating our response and to ensure that it will be formulated in the same format as is used by officials. I ask the Minister to ensure, therefore, that we will be provided with the spreadsheet that officials use to model the costs and benefits, so that we can do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para29"><a name="08062481000292">At the moment the issues come down to the fact that children pay the price of non-installation of the valves in houses. They pay in pain and suffering and the impact on the whole family. When we consider an impact assessment we are considering what society is willing to pay to prevent such a terrible injury. There is a moral case too&#151;it is not just an economic case&#151;about what society will pay to protect children and keep them safe in the home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80624h0008.htm_para30"><a name="08062481000293">This is child safety week. I urge the Minister to make it a landmark for child safety in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and to consider option 5A&#151;the option for making TMVs compulsory on baths in all new dwellings, conversions and refurbished bathrooms. I want to be able to go back to Wakefield in the summer and tell Holly Davenport that her courage in coming to the House and speaking to MPs about her injuries was worth it; that together we made a little difference; that the Minister listened and is now finally ready to act.</p>

 I simply want to say that I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and congratulate her on the single-minded way in which she has pursued her campaign for years. I had a constituent who had a similar experience to what the hon. Lady described; Mrs. Leanne Seers lives in Barrington in my constituency and very sadly her 18-month old baby girl Katelyn fell into a hot bath, was badly scalded and died four days later in Frenchay hospital. Mrs. Seers brought home to me the need for action of the kind that the hon. Lady has outlined. I wrote to the Minister repeatedly and had a reply in June last year from the hon.

 It is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) on securing the debate.

Friend has so ably campaigned for several years, and sort the matter out to her satisfaction and the satisfaction of the people who campaign with her. I commend her passion and the vigour and hard work by which, from her ten-minute Bill onwards, she has kept the matter a high-profile one, which has ensured that her work with key stakeholders such as the &#147;Hot Water Burns Like Fire&#148; campaign is recognised by the Prime Minister and throughout Whitehall.</p>

document, and they would be happy to discuss policy questions and the impact assessment spreadsheets. I am very happy to supply those spreadsheets to my hon. Friend, although I do not think that there will be any surprises in them. The analysts followed Treasury guidance, and all the data that were used are in the appendices of the published impact assessment. The analysis simply calculated the net present value of options over 10 years using a 3.5 per cent. discount factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000301">In simple terms, we are looking for additional or alternative data to our data, which we have already published. My hon. Friend mentioned some new data, and I look forward to working with her on those specific issues. Although it would be very helpful to have the data in the set format, my officials would also be happy to accept them in whatever format they are provided and to discuss how to present them in the standard impact assessment template. Working through the data may help us to understand their background and meaning more fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000302">I realise that my hon. Friend is also rightly interested in the timing of any changes, and she raised a valid point about when they could be made if new evidence changed the situation. I should point out to her that the consultation impact assessment is a draft. We have already said that we will, and I have committed publicly to this, recast it and re-examine all the options before we publish our final proposals. My hon. Friend will appreciate, however, that I cannot make changes when I do not have the evidence, or without warning or the right consultation. No one supports unnecessary delay, but let us look at the new evidence first before working out how it affects our next move. We must also remember that as important as the issue under discussion is, the consultation tackles other important safety and efficiency issues, too, which with luck, I shall have time to explain. We must not delay those changes as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000303">There is a wider point: cutting the number of accidents in the home is something we can do most effectively as a joint effort. I am sure that my hon. Friend will recognise that regulation is not the single right answer that will solve the problem instantly. Departments, charities, landlords, public campaigns and the media also have a role to play in setting the right level of regulation and in finding the right way to tell people about the risks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000304">We know that there is a problem. As my hon. Friend said, there are about 20 deaths and 600 serious injuries per year owing to scalding at home&#151;mostly in baths. As she most vividly pointed out, the majority of them are suffered by vulnerable people: young children or older people who are most at risk of injury and less able to react quickly to climb out of a scalding bath. The task for my Department is to understand how the building regulations should address and reduce that risk, and to ensure that as far as possible, we provide safe and sustainable buildings. Our role as regulators is to understand the evidence for all aspects of safety and to reflect it in the way in which we set and review regulations, so that we target the greatest risks&#151;whether that involves hot water systems or other important issues, such as sound building structures, protection in the event of fire or the prevention of slips and falls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000305">I shall also explain how the building regulations operate, because it is an important point. The regulations cover all new homes, new non-domestic buildings and major works to existing buildings, but they have no  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Jun 2008">

control over minor works or replacements that are carried out daily in homes and in other buildings. They are also designed to be flexible: rather than set prescriptive standards, we set functional requirements and offer guidance on how to meet them in common situations. Designers and builders are not forced to use the suggested methods; a building can meet the requirements innovatively or differently, or it can go beyond the standards. However, in respect of part G of the building regulations, which my hon. Friend mentioned, we announced in statements last June and July that the review would not only address necessary updates for new legislation, but broaden part G&#146;s scope to tackle two major policy issues. The first is water efficiency standards, which are important, and the second is the safety of hot water systems. That was and remains a very high-profile issue. Scalding from water released by cisterns that overflow or burst has been the cause of two fatalities in recent years. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned the appalling case in his constituency, and we have proposed measures to ensure that cisterns can resist pressure and certain temperatures in the event of a fault.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000306">Today&#146;s debate also focused on another risk: scalding from hot water in baths, showers and sinks. My hon. Friend gave us some of the appalling statistics and told us about the horrific suffering of victims and their families. Her work and that of the Hot Water Burns Like Fire campaign has been very valuable. I should like to work with her further to ensure that what we achieve is what we both want.</p>

 Violent crime, antisocial behaviour and alcohol-fuelled disorder, most recently highlighted by the Home Office&#146;s hard-hitting adverts on youth drinking, have rarely been out of the headlines in recent months. A great deal of the burden is borne by our town centres throughout the nation where people gather to drink and revellers spill out of pubs and clubs into the streets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000308">In my central London constituency, the night-time economy booms, and undoubtedly contributes to the capital&#146;s vibrancy. But it also places undeniably great pressure on my two local authorities, stretches our emergency services, and causes trouble for the increasingly important and perhaps overlooked residential population. The impact of the Licensing Act 2003 and the gathering of smokers outside licensed premises only serve to highlight the alcohol-related disorder more vividly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000309">The Minister may assure me that those problems are by no means unique to my constituency. Up and down the country, police and paramedics deal with depressing regularity with the fallout of our excesses, but such problems are being felt acutely in the City of London. In its small area&#151;one square mile&#151;which supports a residential population of just 8,000, the number of premises with public entertainment licences operating beyond 2 am stood at 11 before the new licensing legislation came into force in 2005. Today, that number has leaped to 64 such premises. That increase has seen as many as 10,000 people partying in the City at any one time, and has transformed the area from one that has traditionally been empty in the evenings and at weekends, to a place where an increasing number of people who neither work nor live in the City arrive to go drinking and clubbing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000310">The City of London police are incredibly responsive and have done a fantastic job in minimising the negative impact of the night-time economy. Yet the funding package allocated by the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government for the next three years neither reflects the changing situation on the ground nor recognises the City force&#146;s national responsibilities in protecting us from terrorism and international fraud. If the Government expect emergency services and local authorities throughout the country to deal with the impact of a changing night time, adequate support must be provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000311">Evenings and weekends in the square mile have, until recently, been quiet, but with the increase in the number of licensed premises and the large independent promotional events that are gaining popularity, the City is beginning to provide an exciting alternative to the west end. It has welcomed its burgeoning night-time economy as reinforcing London&#146;s status as a world-class capital, and the vast majority of the licensees and patrons are well behaved. That must be stressed when discussing the issue throughout the country. They are keen to work with the City of London police and the corporation to reduce any negative effects of their presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000312">However, problems have arisen from the extended hours that are now afforded to such a large number of premises. They have attracted to the square mile promoters who take advantage of the City&#146;s safe environment and  <br>

its wealth of large venues with late licences to host big events. Such promoters draw in crowds of people who neither work nor live in the City and who remain at the venues until the early hours of the morning, often beyond 4 am. Individual clubs may attract as many as 1,200 people in an evening and up to 2,000 may be dispersed on to the City&#146;s relatively quiet streets as the clubs close their doors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000313">With such large numbers gathering, the City has seen a dramatic increase in alcohol-fuelled violence. Wounding and common assault have been identified as two distinct areas where crime is heavily on the increase in the City and which the City force believes are specifically related to the growing night-time economy. More worryingly, in recent months there have been two murders at licensed premises in the City of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000314">There are increasing incidents of noise disturbance, street urination, vomiting and illegal parking. The city street cleansing system has been put under significant strain in dealing with the large amounts of cigarette litter and advertising fliers discarded on the pavements. At residents meetings, constituents have spoken passionately about the diminution in their quality of life. Business rate payers have also expressed deep concern about the damage to property caused by the growing night-time economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000315">I witnessed first hand the burden that is put on people when I joined the City force&#146;s special constabulary on one of its busy Friday-night shifts at the end of last year. Most of the incidents to which my team was called involved people who had come to the City for a night out. Many of the incidents had been fuelled by alcohol; there were drunken brawls outside bars and people slumped in doorways, too inebriated to function properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000316">My researcher went out with the City force to help with its rough sleepers count and had the chance to speak with officers about the pressures that they faced. Late licensing has emerged as one of their primary concerns. Officers agreed that since the new licensing regime came into force, their jobs had become significantly more challenging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000317">Like many authorities across the country, the City of London is taking a very joined-up approach to dealing with the negative impact of the night-time economy. It is not only looking at what the City of London police force can do through law enforcement but re-examining what can be achieved in terms of licensing and environmental protection. The City&#146;s team has, for example, been learning from Birmingham city council, which has presided over a dramatic increase in Birmingham city centre&#146;s night-time economy since the Licensing Act was implemented. Key stakeholders in Birmingham&#151;the police, the fire service, trading standards and licensed premises themselves&#151;have worked together to reduce the problems associated with the growing number of bars and clubs in the city centre. There has been a highly visible but light-touch police presence, with a particular focus on dispersing large crowds quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000318">The City has brought several of those lessons back to London and it has made reducing the impact of the night-time economy one of its six priority areas over the next three years. It intends to establish a dedicated team to oversee licensing issues, make more visits to licensed premises when they are open and identify problem  <br>

premises. The team will adopt the tactics of engagement and enforcement. In addition, the City force has appointed an inspector specifically to lead on this issue, as well as a lawyer to take a robust approach to those who flout the terms of their licences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000319">Through initiatives such as risk assessment for promoted events, the City is also working in tandem with Westminster city council to its west. The City police are accessing information supplied by the Metropolitan police, who have responsibility for all areas in the metropolis outside the square mile, and working together with their vice unit to deal with this new phenomenon. Encouraging intelligence and information-sharing is key, and such measures will be backed by new shift patterns at weekends and late at night to allow a greater police presence on the street.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000320">To that extent, it is only fair to say that the Home Office has been very aware of the concerns, and I appreciate that a lot of this good national practice has come from Home Office initiatives. Much depends, however, not just on diktats from on high, but on local agencies working closely together. I am sure that there are great successes in some places, such as the City of London, but current arrangements in other places leave much more to be desired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000321">Softer measures, such as taxi marshalling schemes to remove some of the 2,000 people who can be dispersed at any one time, have played a significant role in reducing disorder. I am sure that such programmes will continue apace. The City of London&#146;s director of environmental services is also considering the deployment of new inspectors to cover the streets during evenings and early mornings. Their role would be to enforce rules on licensing, noise, smoking and parking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000322">But&#151;I fear that there is always a &#147;but&#148; on these matters&#151;the City police&#146;s rough calculation of the relatively new costs that the force is incurring as a result of the developing night-time economy is &#163;968,000 for the year. Let me list what that cost is made up of. The cost of overtime to assist with night duty, which applies on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, comes to &#163;102,000. An Easter operation on motor defence cost &#163;79,500. The two-week run-up to the festive season cost &#163;13,500 on top of the usual budget. An inspector and sergeant in licensing roles cost &#163;125,000. Two additional ward constables, who deal with a lot of this night-time economy, cost another &#163;90,000. Likewise, a constable attached to the CO14 clubs and vice team costs &#163;45,000. Major incident inquiries, in relation to the two murders and shootings to which I referred earlier, cost more than &#163;500,000. The total is, as I say, almost &#163;1 million for this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000323">The police tell me that all these figures are directly attributable to a burgeoning night-time economy. One might argue that, to a certain extent, a lot of the activity associated with that economy has been transferred from other areas, either other parts of London or other areas in the home counties and the south-east, and it is now focused on the City of London, which, as I have mentioned, now has about 64 premises, rather than 11, that are licensed to stay open beyond 2am.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000324">The licensing posts, for example, were not previously anticipated, even when the new legislation came into place five years ago. They were introduced to address the licensing issues that have been raised as a result of  <br>

the night-time economy and the officers in those posts effectively supplement the existing support staff for licensing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000325">The seasonal costs were for operations dealing with specific late-night events at venues that required additional policing and not simply for additional policing at bank holidays. The same is true of the costs associated with the major incident inquiries following the murders and the shooting in the City, which occurred at events that would not previously have been held in the City.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000326">So this is a pretty extensive new burden on the City of London Police. The rapid way in which the situation has changed in the square mile means that the City&#146;s force has had to adapt equally rapidly and is having to find resources to deal with problems that barely existed only a few years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000327">I have expressed in the House before my great admiration for the City of London police. They have a unique role and a record of success that make them stand out as a model for effective, localised and adaptable policing. The City force ensures the safety and security of the square mile not only for its 8,000 residents but for its 300,000 daily workers, those who visit the capital and the large numbers of people who, as I have mentioned, arrive in the centre of London for a good night out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para27"><a name="08062481000328">The Government have also come to rely on the City force to help with some of their broader objectives, namely counter-terrorism and combating white collar crime. The force reaches across regional, national and even international boundaries in policing global business, and its economic crime unit boasts the largest fraud squad in Europe. The increasingly globalised world in which we live has inevitably meant that there has been an increasingly large burden placed on the force over the last decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08062481000329">Indeed, the force&#146;s high degree of experience in the investigation of white collar crime has led the Government to grant it lead force status for fraud cases across the whole of south-east England. The force even works with the Department for International Development to investigate allegations of overseas corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08062481000330">Furthermore, the City&#146;s force is uniquely prepared to deal with the threat of terrorism, as a result of its own experience in the early 1990s in dealing with bombing campaigns by terrorists from Northern Ireland. Its state-of-the-art technology and its restructured policing methods, both of which I have seen on the ground, mean that the force can provide the Government with a wealth of expertise in this sector&#151;expertise that is crucial at this time of heightened security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para30"><a name="08062481000331">Unfortunately, it seems to be the case that, despite working beyond its boundaries as a trusted, reliable and frequently utilised resource, the City of London police force is not receiving the funds from the Government that I believe it is entitled to. The force has ended up with a grant allocation below the level that even the Government themselves have judged necessary to deliver their policing agenda. The Home Office set a minimum grant increase at 2.5 per cent. in each of the three years of the next spending round. No other police authority, apart from the City force, is to receive a grant increase below the minimum, but the figures announced by the Home Secretary in December and confirmed by the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and  <br>

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>24 Jun 2008 : Column 58WH</b><br>
Policing in January show a decrease in police-specific grant from &#163;22.8 million in 2007-08 to &#163;20.2 million in 2008-09.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para31"><a name="08062481000332">There are some specific issues that I do not necessarily expect the Minister to comment on now. These are issues that I have dealt with on the Floor of the House in relation to the Department for Communities and Local Government, and I appreciate that elements of the funding formula are both of historic importance and quite unique to the City police force. Therefore, I hope that, in being able perhaps to do something for the City police force, the Government will not set a precedent that will apply to each of the other local police authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para32"><a name="08062481000333">I expressed at the time my severe reservations about the change in licensing laws and my concerns about the unforeseen circumstances of a smoking ban. Those changes have gone through, and I do not wish to go into great detail about their pros and cons. We now need to deal with the problems that are being caused in city and town centres up and down the country by late opening hours for licensed premises and by the number of bars, pubs and clubs that have sprung up in certain areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para33"><a name="08062481000334">Those problems are being witnessed in both halves of my constituency, but are particularly evident in the City of London. It has gone from being a virtual ghost town at nights and weekends to having to deal with an increase in violence and the antisocial behaviour of vomiting and urination, as out-of-towners are encouraged into London&#146;s centre. Given the City of London police force&#146;s prominence in dealing with a range of Government objectives that go beyond its immediate duties, it is a little disappointing, to say the least, that the funding package offered has not been up to scratch. To ensure that the City can continue to provide people with a safe area in which to live, work and enjoy themselves, it is only fair that the Government acknowledge the impact of their policies and reconsider how best to compensate for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para34"><a name="08062481000335">The technical reasons why the City has done so badly are to be found in how the grant formula works. I appreciate that that argument is replayed across the country, and I do not wish to get tied up in its technicalities, particularly as we anticipate the imminent Flanagan review of the matter. However, that should not mask the essential point that the current formula simply does not work for the City of London. There is a longer-term need to put the City&#146;s police funding arrangements on a basis that takes account of both the City&#146;s unique circumstances and the responsibilities of the police force, and that properly reflects territorial policing needs in the square mile in the light of the new challenges. Inevitably, all 646 of us regard our own constituencies as unique, but a lot could be done for the City of London police with a relatively small amount of money without necessarily setting a precedent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80624h0009.htm_para35"><a name="08062481000336">Will the Minister review the current arrangements or consider meeting both myself and Simon Duckworth, the new chairman of the City of London&#146;s police committee, to discuss our concerns in more depth?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para0"><a name="08062481000338">I congratulate the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) on securing the debate and on the measured, concise and powerful way in which he put his case. I know that he has a reputation in the House for being reasonable. Sometimes reasonableness is a byword for someone being regarded as soft and not pursuing their case with vigour, but that is certainly not true of him. He demonstrates that somebody can put their case forcefully but reasonably, and I congratulate him on that. He makes his case even more powerfully in that way. I know that he is an assiduous Member of Parliament for his constituents, whether they be residents or businesses, and this debate is an example of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08062481000339">In case I forget, I shall say now that of course I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and his colleague. If he contacts my office we will arrange such a meeting, although I am not sure when, to discuss further the issues that have been raised this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000340">We have required all crime and disorder reduction partnerships to draw up alcohol harm reduction strategies. The safer city partnership has consulted partner agencies and the wider public to target problems that it has identified using an analysis of partners&#146; data and a problem-solving approach. The Government have not only legislated to help CDRPs and law enforcement agencies but committed resources to both prevention and education. The harm that binge drinking does is well documented. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, the second phase of our campaign to tackle binge drinking, &#147;Know Your Limits&#148;, which I launched last week, is aimed at reinforcing that message.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08062481000341">According to the police recorded crime statistics at 31 May 2008, all crime is down in the City of London by 6 per cent. compared with the same period last year. I am aware, however, that there have been some problems related to the night-time economy in the area, but I am reassured that the CDRP is working hard to tackle those issues, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08062481000342">The priorities of the recent alcohol harm reduction strategy reflect the concern and commitment to tackle the problems. May I pause for a moment and, like the hon. Gentleman, pay tribute to all the hard work that is done by the City of London police, various local authority staff and all the agencies working to deal with problems in the City of London? Indeed, as he said, as well as dealing with problems from the night-time economy, the City of London police have been made the lead force for tackling fraud, and they are to be commended for all the work that they do on that. I recently met the chief constable to talk about economic crime in the broadest sense and some of the work that is being done on e-crime. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to point out that the City of London police deal with that but are also involved in many other areas of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08062481000343">The night-time economy is not only about pubs and clubs. Other businesses and support infrastructures have a critical part to play as well. The night-time economy in the City of London has changed a great deal in the past 18 months, and while the Government have facilitated responsible drinking and leisure activities enjoyed by the majority of law-abiding citizens, they and local agencies are resolute in their determination to deal with those who overindulge or commit offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000344">The City of London operates a taxi marshals scheme from Liverpool Street station. It is vital in ensuring that people socialising in the City can disperse safely and get home quickly. Another example is the work being done by the London Ambulance Service, which ran a field hospital, or temporary treatment centre, based at Liverpool Street station in December 2007. It successfully dealt with those who were drunk or injured through assaults or accidents, and it relieved the pressure on the London Ambulance Service and left it better able to respond to other emergency calls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000345">We understand that there have been problems with drunks urinating in the street. Clearly, that is unacceptable behaviour. In addition to issuing penalty notices for disorder, the Government urge local authorities to provide appropriate public toilet facilities. We understand that the local authority is trialling temporary urinals around Smithfield market and is set to introduce a new byelaw making it an offence to urinate in a public place. Also, businesses, working with the CDRP, should ensure that they have appropriate dispersal plans in place to address that apparent problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000346">The key to successful policing and management of the night-time economy is working in partnership to ensure that the police, the licensing authority, businesses and the health service all share information and work in a co-ordinated way to tackle any problems that are identified by the agencies or the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000347">We have recently introduced alcohol disorder zones which provide local authorities and the police with a means of charging licence holders for additional costs of enforcing the law if other measures to tackle alcohol-related crime have failed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000348">Without going too much into the budgetary questions that the hon. Gentleman raised&#151;as he said, he is pursuing them in other ways&#151;there have been increases in the funding made available to the City of London police. The total budget for 2007-08 was &#163;62.86 million, an increase of 2.7 per cent. over the equivalent budget for 2006-07. The total budget for 2008-09 is &#163;64.12 million. It reflects the unique funding arrangements for the City of London police. There have been years in the past when they have done better than many other forces. The City of London Corporation, as the hon. Gentleman knows, wants to maintain the special status of the City of London police, but that brings with it a requirement to ensure that the force is properly funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000349">The hon. Gentleman knows that the problem comes from the fact that the corporation is treated like an education authority for the purpose of funding floors. This time around, the floor for education authorities is 2 per cent., which is less than the police funding floor. In previous years, the funding floor for education has been higher for education authorities than for the police. In those circumstances, they benefit. Having said that, it is clearly an issue, and I know that he is discussing it with others to see what can be done.</p>

 It is a legitimate point, and more than just a debating point, that the connection with education authorities has been positive as well as, more recently, detrimental to the headline figures. None the less, there is concern. The burdens on the City of London police are immense for a range of reasons about which the Minister and I agree, including the predominance of  <br>

terrorism and the almost exponential increase of white-collar crime in a globalised financial and overall economy in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000351">Those are particularly strong burdens. As I mentioned in specific relation to licensing and the night-time economy, the reality is that the City of London police take on some of the burden that would otherwise be dealt with by the Metropolitan police or any of the other police authorities. I had that in mind rather than just the specific figures, because, as I mentioned, the police-specific grant will be reduced in this financial year, partly because of the floor relating to education authorities.</p>

 As I said, I know that the hon. Gentleman is arguing that point with others and seeking changes. I was merely pointing out that it comes from the fact that it is funded as an education authority, which has benefited the City of London police in previous years, but the debate will no doubt continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000353">The City of London police have been engaged proactively in a number of initiatives to tackle crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour associated with the night-time and day-time economies. The City of London police are playing their full part, along with key partner agencies, in drawing up an agreed alcohol harm reduction strategy and forming a strategic licensing group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000354">Also, licensing officers, police and local authority are now co-located within the local authority, which should lead to a much improved and more co-ordinated professional approach to licensing issues and help with the presentation of robust evidence to the licensing committee on clubs and premises causing problems. It has resulted in a more focused approach to the application process dealing with problem premises and the process for reviewing existing licences. It has also improved protocols for sharing information and intelligence, resulting in closer working among the licensing authority, the fire authority, the safer city partnership and neighbouring  <br>

Metropolitan police boroughs to assist in enforcement and flag concerns earlier to the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000355">A problem-solving approach has led to a focus on dealing with promoted events by working closely with the Metropolitan police, sharing intelligence and ensuring that applicants carry out rigorous risk assessments before events take place. As the hon. Gentleman said, the police have gleaned effective practice from cities such as Birmingham and their immediate neighbours in Westminster. That has been beneficial. The focus on addressing problems has also resulted in successful work with a major licensee in the City to review its licence and alter opening times, which has caused the other 750 licensees in the City to take note of the police&#146;s determination to tackle problems associated with alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour. I support the police and all involved in licensing in ensuring that the law is rigorously enforced and that people who break licensing conditions can expect a robust response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000356">We also need to protect young people from the harm caused by alcohol abuse, as well as dealing with those who commit crime and engage in antisocial behaviour. That includes taking action against retailers and licensed premises that sell alcohol to children, giving police powers to tackle disorder related to excessive drink and getting the industry to play their part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000357">As well as changes to the law, enforcement of the law and increasing good practice in the City of London, we need to consider how to change this country&#146;s culture. It is seen as acceptable for people to behave in certain ways, drink to get drunk and leave others to pick up the tab. Violence associated with alcohol is unacceptable, as is some of the behaviour that we see on our streets. As well as enforcement and all the actions that the hon. Gentleman and I have talked about, we as individuals in society, whether in the City of London or elsewhere, need to ask ourselves whether we can continue to behave in such a way and expect police, local authorities, health services and other agencies to pick up the problem.</p>

 It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. May I say how much I welcome the opportunity to debate the rights of agency workers such as Sally? The subject is highly topical and I intend to take full advantage of that topicality. I hope to give my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) something to pass on to the relevant Minister for his red box when he is discussing these issues in Europe, namely, an important case study from my constituency that describes the suffering that agency workers endure when they try to protect their redundancy rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000359">That suffering has been created by a state of legal turmoil and the delay in implementing legislative reform. The latter was specifically promised as a key part of the Warwick agreement. As vice-chair of Labour&#146;s national policy forum at the time, I can vouch for the fact that the Government promised, before the 2005 general election, to deliver on the Warwick agreement in full. There has been excellent progress on that, and I hope that agency workers will be protected further in the future. The Government are making progress on equal treatment for agency workers, but on the employment status of agency workers, the situation is not so clear-cut, and I intend to press the Minister on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000360">I thank the T and G section of Unite the Union for bringing this case to my attention. It is on the side of all workers&#151;temporary, agency and full-time&#151;and, in my own town of Swindon, it has worked very hard to put Sally&#146;s case as effectively as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08062481000361">Half of all agency workers in Europe work in the UK. Currently, 1.4 million individuals in the UK are in temporary employment. They have been the lubricant that has kept our economy flexible and nowhere has the great economic record of the present Government been more evident than in my constituency of South Swindon. We are among the most productive places in the country and, as part of our work force, agency workers deserve a great deal of credit. They have helped to build us this great economy and, while the credit crunch bites, we need to give them&#151;the most insecure members of our work force&#151;some extra security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08062481000362">I have heard many stories from hard-working union representatives in my constituency about how agency workers are mistreated. Some large distribution or retail companies continue to pay at national minimum wage levels, with the addition of rolled-up holidays into the pay rate. Perhaps most worrying is something that happens with some agencies. If an agency worker from one of these agencies raises issues while on placement, the chances are that in a matter of days, he or she will be gone. I was given an example of that. It had been indicated to a young woman by company management that she was due to be taken on full-time but, upon raising concerns about her holiday entitlement, she was let go for rather spurious reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08062481000363">Even on some of the premium manufacturing sites, agency workers are exposed to unfair practices, be it split-shift working, short-term notice for lay-offs, being used and abused by agencies or generally being treated as third-class citizens. I know that neither the agencies nor the employers want that to continue, because they want what I want&#151;a thriving and fair Swindon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08062481000364">The particular case that I have raised is the dismissal of agency worker Sally Avis. I thank Sally for bravely agreeing to put her head above the parapet to tell her story and speak about the discrimination that she has suffered. For more than two years, she worked at Catalent in Swindon for an employment agency called Randstad. There is no question of her performance being an issue. Randstad said that Sally was a good worker and never late for work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para24"><a name="08062481000365">On 8 January, Sally had a call from Randstad saying that it would have to let her go because she fell into one of three categories: one, non-performing; two, non-productive; and three, long-term sick. After bringing that up with her union and appealing the dismissal, the regional manager of Randstad agreed to a meeting at Catalent. Apparently, he was unhappy about the way she had been dismissed. The manager for Randstad said that the dismissal of the group was due to a downturn in work. As Sally was the only one of the group who had more than two years&#146; service, she appeared to be the only one entitled to a redundancy payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para25"><a name="08062481000366">The union made a proposal for what it thought would be a reasonable settlement, and the regional manager then sought authority for the payment. However, Randstad&#146;s legal advisers came back saying that Sally was not entitled to a redundancy payment because she was on a contract for services, not a contract of employment. Although the union negotiated a small payment, it was for a lot less than would have been secured had Sally been on an even footing with direct employees. After giving two years of her life to her employer, Sally was dumped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para26"><a name="08062481000367">That exposed the situation that just because someone is treated as an employee of a business for the purposes of tax and national insurance, it does not necessarily mean that they will be classified as an employee of that business for the purpose of employment law. A number of the rights conferred by the Employment Rights Act 1996, or ERA, apply only to &#147;employees&#148;, one of the most important of which is the right to redundancy payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para27"><a name="08062481000368">Attempts to secure rights beyond that of &#147;worker&#148; status by arguing that temporary workers are employees of their employment agencies have so far, with few exceptions, proved fruitless; that was the case for Sally. Employment agencies have been successful in showing that they are free from this type of obligation to workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para28"><a name="08062481000369">The possibility of an implied contract between temporary workers and the company at which they do the work has proved useful in the past. However, there is no chance of that situation existing now. In recent months, case law has shown that an implied contract is virtually impossible to prove. Temporary workers are left with no one to turn to&#151;neither agency nor the end user&#151;as guarantors of basic employment rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para29"><a name="08062481000370">There is similarity between my constituent&#146;s case and that of an important Court of Appeal case, James <i>v.</i> London Borough of Greenwich, a case that reminds us of the reasons why change for agency workers is needed. In James <i>v.</i> London Borough of Greenwich, the claimant was an agency worker who had worked for the defendant local authority for three years. The claimant was absent due to sickness and replaced by a different agency worker. The claimant was not found to be an employee of the local authority and therefore was not entitled to statutory protection from unfair dismissal. The claimant could not sue the employment agency or the end user.</p>

<a name="80624h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08062481000434"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a significant move in the direction of the casualisation of labour and the growth of a two tier workforce, one tier enjoying significant statutory protection, the other tier in a legal no man&#146;s land, being neither employed nor self-employed, vulnerable but enjoying little or no protection&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para31"><a name="08062481000372">He confirmed that only on the ground of necessity can an employment tribunal imply a contract of employment between an agency worker and the end user of his or her services. The Court of Appeal made it clear that it is not for courts or tribunals to extend employment protection rights to agency workers and that further developments will need to come from the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para32"><a name="08062481000373">Under section 23 of the Employment Relations Act 1999, Ministers have wide powers to make regulations concerning the employment status of &#147;atypical workers&#148;. So far, they have not done so for temporary and agency workers, despite the fact that these workers are extremely vulnerable, as I have outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para33"><a name="08062481000374">Although the situation with regard to employment status is blurred, efforts to secure equal treatment on pay are coming into focus. Previous attempts to rectify the lack of equal treatment at EU and UK level have foundered, but the private Member&#146;s Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), the Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill, which I supported, received Second Reading on 22 February. It has since been withdrawn as the Government have indicated that they will introduce their own legislation in this sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para34"><a name="08062481000375">I understand that the Government favour the establishment of an independent pay commission to investigate the pay and conditions of agency workers. The commission would aim to arbitrate on all the contested issues relating to agency workers and attempt to provide full-time comparators for wage purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para35"><a name="08062481000376">I welcome the declaration by Government, the CBI and TUC in May that gives the topicality to this debate. The declaration is a joint agreement that, after 12 weeks in work, temporary and agency workers will qualify for the same pro rata pay and conditions as full-time workers. However, that would not seem to help my constituent directly, because it does not deal with her lack of redundancy rights caused by her confused employment status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para36"><a name="08062481000377">The only hope that I can see is that, if equal treatment on pay and conditions is imposed, we will start to see such cases in the courts and we could also see a shift towards the courts favouring equal employment status, but that is not good enough. I have a number of questions, and I would be grateful if the Minister would address them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="80624h0010.htm_para37"><a name="08062481000378">The main question that needs answering and which I hope the Minister will be able to help us with is whether she will consider extending the Government&#146;s aspirations to provide the same redundancy rights for agency workers as permanent staff. After giving two years of her life to her employer, my constituent, Sally Avis, was dumped. Does the Minister share my fear that if we do not legislate on employment status and equal conditions, millions of temps will remain in limbo on important rights such as the right to redundancy payments? Will the Minister clarify who should pay redundancy compensation&#151;the employment agency or the end user&#151;if agency workers were to receive redundancy pay?</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Miss. Begg. I congratulate my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08062481000382">The wider issue relating to the rights of temporary and agency workers is, of course, topical. There has been a year of debate in the House, during which hon. Members on both sides have pressed the need to ensure fair and appropriate treatment for agency workers while maintaining the flexibility on which businesses depend. Much has been said about the Government's commitments on this issue, and I should clarify what was said in the Warwick agreement:</p>
<a name="80624h0011.htm_brev0"><a name="08062481000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We support the principle of the Agency Workers Directive and will engage with the Commission with a view to reaching an early agreement on the proposed Directive&#148;.</p>

Friend on her timing in securing today&#146;s debate so soon after the EU Employment Council meeting on 9 June. After years of deadlock, we were able to reach political agreement with our European Union partners on the draft agency workers directive, which will provide fairness for workers without damaging Britain&#146;s economic competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="08062481000384"><a name="80624h0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="08062481000519"><b>Anne Snelgrove:</b>
 May I add my congratulations to the Government? Many people have congratulated them. The matter has taken a long time and I remind hon. Members that this Labour Government introduced much of the employment legislation from Europe after the 1997 election. That underlines our commitment to employment rights, and particularly to vulnerable workers&#146; rights. My hon. Friend is right to remind us of the 9 June agreement, and I hope that it will be introduced into British law as soon as possible.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend. It is always nice when the Government do something right, and they are doing the right thing. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said,</p>

12-week qualifying period for agency workers to be given equal treatment with permanent staff. Copies of the joint declaration have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I am particularly pleased that the declaration was so warmly applauded by Unite, which, with other trade unions, campaigned hard for a positive outcome. The revised wording of the directive agreed at the Employment Council will allow the UK to implement the agreement reached between the CBI and the TUC. It really is a landmark agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para6"><a name="08062481000388">I should clarify that &#147;equal treatment&#148; means at least the basic working and employment conditions that would apply if a worker had been recruited directly to occupy the same job as a permanent member of staff: holiday, overtime, breaks, rest periods, night work and duration of working time. The European Parliament will now consider what has been agreed, on its second reading, before the directive returns to the Council for final agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para7"><a name="08062481000389">As we said in the joint declaration, the Government will consult the social partners&#151;the TUC and the CBI&#151;on the key aspects of the implementation of the directive. There will be wider public consultation on implementing the directive in due course. This breakthrough has, of course, been part of a wider debate about worker vulnerability and the exploitation of people at work. As part of our &#147;Success at Work&#148; policy statement for this Parliament, which we published in March 2006, we have an active programme to combat exploitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para8"><a name="08062481000390">I agree that there are ongoing problems and issues in relation to vulnerable workers, but I disagree that agency work is, by its nature, exploitive and that agency workers are generally vulnerable. It is a sad fact that some employers abuse workers and it is highly regrettable that a minority of all types of workers, whether agency workers, employees, fixed-term contract or casual workers, are at some point abused by those for whom they work. We need proper recourse to rights for all people who are subject to exploitation in the workplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para9"><a name="08062481000391">Temporary work, including agency work, is an important though relatively small part of the UK labour market, in comparison with some other EU states. It does, however, play an important role in achieving the labour market flexibility that helps companies meet the peaks and troughs of demand. Indeed, to pick up on my hon. Friend&#146;s language, it has been the lubricant that has helped keep our economy flexible. That is a good description.</p>

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="08062481000392"><a name="80624h0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="08062481000521"><b>Anne Snelgrove:</b>
 I want to clarify that I do not believe that all agency workers are exploited, although the conditions under which they currently work can lead to exploitation. Some high-level, high-paid agency workers in my constituency contribute to our hi-tech industries and they enjoy being agency workers, with the freedom that comes with that, as much as an employee with a permanent contract enjoys their situation. I would not wish to threaten their existence.</p>

 I thank my hon. Friend for her clarification. It is important to remember that temporary work can and does provide a route into employment for those who were previously excluded. It can also provide a route into employment for those returning to work  <br>

after career breaks or those who were economically inactive. It can meet the needs of individuals who may wish to work on a temporary basis for short or long periods; and it can provide a stepping stone to permanent employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para10"><a name="08062481000394">As my hon. Friend has just said, the case that she highlighted is not the norm. Studies have demonstrated that temporary employment can encourage up to a third of women employed in seasonal or casual work to move on into permanent employment. Clearly, that is not how Sally Avis will view her experience. As I am sure my hon. Friend will appreciate, I cannot discuss individual cases. However, as a general principle, there is considerable flexibility in contractual arrangements, on both sides, between agency workers and the agency. If a worker is engaged through an agency, his or her assignment can be terminated at any time, subject to any notice provision in their contract with the agency. It is in the nature of agency work that it is flexible, for some of the reasons given by my hon. Friend, and that assignments can be ended, for example, when the hiring company experiences a downturn in demand. Flexibility works both ways. An agency worker can leave a job giving little or no notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para11"><a name="08062481000395">Agency workers are usually considered to be &#147;workers&#148; under the relevant legislation and are entitled to core employment rights, but not to claim unfair dismissal or statutory redundancy. The agreement on the EU directive, as reflected in the Warwick agreement, will not change the employment status of agency workers or affect their entitlement to existing rights, such as those regarding unfair dismissal, by the end user or hirer. I will certainly draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister the specific concerns so clearly voiced in the debate today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para12"><a name="08062481000396">A court will consider individual claims based on the facts of the case. Over many years, the body of case law has been consistently adapted and refined by interpretation in tribunals and higher courts. In relation to employment status, the courts have defined a number of tests which examine the individual's circumstances and consider all aspects of the relationship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para13"><a name="08062481000397">As we set out in our March 2006 document, &#147;Success at Work: Protecting vulnerable workers, supporting good employers&#148;, we considered the current framework of employment rights, including for agency workers, to see if it was appropriate and fair and supported the aim of high participation in work. That followed a consultation in 2002 on the differing rights and responsibilities in employment law of employees and workers, such as those employed through employment businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para14"><a name="08062481000398">We found that temporary work, such as agency work, is greatly valued by employers and many individuals. We were given examples of abuses and of the lack of knowledge about existing rights, and that is quite important in this process. However, there was a lack of evidence suggesting that the only appropriate remedy was wholesale change to the current system. Having reviewed all the evidence, we concluded that the present framework reflects the wide diversity of working arrangements and the different responsibilities and rights in different employment relationships. We believe that it meets the labour market&#146;s current needs and that there is no immediate need for further legislation on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para15"><a name="08062481000399">Nevertheless, we are keen to help people better understand the current framework, the rights to which they are entitled&#151;whether they are an employee, a  <br>

worker or self-employed&#151;and how to enforce those rights. We will improve guidance through the new employee pages on the Directgov website, and work is progressing on developing an associated interactive tool. For those who do not understand what an associated interactive tool is, it is simply a good online guide, with a question-and-answer system built in, which gives people a much clearer idea of their legal position to ensure that they are not wrongly deprived of their rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para16"><a name="08062481000400">Agency workers are protected by a combination of general legislation that gives them core rights and specific legislation that governs the conduct of their agencies. Those protections include the right to be paid at least the national minimum wage; entitlements under the working time directive, including paid annual leave and regular rest breaks; social security provisions, such as maternity and paternity pay; and coverage by anti-discrimination laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para17"><a name="08062481000401">I want to focus on some of the current initiatives to improve protections for agency workers. The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 provide essential protection for agency workers and all those using the services provided by employment agencies. Amendments to the regulations came into effect on 6 April 2008 giving workers the right to withdraw from services provided by an agency, such as accommodation and transport, without suffering any detriment. That is quite an important change. In addition, the current Employment Bill includes measures to increase penalties for offences under the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and improve the investigative powers of the employment agency standards inspectorate&#151;the EAS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para18"><a name="08062481000402">Those additional rights will be backed by additional resources for enforcement. We will double the number of EAS inspectors from 12 to 24. EAS inspectors have a good record and investigated more than 1,600 agencies in 2006-07. The EAS follows up every relevant complaint that indicates a possible breach of the legislation and carries out targeted inspections on the basis of risk. In 2006-07, more than 1,300 complaints were investigated and more than 300 targeted inspections were carried out, resulting in 558 corrective letters being sent to agencies. Following such action, five individuals were prohibited from being involved in running an agency on the ground of unsuitability due to previous misconduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="80624h0011.htm_para19"><a name="08062481000403">The Government are determined to ensure that the enforcement regime is effective in dealing proportionately with rogue employers who are determined to flout the law&#151;an issue forcefully raised by the Unite campaign. We must understand the nature and extent of the abuse of vulnerable workers and get behind the anecdotes to look at the hard facts. To do that, we established the vulnerable worker enforcement forum last year. The forum is chaired by the Minister for Employment Relations  <br>

The forum is also looking at the effectiveness of the enforcement regime. It is an important focal point in terms of getting at some of the real issues that vulnerable workers face. At the moment, evidence is often anecdotal, because people are frightened to come forward and give evidence. Hopefully, the group will get beneath that. It is already proving valuable in identifying issues with the reporting of abuse and a need for closer working among enforcement bodies, and highlighting the resources needed to ensure effective implementation of the laws passed by the House. In the forum&#146;s report, we will announce further measures to ensure that agency workers are better aware of their rights and that those rights are more effectively enforced.</p>

She asked a series of questions that I will ensure are passed on to my colleague the Minister. She asked about redundancy pay and whether we should be making changes to it. Further consultation will be held on that issue. I hope that that partly answers that concern.</p>

 Will my hon. Friend arrange for the Minister to write to me on that issue, so that I have some indication of the time scale of the consultation?</p>

 I will come at the end to points that I hope will tie up some of the loose ends. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that, overall, particularly in the past year, we have done a lot to improve the position of temporary agency workers with respect to issues on which she and many other hon. Members have campaigned. Most recently, they supported the private Member&#146;s Bill introduced by our hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller).</p>
