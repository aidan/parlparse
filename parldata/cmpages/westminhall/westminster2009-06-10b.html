 I welcome you, Mr. Russell, to what I think is your first time in the Chair in Westminster Hall. I was not, by my reasonably late entrance, trying to make it a difficult start for you. I also welcome the Minister to her new duties. She has already set out her stall at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and it will be interesting to see how she applies herself to the problems of energy. She has our best wishes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para1"><a name="09061057000010">The purpose of the debate is to put the spotlight on energy customers who are simply paying too much for their energy, including many of the 5 million or so households nationwide who live in fuel poverty. My interest in the subject will be familiar to hon. Members. I introduced a ten-minute Bill to require energy companies to offer cheapest-tariff information on their domestic invoices and statements. However, the debate has a wider remit&#151;it is about energy regulation in a wider sense. It is right that we track the progress of our energy markets towards proper liberalisation. Now is an excellent time for such a debate. As we know, Ofgem&#146;s consultation on its recent retail market remedies closed at the end of May, and commentators are waiting to see how the regulator addresses the various problems uncovered by its market probe last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000011">One of the biggest problems facing consumers is that tariff structures are notoriously complex and energy bills can be mind-boggling. Those factors are stopping many consumers&#151;not all&#151;engaging in the market and getting better deals. Which? has suggested that there are 15 to 20 different basic tariffs for each supplier. That figure rises to more than 4,000 tariffs across suppliers when factors such as variance payment methods and special offers are taken into account. It  is unsurprising that something like 70 per cent. of consumers find the number of tariffs confusing. I suggest that overwhelming choice is no real choice at all. The effect of the confusion on the market speaks for itself. Evidence suggests that a quarter of those who switch, and something like half of those who switch as a result of doorstep selling, actually end up paying more for their energy. That is a clear example of how confusing tariffs and energy bills can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000012">The best way of promoting competition and improving the effectiveness of energy markets is to give consumers better information about their energy use, what they are being charged and what else is available. Therefore, we should be requiring energy companies to publish clear information about cheapest tariffs on domestic bills and statements. I am not suggesting for one moment that energy companies should calculate the lowest possible rate for each customer&#151;for one thing, suppliers will not  <br>

always have access to all the relevant information, and no one is proposing to impose such a bureaucratic burden on industry&#151;but we could, at very little cost, improve transparency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000013">We should therefore require energy companies to include on statements what the cheapest tariff would be taking into account certain basic assumptions. A customer, for example, may have online access and so make a payment by direct debit. The information could take into account the pattern of a customer&#146;s energy use, but it could also reveal how much would be saved if they were to switch and how to go about that. There would be several advantages. It could encourage greater use of internet and direct debit payments, which would be for the benefit of all. It could also help to track changes in tariffs and remind customers of the discounts from which they benefit and when they end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000014">I suggest those things as a bare minimum. The same criteria could apply to those on social tariffs. The energy company could be obliged to state whether a customer is on the cheapest available tariff. Obviously, the underlying assumptions would change&#151;those on social tariffs may not have access to bank accounts, for example. Even so, the onus, with the appropriate set of assumptions, could be on energy companies to make it easier for those on social tariffs to see whether they are on the cheapest social tariff. We must remember that until fairly recently&#151;until Ofgem&#146;s intervention&#151;some people on social tariffs were paying more than those who had direct access to banks, direct debits and the internet. That cannot be right and, fortunately, Ofgem put it right.</p>

 I am pleased to make the first intervention under your chairmanship, Mr. Russell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000016">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his long campaign on this issue, which is on the record in the House. He will be aware that some social tariffs charged more than ordinary tariffs and that I have tabled an early-day motion on the matter. Does he share my disappointment that even though more than 800,000 people are on social tariffs, Ofgem and the Government have not really tackled the problem of getting consistent, simple, easy-to-understand, more accessible and fairer social tariffs for the group of people at the bottom? We need to do more to help the poorest people.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="09061057000017"><a name="90610h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="09061057000340"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 I believe that my proposals would go a long way to addressing that issue. Many people on social tariffs could be on an even cheaper tariff. As we know, there are many social tariffs, and they are very different in make-up. As with tariffs that can be paid by direct debit and online, we could simplify social tariffs. One advantage of obliging energy companies to go down that line is that it would result in a great simplification of the tariffs. Making people aware of what tariff they are being charged when they receive their bill would focus the minds of energy companies on the task in hand, which must be to simplify the tariffs. For many customers, the cheapest tariff is the social tariff, which Ofgem now says ought to be no more expensive than any other available. Others are likely to use a direct debit internet account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000018">Statements could also be used to convey information about a household&#146;s energy use compared with, say, other households of a similar size, in the same street or building, or historically.

information mechanisms, we may be able to nudge customers into making behavioural changes that could help to conserve energy, save the environment and reduce bills. In particular, we need to give customers a clear idea how much energy each kilowatt-hour represents in terms of appliance use. For example, customers are more likely to change their habits if they know how much leaving their TV on standby costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000019">It may appear unusual for a Conservative to prescribe in such detail how firms should represent information to customers, but we must remember that energy is not a luxury item or good, and the market is far from truly competitive. Consumers therefore need special help, if they are to be truly empowered, hence my proposal would strike a blow for social responsibility and common sense.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="09061057000020"><a name="90610h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="09061057000341"><b>Bob Spink:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is being most generous in giving way, but I wish to disabuse him of one small point. It is not at all unusual for a Conservative to want better and clearer information for consumers. Conservatives believe in choice and real choice comes only from proper information.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="09061057000021"><a name="90610h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="09061057000342"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is probably being kind to me, but that is a fair point. How can one make informed choices if there is no clear information on which to base them?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000022">I am grateful to Which? for its support for my proposals, although it has been busy proposing that a summary box in a similar format is put on all bills across all suppliers. Information would include the precise name of the tariff, the amount of energy used and how the overall cost had been calculated, which suggests that customers should also be reminded of any discounts from which they are currently benefiting, when those end and any fees they will be charged for changing tariff or supplier. That is vital information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000023">In fairness, Ofgem has also made some suggestions on the matter, as we know. The regulator is consulting on the desirability of an annual statement to customers detailing energy consumed and a reminder of the customer&#146;s right to switch. Information might also be included stating how much customers are paying compared with other packages available from that supplier. However, Which? and I agree that it would be a mistake for that information to be conveyed only once a year at an arbitrary time instead of alongside each energy bill. After all, it is when consumers receive their energy bill&#151;perhaps quarterly&#151;that they are most keenly aware of the costs and most likely to try to do something about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000024">I believe that we can be ambitious and require companies not just to give a general picture of where customers stand in relation to other users but to identify the cheapest rate for them. That is the difference between my proposals and Ofgem&#146;s. Ofgem talked about stating an average cost when it came to tariffs; I am suggesting that energy companies could go one step further and detail the cheapest tariff for that particular customer, taking basic assumptions given the area pattern of energy use. It is not beyond the wit of man for energy companies, with all the technology available to them, to do that on their customers&#146; behalf. Ofgem proposes a  <br>

further tranche of useful information, but I contend that it has excluded the single most useful piece of information&#151;which rate is cheapest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000025">I have put my proposal to the Government on a number of occasions and have been moderately encouraged by the response. In January, during oral questions, the Secretary of State described the idea as ingenious, which was kind of him, and promised to consider it. Only last week, the Minister&#146;s predecessor agreed at oral questions that mine was a very good question, and again promised to look into it. However, I have heard little of substance from DECC, having raised the issue for a reasonable time now, and I would like to take this opportunity to put the Minister on the spot and ask her what is being done about the proposal. Are the Government considering the question, or&#151;I do not wish to be unkind&#151;is Ofgem being used as a shield for inactivity? I would appreciate it if she were to address that point in her reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000026">Will the Minister join me in evaluating some of the changes proposed by Ofgem in response to the findings of its market probe? Whether the policies can be implemented will determine whether the Government should take a more interventionist approach. Ofgem is finalising its policies. It is useful for Members of the House to have the opportunity to comment on them, and hopefully to influence the debate. In that spirit, perhaps the Minister will undertake to send a copy of today&#146;s <i>Official Report </i>to the regulator for its consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000027">I shall briefly address some of the specific issues that Ofgem is considering. Ofgem has been consulting on a ban on unjustified price differences. That is important because at present companies can set different prices in different areas in order, for example, to attract new customers. Those prices do not necessarily reflect relative costs. Customers in one region or on one tariff could be subsidising customers in another region. That can lead to a situation in which the people who can least afford it are paying even more because of their method of payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000028">A new licence condition will require prices to reflect the cost to companies relative to the payment method used. It is also intended that undue discrimination between customers inside and outside areas where the supplier was once the local incumbent will be ironed out. That bold initiative is welcome, but one naturally questions why a sunset clause is being suggested after three years. Ofgem&#146;s logic appears to be that its package of retail remedies will come into play by that date, but it is difficult to feel confident that enough progress will necessarily have been made. I am minded to agree with Consumer Focus: it might be better to undertake a review of the market in three years&#146; time and remove the ban only when it has been demonstrated that the desired changes have taken place. At any rate, we need to hear from Ofgem how it will monitor compliance with the new licence condition, which is likely to be a tough job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000029">Ofgem has also set out new overarching standards of conduct that suppliers should meet. Most of the standards are common sense, and I hope that they are being observed already. They include not selling customers products they do not understand and not preventing them from switching without good reason. However, having said that, I refer to the earlier statistic suggesting that half of those who switch through doorstep selling switch to a more expensive tariff. We know that there are improvements to be made. However, serious questions must be asked about the status of the standards. What   <br>

enforcement mechanism will be provided, and what incentives are there for energy companies to comply with them? Without clear means of enforcement, the standards could prove toothless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000030">Meanwhile, the threat of exit is what forces firms to stay competitive. Customers in debt have traditionally faced the greatest difficulty when it comes to switching, lending credence to the idea that the blessings of liberalisation have not flowed to those who deserve them most&#151;the least well-off. Ofgem should therefore be congratulated on taking steps to make it easier for customers in debt to switch, giving them the right to switch where debt is the result of supplier error and doubling the threshold below which customers can transfer debt from one supplier to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000031">I am doubtful about Ofgem&#146;s proposals on price comparison. The suggestion that a new price scorecard to simplify information on tariffs will make comparison easier between different suppliers is difficult to prove. The usefulness of a price comparison tool will depend ultimately on consumers&#146; ability to estimate their own levels and patterns of energy use for the purpose of comparison. It sounds complex, and users would need to be guided through the process, but perhaps Ofgem will be able to persuade us otherwise. We shall have to wait and see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000032">It is right that we, as parliamentarians, should allow Ofgem the space to present its proposals and seek compliance from the industry, but we must also ask whether further, stronger measures might be needed in future. How does the Minister intend to monitor and evaluate the implementation of Ofgem&#146;s measures and their impact on consumers? What failure criteria will she apply? At what point is she prepared to consider whether Ofgem needs stronger powers to shape the market and benefit consumers? In other words, does Ofgem have strong enough teeth? At what point might it be necessary to refer the matter to the Competition Commission or the Office of Fair Trading?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para20"><a name="09061057000033">I accept that the issues might be seen by some as dull and technical, but I contend that they are extremely important, particularly for the 5 million people who live in fuel poverty. For evidence, one need look no further than the winter of 2007-08, when 22,000 people over the age of 65 died of cold-related illnesses, far more than the number in countries on the continent with more severe weather conditions. The issue is vital. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 Mr. Russell, I apologise to you and to colleagues for being slightly late. I am glad that I was able to hear a substantive part of the speech made by the hon.

work. I agree with the hon. Member for Billericay that it would be helpful if Ofgem shared its preliminary view on a consultative basis before reaching its final view on the way forward.</p>

She knows that we have great respect for her work in this area. She is a parliamentary neighbour of mine and we have always enjoyed good, amicable, cross-border relations. We both shared the disappointment when Millwall nearly won the play-off finals against Scunthorpe. We are having to defer our excitement about Millwall&#146;s promotion by another year, but I hope we will both be there supporting them next year.</p>

 Before the hon. Gentleman moves away from Ofgem, does he agree that perhaps its greatest failure has been in not tackling the failure of profiteering companies to pass on wholesale prices? That is not just about spot prices but about the actual prices paid by companies for the energy that they sell on, because they often forward-buy.</p>

 That is certainly an issue, and I have raised it with all the companies and with Ofgem. On the day that I took over this job, at the beginning of the year, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) and I had a fuel-price summit with all the major suppliers, as well as Ofgem and others, and that was one of the issues we raised, because it has been very much on the agenda.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000038">I am conscious that there is a further, hidden issue in that the way in which someone pays for their supply might leave them disadvantaged when it comes to benefiting from price changes. Whether a customer pays on a daily rate is a big issue, because companies do not necessarily reduce their prices as soon as their costs are reduced. If a customer is built into a system, they might get the benefit much later&#151;or, arguably, not at all if they pay by direct debit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000039">I should like to pay one more compliment to the consumer association Which? on its report, in relation to which it came to see me. I have always had great respect for Which? and have subscribed to it in the past. It has confirmed what some of us who know about this issue were already very aware of&#151;that there are 4,000 different tariffs available in the UK, and that the confusion they bring is not in anybody&#146;s interests. These things are difficult enough for people like us in the Chamber, by which I mean not only the politicians but the civil servants, the staff of the House and the people who watch and take an interest. I would be interested to know how many times my parliamentary colleagues have changed their supplier in recent years, if any of them is willing to admit it. I own up to not having changed mine, to my knowledge, because it is so low on my list of priorities, when I get home at 12 o&#146;clock at night, to work out which tariff might be better. We know for a fact that 50 per cent. of people do not change their supplier, and, if I may say so, some people are less able to address these issues than other people due to intelligence, time, ability, other responsibilities, language and other reasons.</p>

such as when my brother and I took over the management of the house in which my mother lived on her death 18 months ago. We discovered all sorts of irregularities when we tried to get regular bills, and tried to go from having estimated bills to bills requiring a reading. For example, one cannot necessarily get the whole benefit immediately of a change in reading, and therefore reduce the cost, when one goes from an estimated bill to an accurate bill because it is spread over a different period and one has to wait until the next quarter. Those are little things, but for people on tight incomes they are important and make a significant difference, so I thank Which? for doing its job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para26"><a name="09061057000041">I see suppliers regularly, as we all do, and I decided to check specifically the three suppliers to whom I have recently had access. The best illustration of the problem is provided by Scottish Power, which paradoxically supplies fuel to some members of my family in Wales. It has sent out a booklet, dated September 2008, entitled, &#147;Prices: Your domestic gas and electricity pricing information&#148;. The booklet does not have page numbers but it has many pages of information describing a &#147;Single Rate&#148;, a &#147;Two Rate&#148;, a &#147;Domestic &#145;S&#146;&#148; rate, an &#147;Economy 7&#148; rate and a &#147;White Meter No. 1¥&#148; rate&#151;one has to check what that sign means. As well as those five electricity rates, there is a daily service charge, a price for &#147;All/Day kWh&#148;, a separate night rate, and prices without and with VAT.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para27"><a name="09061057000042">The booklet then gives all the different package payment options. One can have a &#147;Premier Plus Package&#148;, paying monthly by direct debit or standing order, a &#147;Standard Package&#148;, paying quarterly by direct debit, cash, cheque or postal order, a &#147;Weekly Payment Package&#148;, paying weekly by payment book or card, or a &#147;Prepayment Package&#148;, paying as one uses a prepayment meter. If that is not enough, one can have a &#147;Premier Plus Package&#148;, paying monthly by direct debit or standing order for gas, or a &#147;Standard Package&#148; for gas with different payment options. There are then standing charge options for gas and some packages that have no standing charges. In the second half of the booklet, there are more categories for standing charge options, including a &#147;ComfortPlus Control&#148; rate, a &#147;ComfortPlus White Meter&#148; rate, a &#147;Domestic &amp; Economy 2000&#148; rate, a &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak C&#148; rate, &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak 2‡&#148; rate, a &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak A‡&#148; rate and a &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak D‡&#148; rate.

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para0"><a name="09061057000043">I want to make a simple set of propositions to the Minister, because I think we are in danger&#151;I say this with respect to the hon. Member for Billericay&#151;of buying into a system that has begun to be so complex that we think it will be sufficient to simplify a bit of it. I should like to put to the Minister not a formulated party policy position, but some suggestions for her and the Government to consider in relation to Ofgem&#146;s work. I have deduced that Ministers as a whole, as well as my party and others, think that the way in which the market was privatised was not, in the end, in consumers&#146; best interests. I have spoken to my right hon. Friends the Members for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) and for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), who were responsible for our policy when these matters were going through  <br>

the House some years ago, and they predicted that it was not the right way to proceed with the industry, and I am confirmed in that view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para1"><a name="09061057000044">I am conscious that we have to have a competitive industry within the European Union, although I observe that whereas the French and others have penetrated the British market well, we have not done quite so well in penetrating the mainland European market, so there does not seem to be absolute equity of access. It is not the first time that that has been mentioned&#151;<i>[Interruption]</i>&#151;and I shall not get the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) going on that. I am pro-European, but it appears that something is not quite right in that context. My background proposition is that we have not got the market quite right, and my proposal is that the Government should confirm that we will all have available to us, in the long term, a smart meter or super-smart meter, as they would move everybody to the cheapest tariff automatically without them having to worry about things. That is more or less the idea of the technology, but that will not happen tomorrow, as the meters must be put into everybody&#146;s homes. The Italians installed them the most quickly&#151;I am told that they did the whole of Italy within three years. I have taken advice from people who have thought about the technical aspect, including colleagues such as my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell), who worked in the architectural profession, local government and elsewhere before he came to the House. He made it clear that it would be far better to have a longer period for installation&#151;not least so there is the capacity to do the work. In a sense, it is nonsense to train the people to do the job if there is only going to be a three-year programme around the country, so it might be better to have a six-year programme or something like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000045">Let us assume that there will eventually be a super-smart meter option for everyone. Until then, we need something that helps people to make choices. The Government should think of a new way of giving people the discounted tariff, which exists for people on low incomes. I was at a dinner the other day with National Energy Action, Neighbourhood Energy and British Gas. British Gas told me that it has 300,000 people on the subsidised tariff rate. Until recently, the way for someone to receive the subsidised tariff was for them to tell British Gas that they are a pensioner, or on income support or the disability living allowance. I gather that, until recently, they did not have to prove that they were on any of those things; they just asserted that they were. That has changed and proof is now required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000046">We could have a simple system that ties in with the Department for Work and Pensions, so that pensioners and people on disability living allowance, income support or in receipt of child benefit can be given a subsidised rate. The reality is that the following groups of people are much more likely to use fuel than the rest of us: people with children&#151;the more children someone has, the more the need is; people who are older, for example, past retirement age; people who are ill or disabled and are at home all day because they cannot work; and people who are out of work. A household full of healthy adults, whether it comprises a single person, a couple, students or other groups of people, should not expect subsidised rates for their fuel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000047">I am not presenting a final formulated proposal, because we need to work the matter out through dialogue with Ministers and Ofgem, but we could have a very simple system that would make it as easy as possible to have, in principle, two types of rate: a normal rate and a cheaper rate for more vulnerable customers. Hon. Members are here because they want to tackle fuel poverty. Obviously, there is not a direct match between the types of people in fuel poverty and those categories because someone who lives in a hard-to-heat home has much greater difficulty than someone who lives in a less hard-to-heat home. If we pull into the categories people who have children under 18 at home&#151;the state knows who they are&#151;people of retirement age, and people who are on disability living allowance or on income support, we are likely to catch the individuals who do not have an income, about whom we are most concerned. That is my first proposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000048">My second proposition is that, at the end of this exercise, it is important to ensure that the energy companies are required to publish publicly&#151;twice a year before and after winter would be reasonable&#151;a grid of the six suppliers with the six key comparators of information that people need in the local and national press. I hope that Ministers will be tough about that with Ofgem because they have hinted that if necessary they will take the powers to be tough and legislate or regulate. Publishing such information would mean that people could make a choice. Everyone would know that, for example, the weekend that the clocks go forward and the weekend that they go back, they would find in their local paper, library and elsewhere a table comparing the suppliers&#146; offers. I do not understand why that cannot happen and why the key facts and figures&#151;for example, the per unit cost&#151;cannot be made available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000049">Thirdly, in terms of the demand system, there is obviously an argument for having a cheaper purchase rate for those who purchase electricity at night when the demand is less. The other day, when I read the suppliers&#146; information&#151;not just Scottish Power but British Gas and Electricit&#233; de France&#151;I noticed that there is not even a consistent time period for the cheaper night-time rate. The time at which people clock on to the cheaper rate depends on the company, which is nonsense. I gather that the peak time for use of electricity and gas is understandably between 4 and 8 pm, so the cheaper rate could be available from 8pm to 8am, or from 8pm to 7am if demand starts earlier in the morning. It is obvious that there is a downtime at night when people use less energy, and it should be possible to have a system that allows people to take their feed then and be charged at a lower unit rate. That principle could  apply generally across the UK so that everyone knows about it. If people have the systems that allow them to have storage heaters and so on, they will benefit from such a proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000050">My final proposition&#151;I have thought about this quite a lot&#151;is that there should be no differential price dependent upon the method of payment, with one exception. Whether someone pays by prepayment meter, direct debit, quarterly, weekly or monthly, they should be charged the same rate provided that they understand that if they do not pay within seven days of the date that they have agreed under whatever system they are using, there might be a slight penalty. Let us consider the proposal the other way round: there would be a  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jun 2009">

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2009 : Column 242WH</b><br>
discount for prompt payment&#151;whoever someone is and whether or not they are on direct debit, prepayment or so on. The Liberal Democrats have argued that the suppliers wrongly penalise two groups of people, and that they should not do so. They penalise people who have to pay up front by pre-payment meters&#151;that should not happen because they are often the poorest people&#151;and they penalise people who do not pay by direct debit. That is one category. Suppliers also penalise the low user because the first unit purchased is charged at a higher cost than later units. If someone purchases only a small number of units, they pay relatively much more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000051">If we are going to deal with that inequality and ensure that no one is penalised for being a low user or because they use a payment method that they need for their own money management, we should have a requirement that says, no matter how someone pays, they will be charged the same price. Such a requirement would get rid of pages of this bumf and it would mean everyone would understand the system. The rate would be x per unit this year&#151;the price would vary twice a year&#151;and suppliers could apply to Ofgem or the Government for permission to vary their rates more than twice a year if the price of fuel went up or down significantly. Other issues would also have to be looked at&#151;for example, the need to provide warnings about price increases a certain number of days before they happen&#151;but my plea is for us to have a very simple system that is led by the needs of the consumer, not the needs of the supplier.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="09061057000052"><a name="90610h0002.htm_spnew0"><a name="09061057000346"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman with great interest. I totally agree that simplicity must be the overriding aim when we consider how to help the consumer. However, will he explain the differences between our proposals because, when smart meters are introduced, I question whether the technology will be advanced enough automatically to ensure that every single household is on the cheapest tariff. That is a debate for the future. In the interim, my proposal suggests that it is not beyond the wit of man for energy companies simply to state on energy bills whether the customer is on the cheapest tariff available given the pattern of energy use. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion sounds a bit more complex than that. Will he perhaps guide us on his proposals?</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="09061057000053"><a name="90610h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="09061057000347"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman knows&#151;and I hope that I have said so clearly&#151;that I respect his work. Outside this Chamber, I am happy to have a continuing discussion with him about the matter. I think that our proposals are complementary. I absolutely do not dissent from his proposal that such information should be available on the front of someone&#146;s bill because patterns of use are normally consistent and, therefore, it is entirely possible to draw such conclusions. Indeed, more and more bills give some description of usage over a longer time span.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000054">I am seeking to deal with the second issue that arises from that, and which involves a quarterly bill that says, &#147;You are not getting the cheapest supply available, given your pattern of use&#148;. Of course, EDF Energy, Scottish Power and British Gas will not automatically tell customers where to go to get a cheaper option. Until we have smart meter automaticity, the customer  <br>

will have to make that choice. I am trying to deal with the fact that because there are so many options available&#151;the price is determined by payment method as well as other things&#151;that is not sufficient of itself. However, I would absolutely support that additional information on the bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000055">I shall make two final points, as I am conscious that the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) will contribute, and that the Minister will then reply. Does the Minister agree that we should demand that energy companies show not just the amount of energy used in the payment period, as they already do, but the embedded carbon used? We could begin to educate people about the implications of their energy use in terms of the big climate change threat that faces us. The last principle is that we should seek to reward customers for energy efficiency and reducing energy usage. There should be an incentive to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000056">As a postscript, there are other things besides varying tariffs and payment options. Customers can get Nectar points and all kinds of other goodies. I believe that they can even get air miles with some companies, but I may be wrong about that&#151;I do not mean to mislead people. The most important thing is that we should try to get a culture in which, of course, we deal with fuel poverty. That is a bad phrase: we are talking about a lack of warm homes, or homes that are inadequately heated, thereby leading to illness and sometimes death. Of course, we want to ensure that people are able to look after themselves and their families well, but we want to reduce energy use and harm to the climate from excess emissions. We should be helping everybody to achieve those things. There is a separate debate about how homes in Britain are insulated which we are all alive to, but it is for another place and time. That is an equal imperative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000057">It would be helpful if, when she replies, the Minister responded positively to the constructive suggestions from this side. I hope that she will support us by saying to Ofgem, when it has thought about what it might propose next but before it finalises its proposals, knowing that the Government are watching it closely and wanting it to be pretty tough with the industry, that we would value a short opportunity to respond to the consultation, so that we can get the most robust position possible under the present law. Perhaps before too long, we might change the law, whoever is in government, to have a much more consumer-focused system.</p>

 I warmly welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Russell. I hope that your first experience of this exercise has not been too traumatic. I warmly congratulate the Minister on her promotion. As I mentioned in a debate yesterday, many of us have found working with her to be extremely productive and a congenial process. No one doubts her commitment to ending fuel poverty. She has worked in that area for many years, and we would be keen to work with her to try to find cross-party solutions that address some of the issues. I congratulate her on her appointment.</p>

Energy and Climate Change. We wish him well in that role. I understand that he will be unpaid and am slightly concerned about having someone holding such an important position as a part-time volunteer. Nevertheless, we congratulate him on his promotion to Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000060">I welcome the measures that my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) proposed this morning. He has campaigned long and hard on these issues and has attracted significant support. The Secretary of State paid him the compliment of describing his idea as &#147;ingenious&#148;. I believe that is a way of saying that his idea is well worth exploring further&#151;undoubtedly it is. The way in which he got non-governmental organisations to support him is also incredibly important. It shows that there is a strong sense in the world outside Westminster that the system does not work as well as it ought to. I congratulate him not just on his ten-minute Bill and his early-day motion, but on securing this important debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000061">I welcomed the comments of the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink). His presence today shows his personal commitment, as did his interventions in the debate. I am concerned, however, that the issues we are discussing have not yet been properly addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000062">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) spoke about switching. I did, in fact, switch a few years ago, because I wanted to move to a green tariff. It became evident that it was not a cheaper tariff. The experience was straightforward. Several shadow Ministers went through the exercise. Disturbingly, one of my colleagues tried to switch his gas supply to an electricity supplier that did not provide gas, which, I imagine, had dramatic consequences for the safety of his household. Generally, several of us switched. The process was straightforward, but it did not put us on to a more favourable tariff. The hon. Gentleman was helpful when he read out from the booklet. Initially, it was as exciting as someone reading from a telephone directory, but it showed how completely baffling the tariffs are. No one could be expected to read through that booklet and understand at the end of the process which system would be better for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000063">One of the things that became clear was that the more favourable tariffs are available only to those who have bank accounts. That is a matter of great concern. It is one of the reasons why we have suggested extending the remit of the Post Office card account to enable people who do not have a bank account but do have a Post Office card account to pay their utility bills, particularly their energy bills, using that account. It has been independently estimated that, if that were to happen, 4 million people without bank accounts could save about &#163;100 a year on their utility bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000064">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the only tariff distinction should be between those who pay on time and those who do not. He may have seen me grimace at that point. My concern is that those who do not pay on time are not necessarily those who can afford to but are lazy, but probably those who cannot afford to pay on time. They juggle different bills. They may have to pay their rent that week or do something else, and they simply have to put something off. It worries me greatly that the only people who might be subject to a higher tariff would be those who are probably finding it most difficult to pay. In any reforms, we must ensure that there are not perverse consequences which would actually move us in the wrong direction.</p>

 I completely understand the issue. In a constituency such as mine, I am hugely sensitive to it. I was seeking to find a way to ensure that people did not abuse the system and fail to pay but not ever suffer the consequences, but also sort out the present situation in respect of people who pay in advance. The certainty of payment is an advantage to the company that receives the money. I am happy to continue the debate about how we deal with prompt payment as opposed to late payment but mitigate the consequences for those who are in difficulty.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. It highlights the importance of smart meters and our frustration that the smart meter programme is not moving forward faster. In Northern Ireland, 40 per cent. of households are now equipped with smart meters. It has a lower rate for prepayment customers than for mainstream consumers&#151;because customers pay in advance, the company can be clear that bills will be paid. Smart meters can help to tackle some of the issues; I shall come back to that shortly,  if I may.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000067">It is clear to us that the debate on fuel poverty is moving in the wrong direction. We have had a revised interpretation of the law. When it was introduced, it stated that fuel poverty should be abolished by 2010 for vulnerable households, and by 2016 for all households. It was not clear at the time that the few words</p>
<a name="90610h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09061057000312"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as far as practically possible&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09061057000068">would be attached to it. As we now move towards the 2010 deadline, it is evident that the numbers are getting worse rather than better, and that it is virtually impossible to meet the target. It has been disappointing to find that there has been a lot of wiggle room, which has enabled Ministers to get off what we thought was a legal hook.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000069">Targets should not be introduced without a road map to explain how they will be reached. It sounded all well and good to introduce a target for eradicating fuel poverty, but nobody said where we needed to be by 2006, or by 2008, if we were to meet the target by 2010. So as we move closer towards that target, people could say whether or not we are moving in the right direction and ask what more needs to be done. This is a general problem that one has with targets in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09061057000070">In tackling fuel poverty, we need to be clear about the different roles that could be played by Government and the energy companies. Many issues to do with fuel poverty need to be dealt with centrally by Government. Often, people who are fuel-poor are probably generally in poverty and do not just struggle to pay their electricity and gas bills: they struggle to pay all their bills, including food and phone bills. The solution to that is probably through Government giving more targeted support to the people who need it most.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000071">The hon. Gentleman talked about having a separate system for people in vulnerable groups and mentioned families with children and people who are elderly or have disabilities. It is hard for an energy company to know who is in any of those categories at any time. For example, they do not know the situation of a marital break-up&#151;whether there is one income or two or whether a child has moved away from home&#151;or what has happened in terms of people&#146;s financial circumstances. The one organisation that knows that is the Government, because they are charged with paying benefits to those  <br>

vulnerable groups. Therefore, there is a distinct role for the Government in this regard. Sometimes we try to confuse the work of the energy companies and impose on them responsibilities that the Government are more equipped to tackle. There is a natural role for Government in this process, just as there is also a natural role for the energy companies.</p>

 Of course, the Government have the information, not the energy companies. A way of dealing with the issue would be to make the winter fuel payment payable before Christmas&#151;when everybody uses it, and some people use it for things other than electricity bills&#151;to all the people in all those vulnerable categories, possibly for six months or across the year as a top-up to the other payments that they receive, such as pension benefit and the rest. That could be entirely the responsibility of the Government and it would be there to subsidise and reduce the consumers&#146; bills.</p>

 Although there is a lot of ground worth exploring there, we would still have to decide whether a high-income family with one child should receive exactly the same benefit as a low-income family with four children. This issue is complex, but we probably agree fundamentally that Government can do some things better than companies. I find the prospect of the energy companies having to take legal action against their consumers to reclaim money that people have had because they did not advise the companies about a change in their circumstances too horrific to contemplate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000074">The companies should be doing much more to simplify tariffs. It is absurd that there are 4,000 tariffs out there. Although those have probably grown up for the best reasons in the world, it should be an important priority for the companies to go through them with a red pen, remove those that can be removed and move people on to a much smaller range of more readily understandable tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="90610h0002.htm_para25"><a name="09061057000075">The companies should be giving much more information to their consumers on their bills, as my hon. Friend suggested directly, including when people call in and ask for advice. In the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change, I asked the heads of the electricity companies whether they would make it an absolute policy that anybody phoning to ask about a specific tariff would be told which one was most favourable, if the one they were inquiring about was not. The head of Scottish and Southern Energy said that, yes, that would be its policy. I hope that other companies will follow suit, so that if anybody rings up and asks, &#147;Is this a good move?&#148;, they will be told, &#147;Yes, but this one would be even better for you.&#148; That sort of information is important. Of course, the companies should also be helping with energy efficiency. They should ensure that their social tariffs should always be their lowest ones. A social tariff should not be bettered by some alternative tariff. People should be clear that if they are entitled to a social tariff it is the best available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para0"><a name="09061057000076">I think that all hon. Members can agree that bills do not give enough information on comparisons between different types of residences, as my hon. Friend suggested, or about what should be the cheapest tariff. We could go further. During the passage of the Energy Bill, we said that energy bills should tell the householder what CO2 emissions relate to their usage, as the hon. Gentleman  <br>

suggested. If we want consumers to change, they must have information. As the hon. Member for Castle Point said, people only get real choice if they have real information. We should assume that, if they are given the information, consumers will have the ability and the common sense to make those choices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para1"><a name="09061057000077">We have suggested that consumers should be told what the environmental charges are. At the moment, typically, &#163;70 or &#163;80 of a &#163;1,000 bill relates to the environmental charges: the contributions towards the renewables obligation certificates, the European emission trading scheme and the carbon emissions reduction target scheme. If we want an honest debate with the public about the cost of energy efficiency and environmental improvements, they should be told what that is costing them and it should be spelled out on their bill, because there would be a better engagement if people realised exactly what it is costing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000078">Some people say, &#147;This is all too confusing. The public simply wouldn&#146;t understand this range of information.&#148; That is wrong. One company out there called First Utility says that the first thing that it does with a new customer is to install a smart meter. Then it gives them a bill showing them their electricity use for every half hour during that month. The bill compares the half hour of greatest usage in a month with that in previous usage, so people can see when their lowest period of energy usage is, allowing them to ask themselves, &#147;Why was my usage on that Friday so much greater than the previous Friday?&#148;, or whatever. First Utility has found that informed consumers really do start to make changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000079">The introduction of smart meters is fundamental to the process of informing consumers. Smart meters will have great benefits in terms of energy efficiency and the environment and they will facilitate microgeneration. With regard to this debate, they will also make a massive contribution towards tackling fuel poverty. Smart meters will enable people to see what their usage is much more readily, on a real-time display in their homes, and see why something has suddenly surged. With a smart meter, people will know the comparative use of their tumble dryer, fridge and dishwasher and they will be able to determine how often they want to use things. They will be able to switch consumption, so that if they decide to use a better tariff in the night, they will get the benefits. Smart meters will not, per se, reduce people&#146;s energy tariffs, but if people start using them constructively and sensibly they will make significant reductions indeed. That is the sort of change that we all want to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000080">We need to ensure that people have a better understanding generally of the equipment that they are buying. My hon. Friend touched on the fact that every white good that we buy has a star rating for energy efficiency: so should every television and computer and every bit of kit that we buy that uses electricity. We should have an understanding of that. Somebody looking at an LCD TV and a plasma screen TV should be able to choose based on the fact that the plasma screen TV will use massively more energy than the LCD one. That information needs to be made available to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000081">We need to understand how technology is evolving. My hon. Friend mentioned standby buttons. Formerly, just maintaining the electricity supply for the nation&#146;s  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jun 2009">

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2009 : Column 248WH</b><br>
standby buttons used the same amount of power as the city of Liverpool: two power stations needed full-time. Technology is changing that. People can leave a new low-energy standby button on for three months using the same amount of electricity as it takes to boil a kettle once. The technology is moving beyond recognition in these areas. But is the standby button in my house the old one, which keeps Liverpool alight, or the new one that uses a fraction of the electricity used by a kettle? We need greater information if we are to have proper consumer choice in such matters. There needs to be much greater simplicity in the tariffs that are offered. The range of tariffs must be reduced and we must also ensure that consumers are in a position actively to compare what they are using.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000082">My hon. Friend also touched on the important role of the regulator in this area. We have suggested that there may be grounds for a swift assessment of the prices by the Competition Commission to ensure that a reduction in wholesale price is passed on as quickly as the price increases appear to be passed on. Having looked at this, Ofgem has suggested that there is no collusion and that there is not a case to be answered. But there still remains in the public great anxiety about the speed with which price reductions are passed on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000083">We recognise that there are enormous demands on the energy companies at the moment. They are profitable businesses, but they are being asked to spend tens of billions of pounds on new generating capacity and developing renewable technologies, on energy efficiency in our homes and businesses and on grid upgrading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000084">We are conscious that in today&#146;s world some companies are based in France and Germany, and we must make a pitch to their boards for why they should continue to invest in the United Kingdom. We understand the competitive pressure facing the United Kingdom, and that if we do not receive new investment that will lead to tremendous energy insecurity, which will push up prices to very high levels in the middle of the next decade. We must balance that with the certainty that wholesale price reductions are passed on, and Ofgem can do more in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000085">There is no doubt that this is the time to act. At this time last year, we could see that winter prices would be horrible. Today&#146;s gas price is 26p a therm and the forward price for the winter is double that at 52p a therm. That is well below where it peaked last year, but clear indicators already exist that prices could rise again in the winter. When we see a rising trend in oil prices, we know that gas prices will follow. When the Government saw the warning signs last year, they did not act quickly enough. A great deal can be done now to use people who are losing their jobs to insulate our homes better and to ensure that those in fuel poverty are given every help to reduce their energy consumption. We would like to hear from the Minister that she will start to take real action on my hon. Friend&#146;s sensible proposals, which will start to give consumers the information that they need to make informed choices and to cut their bills.</p>

 I thank all hon.  Members who have contributed to this interesting and productive debate. I particularly commend the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) for obtaining it and  <br>

for presenting his case so ably. I also thank him for his kind words to me. I may not cover all my predecessor&#146;s brief, because we have not yet decided on portfolios and I have some major responsibilities for climate change. We will decide soon what the mix will be, but I am happy to be here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000087">We are all clear that people must be treated fairly by the companies that supply their energy and that they must have confidence in the rules and arrangements under which those companies operate. I agree with the interventions by the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink), because unless people have good information that they can understand, they cannot exercise choice, which is central to running a competitive energy market such as that in this country. We must do better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000088">Last year, the gas and electricity regulator, Ofgem, registered concerns from consumers and the Government, and responded by investigating the energy supply markets. Hon. Members have referred to that work, which revealed that many consumers suffer significant and unjustified disadvantages in what they pay for their energy. Under pressure from the Government and the regulator, suppliers have taken action to remove those unfair practices. That is a start, but all suppliers must take full responsibility for ending such practices and avoiding their repetition in future. Ofgem is working to ensure that through changes to suppliers&#146; licences. We have made it absolutely clear to energy companies and Ofgem that fairness to consumers is a key priority, and I reiterate that today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000089">Ofgem&#146;s investigation also showed that consumers cannot always make the best choices about tariffs, payment methods and energy use, because they are not given information that they can understand fully and use effectively. I share the concerns of all hon. Members who have spoken this morning about information for consumers and the need to make great improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000090">Suppliers must clear away confusion about tariffs and how information is presented. People must be able to understand their bills and to make confident decisions on tariffs. The hon. Member for Billericay said that changes are clearly needed on tariffs, and the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) illustrated from his reading of the booklet what a nightmare the current system is. We are all clear about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000091">As the hon. Member for Billericay said, the regulator has proposed new obligations on suppliers to provide clearer information to their customers, and specifically a standard annual statement, including the tariff name, the customer&#146;s consumption, a reminder of the right to switch, and simplified information on tariffs to make comparisons easier, including a clear price scorecard, although I know that the hon. Gentleman expressed some scepticism about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000092">The hon. Gentleman made a good argument on the need to simplify and clarify tariffs. Being able to make a comparison with similar homes would undoubtedly be a useful way for people to satisfy themselves that they were getting a fair deal, and that they were doing the right thing. Most people want to do the right thing&#151;they want to save energy for the benefit of their pocket and also to help the climate&#151;but they are not in a good position to know whether they are doing the best for themselves and for society at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000093">The hon. Gentleman suggested that each consumer should have information about the cheapest rate for them. Clearly, that would be ideal, but the problem is how to achieve it, and the work is already under way by Ofgem.</p>

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="09061057000094"><a name="90610h0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="09061057000354"><b>Simon Hughes:</b>
 Will the Minister address whether the normal consumer would believe that the organisation best equipped to give them independent and accurate advice about the best option for them is the supplier who wants their custom, or someone who is not connected with the supplier, such as someone engaged by the local authority or an independent agency?</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="09061057000095"><a name="90610h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="09061057000355"><b>Joan Ruddock:</b>
 It may sound attractive to have someone who is independent, but that might introduce enormous complexity. The energy supplier in a competitive market wants to attract customers and to keep them, so they have an interest in serving them well. The disappointment about the competitive market at the moment is that, as we have all agreed, people cannot even work out whether they are getting the best deal. It is crucial to making the system operate that the energy companies are obliged to produce the information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000096">The hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) said that people should be able to discover how much energy is used by different appliances, such as leaving the TV on standby. We are working with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on sustainable consumption and production, and particularly in Europe, to obtain more labelling schemes, reductions in appliances&#146; energy use, choice editing by retailers, and to enable customers to make relevant choices. Whether all that information could be supplied directly by energy companies is questionable, the obvious reason being the extent of the booklet. We must not put more and more requirements on energy companies, but we must ensure that we enable people&#151;retailers have a huge role to play in this and have been helpful&#151;to make the best choices in reducing their energy consumption wherever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000097">The hon. Member for Billericay referred to the Which? report and recommendations, which I have looked at in preparation for this debate. That organisation has taken a useful role by engaging more customers in the debate and coming forward with a host of proposals. We need to keep up the pressure, which I welcome wherever it comes from. I hope that all the recommendations were made to Ofgem in the consultation that closed recently, which is where such matters can be properly explored.</p>

We are not using Ofgem as a shield and are working with the regulator that this Government put in place. Ofgem is there to do a job, which it is doing. It was asked to make proposals that will give consumers more confidence when changing suppliers and to give a guarantee that the process will be safe. It is clearly nonsense if people go through a process to get a better deal and end up with a worse one.</p>

have shared his experience. We probably made the same switch on to a green tariff, and we probably pay the highest prices as a consequence. I will be satisfied with that if the company produces additional green energy beyond what would have come about as part of the supplier obligations under renewables obligations certificates. I am currently trying to find that out.</p>

 May I gently put the Minister on the spot? We all accept that Ofgem is looking at a range of proposals. We welcome that and want to be part of the process. However, as I highlighted in my speech, my simple proposal goes one step further than what Ofgem is considering. The Government have said that they welcome that proposal and are actively considering it. However, it is not clear what they will do about it. She has quoted Ofgem at me, but Ofgem is falling short of my proposal. What will the Government do with regard to my proposal?</p>

 We are considering all matters raised in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals, the Which? report and this debate. The suggestion was made that I send a copy of this debate to Ofgem, and I will do so. However, we must allow Ofgem to do its job. It would be premature to give a commitment to adopt any ideas&#151;including the hon. Gentleman&#146;s&#151;however fine they are, because we have given Ofgem a job to do. When we see the results, we will be in a position to say whether we are satisfied. We have made it clear that we want satisfaction, fairness, transparency and the fair deal that consumers have not been getting. It was assumed that privatisation would give consumers a fair deal, but it has not. We are all impatient for improvements.</p>

 I have made a note of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point and will consider it. There are processes and protocols that must be followed. However, we ought to be in a position to have a meeting. It would also make sense to hold an all-party meeting, if the Front-Bench spokesmen would like to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000104">It was necessary for the regulator to consult on these issues because that is the appropriate vehicle for taking account of the views of everyone concerned. That is the process that we are currently going through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para22"><a name="09061057000105">I was asked what the criteria for success will be and how I will monitor them. As we have all rehearsed, one criterion for success is whether the consumer has information that helps them to understand their bills and to make the appropriate behavioural changes. As suggested by Which?, another test will be whether the public opinion of Ofgem and the energy companies changes. Public opinion of the companies is currently poor. The companies would appreciate a change in public opinion, so it is in the interests of everyone that we work together to sort this matter out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000106">In the follow-up to its probe, Ofgem examined standards in doorstep selling. In my constituency, Deptford Action Group for the Elderly frequently complains that people  <br>

going door to door&#151;particularly to the doors of elderly people&#151;are quite aggressive in trying to persuade people to sign up to new tariffs on the spot. There is concern that people will feel intimidated and might make the wrong choices. We know that many have made wrong choices, although I am not suggesting that they were bullied into doing so. We therefore appreciate Ofgem&#146;s examination of the standards in doorstep selling. It has proposed new rules to require suppliers to offer written quotations following doorstep sales and to provide that the offer made on the doorstep is better than the customer&#146;s existing deal. That is another important step forward. All the steps that have been taken could prove to be important in giving consumers confidence that they are paying fair prices for their energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000107">No matter how much information consumers have, their main concern is the size of bills, particularly given last year&#146;s dramatic price rises. The Government have made it clear that we expect reductions in the wholesale costs for energy companies to be passed on to the consumer. We have required Ofgem to track the link between wholesale and household prices so that there is more transparency. That will be reported to us on a quarterly basis. We are keeping a close eye on that, especially as oil prices have recently risen again. I appreciate the concerns of all hon. Members who have spoken in support of their constituents and urge everyone to keep up the pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para25"><a name="09061057000108">Although we all want affordable energy, energy companies should publish on their bills the extent of the payments that are made in support of renewable energy and the transition to a low-carbon economy, as the hon. Member for Wealden has proposed. We are committed to moving to a low-carbon economy, increasing our renewable energy supplies and meeting the 15 per cent. target by 2020, but we must accept that that will add inevitably to the cost of fuel bills. We are developing policies to make that journey as cost-effective as possible. We are putting in place policies and regulations that help consumers take action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para26"><a name="09061057000109">We believe that smart meters, which have been referred to by all hon. Members in this debate, can contribute significantly to that aim and be cost-effective. They can help us change our energy habits in the short term and provide a stepping-stone to the smart grids of the future. Smart meters will empower all consumers, enabling them to monitor their energy use and reduce consumption, which will help them to save money as well as reduce carbon emissions. There will be no more of the estimated bills that particularly irritate those people, such as hon. Members, who can never be at home for the meter to be read. I had estimated bills for years, and then, amazingly, my energy company found that my gas meter had not even been working. There are great hazards in estimated bills, and I probably suffered one of the worst of those. Not being able to stay home for readings is a real problem, and we need to move beyond it as quickly as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para27"><a name="09061057000110">We have announced, as hon. Members know, the roll-out of smart meters. I know that there is frustration, because we have said that the total roll-out will take us until 2020, but it is a major infrastructure project. We have more than 20 million homes, and we must get it right. We want to put in the equipment that will do the best, most comprehensive and most efficient job. That is why there is a consultation period before the roll-out.  <br>

We are determined to bring smart meters forward through a system whose design will bring the best value to everyone involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para28"><a name="09061057000111">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey made several points, and I have not dealt with them all yet. I thank him for his congratulations. I agree that it is disappointing that we cannot congratulate Millwall this year, but there is next year. He suggested&#151;I think that I have already responded on this point&#151;that when Ofgem has established a preliminary view, it should consult on it. I am happy to take that proposal on board. He accepted the need for a competitive industry in Europe, and I agree with him that there has not been sufficient liberalisation of the continental energy market. It is not a case of our turning back, but rather of seeing that more is done in continental Europe. He said that a smart meter is the answer to getting the best tariff, and, as I have just explained, we all hope that we will be able to go down that path.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para29"><a name="09061057000112">The hon. Gentleman spoke at length about social tariffs and suggested that a subsidised rate might be possible for all vulnerable groups, which he defined as pensioners, disability living allowance recipients and people with children. We have social tariffs at present, which last year cost energy companies &#163;100 million. This year, they will cost &#163;125 million, and next year they will cost &#163;150 million&#151;they cover 800,000 people. The categories of people to whom the hon. Gentleman referred would run into many millions&#151;possibly tens of millions. The difficulty with subsidised tariffs, as opposed to lowest tariffs, is that they require someone else to fund the subsidy. That would be either the Government, directly, or, as at present, the energy companies. The more we use subsidy to prevent or help people out of fuel poverty, the more we risk tipping others into fuel poverty. That is why the social tariff model outlined by the hon. Gentleman would not work. However, that is not to say that we are not extremely interested in, and carefully considering, social tariffs. We appreciate that many people have urged us to mandate for social tariffs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="90610h0003.htm_para30"><a name="09061057000113">The hon. Gentleman suggested that there should be publications in newspapers twice a year. That is a very interesting idea&#151;as is anything simple that we can do that people can rely on. The question is whether the simplicity that the hon. Gentleman proposed can be achieved. He spoke about the night rate and said that the hours are not even the same for every company, and I agree that it would be sensible if those were brought into line. Everyone made a plea for a simpler system; I agree, and we must try to achieve it.</p>

the population to have access to the information, but we perhaps need to be more imaginative about where it is best for that information to sit&#151;sometimes it sits best with the appliance or consumer goods, when they are purchased. We are working, through the Carbon Trust, with several major retailers, to do carbon footprinting and look at embedded carbon.</p>

All consumers need and deserve help and protection, but there is clearly a particular need for safeguards for people who are fuel-poor. The hon. Member for Wealden said that we should not have targets without a road map by which to achieve them. When the fuel poverty strategy was devised, we were in a very different world. It was hugely successful in the early days, and between 1996 and 2004 fuel poverty was reducing steadily. In that time, we brought 4.5 million households out of fuel poverty. It is rising energy prices since 2004 that have reversed that progress. For the Government that means redoubling our efforts. Since 2000, we have spent &#163;20 billion helping the fuel-poor in this country, through a number of initiatives. Yet despite those efforts, and despite our being the only country in the world with a fuel poverty strategy, fuel poverty has increased.</p>

The review examines whether existing measures to tackle fuel poverty could be made more effective. It considers whether new policies should be introduced to help us make further progress, particularly in the light of market conditions to which we have referred already and our aim of reducing carbon emissions. The initial findings of the review will be available later in the summer. I am glad that the hon. Member for Wealden agrees with us about the complexity of trying to sort out the mechanisms by which we can further assist people who need assistance, and about the fact that the targeting and method are critical. We are carefully examining, as hon. Members have suggested, the way information is shown, so that we can improve targeting. We accept that the Government have a role and that it is not all down to energy companies.</p>

We cannot be complacent about the service that paying energy customers receive, and we should aim for that to be the best and fairest service possible. Regulation needs to be active and effective in current conditions. Rules must be amended, where necessary, to stop unfair practices creeping in again in future, and to help consumers make sound decisions. I appreciate the interest that has been taken by all hon. Members who have contributed today. It is obvious that there is much common ground between us. We all share the aims that the hon. Member for Billericay put forward in the debate. I am grateful to him for doing that, and I look forward to working with everyone to advance the cause and get a much better deal for consumers from their energy supply companies.</p>

 I begin by thanking Mr. Speaker for granting me this 30-minute Westminster Hall debate to discuss the case of my constituent, Mrs. Masuma Jariwalla.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000119">Mrs. Jariwalla first came to see me at my advice surgery in May 2003. She is a Shi&#146;a Muslim, who was born and married into the Dawoodi Bohra sect. She divorced her husband under English civil law in 1995. The couple have two sons, who are now both over 18. My constituent told me that her ex-husband, a strict religious Shi&#146;a, will not accept that divorce as binding on him, but will consider himself divorced only if he divorces her under Shi&#146;a law. She has a new partner, a Sunni Muslim, but he cannot marry her nor can his parents accept her into the family unless her ex-husband releases her by accepting the English civil divorce or divorces her under Shi&#146;a law. It seemed to me in 2003, and nothing has been achieved to change my mind since then, that I could not help her so long as her ex-husband refused a Shi&#146;a divorce and she, as a religious woman, wished to remain bound by Shi&#146;a laws, which she clearly respects, unless the Government change the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000120">Following our first meeting, I corresponded with a number of Ministers on her behalf, to see whether the Government would be able to help, perhaps directly by amending the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, or indirectly by amending the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002, or even by passing new legislation to deal with this impasse. I appreciate that Government and Parliament, although sensitive even to a small number of difficult cases, must be careful to consider the wider implications of making statutory changes to the religious customs and laws of a religion of any denomination with which it has no proper business to interfere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000121">In June 2003, Lord Filkin, then the Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Constitutional Affairs, replied to a letter that I had written in May to the right hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), then a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor&#146;s Department. Lord Filkin accepted that my constituent was locked into a state of affairs similar to some Jewish chained wives, who are prevented from remarrying because of their husband&#146;s refusal to grant a religious divorce or get. If the husband does not apply to the Beth Din for a get and deliver it to his wife, she cannot remarry under Jewish law. The Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act, which came into force in 2003, provided some assistance by enabling the English divorce courts to require the dissolution of the religious marriage before granting a civil divorce. That means that a husband who refuses to deliver a get to his wife will not be able to obtain a civil divorce and lawfully remarry. That provision is fine so far as it goes, but it does not assist my constituent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000122">Mrs. Jariwalla&#146;s plight may be numerically unusual, but the size of the orthodox religious Jewish population is large and the number of divorces in that community must, for a host of religious and social reasons internal to that community, be correspondingly small. However, the problem was sufficient to cause the Government to recognise that some measure of reform was required to allow for social harmony and compliance with our  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000123">Lord Filkin accepted that my constituent and other Muslim women faced a similar problem to that faced by the Jewish women, whose husbands refused to grant them the talaq, whose rights and interests were enhanced by the 2002 Act. Mrs. Jariwalla, as a British citizen, was and remains divorced under the law of England but trapped by sharia law in a marriage to which she has no real or emotional attachment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000124">There are, of course, any number of differences between Islam and Judaism. However, I suggest that as the Muslim population of the United Kingdom grows year by year, and as a greater proportion of that population are and will be British-born rather than foreign-born, and as the cultural, religious and geographical links that bound first and even second-generation Muslim families are attenuated by the exposure of the younger, indigenous generations to the social mores and cultural systems prevalent in the majority population of British citizens, the tensions between English civil and Muslim religious law will increase, and need to be alleviated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000125">As within the Christian faith, there will always be groups and individuals for whom the religious teachings and tenets of their own faith take precedence over secular civil law, no matter how problematic that can be. However, there will be a cohort of Muslim women brought up within one world from which they do not want entirely to be separated who, in order to live happy and fulfilling lives in modern Britain, need to be able to exist in harmony within both a religious and a secular context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000126">Since 2003, as well as contacting the two Ministers to whom I have already referred, I contacted Lady Ashton of Upholland and the Leader of the House of Commons, the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), who were then Ministers at the Department for Constitutional Affairs. Like Lord Filkin, they said that they could do nothing unless it became clear that there was consensus within the Muslim community, and that the reason why Muslims could not be included under the 2002 Act was that their communities were not able to offer efficient remedies to deal with the problem&#151;and, anyway, that women like my constituent could always approach the sharia council to ask for the marriage to be dissolved. Furthermore, the Government had received no representations from the Muslim community, which they had from the Jewish community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000127">I am grateful for the Under-Secretary&#146;s attendance here today. She will know that the two great sects in Islam are the Sunni and the Shi&#146;a Muslims, with Sunnis predominating by some measure. The Muslim Council of Britain is the umbrella body covering the many Muslim councils and sub-councils to be found in this country. These councils can resolve marriage disputes such as my constituent&#146;s by issuing a fatwa, but I understand that Dawoodi Bohra wives, like the pre-2002 Act Jewish wives, cannot remarry unless their husbands consent to a religious divorce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000128">In the autumn of 2008, I wrote to the Janaab Amilsaheb of the Anjuman-e-Saifee in Leicester and to Dr. Idris Zainuddin in Northolt, the relevant Dawoodi Bohra religious leaders, to ask them to intercede in this case. Apart from a polite holding reply from Leicester that  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000129">I wrote to the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham again in January this year, in her capacity as Minister for Woman; in February the Under-Secretary replied. She told me nothing new. With Mrs. Jariwalla&#146;s consent, I bring the matter to the House in the hope that any publicity generated by this debate will act as a spur to action within the Muslim community and among the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000130">It is far too late for the 2002 Act to include my constituent&#146;s case, as she was long ago granted a decree absolute under English law. There is nothing to be gained in preventing her ex-husband from getting a civil divorce in order to stop him lawfully remarrying, because he already has a divorce and, if he chooses, he can remarry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000131">If one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, the power can be abused and used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree to less favourable terms for residence and contact with children, and for financial provision. That is no longer relevant in this 14-year-old case, but surely neither the Government or Parliament should countenance a continuing conflict between her ex-husband&#146;s refusal to grant a religious divorce and Mrs. Jariwalla&#146;s rights to family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, her rights to freedom of conscience and religion under article 9, her right to marry under article 12, her right to equality between spouses under article 4 of the 7th protocol to the convention, her right not to suffer discrimination in the exercise of her convention rights under article 14 of the convention, and her right to an effective remedy to protect her rights under article 13. Similar provisions are to be found in the United Nations universal declaration on human rights, which the United Kingdom voted for as long ago as 1948, and in other more recent treaties to which we are a party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000132">Of course, we respect the separation between religion and politics, which rightly inhibits Governments from interfering in the practice of religion unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law. However, that is what we have here: the current power held over this woman by her ex-husband is an abuse of her rights as a citizen under the law, and the Government have a duty to put it right. They can no longer wait for consensus within the Muslim community, or for that community to approach the Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000133">As a matter of public policy, of fairness, of humanity and of justice, I urge the Government, through the Minister, to apply whatever pressure and influence they can to impress upon the Dawoodi Bohra authorities the need to allow Mrs. Jariwalla&#151;talaq or no talaq&#151;to be freed from this long-dead marriage.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Russell. I congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) on securing this debate, in which he has outlined Masuma Jariwalla&#146;s poignant and long-running case. As he explained, he has already brought it to my attention and that of a number of my predecessors. I also want to place on the record my sincere and absolute sympathy for Ms Jariwalla.</p>

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2009 : Column 258WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000135">I shall explain in a little detail the principles behind sharia law and then try to address some of the issues raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman. Sharia law is the code of personal religious law governing the conduct of Muslims, and, as he pointed out, Ms Jariwalla, and many others in this country, have chosen to live by it and wish to continue to do so. Sharia law is not part of the law of England and Wales and nor do the Government have any intention of changing that position. We believe that social cohesion is best served by people living together under one legal system, rather than a system of personal laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para20"><a name="09061057000136">The hon. and learned Gentleman rightly points out that it is not Government&#146;s business to legislate to change the laws and customs of a religion; the business of Government is to frame appropriate laws for the country, within which personal choice to practise a religion or follow a religious law can be exercised. We would not want to interfere in the right of people to live their lives according to their religion. Nothing in the law in England and Wales prevents people from abiding by sharia principles if they wish to do so, provided that it does not conflict with the law in England and Wales. If it did, the law in England and Wales would prevail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000137">The hon. and learned Gentleman asked what the Government can do to bring the predicament of Ms Jariwalla, and possibly others like her, in line with modern British life. He referred to changes made through section 10A of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. That provision applies to the Jewish faith, and to any other prescribed faith whose representatives apply to the Lord Chancellor to be brought within the scope of the Act. Since the provision came into force in 2003, no other religious group has sought to bring its faith within the scope of the Act. However, given what he has said, I now feel that it might be incumbent on me to suggest to other religious groups that they might like to consider being brought within its scope, rather than to wait for them to come forward. Obviously, it is not my role to persuade them to do so, but I could at least bring the provision to their attention and ask them to think about whether it would be appropriate for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para22"><a name="09061057000138">Having said that, in Ms Jariwalla&#146;s case, section 10A might not be the answer. The section enables a court to refuse a decree absolute until a recalcitrant spouse has undertaken the necessary steps to enable the parties to obtain a religious divorce. It does not purport to change religious law; it simply enables the civil law divorce to be withheld until the parties have dissolved the marriage in accordance with their religion. In Jewish law, divorce requires the co-operation of both parties. The husband secures a get from the religious court, which is then delivered to the wife. If he refuses to do so, the wife might be able to obtain a divorce under civil law. However, because she would remain married to her husband, in the eyes of Jewish law, she would not be entitled to remarry in an orthodox ceremony. If she is devout, that inhibition might be a major source of distress and unhappiness for her and her family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000139">Section 10A is of use, however, only if the husband wants a civil divorce. Under the Jewish faith, the man is free to marry again, having been granted a civil divorce, even without obtaining a religious divorce. If he wishes to remarry, he can obtain a civil divorce, so section 10A could be an incentive to the husband to provide the wife with the necessary get by allowing that civil divorce to  <br>

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2009 : Column 259WH</b><br>
be withheld until the get is provided. However, section 10A would be ineffective against a spouse who has no interest in obtaining a civil divorce. And that is as true of a Jewish religious marriage as of any other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000140">The hon. and learned Gentleman rightly said that the numerical size of the problem is not the issue&#151;we are probably talking about very small numbers of people. The problem is that section 10A is ineffective in any situation in which the spouse resisting religious divorce has no interest in the dissolution of a civil marriage. Ms Jariwalla&#146;s situation might be similar to those of some Jewish women, but it is not identical, so I am not convinced that section 10A would provide a solution in every case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para25"><a name="09061057000141">The Government have stated that they will consider representation from Islamic communities and organisations to extend section 10A to that religious group. However, that can be done only if it wishes to bring its faith within the scope of the Act. I shall ensure that we remind it of that provision; and it might then wish to consider making representations to be brought within its scope. Having said that, none of this detracts from the very real problems highlighted by Ms Jariwalla&#146;s case and the difficulties of managing a modern life for people of different religions in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para26"><a name="09061057000142">The hon. and learned Gentleman rightly and sensitively recognised the need to be very careful about how we best regulate these issues through legislation. He raised the concern that the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce could be used as an unfair bargaining counter in disputes over contact, residence or financial provision. Undoubtedly, it could so be used, but I hope that I can assure him&#151;and you, Mr. Russell&#151;that should parties bring such a matter before a court in England and Wales, any suggested agreement would be vigorously scrutinised by that court, under English legal principles, to ensure that what is agreed meets, for example, the interests of any children and corresponds to appropriate divisions of finances under English law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para27"><a name="09061057000143">The hon. and learned Gentleman then suggested that refusal by one spouse to grant a religious divorce can amount to interference with the other spouse&#146;s human rights. He, more than many, is aware that human rights issues are very complex&#151;much more so than often appears at face value. I am not yet convinced, however, that this situation raises a human rights issue in the terms that he suggests. Under European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence, marriage is not held to be a form of expression of thought, conscience or religion, such as would attract the protection of article 9. Marriage comes under article 12, which provides for the right to marry according to national laws governing the exercise of that right. I am not convinced that the desire to remarry, not through a civil ceremony, but according to religious formats not recognised in English law, would necessarily come under article 12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="90610h0004.htm_para28"><a name="09061057000144">Having said that, I do not want to detract from the seriousness with which we take these issues. In this country, many different nationalities, cultures and faiths live cheek by jowl and generally harmoniously. That brings many advantages and enriches our communities. We are taking steps to tackle issues faced by Muslims in modern Britain. For example, we have commissioned a small-scale research project to investigate the number  <br>

We have also supported the establishment of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board and the radical middle way roadshows, which have been attended by more than 70,000 people. We are very aware of the issues surrounding religious marriages that do not comply with the formal requirements included in the Marriage Act 1949. I am particularly concerned about cases in which people marry in a purely religious ceremony, because the marriage can be invalid as a matter of civil law if it has not been subject to the rights and responsibilities that accompany legally recognised marriages in England and Wales. I want to ensure that sharia councils around the country realise that mosques need to be registered according to English law in order to validate such marriages.</p>

That requirement applies to all religious marriages, whether Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Hindu, Sikh and so on.</p>

 I am pleased to have been successful in obtaining the debate. A large part of the reason why I wanted to initiate it on the back of the publication last week of the report by the Select Committee on Home Affairs entitled &#147;Knife Crime&#148; was that agencies and individuals in my constituency made a very important contribution to that report. At the time, I did not appreciate that there was going to be an Opposition day debate on knife crime last night&#151;a debate in which I took part. As an aside, I originally applied for a debate on knife crime, then made a positive decision to change the title to &#147;Youth Crime&#148;. I have been given to understand that the initial debate last night in Opposition time was to be on youth crime but was changed to one on knife crime. That is quite important in its way, in that there is a broader reason why I wanted to speak on the subject this afternoon. Knife crime is understandably the focus of much of the thinking on youth crime because of its lethality and the very high profile that it has had in the last couple of years, but it should never be considered in isolation from the broader issues of crime and young people. That means considering young people as perpetrators, victims and, not infrequently, both at the same time&#151;a theme that I shall develop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000155">Knife crime is the most dramatic embodiment of a larger and much more complex pattern of youth behaviour, ranging from the emotional element that is so much a characteristic of many teenagers&#151;the fear that many young people feel on the streets, and the bravado&#151;to the relationships dimension. What we call gangs can range from a very loose network of affiliations to a much more structured gang that is sometimes involved in quite hard criminal activity such as drugs. Gang attachment underpins and sometimes even replaces family support, particularly on the streets. Then we come to the policy questions, involving decisions about school exclusions and what happens to young people after they have displayed a pattern of offending behaviour. Then we come to the broader material factors of poverty, inequality and the means by which tough neighbourhoods come into being and people are sometimes trapped in a cycle of violence and criminal behaviour. We do not tend to talk about this in the same breath as youth crime, but also relevant are the patterns of adult criminal behaviour, particularly relating to the drugs trade, the trade in stolen goods and so on, to which young people can be actively recruited or in which they can be trapped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000156">All those characteristics come together to form a wider pattern of youth crime, with knife crime at the extreme end. We often focus on that too much, at the expense of the wider context. We cannot understand knife crime without understanding young people and criminal behaviour more generally, and that cannot be understood in a context that divides young people into two distinct categories: the so-called innocent or good young people and the bad, who are often described in quite stunning language, particularly, although not only, in the media. I am talking about the depiction of a yob culture and young children being feral and part of an underclass.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000157">The truth is that at any given time the overwhelming majority of young people are not involved in a gang or criminal behaviour. A YouGov poll last year, which I think was commissioned by Barnardo&#146;s, revealed that the public believe that young people are responsible for half of all crimes committed, when in fact the figure is about 12 per cent., so we start with that enormous overestimate of the extent of young people&#146;s responsibility for crime. The report by the Select Committee, of which I am a member, found that 5 per cent. of young people commit 50 per cent. of all the crimes committed by that age group, so the core number of offenders is relatively small.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000158">We also know that, overall, crime levels have fallen. I was pleased to see an acknowledgement of that fact in the briefing by Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London. It confirmed a 17 per cent. fall in crime in London in the past five years and a 10 per cent. fall in violence in the last year. However, as can be confirmed by any parent of a teenager in particular&#151;I speak as one&#151;the truth is that a great deal more is going on out there in the streets, estates and schools than the flat statistics show. We do not really know, because we do not have the information to make a judgment, how much more crime there is between young people or whether there is less, and how much of that can be explained by the availability of gadgets&#151;mobile phones, iPods and so on&#151;which makes an individual a desirable target for robbery. There is an awful lot that we do not know, but we do know that although the high-profile violent crimes have fallen generally, there is a very serious problem on our streets involving young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000159">The boundaries between the innocent and the guilty are far more fluid than our policy makers, at all levels, tend to be able to respond to. There is a fluidity between the victim and the perpetrator, between the serious and the occasional offender and between the people who are not caught or convicted of a crime and those who are deemed to be innocent. Behaviour that we can criminalise and describe as criminal now would not necessarily have been criminalised a few decades ago. Many people are involved in lower-level criminal behaviour and antisocial behaviour, but that information is never brought to public attention. The overwhelming majority of those young people grow up and grow out of it. Age is a critical factor and getting work is often a critical factor in that. I worry&#151;this came through in the Select Committee report&#151;that there is a rigidity in the way in which the media describe youth crime and in the way we as policy makers often respond to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000160">I shall now consider some of the issues as they are reflected in my own area. North Westminster, in common with many inner-city areas, faces three challenges. First, far too many young people are anxious or frightened on the streets and far too many&#151;probably most&#151;have had at least one bad experience that confirms them in that view. Secondly, there has been some evidence of gang activity in the past couple of years. I am, however, pleased to say, having met senior police officers yesterday, that the situation that was emerging over the past couple of summers seems to be calmer. There has been effective police action and other preventive action that may have helped us to deal with that, but only a fool would be complacent about the gang-related behaviour that we have seen and that is deeply entrenched in some  <br>

parts of our cities. I do not believe that there are many communities that are wholly immune from that. Fashion tends to be a factor in these things and there is a fashion for postcode-dominated gang-related behaviour at the moment. It would be naive of us to believe that these things cannot emerge in Westminster, Kensington or Camden, albeit at the moment they are not as developed there as they are in some other areas.</p>
<a name="09061057000310">
<p>There are three families mourning young men who have died as a result of knife crime in my constituency in the not-too-distant past. The men who died were Kodjo Yenga, Jevon Henry and Amro Elbadawi. As tiny as that figure is, each person represents a tragedy of awesome proportions. It is absolutely incumbent on us not to minimise the scale of the challenge that we must confront.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000161">Thirdly, there are frequent flare-ups of antisocial behaviour and lower-level criminal activity involving young people. Sometimes they involve the same people who are involved in some of the loose gang networks, and sometimes not. Some young people are victims; some young people&#146;s behaviour; towards other young people spills over into criminal behaviour and some young people are involved in behaviour that, at its extreme, can destroy the lives of the people who are on the receiving end of it. We have to accept that truth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000162">The local Uncut project, which is part of wider network called Working With Men, has worked with more than 1,000 young people locally. I was pleased that the project brought young people from a number of schools and youth organisations into Parliament to talk to our Committee. The presentation made difficult hearing. They were a delightful bunch of young people and I knew many of them. The majority of young people whom Uncut consulted knew someone who was carrying a knife, but very few would be comfortable repeating that information. The reluctance of young people to report what they know and what they have experienced, even when they have been victims, to the police and others is one of the most critical problems that we face. Many of those consulted did not feel safe and most felt that weapons were carried in response to fear, although they felt that peer pressure and robbery motivation were factors. Many felt that the situation was getting worse. In fact, the pessimism of some young people was one of the most striking elements of the presentation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000163">Although it is sometimes hard to know how people interact in an event such as the presentation, and some element of fashion influences how they will respond and present their problems, there is a genuine issue. We have heard that many times, particularly from people in our most challenged communities where opportunities are fewest. Uncut and many similar projects do phenomenally important work. They make shock tactics much more effective than they would be if they were pursued, for example, by MPs or senior police officers, because they have a valuable closeness to the community. I commend to hon. Members a superb short film that Uncut showed the Committee. It was based on the Mozart estate and in some ways reflected the tragedy of Amro Elbadawi&#146;s death. It was very well received by young people, unlike some of the &#147;talking heads&#148; warnings that they receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000164">However, the truth is that projects such as Uncut cannot serve everyone who needs early intervention, mentoring or shock tactics, even in an area such as north Paddington. The early intervention work with  <br>

families that is being delivered in partnership with the youth offending team and others with Government support is excellent and intensive, but the requirements are far greater. That is not a criticism, but an expression of the mismatch between need and the delivery of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000165">At a time when we face retrenchment in public spending, it is vital that we do not abandon support for a spectrum of measures, many of which were discussed by the young people themselves. I shall go through some of the things that the young people articulated. First, young people themselves want to feel safe on the streets, but many do not feel safe. That is the overwhelmingly powerful message. Safer neighbourhood policing is absolutely fundamental to that, and it has been a hugely important and successful development in many areas. It must be defended and we must, above all, ensure that we are putting safer neighbourhood policing resources into the areas that need them most. There is an inequality, rather than an equality, of need, and we must target accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000166">Secondly, the continuing problem of the dysfunctional relationship between the police and too many young people needs to be addressed. Stop and search is a vital tool in effective policing, but as the police, including the Met, have recognised, inadequately targeted or badly handled searches by response teams are counter-productive&#151;sadly, this often happens with response teams who are not familiar with a neighbourhood or the people in the community. Such searches in large part explain exactly why we are unable to get the reporting and flow of information that we need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000167">For example, only three in every 100 stop-and-search stops in London involving young people in the year before last resulted in a knife being found&#151;the number went down to 1 per cent. last year. I calculate that more than 280,000 stops took place last year, disproportionately involving black and minority ethnic communities, without anything significant being found. That is a genuine problem. That does not call into question the stop-and-search tactic in principle&#151;it can have an important deterrent effect&#151;but we must keep the measure under constant review. To a certain extent, that has happened, which is welcome, but it must continue. We need to give an even higher priority to managing the conduct and relationships of some police. It is difficult. A 22-year-old police officer could find themselves facing a big strapping 18-year-old who is giving them a bit of lip. It is not an easy relationship, but we need to work on making it better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000168">Thirdly, co-ordination and communication between agencies is vital, and it is still not as good as it should be. Good schools are not arms of the police force, but good policing is vital to effective schooling. The same goes for the youth service. It is difficult to over-estimate how important it is to have stable, embedded police working well in schools. Weaker and less trusting relationships with agencies such as the youth service and the police are counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000169">In that context, we need to ensure that there is downward pressure on school exclusions. That is a policy difference between Labour and the Conservative party, which tends to look at how we could make it easier for schools to exclude. One understands on one level why the pressure to exclude emerges within schools, but all the evidence points to the fact that weak attachments  <br>

to school and school exclusions are correlated with offending behaviour and the risk of drifting into a gang culture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000170">Fourthly, intensive family support must be more accessible, because domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse and mental ill health among adults is a key trigger for much of the behaviour that I am talking about. Fifthly, chronic overcrowding in our housing stock drives young people on to the streets. Westminster has some of the highest levels of overcrowding in the country. Although it would be crass to draw a causal link between offending behaviour and overcrowding, I have not the slightest doubt&#151;I know this from extensive experience&#151;that the stresses that many people grow up with in their homes push them on to the streets where the risk factors are high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000172">My hon. Friend is a constituency neighbour of mine and Kodjo Yenga, whom she mentioned, was killed in Hammersmith grove, which borders my constituency. Such things are tragic. I went to a residents meeting earlier this year following another tragic death of a young man, Craig Brown, in Loftus road. There was a huge turnout of residents and the Greater London authority, the council and so forth were there. The issue of youth crime and young people having meaningful things to do was the main thing that came out of the meeting.</p>

 By a happy coincidence, my next point concerns precisely that. Although no one can legitimately claim that they picked up a weapon or committed a crime because they were bored&#151;people are sometimes represented as though they were apologising for criminal behaviour when they talk about the level of funding for services&#151;my hon. Friend is absolutely right that inadequate or expensive out-of-school provision, whether in the evenings or during the school holidays, be it sport, entertainment, drama or other activities, does absolutely nothing to prevent antisocial behaviour or gang culture. Again, Westminster trailed in terms of after-school provision but is improving now, and the extended school programme is an important contributor. That is all discretionary spending, and there is a fear that those kinds of service are likely to bear the brunt of downward pressure in public spending.</p>

 To give an example that my hon. Friend might share, youth clubs are being closed in Hammersmith and Fulham borough simply so that the sites can be sold off to make money. Youth services are being cut by &#163;100,000, and out-of-school services are being completely decimated across the borough. Conservative politicians are proud to respond with quotes such as:</p>

 It is absolutely crass. We know that providing diversionary activities cuts crime. It is as simple as that; it has been researched. To be fair to my borough, Westminster has recognised that. I am happy to say that those services are not being cut but improved, although not as much as I would like. I worry about what might happen if the regime changes. It is right that we should provide those activities, and they must be very cheap or free if we are to make inroads into families whose disposable income in a week is inadequate to send a child to the cinema, let alone to afford a broader range of activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000180">In Uncut&#146;s meeting with the Select Committee, many young people expressed the view that they would like the opportunity to earn money legitimately. We are all of slightly different ages, but it was not uncommon for people to have Saturday jobs when I was growing up. That is not common now. A lot of 16 and 17-year-olds who would like to have &#163;20 in their pocket to pay for  the cinema, football training or whatever simply cannot get jobs like that. It is a hard sell when there is an economic downturn and jobs are a problem, but it needs to be factored into people&#146;s thinking. A targeted programme of access to part-time employment for  young people from tougher backgrounds would be really beneficial, and they want it. They ask for the opportunity to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para22"><a name="09061057000181">The big picture remains inequality. That is demonstrably the case. Research carried out by the Sutton Trust and others has demonstrated a causal link between extreme inequality and crimes of violence. We cannot turn our eyes from that bigger picture, even while we rightly discuss a range of policy prescriptions. Like so many other factors, it does not excuse criminal behaviour, but it helps explain it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000182">Finally, my hon. Friend has helped lead me into a warning. Families and civic society are key to helping children make a successful transition into decent adulthood, but it is a dangerous illusion to believe that rolling back the state will help create strong families and communities. Indeed, it is precisely where need is greatest that civic responses are often weakest, or at least patchy and inconsistent. A slash-and-burn approach to public spending in those areas will, I fear, simply end with slashing and burning of a different and more dramatic kind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="90610h0005.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000183">There have been real successes in tackling crime in recent years. A whole range of agencies such as the police, voluntary and community organisations, local government and others should be encouraged in the work that they do, and it must not put at risk by either oversimplifying the problem, as is so often done, or undermining the solution.</p>

 I congratulate my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), on obtaining this valuable debate. As she has rightly pointed out, it comes 24 hours after a debate in the main Chamber on knife crime specifically. I should make a confession: I could not contribute to that debate, not least because I was in the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency. When I tell her that I am a member of the all-party group on cricket, she will perhaps understand which particular part of the NW8 posse I was involving myself with yesterday afternoon.</p>

It is sad that a debate on youth crime should involve, from the Back-Bench perspective, only Members from London, as though youth crime were only an urban phenomenon. The issue is obviously close to the hearts of all of us who represent London seats, but it applies across the country.

Lady quoted an interesting statistic, which I had not heard before, from her experience on the Select Committee, namely that only 12 per cent. of crimes are perpetrated by young people. However, it is fair to say that some young people are more guilty than other people within our society of antisocial behaviour and a lack of civility. Those things obviously do not appear on crime statistics, but they none the less play a role in cheapening and coarsening the areas where we live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000188">I had not intended to do more than intervene, but I think that I shall have the Floor to myself for at least a little while longer. I both agree and disagree with the hon. Lady&#146;s concluding comments about rolling back the state. There is a difficulty. My party has rightly said that it believes in the idea of society, but society and the state are not one and the same thing. One need only look, on a related note, at the dreadful events in New Cross that came to court last week. There was the idea of a multi-agency solution, as though somehow everything could be solved through various parts of the state. All too often, those elements of the state are only as strong as their weakest link, which was one of the contributing factors in the terrible events involving the killing of two young French students who were studying in my constituency at Imperial college.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000189">The hon. Lady is absolutely right&#151;this is a fair criticism of elements of Conservative policy&#151;to suggest that the answer does not lie in voluntary and charitable groups alone. Again, there are too many gaps. We are living in a very different society&#151;maybe regrettably, maybe not&#151;from the society of 30 or 40 years ago, when young, educated women who had started families were the leading lights of many voluntary and charitable organisations. Those days are gone, and the notion that we can return to them is, I am afraid, not borne out in practical reality.</p>

That applies just as much in my constituency, although not to the same extent. As she well knows, there are pockets in both my constituency and the area that she hopes will become her constituency, the Bayswater and Lancaster gate area, where there are problems. Things are often clouded by many of the issues occurring cheek by jowl with some of the wealthiest real estate in our country. Many issues occur literally 50 or 100 yards away from fabulously wealthy properties, which are often part of gated communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000191">I am concerned that so many incidents receive enormous media coverage simply because of the sheer randomness of what has happened. Like the hon. Lady, I speak to young people in central London, so I know that there are real fears. I hear a lot of people say that they carry a knife for their own protection rather than with any sense of aggressive intent, and on one level one can understand that concern. People are concerned not just by the media perception of knife and other crime, but by their own experience of precisely what she has described. They may have experienced incidents that were not terribly serious but that rightly made them quite fearful, such as being bullied or going off the main track near where they live and finding themselves under intense physical threat. An element of the pessimism to which she has referred may simply be because people are getting slightly older and wiser in certain ways, but that should not necessarily make us complacent going forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000192">I want to touch on a few of the local issues that the hon. Lady mentioned. In our part of central London, we have had great success in working together with the community, the police and local authorities, and it is only right and fair to say, as I said before last year&#146;s mayoral election, that it is one of Mayor Livingstone&#146;s great successes, in his eight years as Mayor, that he was able to bring much of that together with the safer neighbourhoods initiative. I am glad that our Conservative Mayor, Boris Johnson, is working on that seriously. There seems to have been a smooth, almost seamless, transition between the mayoralties in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000193">The single most important element of much of the safer neighbourhoods initiative in London has been the work of local authorities. To be fair, the hon. Lady rightly pointed out that Westminster council has had great success in that area with many initiatives such as the one city initiative and the civic renewal initiative. Looking into the future, I hope those initiatives will mean that, insofar as there are to be budgetary cuts, this area will have a strong priority, even if it is not entirely ring-fenced. She is absolutely right to say that policing needs must be localised, particularly given the controversy surrounding stop-and-search. I think that stop-and-search is justifiable in many ways, but she is right that a localised sense of trust needs to be built up, so that any flash points can be sorted out relatively quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000194">I accept what the hon. Lady has said about overcrowding, but there are no easy solutions to that problem, not least when one looks at the situation with social housing organisations and associations. Many of them say that any additional private flats that come on to the market&#151;the property market has gone through some travails in the past couple of years&#151;are sub-standard, in relation to overcrowding, for their purposes. That is a major issue, which I hope that all the parties understand. There is no  <br>

doubt that living in flats or apartments may contribute to a stressful cocktail, particularly for young men who have a lot of surplus energy that needs to be got rid of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000195">For the past two years, I have been the president of the St. Andrew&#146;s club, which is a quarter of a mile&#151;literally a stone&#146;s throw&#151;away from here, in Old Pye street, which is part of the Abbey Orchard estate. I am glad that the new lord mayor of Westminster, Councillor Duncan Sandys, who happens to represent that ward, has made it his big charity of the year. It is the oldest youth club&#151;it was a boys club when it was set up in the 1870s, but it now takes girls as well. It does a tremendous amount of work with art, dance and various acting shows, and it has a significant number of football teams and other activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000196">That club is a beacon, and I hope that the fact that the lord mayor has made it his specific charity will provide the foundation for its financial wherewithal for some time. I have been lobbying Westminster city council at a time of great constraint, and it has been able to provide a certain amount of money, but the club has effectively been losing money year on year and has had to dig into its reserves. On a positive note, it has an initiative with the private Westminster school, which is in the vicinity, and tries to gain income from allowing the school to use its facilities during the day. I suspect, for the reasons that I have set out, that the club is rather luckier than many such clubs throughout the capital and the country, which are under increasing financial constraint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000197">These issues are important, and I look forward to hearing the contributions from Front-Benchers. It is easy to be glib about this issue, but youth crime  is important. It is not just an inner-city problem and it is not just a problem for young people, as it affects all of us in society. We have to get things right. There have been some positive developments. I speak largely from an inner-London perspective, but I hope that there is little dispute between all of us in politics on this issue. We understand the importance of this issue and that there is much work to do. The statistics might be moving in the right direction, but that is no cause for complacency.</p>

That may not mean that those incidents have stopped altogether&#151;it is partly that the media bandwagon has moved on&#151;but there have been improvements, which is one reason why it is less of a high-profile issue. However, there should be no complacency. I am pleased to have been able to say a few words, and I thank the hon. Lady for introducing the debate.</p>

Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North said, yesterday&#146;s debate was very constructive and welcome. I made only a brief contribution, and I found it surprising that all three parties made almost exactly the same points in a constructive tone. We were well away from the rhetoric that we have usually had in the past 10 or 12 years about what to do about youth crime, being tough and locking people up. There was none of the rhetoric from outside this place about bringing back corporal punishment. Instead, there were many thoughtful contributions, both about the fact that, although the problem is serious, it is certainly exaggerated in the media and about how we should deal with the problem constructively, in ways that work, rather than in ways that simply look like tough knee-jerk responses to please the media and look good in headlines. So yesterday&#146;s debate was welcome, and today&#146;s debate has been of the same tenor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000200">We know that issues such as vandalism and drug abuse&#151;mainly of alcohol rather than the traditional illegal drugs that we always hear about&#151;foul language and knife crime are very serious and are undoubtedly major problems, but one welcome thing from both debates is that everyone who spoke in them reiterated the point that the vast majority of young people are not involved in those things. My constituents often make the point to me that most young people get tarred with the same brush, and there is a bad impression that they are all like that. I taught in secondary schools for 22 years, and I know that the vast majority of the thousands of children aged 11 to 18 whom I taught in that period, in three different schools in different parts of Derbyshire, were fantastic. All the stuff we read in press headlines bears no relationship whatever to the way in which most children behave and conduct their lives. Good news tends not to make it into the press, so we do not see that perspective from the press.</p>

We have to recognise that, and find ways of ensuring that their lives are not destroyed if they sometimes step over the line as a result of youthfulness, temptation or peer pressure. We must find ways to support them and bring them back so that they can grow out of this behaviour and live a better life, without their actions becoming a scar on their lives in perpetuity.</p>

almost without exception, fantastic&#151;they are not what we see in the newspaper headlines. As a politician&#151;I was a borough councillor for 12 years and I have been an MP for eight years&#151;all kinds of problems are brought to me. The vast majority of contacts with constituents that involve young people are about good things, but those are not the things that hit the headlines. When we are invited into schools, community centres and youth clubs, we see a terrific range of children involved in a terrific range of things, but that does not tend to hit the news in the same way. So it has been good, in our debates yesterday and today, to hear all the thoughtful comments emphasising the fact that we should not tar all children and teenagers with the same brush.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000204">In her opening comments, the hon. Lady said that we criminalise behaviour today that we would not have criminalised in the distant past or, indeed, when I was a kid in the &#146;60s and early &#146;70s. Today, unlike in the past, certain behaviour will automatically be reported to the police and it will go down as a police crime statistic. There will be a criminal record and DNA will be taken, to hark back to our debates on DNA during consideration of the Policing and Crime Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000205">One example that always springs to mind involves a local history fair that I went to in the St. Helens ward in my constituency last year. We were looking at a photograph of some old stone cottages&#151;now demolished&#151;on Wharf lane next to the old canal basin. One old guy, who was 70-odd, told me that he lived there as a little boy. He said that back in the 1930s, they would tie a string to one door knocker, run it through all the others in the row of 10 cottages, stand at the end, pull the string, knock all the knockers and run around the corner or behind the hedge to watch all the 10 residents come to the door and start cursing. I knocked on doors and ran away as a kid in the &#146;60s, and that old man and his friends did it in the 1930s, but the police would be called today, and if somebody was caught, there would be a criminal record. We have criminalised a lot of behaviour by young people in a way that is counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000206">People leave messages at their MPs&#146; offices, saying, &#147;The children are playing football in the street,&#148; but what did they do as children? I did not play football in the street, because I never really liked organised team games, but what did those people do when they were young? They played football and cricket in the street. On the one hand, people say in the press, &#147;Children today don&#146;t play football and cricket in the street like they used to. That&#146;s why we don&#146;t win competitions around the world any more.&#148; In the next breath, they are on phone to the police, saying, &#147;These kids are playing in the street. Come and move them.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para20"><a name="09061057000207">One of our councillors said that people ring him up about children scrumping apples and that they phone the police. He said that when he grew up in a Nottinghamshire pit village, people scrumped applies, but no one would have dreamed of calling the police. Now, however, it would be a criminal offence. In another example, which I raised in Committee when we discussed DNA during consideration of the Policing and Crime Bill, two children built a tree house in a cherry tree, but they ended up being arrested, criminalised and having their DNA taken and put on the DNA database. That would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, let alone 40, 60 or 70 years ago. We need to consider carefully the fact that we are in danger of exaggerating these problems and criminalising young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000208">Many people have a rose-tinted view of the past. They say, &#147;We didn&#146;t have these problems in the past. We didn&#146;t have these crimes.&#148; I recently read an article about a charity home in Chesterfield, which a local philanthropist had donated so that unemployed people could gather, play cards and the rest of it. However, it had to be knocked down because it had been so badly vandalised&#151;the lead had been ripped out and stolen, and the building had been smashed up. When did that happen? Not during the miners&#146; strike in 1984 and not in 2009&#151;in the wicked days that we live in&#151;but in 1945, at the end of world war two, when we had standards and such things never happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para22"><a name="09061057000209">Another example that I read about related to a wonderful Victorian park in Chesterfield, which has been done up in recent years with Heritage Lottery Fund money. After two or three attempts to make an aviary, the council had to abandon the idea and instead turned the building into a glasshouse with plants because local youths were going in and killing the birds. That was not in 2009; it was in the 1930s, when we had standards, such things never happened, children behaved and everybody could leave their doors opened because nothing ever got stolen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000210">So there is the rose-tinted view of the past and there is the over-criminalisation of a lot of behaviour. However, there is the other extreme, and we know all the crime statistics about knife crime and so forth. One thing that encapsulated that for me in a shocking way was the film &#147;Kidulthood&#148;, which came out two or three years ago&#151;&#147;Adulthood&#148; came out as a follow-up more recently. The film was based on the experiences of the person who wrote and directed it and who had grown up on a very tough inner-city estate in London. It was fictional, but it none the less gave an incredibly grim portrayal of stories like those that we regularly see in the newspapers today. So there is a serious problem, but let us not exaggerate it and let us remember what most children are like and what life is like in most areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000211">How do we tackle the problems that undoubtedly exist? One of the traditional answers is that schools should teach standards, but I always find that very insulting as somebody who worked in schools for 22 years. I never worked in or visited a school where the teachers did not go out of their way to teach standards, manners and behaviour to the children&#151;as if teachers would do anything else. However, we sometimes hear crass comments&#151;occasionally from politicians, but more often in the press&#151;suggesting that schools should teach standards. Of course schools try to do that, but the greater the problems and the deprivation in the area that a school represents, the more difficult that will be. I forget the precise numbers, but there are some famous figures showing that children spend far less time in school from five to 16 than they do at home with their parents or out playing with friends at weekends and in the evenings. School is only part of the mix. If we think that children are less respectful of authority and that they swear and answer back more when we tell them off, that is a problem for society as a whole. That is not something that teachers or we as politicians can solve by clicking our fingers or waving a magic wand; it is a much wider problem, which every parent has to tackle, rather than leaving it to somebody else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para25"><a name="09061057000212">We have heard about increasing constructive activity. I sometimes become a bit impatient when people say that there is nothing for kids to do. Kids today have  <br>

more money, they are more affluent and they have more access to Xboxes, video games and the rest of it than I did when I was young in the &#146;60s and &#146;70s and certainly than children did back in the 1930s. If kids want to take part in activities, there are a lot available. As we have heard this afternoon, however, there is a danger that constructive guided activity will be one of the first things to be cut when there is a problem, as there is now with the recession and the tough financial situation that we face over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para26"><a name="09061057000213">We have heard examples of constructive activities from London, and there are other examples from Chesterfield. Traditional activities such as scouts, guides and youth football teams are flourishing. In fact, I was reading only this week that there is a waiting list of 30,000 people to join the scouts nationally, but they cannot get in, because there are not enough scout and guide leaders to run activities. There is a big demand for these activities and they are thriving&#151;they are not withering away, as some people would have us believe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para27"><a name="09061057000214">There are also the things that councils can do. For more than 20 years, we have had a BMX track in one of the local parks in Chesterfield, although, of course, BMX goes in and out favour. In the past few years, the council has also opened a skateboard park and it will open another, much bigger one this autumn. The park was designed by local teenagers, although those teenagers are now adults, because it has taken so long to get the money together to get the park working. None the less, there are some fantastic facilities for young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para28"><a name="09061057000215">One local police constable, who was an enthusiast for boxing, started some boxing clubs. That is not a sport that appeals to me, but it is popular, and it has spread across Chesterfield into other parts of north Derbyshire. It gets kids off the street and into organised, disciplined activity. I have also been to open martial arts centres that do exactly the same constructive activities with children. Another activity, called Gamezone, involves anything up to 10 or 15 volunteer parents, and I would mention Mick and Christine Samuels in particular. I have been to their youth club activities, which take place in some of the most deprived bits of Chesterfield and Staveley. As many as 90 or 100 children can be involved in indoor activities. Some activities involve computer games, but they also involve children socialising as they would at a youth club. Otherwise, those children would be on the streets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="90610h0006.htm_para29"><a name="09061057000216">A letter from the inspector who used to be in charge of Staveley police said that a couple of years ago, in the weeks in which Gamezone was operating, such as school holidays, the police could log on to their computer and look at the figures for referrals for vandalism, kids getting into people&#146;s gardens and kids drinking on the street corner. The figures just plummeted in the weeks in which Gamezone was operating, because instead of being out on the streets causing trouble, these youngsters, all of whom are under age, were involved in constructive activity and social engagement with other people, including adults.</p>

He wants to get them involved in constructive activity, learning to ride on that waste land, and learning to do the jumps and the rest of it. He has it all worked out: the business plan and the insurance that is needed. He has been to look at two similar schemes that exist in other areas.

However, as we have heard, there is the threat of cuts. If councils&#146; budgets become tougher and tougher, what will be one of the first things to go? Back in the 1980s in Derbyshire, one of the first things to go was almost the entire youth service. It has slowly been rebuilt in the past 10 or 15 years, and now we all wonder what will happen in the next three or four years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000219">Another aspect of the matter is the importance&#151;not for hard-hitting law enforcement, but for proactive prevention&#151;of the visible police presence. The Government deserve congratulations, because there are more police officers and police community support officers around; there is a more visible uniformed presence. Last Hallowe&#146;en, I went out on patrol with the specials in Chesterfield, and that night there were more of them than regular police on the street, because of the number of volunteers. I think they got 13 out on the night. Because there was a uniformed presence in such numbers, they could go to all the known trouble spots: the playgrounds, the high streets where young people hang around drinking outside shops, and the graveyards. They could be visible there all night and they were a deterrent. It was the quietest Hallowe&#146;en for the past 10 or 15 years, because of the number of people on the street to act as a visible deterrent. The more people see a uniformed presence, the less there will be trouble that gets out of hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000220">That takes us right back to the zero tolerance approach in New York, for example. When there is a deterrent to low levels of activity, serious levels do not arise in the first place. However, the presence on the streets is needed to achieve that. Derbyshire police are underfunded by &#163;5 million a year and are being rate-capped by another &#163;1.6 million for next year, and will have to cut 60 police officers as a result. How does that help, when Derbyshire police are already 380 uniformed staff down in comparison to equivalent counties? Obviously, it does not help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000221">On the question of alcohol, I mentioned earlier that the biggest problem in the context of drugs and young people is not illegal drugs but those that are legal, although it is illegal for people under 18 to get them. That is far and away the biggest problem. The effort that has traditionally been put into tackling alcohol issues is a fraction of what has gone on dealing with illegal drugs.

Policing and Crime Bill, which is going to the House of Lords, to permit further steps to be taken, although I think that an opportunity has been missed on such approaches as minimum pricing for alcohol. It is the super-strength cheap ciders and lagers that young people buy from the off-licence that are the real problem, not the beer that they buy in the pub in a managed, more adult environment.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are some deep-seated and long-standing issues about the use of alcohol, not just in British but, one might argue, in northern European society? However, there is some hope if one considers the sea change that has taken place in the past two decades in tobacco use. I accept that tobacco is a legal drug, and one that has tended to be used almost as a rite of passage at a particular age; but what has happened with tobacco must bring some hope that the policy changes that can be, and are being, made over a period of time will lead, much more importantly, to a sea change in general attitudes, which is the only realistic way in which we can ensure that the blight of alcohol&#151;not just alcoholism but antisocial behaviour by young people&#151;can be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="09061057000223"><a name="90610h0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="09061057000378"><b>Paul Holmes:</b>
 It is one of those intangible problems, a bit like saying, &#147;Children swear more on the streets, and answer back when you tell them not to do it, which they would never have done in my day.&#148; In so far as that is true, it is down to parents to change their attitude. The alcohol issue is another such intangible. The Government cannot click their fingers and solve the problems, and neither can schools or the police. Society must change its attitude, although Government can give nudges in the right direction. As the hon. Gentleman has said, smoking was prevalent, but the number of smokers is now down to 30 per cent. of the population. That is partly because of health education campaigns, cracking down on the sale of tobacco to under-age people and banning smoking in enclosed public places&#151;which I was an enthusiast for, and which we were one of the last western countries to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000224">All sorts of things have led to the sea change in attitude, and we need that to happen for alcohol. The idea that 24-hour licensing would mean a continental caf&#233; culture, just like that, was nonsense. It is to do with society and how society sees things. That is where I took issue with the chief medical officer when he recommended that parents should never let their children drink any alcohol at home until they are over 15. As I have said before in debate, when my children were as young as five, they would have some watered-down wine when we were sitting eating a meal and drinking wine. By the time they reached their early teens alcohol was not a great, exiting, illicit thing, and they did not go out and get drunk, and collapse in the streets. That is how things are done in most of Europe and why there is a caf&#233; culture there. Parents, with their children, treat alcohol with respect and as a family thing&#151;not as a mysterious drug to rush out and get drunk on in the street at the age of 13, 14 or 15. Social attitudes are what need to be changed.</p>

Committee on Children, Schools and Families was recently in New York and we saw that every school automatically has police on duty in the entrance way, and a metal-detecting arch. It is not necessarily in use all the time, but it is there so that children going to school know it could be used, and they could be picked up carrying knives or, of course, in New York, guns. We are a million miles from that situation, but the judicious use of mobile metal arches on the underground, and of stop-and-search, has been very successful in the past year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000226">There are some startling comparisons to be made by considering a wide picture of the youth justice system: &#163;300 million a year is spent locking young people up, and &#163;30 million is spent on prevention. That is utterly the wrong way round, because, to go back to a point that the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North made several times, we should not be criminalising young people of 11, 13, 14 or 15 if we can avoid it. When they step out of line, we should try to avoid the automatic process of police, crime, arrest, custody and young offenders institutions. That balance, of &#163;300 million on locking up 2,800 young people this year, as against &#163;30 million on trying to prevent that happening, is the wrong way round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000227">The Youth Justice Board started to take responsibility for that aspect of the matter in 2000, and I know it would say that since then things are starting to move in the right direction and the numbers are going down. We are locking up fewer young people and putting more effort into prevention. If young people who are put in young offenders institutions come out with the same low level of education and drug or alcohol problems that they tend to go in with, and the same mental health problems they probably go in with&#151;the same is true of the adult prison population&#151;all that happens is that  70 per cent. reoffend within two years of leaving. What is the point of that? It may look tough; but countries such as Norway, Canada and the Netherlands do not take the macho, tough approach. Instead they do what works and concentrate on rehabilitation and help, and intensive fostering programmes&#151;all things that the Government, to their credit, have started to introduce in the past year or two&#151;and that is a far healthier way forward, which will bring the results we want in the long term. However, there is no magic wand. We cannot click our fingers or pass a law to solve the problems. It is a shame that the media give the impression that we can do so. The tenor of the debate, and of yesterday&#146;s debate, from all three parties, suggests that we are at long last moving in the right direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000229">I agree with the hon. Lady: we should not frame these debates so that they are simply about knife crime. We need to look at the broader spectrum of youth crime and what that means. Someone does not necessarily automatically go from not being an offender one day to being a criminal or someone who has perhaps perpetrated one of the appalling incidents that gathers media coverage and is discussed in the debates that we have sadly had on far too many occasions over the past couple of years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000230">We need to look back at someone&#146;s history, their family, their neighbourhood and, indeed, the issues of inequality that the hon. Lady highlighted. That was reflected in an excellent report from the Select Committee on Home Affairs. We do not necessarily agree with everything in the report, but it has some good ideas and thoughts. Indeed, from the Government&#146;s comments yesterday, I know that they will be reflecting on the interesting analyses and themes that come out of that report, as we will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000231">I want to pick up on a few things that the hon. Lady said, particularly the issues of schools, education and exclusion. I know that she and I have discussed those matters privately and have talked about how exclusion is often a big red flag in terms of quite serious offending thereafter. I have certainly been struck by some of the analyses, of which she will be aware from her membership of the Home Affairs Committee. For example, Operation Trident has offered profiles of some of the most serious offenders and it can almost be guaranteed that such offenders will have been excluded from school. That was quite a striking factor that came out of the evidence that was provided, and I am sure that it is reflected more generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000232">In terms of the difference in the approach that we take, we believe that it is important for schools to have greater discretion to be able to exclude. That does not mean someone who has been excluded should be written off and that that is, in some way, where it all ends. Ofsted said that pupil referral units are the</p>
<a name="90610h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09061057000314"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;least successful of all in ensuring the good progress of pupils who attended them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000233">That is simply not acceptable and is why we would reform pupil referral units to ensure that they adopt the best practice of those units graded by Ofsted as outstanding and of special schools that cater for children with behavioural difficulties. We would also do a number of other things. This matter is so important. I strongly believe that pupil referral units should be made much better than they are at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="09061057000234"><a name="90610h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="09061057000380"><b>Ms Buck:</b>
 Of course, the standard of practice in pupil referral units may well vary and the worst need to be brought up to the standard of the best. However, the core truth, which I think is unarguable, is that if the most challenged and difficult children&#151;in terms of offending behaviour or behavioural disorder&#151;are concentrated together in one institution, almost nothing can be done to get the standard within that unit up to the standard of an average school because of the residualisation and concentration of pupils with a problem. That is why I disagree with the Conservative party&#146;s policy on exclusion.</p>

disrupted by pupils who are misbehaving, so that there are good standards in those schools and standards and expectations are raised. However, for those who have been excluded, we need to improve the pupil referral units by, for example, working with those parts of the voluntary and third sector that have experience of turning lives around. We need to ensure that pupil referral units provide a transition. It is not simply a case of sending someone to a PRU; the aim is to get that young person back into mainstream education. Turnaround services need to be piloted in specific areas through those exemplary third-sector organisations, so that schools have the option of either sending someone to a PRU or using a more intensive volunteer-led provider of education and training to ensure that those young people make progress.</p>

 I will do the hon. Gentleman a deal. If he can demonstrate to me that, say, 20 per cent. of the most successful schools in the country are willing to come to the table and accept a proportion of formally excluded pupils on their journey away from a pupil referral unit, I am prepared to accept that his policy might be the right one. In practice, the consequence of his policy is that even when a child has been through the PRU, the only schools that will usually accept them are those that are themselves the most challenged. That is why his policy will not work. However, if he can demonstrate that the more successful schools will take those pupils, I will rethink the matter.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that challenge because I certainly believe strongly that we need to ensure that young people who get into difficulty are not simply written off and that they are able to fulfil their potential, their ambitions and aspirations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000239">We should look back to what happened in a young person&#146;s life before they went to school. The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) made an interesting point in relation to his experience as a school teacher and the expectations that we have of schools. However, we need to look back even further to the early years and the family from which a young person has come, so that we get, for example, the necessary health interventions. We also need to ensure that health visitors are available for those first few days and months of life, so that we give young people the chance to make the most of their potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000240">There is not some sort of silver bullet. Again, Trident did some good analysis on the issue. When I started to look into the subject, I noticed that it had produced a wonderful spidergraph of all the potential contributory factors that might lead to a young person offending. We should look at this matter in context. Yes, of course, I believe strongly that we should ensure that we have proper policing and robust enforcement&#151;potential punishment is an essential strand in providing that safety and security&#151;but we should also have targeted intervention and, more generally, primary prevention,  <br>

so that we can ensure that we are giving young people and their families the strongest possible opportunity to move forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000241">It is important to reflect on some of the good community work that is taking place. The hon. Lady referred to the work going on in her constituency, and some of those issues were also highlighted yesterday. For example, sport can be a powerful way in which to engage with young people. I recently visited Charlton Athletic football club to see some of its very good community work. We should not simply use sport as a diversion, but as a means of moving young people on and getting them into education. It can also be used to enable them to develop other skills, such as team and partnership skills, self-respect and self-confidence. We need to consider how we can use sport&#151;whether football, boxing or other activities&#151;not simply as a diversion, but as a means of ensuring that a young person is able to fulfil their potential. I was certainly struck by the work that Charlton Athletic football club and various other sporting and other groups are undertaking in terms of channelling that energy and enthusiasm positively. That is why it is important to stress that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000242">Dealing with this issue is also about building a relationship with the police. The hon. Lady referred to young people&#146;s reluctance to report crime, and that theme came out in the Home Affairs Committee report. An interesting analysis was produced by 11 Million, an organisation led by the Children&#146;s Commissioner, on the confidence that young people have in the police and how their relationship with the police starts off positively and erodes over time. There is a change in the relationship between the police and young people so that the police go from being seen as an organisation that will protect and support young people to being an enforcer against them. We need to consider that carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000243">In some parts of the country, the fire service has been good at engaging with young people&#151;for example, it is working with young people from challenged backgrounds through the local intervention fire education project. That gives young people self-confidence in a positive way. That is a good example of how one uniformed service has engaged with young people&#151;although, of course, there are differences with the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para20"><a name="09061057000244">The other interesting factor that came out of the Children&#146;s Commissioner&#146;s report was that young people tend to have a much more positive view of the police the more that they see them and have an interrelationship, a reaction or some sort of engagement with them. Again, that supports the model of visible policing, because it means a relationship can be built up when moving forward. I agree entirely with the hon. Lady about the importance of safer neighbourhood teams and the community policing model. That is something that I believe in very strongly. The safer neighbourhood teams and policing need greater emphasis and discretion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="90610h0007.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000245">Yes, we have been critical. There is some consensus on the matter, but we have been critical of the target-driven approach embodied in some of the previous plans for policing, which perhaps has not allowed officers discretion and has played into criminalisation, which is a theme that came through in contributions to this debate. Perhaps it is because of targets that the police feel that they have no discretion other than to go down the path of criminal charges. That is why we need to row back from rigid, target-driven approaches.</p>

Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) on some of the work that the Mayor of London is doing were interesting. Yes, this issue touches the whole of the country, and I would not want this to become a London-centric debate, but, as the Mayor highlighted in some of his briefings, sadly, most homicides occur in London. That may be why some of the debates have been framed around the capital city.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000249">We are looking carefully at some of the Mayor&#146;s interventions on prevention, and also on enforcement. The Daedalus project uses a more intensive approach with someone who is going into a young offender institution for the first time. Resettlement is an important aspect of the project, which tries to reduce recidivism and stop the spiral of reoffending. We should reflect on and consider further some of the important and innovative ideas that are coming out of the Mayor&#146;s office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000250">My hon. Friend also mentioned the important work of local authorities. They have a key role in the prevention agenda&#151;the prevention strand&#151;because so much of this is about how local authorities&#146; individual departments drive issues forward. That is why I am critical of some crime and disorder reduction partnerships. At present, too many of them are police-led rather than council-led. We need political buy-in: it is the driving force to get a partnership to work, and to get departments such as housing, children&#146;s services and social services to engage properly with the police and the primary care trust. Political ownership is essential to driving things forward, to putting the prevention strand very much at the forefront, and to working with the police and complementing their enforcement activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para4"><a name="09061057000251">Yes, the police have to have an eye to that, but, ultimately, they are there as enforcers. It is perhaps a mistake to try to lump everything on to the police, to say that they should do enforcement and prevention. The prevent strand needs to be owned much more clearly and firmly by the local authority as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para5"><a name="09061057000252">Obviously, on positive activities, there is a need to recognise that, sadly, we can have clubs and sports facilities, but, in some cases, too many young people are too scared to go and use them. This is about transporting a young person from where they live to the community facility that they might want to enjoy. The impact of postcode gangs and the feeling that they are going outside their territory are why, in essence, policing and the safety side have to be a key part of the overall strategy to ensure that diversionary activities can actually be enjoyed and used by young people who perhaps feel scared in their own communities.</p>

That is why my party would seek to strengthen families, and to provide young people with a much more stable environment in which to grow up. That is why we would encourage young people away from crime by helping them off welfare and into work&#151;important points were made about that this afternoon. That is why we would introduce the national citizen service for all 16-year-olds who want a place to help them develop as individuals and to allow them to make their own contribution to society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para8"><a name="09061057000255">Breaking the spiral of offending before it becomes deep-rooted is essential to preventing young people from getting stuck in the criminal justice system, in persistent offending and on the conveyor belt to crime. We need to continue the positive discussions that we have had in recent weeks.</p>

 I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) not only on securing the debate but on her thoughtful remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000257">Today&#146;s debate has been thoughtful and interesting. It follows yesterday&#146;s debate, which was consensual, so, for the sake of politics, let me break the consensus briefly and respond to the remarks of the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire) about partnership working, in particular around central direction. He argued that the Government need to learn the lesson about trying to direct from the centre&#151;we are learning that lesson&#151;but then sought to dictate that local authorities rather than the police should chair local partnerships. That is a matter for local partnerships. There are different models, and the decision depends on the locality. He also spoke about partnership and, with what I thought was a fairly old-fashioned view of policing, the role of the police. Of course the police are there to enforce the law, but they also play an important part in prevention. Certainly the police whom I speak to in and around partnership working accept that we have moved on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000258">But let me move back to consensus and the shared ambition of everyone who spoke this afternoon and recognises that youth crime, particularly violent crime, harms individuals and communities. We are determined&#151;this is a feeling across the House&#151;that we need to make young people and the communities in which they live safer. This debate comes against a backdrop of falling crime over the past decade or more, fewer young people offending for the first time and falls in reoffending. However, we must recognise that there is real concern about serious violent crime committed by young people, often against young people, and that perception, which is why this topic simply will not go away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000259">Let me make two points about the context. I strongly agree with what has been said about today&#146;s generation of young people. The vast majority just want to get on  <br>

with their lives; indeed, they never get into trouble. I would go further and say that, far from being a problem in their communities, the ones whom I meet are often the ones who have volunteered in some way and are putting something back into their community. They are often the unsung heroes of their community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000260">Secondly, we should pay tribute to the voluntary organisations, churches, schools, police, other agencies and parents who work day in and day out to provide opportunities for and support to young people, and to nail the lie that Britain is broken. I do not want to get into the argument whether we should say &#147;state&#148; or &#147;society&#148;. I prefer to use the word &#147;community&#148;, which is at the heart of tackling many of the problems that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000261">Let us be absolutely honest: a small minority of young people get into trouble and cause concern, and an even smaller minority get involved in serious violent crime. I thought that the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) was in danger of going a little overboard in his description of young people, although I agree with the general thrust of what he said. Like him, I taught in secondary schools&#151;in my case, for 17 years&#151;before coming to this House. The question of who might go on to offend is complex. I taught for half the time in an affluent area and half the time in what might be described as a deprived area. I taught two people, one from each of those schools, who I know went on to commit murder. They represent a very small minority and are extreme cases, but we need to be careful about drawing generalisations from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000262">As my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North has said, around 5 per cent. of young people commit 50 per cent. of youth crime, and we are determined to deal with that minority. We seek to do that with the tackling knives action programme and the youth crime action plan, which will send out a message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. That means tough enforcement and non-negotiable support, but crucially it also means a range of preventive measures, including developing parenting and family services. It also means putting services in place to tackle the misuse of drugs and alcohol, for example, which sometimes fuel the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000263">I welcome the recent report by the Home Affairs Committee, which has been the backdrop to our debate today. I acknowledge the important work of my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) in producing a fair and, at times, hard-hitting report that recognises the effort and resources put into tackling knife crime, particularly through prevention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000264">We have committed &#163;12 million to the tackling knives action programme between last June and March 2010. Responding to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North, we should recognise that problems evolve and change. Therefore, the focus has shifted in the second part of that programme, not away from knife crime, but to serious violent crime in a wider context. Signs of progress show that that programme is working, but I refuse adamantly to use the word &#147;success&#148; as long as young people are taking knives out on to the streets and injuring each other and, in some cases, killing each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000265">I want to mention a number of measures that the Government are taking and a number of resources that we are expending, which I hope will address the themes that have been picked up in this debate. Operation Staysafe, for example, organised jointly by the police and children&#146;s services, took 124 young people off the streets into a place of safety over one weekend in February. Their parents and carers were grateful for their return and for the protection that was offered. However, that operation also challenges parents to accept responsibility for their children, some of whom are young, are out at night and are being put into vulnerable positions. It is important that parents should be held accountable, and, if necessary, they should be supported as well as challenged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para18"><a name="09061057000266">We are working with Be Safe to provide training to young people in workshops on the dangers of carrying weapons, which involves giving information to more than 1 million young people over the next five years. More than 95,000 young people attended the weapons awareness programme up to April last year. That point was recognised by the Home Affairs Committee in its important work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000267">Tackling youth violence also means recognising why some young people seek respect by carrying weapons. That point was picked up by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field). Through the youth sector development fund, managed by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Home Office launched a &#163;500,000 scheme in TKAP areas, which involves supporting young people&#146;s efforts to remove themselves from gang culture as well as preventing others from being tempted to join. Our recent &#147;It Doesn't Have to Happen&#148; advertising campaign was developed by young people in terms of content and the medium used. As a middle-aged Minister in the Home Office in Whitehall, it is not necessarily for me to pick the message or the medium; it is up to people who understand better than me what message will work and what medium will get to the people whom we want to get to. That campaign also encourages parents, particularly mothers, to talk to their children about the dangers of carrying a knife.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para20"><a name="09061057000268">The knife possession prevention programme targets under-18s who have been convicted of possession but not given a custodial sentence. Piloted in the original 10 TKAP areas, the programme dealt with more than its estimate of 230 young people last year, challenging their behaviour but supporting them to change it. Allied to the TKAP programme is the youth crime action plan, rolled out in 69 areas in England and two in Wales. It covers, for example, school police patrols, the family intervention programme and street teams to support young people on the front line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para21"><a name="09061057000269">My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North mentioned schools. We encourage safer school partnerships, which are effective in making young people feel safer, reducing antisocial behaviour and improving attendance at school. We want those partnerships to be the norm rather than the exception. I agree with the comments from all hon. Members about the importance of neighbourhood policing, which can play a role in this regard and which is central to this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para22"><a name="09061057000270">The Open initiative is providing positive activities for young people when they need them most on Friday and Saturday evenings. It is part of the &#163;900 million Aiming  <br>

High programme. I understand the point about the squeeze on resources locally, because we face similar issues in government. Therefore, it is important that we take into account the points made in such debates before councils rush off to set their council tax at an arbitrary figure to capture a headline, although that will actually do nothing to support services in local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para23"><a name="09061057000271">My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North mentioned the Uncut project and its powerful documentary, which was recommended in the Committee&#146;s report. I want to put on the record our recognition of the importance of that work and that of other organisations that devote huge amounts of time and energy to tackling the causes of serious youth violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para24"><a name="09061057000272">I am sure that Uncut is aware that young people are much more likely to be victims of crime than adults, yet they are less likely to report the crime or to seek support. They are in danger of retaliating and getting into trouble themselves or sometimes befriending the people who have offended against them, because they think that, somehow, that gives them security. We need to work with those victims, as we are doing now, to ensure that we do not escalate the problem. Over the past year, we have piloted support for victims in five pioneer areas, supporting those who need it and building confidence through shared experience and engaging in positive activities. Nearly 400 victims have been supported in this way and, over the next year, we want to roll that out to more areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para25"><a name="09061057000273">We have worked hard to restrict access to weapons by young people. We have worked hard with retailers to limit shop and online sales. We are also doing some things that have not been mentioned today. First, we are working hard with the Design Alliance on important work, and 12 of the country&#146;s top designers are demonstrating how they can take a problem and design it out before it becomes a problem. Those designers are working on a set of knives for the kitchen&#151;that is where many people access the weapon that they then take out&#151;that can do the job in a kitchen but are  <br>

virtually useless when it comes to stabbing somebody. Those knives will be piloted in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para26"><a name="09061057000274">Secondly, we are working on a new generation of e-commerce mobile phones that are being piloted but that will not be rolled out for a further two years. Let us see whether we can get ahead of the game and explain to the people bringing those phones into the marketplace that it is about more than just market forces. It is not just about the &#163;30 on the phone that is in danger or about the phone&#146;s value; it is about the well-being of the young person who will be injured when that phone is taken from them, unless we can get some way of saying to perpetrators, &#147;It&#146;s just not worth while going down that route,&#148; as they did previously with mobile phones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para27"><a name="09061057000275">Thirdly, when we brought young people together and asked them about where they feel safe in their schools and communities, it was remarkable, because they told us that the two things they want are CCTV and better lighting. When we said, &#147;But CCTV means you&#146;ll be watched,&#148; they said, &#147;We want to be watched, because we want to feel safe.&#148; Let us see if we can do that. It is not just about having more social housing, for example, but about better designing the estates on which those social houses are being built. That is crucial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para28"><a name="09061057000276">Stop-and-search has been mentioned. That is an important part of what the police do, but I accept that it has to be sensitively done. We are also making important improvements in collecting data from the NHS, particularly in TKAP areas, that are informing intelligence about knife crime and serious violent crime and allowing a more joined-up approach across partnerships to tackle a terrible problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para29"><a name="09061057000277">My time is running out, but I want to say that we know that there is a great deal more that we have to do. However, I assure my hon. Friend and others that we are absolutely committed not just to reducing knife crime, but to reducing serious violent crime among young people. That requires enforcement and prevention. At the end of the day, it is about making young people safer in their communities.</p>

 I am delighted to have secured this debate so soon after the 65th anniversary commemorations of the D-day landings and so close to the start of armed forces and veterans week. I want to use this opportunity not only to raise awareness of Plymouth&#146;s RAF and Allied Air Force monument on the occasion of its 20th anniversary, but to tell the story of how it came about, why it is in Plymouth and, most significantly, why it is so important that it exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para30"><a name="09061057000279">The memorial is the only one, or perhaps the first one, in the country to acknowledge those who served in all commands of the Royal Air Force and Allied Air Forces during the second world war, including men and women from Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, former Rhodesia, South Africa, Belgium, former Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland. It also marks our particular gratitude to the United States of America for the major part that it played in the air war, particularly over Europe, and the substantial losses that it sustained with our other main ally, the USSR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para31"><a name="09061057000280">It is sobering to reflect that some 107,000 members of the Royal Air Force paid the ultimate sacrifice between 1939 and 1945, with 84,000 members of the United States air force and 42,000 of the Soviet air force. The tablet at the foot of the memorial makes specific reference to the command losses during the 1939-45 war,  including Ferry Command, West Africa Command, the Women&#146;s Auxiliary Air Force, Balloon Command,  Army Co-operation Command, Maintenance Command, Transport Command, 2nd Tactical Air Force, Flying Training Command, South East Asia Command and Technical Training Command, as well as Fighter Command, Coastal Command, Middle East Command and, of course, Bomber Command.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para32"><a name="09061057000281">The memorial stands atop Plymouth Hoe, our wonderful historic waterfront, which my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)&#151;who I am glad to see here today&#151;has likened to Sydney harbour. People who are not from Plymouth may find that comparison difficult to imagine, but for Plymouthians the Hoe is a special place. It is the focus for many of our most important events, as it will be for our marking of national armed forces and veterans week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="90610h0008.htm_para33"><a name="09061057000282">With its naval heritage, Plymouth may seem an unlikely choice for a memorial to commemorate air forces, but our city's connection with the armed forces is as varied as it is deep. Plymouth Hoe overlooks the site of what was RAF Mountbatten, home of the Sunderland flying boats and Catalinas, and the air station to which a certain Aircraftman Shaw, who is better known as Lawrence of Arabia, fled to escape publicity in the 1930s.</p>

It also changed the fabric of our city. Gone were our Elizabethan houses, our grand civic buildings and more than 3,000 homes. When Plymouth's principal place of worship, St. Andrews   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para1"><a name="09061057000284">I am proud to say that that strength and resolve lives on. It was apparent a few weeks ago when seemingly the whole city turned out to cheer home 3 Commando Brigade, Royal Marines and 29 Commando, Royal Artillery from their difficult but vital work in Afghanistan. It can be seen in the way our higher and further education institutions have united with our businesses and employers not just to work our way out of recession, but to keep on track with our ambitious growth plans which, with the Mackay vision for our built environment, will carry on the work of the civic leaders who set about rebuilding the city 60 years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para2"><a name="09061057000285">It was the same dogged determination that made the memorial possible in the first place, and the story of how the RAF and Allied Air Forces monument came about is remarkable. It started with a single individual, who saw something wrong and set about correcting it. It reached its goal with a crowd of 20,000, ambassadors from 15 countries, a flypast and, most importantly, a lasting tribute to those who gave their today for our tomorrow. It also seeks to mark the contribution of those who survived, and those who continue to serve the country in different but equally dangerous  circumstances.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the international monument. She has touched on the vision of a few key individuals being vital to the project taking off, but does she agree that it was supported by the generosity of Plymouthians? In his book, a copy of which my hon. Friend has beside her, Jim Davis says that many small donations were received with letters stating that the donors were glad that the monument was being built because a father, son or other relative had been killed. The monument would not exist without those people. The same applies to the monument at which I attended a ceremony last week to celebrate American naval personnel who were stationed in Plymouth, and served and died. We should honour them also.</p>

 We should indeed. My hon. Friend is right; the idea was first conceived by Jim Davis, and he would be the first to acknowledge that it took those many small contributions and some big ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para3"><a name="09061057000288">As a young man, Jim lived through the Plymouth blitz. His experience of the &#147;traumatic nights of fear&#148; with the &#147;dreaded sounds of sirens&#148;, the falling ceiling plaster, the glowing orange silhouette of Plymouth burning during the night, and the piles of rubble in the morning made Jim vow to join Bomber Command, and he ultimately served as a rear gunner on Lancaster bombers. He flew some 33 missions, and in his telling book &#147;Winged Victory&#148; he says that lady luck seemed to be beside him on all those occasions, sometimes in extraordinary ways. He tells many stories of those who were, like him, fortunate, and of many of those who inevitably, given the casualty figures, were not.</p>

He started by writing to local councillors and air force associations, but was disappointed with their initial response. They simply did not believe that it could happen because the cost was too high, the public interest insufficient, and the political will absent. However, Jim was not going to let that set him back. Over time, he met every councillor he had written to, and persuaded each of them in turn to support the project.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para6"><a name="09061057000291">Perhaps the most important development in the early days of the campaign was the decision in 1984 to ask for the help of Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett who, as the youngest air marshal in the RAF, led the Pathfinders during the second world war. Given the international dimension of the memorial, there could not have been a more appropriate choice. He was born in Australia, and during the early part of the war he was responsible for arranging the delivery to Britain of hundreds of aircraft manufactured in Canada and the United States. A key part of persuading the council to allow the monument to be erected on the Hoe was his address during a visit to Plymouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para7"><a name="09061057000292">It is worth taking time to reflect on the key role that Bennett's Pathfinders played in enabling D-day and the liberation of mainland Europe to happen. Only a few hours before the troops were due to land on the D-day that we have been commemorating, Bennett's Pathfinders attacked the 10 heavy gun emplacements along the Normandy beaches and, with the main force of Bomber Command, destroyed them all.

<a name="90610h0009.htm_brev1"><a name="09061057000317"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Extraordinarily as it may seem, in 1942 Britain had no other man who could have done the job that Bennett did in forming the Pathfinder Force, training them to such excellence and doing the air routing for Bomber Command throughout the war&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para9"><a name="09061057000294">His name also has resonance in this place. He served for 73 days as Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough, West in 1945. Bennett's stature and charisma and Davis's drive and resilience made a winning combination. Unfortunately, Air Vice-Marshal Bennett unexpectedly passed away in 1986 before the project had come anywhere near fruition. That was a huge setback, but he continued to be an inspiration to Jim Davis. Indeed, Air Vice-Marshal Bennett&#146;s ashes are interred beneath the memorial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para10"><a name="09061057000295">A committee of air marshals from all the wartime commands had been assembled, but without the leadership of Air Vice-Marshal Bennett, it came to think that the obstacles were insurmountable and that the project could not be achieved. With a customary display of fortitude, Jim did not let that stop him. He formed a committee of local supporters to continue the project. He did not care that they were not as distinguished or high powered; the only thing that mattered was that they had the will to make it happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para11"><a name="09061057000296">One of the committee members is the secretary of the monument committee, my constituent Mr. Douglas Taylor. He trained as an Air Force electrician and was inspired by Jim when they met at a static air display at Plymouth airport. With the help of the committee, Mr. Taylor has taken on the significant organisation behind the monument service each year. Jim says that</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para12"><a name="09061057000297">The original monument committee included Cliff Platt, Lauri Scott, Bill Flynn, Dennis Teague, Doug Dawson and Ray McSweeny, who are all ex-RAF personnel. That stalwart team was joined 12 years ago by Squadron Leader Francis Reis of volunteer reserve training, who is now chair of the monument committee. Mentioning his role reminds me of the strong links between the six squadrons of air cadets in the city, which are about 300 in strength, and the support that they give every year in organising that event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para13"><a name="09061057000298">The project slowly gathered pace. A letter-writing campaign collected supporters and donations. Important links were made with key foreign embassies. Plans were put in place for the unveiling ceremony. The United States pledged servicemen for a guard and aircraft for a flypast, and Holland was sending warships. The Russian embassy met with Jim and gave its support. The representatives of 17 allied countries pledged that they would attend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para14"><a name="09061057000299">The momentum was then sufficient to get through the significant opposition from the military establishment in Whitehall. By refusing to support the project from the outset, the establishment believed that it would be stopped in its tracks. However, it had not counted on the determination of Jim Davis and his supporters. Whether it approved or not was irrelevant: the event was going ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para15"><a name="09061057000300">The date was set, but the costs escalated suddenly. Jim and his team redoubled their efforts to make it happen. Tarmac donated the granite for the plinth, English China Clay provided the lorries and cranes and ARC the cement. The 3 ft gunmetal eagle insignia was crafted in Devonport dockyard. As my hon. Friend said, numerous individual donations were received from members of the public. The family of Air Vice-Marshal Bennett have played a key role and given important support, not only at that time but over the 20 years since the monument was built.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para16"><a name="09061057000301">The memorial was inaugurated on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war, Sunday  3 September 1989. Over 300 guests were invited from  15 countries, including an admiral and an air marshal from the USSR. The unveiling was undertaken by Air Marshal Sir John Curtis, who drew on his experiences in Coastal Command and as commander of the RAF in the Falklands war, which was still fresh in many memories. His speech drew a comparison between the defeat of the armada 350 years before and the defeat of the Luftwaffe by &#147;the few&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para17"><a name="09061057000302">The crowning glory of the memorial is a 6 ft high bronze statue of a gunner who has since been named the unknown airman by locals. I am sure I am not the only person who has gazed up at that figure, with the blue sky behind him, and recalled John Magee&#146;s immortal poem &#147;High Flight&#148;, which each year forms part of the ceremony. I have attended most of the ceremonies over the past 15 years and pay tribute to the voluntary effort that has kept up the significant logistics required to deliver what is a moving service. Many of the embassies that attended the unveiling ceremony 20 years ago still send representatives. It is a ceremony with very human dimensions. At the end of the formalities, families and  <br>

Many names of those who lost their lives were included on a scroll that was buried alongside the ashes of Pathfinder Bennett.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para19"><a name="09061057000304">It was agreed several years ago that the monument service could be held each year on the last Sunday of June, which by happy coincidence was the same weekend as veterans weekend last year and armed forces day this year. That means that the combined force of the committees that support those events and the Lord Mayor&#146;s office, which has had an important role since the monument was built, have come alongside the efforts of the monument committee.</p>

 It is a pleasure to appear under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) on securing this debate to highlight something of which she and the people of Plymouth are very proud. I also commend her commitment to the armed forces in general. I was privileged to serve with her on the Defence Committee and know that she takes a keen interest in such matters. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck). No two people advocate on behalf of their city as strongly as my hon. Friends.</p>
<a name="09061058000053">
<p>This debate recognises the work that was undertaken on the memorial. I had the privilege of receiving an extract from Jim Davis&#146;s book from my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton. I read it last night with great interest. It shows that the determination of the individuals involved ensured that they were not defeated in creating the memorial. It also says something about the people of Plymouth. They are certainly supporting our armed forces today. Indeed, my hon. Friend referred to the welcome home parade, and I thank the people of Plymouth for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para24"><a name="09061058000003">When one reads the history of the war, one realises that Plymouth lost about 1,200 people and suffered 4,000 casualties during the blitz, and that parts of a beautiful city were destroyed. However, it shows the tenacity with which the people fought back that they not only rebuilt the city that Plymouth is today, but ensured that the monument was built. My hon. Friend referred to the part that Plymouth plays in our D-day celebrations. I was privileged at the weekend to be in Normandy, and saw the support given by the city of Plymouth, not only with the Pathfinders but throughout the second world war. We should recognise that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para25"><a name="09061058000004">May I make another important point, one that I know my hon. Friend is conscious of, which is the importance of passing on the message that future generations should remember the sacrifices of the past? The memorial in Plymouth is a good way of achieving that. I know that my hon. Friend is keen to ensure that future generations do not forget the debt of gratitude and honour that we owe those individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para26"><a name="09061058000005">Having read Jim Davis&#146;s book, I would like to pay tribute to him. I pay tribute, too, to the late Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett and to the present members of the committee. They want to ensure not only that the monument is maintained but that the service takes place annually. May I say a big thank you to Doug Taylor and everyone else involved? The memorial is unique, as my hon. Friend said. It recognises the sacrifice made by more than 100,000 RAF personnel between 1939 and 1945, and by more than 80,000 Americans and 40,000 Soviet personnel. It also recognises the other Commonwealth air forces that made the defeat of fascism achievable.</p>

 As I learned when serving with my hon. Friend on the Defence Committee, she uses various methods to get her way. I look forward to my visit to Plymouth. I have visited the city on a number of occasions with my hon. Friend and the Defence Committee, and I know of its contributions not only in support of our armed forces in general but also locally. This year, the RAF will be represented by Air Vice-Marshal Lindsay Irvine at the annual thanksgiving commemoration and the wreath-laying ceremony on 28 June. That shows the Department&#146;s commitment to ensuring that high recognition is given to the monument and to the event.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="90610h0009.htm_para28"><a name="09061058000009">My hon. Friend referred to armed forces day; the first falls this year, on 27 June, and it builds upon and incorporates veterans day. Across the country, some  80 events will be taking place that have been directly funded by the MOD. Again, I pay tribute to the tenacity of the hon. Lady in securing a contribution of &#163;10,000 from the MOD for the event in Plymouth. Veterans day was a success. The recognition study, supported by veterans organisations, ensured that we could widen it to incorporate serving people, and it is now called armed forces day. This year&#146;s is the first such day, and I want to build on that. There is growing interest in, and growing support for, recognising the debt of honour that we owe not only to our veterans but to the men and women serving in the armed forces. They come from communities large and small across the country, including Plymouth. It will be an annual event, and I hope that it will get into the nation&#146;s psyche, ensuring that on at least one day a year, people can say thank you to the men and women of our armed forces.</p>

During my tenure in this post, I will try to ensure that the MOD is involved in the annual event. I want to discuss with my hon. Friend how we can promote the memorial, possibly through publications or the MOD website. The events in Normandy last weekend showed that there is an increasing interest not only in memorials but in some of the great stories behind the individuals who took part in the nation&#146;s defence during the second world war. As Veterans Minister, I believe that it is important to transmit those stories to future generations. We must ensure that people know of them.</p>

 Before the Minister concludes, may I say how pleased I am that he was able to read the chapter about the memorial that I gave him? I mention again the book written by Jim Davis, and especially the front cover, because he was quite an artist. He won a scholarship to Plymouth college of art and design and he is a well-known local artist. I commend the book to the Minister&#151;I may buy him a copy so that he can read the rest of it&#151;because it contains some simply remarkable stories, not only about Plymouth but about Jim&#146;s time in Bomber Command.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg, and I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting this debate. I also welcome the Minister to his place&#151;I think that this is his first debate with his new responsibilities. I am glad that he is here, and I am glad that I am here, too. Since my meeting in the House, I have been back to my constituency and returned again. It was a pretty tight call, but it is important to be here for this debate.</p>

Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who, with me, has been interested in this subject since we entered the House 25 years ago. Like me and many other colleagues in this House, he is frustrated that, in recent weeks, when the Tamil community in Sri Lanka and around the world, including here, looked to Governments outside Sri Lanka and international organisations, such as the EU, the Commonwealth and the UN, to help it in its hour of need, such help was not forthcoming to the desired extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para3"><a name="09061058000018">I am aware that there is a general debate about reform of the UN. My party, and others, have long argued that the structure set up in 1945&#151;over the road from here, where the first General Assembly took place&#151;which was understandable at the time, and which gave five countries particular responsibilities and control, is no longer appropriate for the modern age. As we all know, the five countries that had that privilege, and continue to enjoy it, are the United States, the Soviet Union&#151;now its successor, Russia&#151;China, France and the UK. They are permanent members of the Security Council and have the right of veto, which means that they determine decisions. Over the years, that veto  has often been used by Britain, the States and the  other three members. Then, of course, there are the other members who rotate with the presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para4"><a name="09061058000019">Since the beginning of the year, a huge effort has been made to persuade the UN to take international action to avoid a continued and unabated military offensive by the Sri Lankan Government against the Tamil Tiger rebel army, which was conducted in such a way that civilians were injured and many innocent people were killed. The blunt truth about the past few months is that many civilians were injured and killed. We still do not know how many, but we know that, at the beginning of April, the UN estimate&#151;from its own papers&#151;was between 6,000 and 7,000 killed since the end of January this year and about 14,500 injured. In April and May, until the conflict ended with the victory of the Sri Lankan army, many more were killed and injured.</p>

I pay tribute to the Prime Minister and, in particular, the Foreign Secretary for their efforts. The latter visited the States, where he engaged with the Secretary of State. I also pay tribute to the American Administration, who made clear the need to engage with the UN on the need to take positive measures. Three young British Tamils and I had the privilege of visiting the State Department, the White House and the British embassy in Washington. We left convinced of the Administration&#146;s commitment. We also held a teleconference in this building with two senior UN civil servants, and we were convinced of their desperate desire to intervene.

Responsible and high-ranking UN officials drew attention to the fighting, the civilian deaths and the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and there is a requirement, under international law, to provide assistance. However, due to the arcane structure of the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, the UN was unable to act, despite the fact that events in Sri Lanka contravened both the universal declaration of human rights and the UN charter itself.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Like me, he has taken a long interest in international affairs and the interests of minority communities in many countries around the world. He knows that one of the institutional problems is that the UN Security Council is, by its constitution, intended to take action only in the face of a threat to international peace and security. The Sri Lankan Government argued to the Chinese and Russians that this was not an international matter and that it did not threaten international peace and security. I contrast that with the situation in Iraq some years ago when, owing to the threat&#151;perceived or real&#151;from weapons inside Iraq to other countries, it was argued that there was a threat to international peace and security. Arguably, the UN&#146;s actions are much more limited, if something can be described as internal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para7"><a name="09061058000024">In recent years, the international community has sought to address that issue. It has moved from saying, &#147;We can act only in the face of a threat to international peace and security,&#148; to deciding, only as recently as  the past decade, that there is a responsibility to protect, which is an entitlement. Significant work has been done&#151;I pay tribute to the UK and others&#151;to  invoke and establish that responsibility to protect. That  <br>

responsibility is important, because we have seen how no intervention was forthcoming when places such as the Balkans, Darfur, Rwanda and Burundi descended into genocide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para8"><a name="09061058000025">Arguably, if we accept the right to intervene and protect, we need the mechanism to do so. My colleague, Lord Ashdown, has argued that it is no good unless troops are available, willing and able to enter under such circumstances. However, I argue that in this case there was undoubtedly an international right to protect. Sufficient independent evidence, including from the UN and certainly from American satellites, pointed to attacks on civilian communities in such significant numbers to lead only to the conclusion that those affected were unnecessary and intentional victims of the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s actions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para9"><a name="09061058000026">The first question is whether there is something wrong with the UN, when the same criteria are required both for intervention and for threats to international peace and security. Both require a vote by the Security Council, and there can be a veto by any one of the permanent members. The same blocking mechanism applies in both cases. If Russia or China, or anyone else with the right of veto, wants to block an initiative, then the right to protect and intervene for humanitarian purposes cannot be acted on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para10"><a name="09061058000027">Does the Minister accept that that is a flaw in the present system and that we need urgently to restructure the organisation of the UN and the power mechanisms within the Security Council, so that we do not have a single country, or combination of countries, blocking that second right to intervene for the protection of communities? If we wait for unanimity or for vetoes to be lifted, it will be too late.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para11"><a name="09061058000028">My second concern about the working of the UN is, I am afraid, demonstrated by what happened a couple of weeks ago in Geneva at the UN Human Rights Council&#151;the Human Rights Commission was thought to be inadequate, so the UN created the Human Rights Council, which is unarguably a better mechanism than its predecessor. The Human Rights Council, which was convened by a significant number of countries, including ours, was requested to consider whether there was a case for investigating war crimes&#151;by the Government of Sri Lanka or by the Tamil Tigers&#151;and the question of genocide. In the end, the request did not succeed. Despite a plea by Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, a coalition was built up by Sri Lanka, which effectively turned that request into almost a paean of praise for the Sri Lankan Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para12"><a name="09061058000029">The countries at the meeting included Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Mauritius, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovakia, South Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine, Uruguay and the United Kingdom. In particular, Argentina, Chile, the Czech Republic, Mauritius, Mexico and Switzerland wanted a stronger resolution, but in the end they were blocked by action on the other side by Brazil, Cuba, India, Pakistan, Bolivia and South Africa. Bluntly, countries such as South Africa should know better than to intervene to prevent that sort of investigation. It was unsatisfactory that the Secretary-General did not throw his weight behind the Human Rights Commissioner at the Geneva convention. Having got that item on the agenda, it was the obvious place to do the first follow-up to the conclusion of proceedings.</p>

Member for Islington, North may want to say a word as well. I conclude with the very simple proposition that the UN is not up to the job in those sorts of cases. I want to know that the Minister accepts the case for reform both of the Security Council and of the Human Rights Council. Moreover, I want to hear what the Government intend to do with the unreconstructed UN to get justice and rights for Tamil communities and others affected in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para14"><a name="09061058000031">As of today, there are many people in camps in Sri Lanka, and some of our colleagues have been to see them. Many people are separated from their families; many people are missing and presumed dead; and many people have been taken away and are experiencing the most severe detention. There is still no access for journalists or the UN. Moreover, international humanitarian agencies do not have full access to everywhere they want to go. There is something wrong with our international structures when our only international body, on which all the countries of the world are represented, is unable to intervene in such circumstances before the event, during the event or even after the event.</p>

 I shall be brief so that the Minister has sufficient time to reply to the debate. I thank and congratulate the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) on securing this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para16"><a name="09061058000034">The situation in Sri Lanka is obviously terrible. We must reflect on how the UN has reacted in that respect. I am not here to be critical of the British Government. Indeed I have had meetings with the Foreign Secretary, and the matter has been raised countless times in the House by a large number of Members who have been extensively and effectively lobbied by their concerned constituents. I thank the Foreign Secretary for going to the Security Council and to Sri Lanka and for doing his best to bring about a ceasefire and some kind of humanitarian resolution to this crisis. Therefore, my point is not to be critical of the British Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para17"><a name="09061058000035">Serious issues, however, must be addressed. First, as I said in my intervention on the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, in terms of the UN charter and the universal declaration of human rights, it is quite clear that there are serious deficiencies in what is happening in Sri Lanka. After making a statement, visiting Sri Lanka and calling for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid, it is unfortunate, to put it mildly, that the Secretary-General should be ignored by the majority of the Security Council, and because of the veto system, that is essentially the end of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para18"><a name="09061058000036">My second point concerns the Human Rights Council.

I found the Commission to be quite cumbersome, but it did give quite a lot of space and working areas to a number of  <br>

other organisations and NGO groups. I was concerned that with the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the NGOs would be driven out of the frame. I was assured by Louise Arbour and others that that was not the intention. I do not believe that it ever was her intention, or the intention of those who set it up. None the less, the voice of civil society has effectively been diminished and diminished in the Human Rights Council. If someone is in a country in which there is a serious attack on the human rights and liberties of individuals, they need to have a civil society voice that can bypass their Government and go to the United Nations. If that voice is choked off, the UN is less effective. It is quite clear in the founding principles of the UN and all its agencies that there is a civil society component in what the United Nations does. I am interested in hearing the thinking of the Minister on that and on enhancing the role of civil society organisations at the Human Rights Council.</p>
<a name="09061058000054">
<p>As for the current situation in Sri Lanka, there are at least 250,000 people in what the Sri Lankan Government euphemistically refer to as refugee camps, but which, in reality, are prisons. People are not free to come and go. Disturbing reports talk about the treatment of individuals in those places and about the lack of visits. It is very clear that there is no access by independent observers or by the media. The well-grounded suspicion is that when those camps are finally closed the inmates may not be allowed to return home. No guarantees have been given. They may well be sent to another place. A humanitarian aid ship off the coast of Sri Lanka has been denied access to Sri Lanka to bring in its voluntarily collected aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="90610h0010.htm_para19"><a name="09061058000037">We applaud and thank the Department for International Development for the very large amount of aid that it has provided through NGOs to try to help people through this humanitarian crisis, but there must be transparency. Sri Lanka is a member of the United Nations, a member of all the appropriate UN agencies and a signatory to all the appropriate international declarations. It must abide by them and allow these poor people, who were bombed in the war and now, unfortunately, are suffering and starving in the camps, to get the aid that the rest of the world wants to get to them. It is not right that a coalition at the Human Rights Council and the Security Council can effectively override the very decent humanitarian instincts of many senior UN officials who want to help people and do their jobs properly.</p>

Those actions at the UN have been important, because they have maintained the spotlight of international concern on the Government of Sri Lanka. We welcomed the visit of the UN Secretary-General to Sri Lanka last month. We urged the Government of that country to use the opportunity provided by that visit, as well as those by the Secretary-General&#146;s chief of staff, Vijay Nambiar, and Sir John Holmes, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, to recognise that the UN has a pivotal role to play&#151;as the hon.

Of course, we remain deeply concerned for the more than 270,000 civilians tragically affected by the conflict and now being held in camps for internally displaced persons in northern Sri Lanka.

 It is by ensuring that through the UN processes there is consensus that a process should be undertaken, but one that is transparent and credible, in which the international community can have confidence and which will allow those people who feel that that they have been the victims of infringements of human rights to know that there will be a level of justice. The UK will be arguing and fighting within the global architecture to ensure that there is not only an investigation, but a robust, credible and transparent investigation into the events that have taken place.</p>

That does not prevent the international community from acting in the spirit of the R2P&#151;the responsibility to protect&#151;but the action itself must remain the primary concern. The EU and UN have called on the Sri Lankan Government to build a realistic prospect of a sustainable peace that addresses the legitimate grievances of all communities.</p>

interventions were made during the debate, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calling for an independent inquiry to ensure accountability for human rights violations committed on all sides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="90610h0011.htm_para1"><a name="09061058000048">I shall conclude by focusing on the more general question of UN reform. There are two urgent priorities. One is reforming the Security Council&#151;to which both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North referred&#151;to make it far more representative. Permanent reform remains the ultimate prize, but an intermediate solution such as that set out in the report of the high-level panel on threats, challenges and change would be a helpful first step. Such reform would consolidate the Security Council&#146;s primacy as the authoritative body on maintaining international peace and security. It would counter charges of irrelevance made by those who do not yet have the stake that they feel they deserve, and acknowledge that those nations need to be part of the solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="90610h0011.htm_para2"><a name="09061058000049">The second element of reform is to deliver system-wide coherence across the UN, building on the November 2006 high-level panel report, &#147;Delivering as One&#148;.  Massive growth in UN development, humanitarian and environmental systems is not yet matched by the coherence that would allow them to be sufficiently effective and efficient. Some $15 billion-worth of official development assistance is channelled through the UN, and that money must be used to best effect. That is particularly relevant in the context of the current economic crisis. For example, 23 separate agencies working on water issues in the UN system is not an efficient division of labour. We must continue to drive forward the &#147;One UN&#148; reform processes being piloted in eight countries around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="90610h0011.htm_para3"><a name="09061058000050">Better ways of managing our global affairs will emerge from multilateral negotiations. We remain committed to that. From civil society&#151;my hon. Friend referred to the central importance of civil society in situations such as this&#151;to business, and from public health to terrorism, there are just too many reasons why we need multilateral approaches. We must ensure that the platform for that continues to be a United Nations, but a United Nations that is reformed and fit for the 21st century and that can respond properly and nimbly to humanitarian crises and tragedies such as the one that we are seeing unfold in Sri Lanka.</p>
