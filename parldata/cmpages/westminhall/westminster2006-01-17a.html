<p><a name="stpa_0">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Roy.]

<a name="60117h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>
</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60117h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. George Mudie  (Leeds, East)</b>  (Lab): It is a particular pleasure to speak for the first time under your illustrious chairmanship, Sir Nicholas, and an honour that I did not think would befall me in Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss equity release schemes and their regulation. I would like to thank the numerous people and organisations who contacted me to offer assistance and information, and I congratulate the Consumers Association on its recent <i>Which? </i>report. It seems to have ruffled some feathers in the financial industry, particularly among some providers, but it offered an objective study and a warning to anyone who is tempted by the often inappropriate marketing of such products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">The products are aimed mainly&#151;I shall touch on that later&#151;at the retired or soon to be retired, and fall into two main types. With lifetime or roll-up mortgages a loan is secured against the home and interest is charged, but not collected until the borrower dies or goes into care and the property is sold. With home reversion schemes the provider takes a share or all of the property in return for a lump sum, the owner continues to live in the house and when it is sold the provider takes its share of the property at the full market price.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60117h01_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I echo my hon. Friend&#039;s praise for the <i>Which?</i> report, and also praise that by Age Concern. He referred to reversion and roll-up mortgages, and the number of reversion mortgages has declined significantly but roll-up mortgages continue to increase in number. Is he concerned that if a 70-year-old widow sold 30 per cent. of her equity she would have a debt that would wipe out the value of the home at the end of just 20 years? Many women today live to the age of 90 or more.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60117h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mudie </b> : I share my hon. Friend&#039;s concern about the financial effects, and I will deal with them later. I am also greatly concerned about the surge of home reversion sales this year, which means that the market balance is changing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">This subject was last discussed in 2003, when neither of the two main types of equity release were covered by regulation. Since then the Government have moved to deal with lifetime mortgages, which have been regulated since 2004. Although home reversion schemes are still not regulated, the primary legislation went through the House in December 2005, just before the recess, and we await the decision of the Financial Services Authority as to when it will trigger the cover.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">The objectives of the financial measures should be non-controversial. As is recognised in the debate on pensions, people are living longer and often find that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
their income is insufficient to meet their needs. It is not difficult to understand that the need for capital may arise, perhaps to fund home improvements, house repairs or even&#151; although this is doubtful&#151;a new car. People who have paid off their mortgage have considerable equity in their homes, and the schemes are designed to release that equity. Estimates of the available equity in the homes of the age group being   targeted are in the range of &#163;700 billion to &#163;1,100 billion. That is the market that is being targeted. Only &#163;4.6 billion has been taken up in schemes to date, so the extent of the opportunity becomes clear, in a market that could be as high as &#163;1,100 billion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">The actuarial profession has issued two reports on the subject and suggests that take-up will increase from 6 per cent. to 15 per cent. within the relevant group, but others suggest an increase to four times the present level. That covers a tremendous number of elderly people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">Clearly, the opportunity to release some of the money tied up in a home to provide greater financial freedom for the elderly makes sense. However, as always when large amounts of money are involved, there are dangers for consumers. The 2003 debate took place against the background of an unregulated market, or perhaps a confused market with so many regulators that the matter sometimes fell between regulators, and no one picked up the difficulties. There was also a background of very bad schemes and inappropriate sales. The main demand was for the Government to empower the FSA to take over the regulation. That has largely been met, so why have a debate now?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">There is no doubt that things have got better. Regulation is clear and schemes have been developed, but there is, understandably, great concern and nervousness about the products and whether they are being appropriately sold. The Minister could take the line that the products are regulated by the FSA, so what more is there to do? Knowing him as I do, I am sure that he will not say that, but other Ministers could take that line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">Let us look at the concern and nervousness. The major reason for it is that the target group is elderly and includes some of the most vulnerable people. If a younger person makes a bad or inappropriate financial decision they can recover, but for the elderly on low incomes there is no way back. There is also concern that people who have worked all their lives to buy their house can see that asset drain away as the charging system operates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">In the current discussion, it must be understood that equity release is complex, long-term and a scheme of last resort. Customers should not enter into such schemes without fully understanding the extensive financial effects and, as the Consumers Association stated, should be aware of the possible effects on other benefits being claimed or to be claimed, and on tax, as well as the problems that could arise for people who downsize and move house, or remarry, or even if a member of the family moves back into the family home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">To touch on the more tangible financial effects of the two schemes, with a lifetime or roll-up mortgage the lump sum is paid immediately with no repayments. It    should be realised and understood that the interest   charge may be as high as 7 per cent. and compounded monthly or annually. Someone who 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
borrows &#163;20,000   would find that after 10 years the repayment would be around &#163;40,000, and after 20 years would rise to around &#163;80,000. The FSA&#151;the regulator itself&#151;gives the example of Hilda, who takes out a roll-up mortgage of &#163;45,000 with a fixed interest rate of 7 per cent. When she dies 10 years later, the lender receives back the original loan plus the rolled-up interest, which totals &#163;88,522. Her family receive the balance from the sale of the home, but 10 years after a &#163;20,000 loan she is charged &#163;88,500.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">The financial effect of a home reversion can be equally disturbing. Someone who sells 50 per cent. of their property receives less than market value for that half in the first instance, and all future increases in value are shared with the provider. The FSA gives the example of George&#151;it is certainly not me, because he is 68&#151;who enters a home reversion scheme. He sells half his home for a lump sum of &#163;20,000, which is 40 per cent. of the market value of the half share. When George dies 15   years later, his home is worth &#163;150,000 and the provider&#151;the company&#151;takes &#163;75,000 for that &#163;20,000 loan. Such details of how compound interest eats into the value of a property may mean good business for the lender, but are chilling to the objective onlooker, especially if people who are not entirely clear about the costs and consequences are involved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">All those schemes would be acceptable to the regulator, provided that the company had fully explained and advised the old person. Considering that most of the firms involved are household names, one would think that that could be guaranteed, yet the FSA found some worrying practices when it sent people in to pose as customers. Mystery shoppers spoke to independent financial advisers and direct sales company providers. The FSA asked whether the question,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Were you asked if you had considered alternative methods of raising funds?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">had been asked. It is important, as this is a last-resort product. Customers should be asked whether other things such as downsizing, the local authority, banks and so on had been tried. Seventy-seven per cent. said that the independent advisers had not asked that key question for determining the product&#039;s suitability for an elderly person. They had not been asked whether they had considered alternative methods. The figure is worse for the direct sales companies: 83 per cent. did not ask.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">When the FSA asked,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;Were the disadvantages of equity release explained?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">38 per cent. said that the independent financial advisers had not explained them, and 67 per cent. said that companies with household names had not explained them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">There were many other questions. The conventional wisdom, according to the mystery shopping survey, is that 70 per cent. of the individuals posing as customers were not asked about their financial situation, yet 77 per cent. were told by independent financial advisers, and 83   per cent. were told by direct sales companies, that they were eligible for equity release. If those people do not ask for information that, clearly, the majority of elderly customers are not asked for, they cannot look the

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
customer in the eye and say that they are or are not suitable for equity release. The work that the FSA would demand simply had not been done.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60117h01_spnew3"><b> David Taylor </b> : My hon. Friend paints a vivid and bleak picture of what is happening with mortgages and reversions. Does he agree that a smallish minority of firms encourage the elderly to borrow more than they need? That drives up the charges that they pay and, of course, lines the pockets of a small group of advisers. Is that not reprehensible? Should the FSA step in there when it eventually produces a regulatory scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60117h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mudie </b> : As usual, my hon. Friend anticipates an important point that I planned to make. I shall take the opportunity of his intervention to confirm that, for example, Norwich Union requires those who apply for one of the equity release schemes to borrow a minimum amount. Indeed, that is the situation with most, if not all, the providers. Someone may need only &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000, but they have to take &#163;15,000, &#163;20,000&#151;or, in an example that I have, even &#163;25,000&#151;over a long term. The time ticks away and the amount doubles in 10 years; it is quite frightening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">Clearly, the figures produced by the mystery shoppers suggest that the customer&#039;s specific needs are not being investigated. As such products should be taken up only as a last resort, the fact that in too many cases advisers make no real effort to satisfy themselves that the customer has exhausted every consideration, and that equity release is the only way forward, means that the potential for mis-selling is arising, if it has not already arisen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">The other sad thing about those details is how badly direct sales compare even with the less than satisfactory advice being given by independent financial advisers. The mystery shopping exercise has resulted in solicitors who deal with equity release being advised in a training course to refer any client who has been involved in a direct sale by the producer to an independent financial adviser immediately.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">All this information raises a series of questions for the Minister. As mystery shopping demonstrated that complex high-risk products&#151;the FSA&#039;s description, not mine&#151;are being sold unsatisfactorily under regulated circumstances, what conversations has the Treasury had with the FSA about putting an end to such practices? Will the Minister discuss with the FSA what follow-up is taking place with the advisers and firms that perform so badly? Will random checks be made with customers to determine whether such practices took place in actual sales?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">The Minister should consider how any delay in the FSA&#039;s becoming proactive on the checks may allow firms to avoid action. With mis-selling of endowments, not only were paper records available, but in most cases customers could advance arguments and describe the selling experience. With equity release, the elderly person may not have told his or her family what they signed up for, and it is only when the person has died and the estate is wound up that the existence of the contract becomes apparent. The customer would not be there to describe what happened, and the firm would be in a stronger position to deny mis-selling. Random checks seem the least that the FSA can do. Can the Minister can comment on that?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 179WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">I congratulate the Government and the Minister on introducing primary legislation on home reversion so promptly in December, but the latest word is that the FSA will not begin regulation until 2007&#151;and that is on home reversion, which is an even fiercer instrument than the roll-up mortgage. I have been told that the timetable is in the hands of the Treasury. Can the Minister tell us whether that is so, and in view of the upsurge in sales of home reversion schemes, can he promise that he will take all steps possible to expedite the start of regulation?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">It is almost universally accepted that greater than ever care must be taken with the selling of such products, in view of the vulnerability of the target group. Schemes in the late 1980s and 1990s were ill designed, and are a source of customer unease even today. There is a lack of confidence that providers appreciate the need to ensure that this financial product, which is probably the most sensitive one on the market, is sold only to the most appropriate people. The sort of hard-nosed behaviour illustrated by the mystery shopping exercise, the response to the <i>Which? </i>report and the way in which the industry defends stories such as the one in <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> last week&#151;in which an astonishing interest rate   of 367 per cent. was charged, and defended, by a household-name firm&#151;leads the public to worry whether their trust that the elderly are in safe hands is correct.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">I suggest that the Minister have immediate discussions with the FSA to agree steps towards telling the industry that investor confidence has been damaged too much in the past few years and that the mis-selling of such products is banned. It should be said that the remedy will be not only compensation but the stiffest financial penalties, and even the barring of firms whose selling of this product is found wanting. That is the least that we can do, bearing in mind the sensitivity of the   product and the vulnerability of so many of the customers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">I shall quickly draw the Minister&#039;s attention to some other aspects of the sale of such products. I have concentrated my remarks on how important it is that they must not be mis-sold by giving bad advice to the elderly. The way in which the schemes are marketed is also very relevant&#151;not only to the elderly. Norwich Union has been running an advert seeking to sell its   product to people at the tender age of 55. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) obviously comes into this category, so he should perk up&#151;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Or is he 45?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">In <i>The Times</i> on Saturday, Norwich Union ran an advert headed &quot;Over 55? Thinking of equity release?&quot; An attractive lady is pictured next to the heading, &quot;New York? New car? Something for the family?&quot; On visiting the website, it transpires that someone of 55 can get a loan for all those purposes, but the minimum loan appears to be an index-linked lifetime mortgage of &#163;25,000. <i>The</i> <i>Mail on Sunday </i>the week before showed a gentleman of 55 in the same advert. According to actuarial tables, a lady of 55 can look forward to being around until she is 85, with a bit of luck, so this trip to New York, the new car or something for the family could end up costing her between &#163;100,000 and &#163;200,000, if we take the amount of compound interest and double up over 30 years. That is a staggering sum.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 180WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">Is the Minister content that a provider such as Norwich Union is selling such schemes to someone with five or 10 working years remaining? Would it make financial sense for this lady to commit herself to a possible 30-year loan&#151;for an amount that she clearly does not need to pay for the items mentioned&#151;instead of taking out a perfectly straightforward bank loan? If   Norwich Union were doing its job, if someone of 55 asked for an equity release they would be directed to another product straight away. It is clearly not appropriate for someone to sign up for this product when they have the possibility of earning additional income through work.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60117h01_spnew5"><b> David Taylor </b> : I saw that advert, and I can also confirm that I am in that age category. Should it not be headed, &quot;Philippines and Hawaii at 55: poverty and homelessness at 85&quot;? That is the roll-up impact of such loans, is it not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60117h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mudie </b> : My hon. Friend talks perfect sense. What he describes is a real worry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">In case I am accused of being unfair to Norwich Union, I shall mention another household name: that of Prudential. The Pru is seen&#151;probably deservedly&#151;as a more enlightened provider, which is new to the market. It has an attractive draw-down scheme. Such schemes work on the basis that one can avoid the doubling of interest over 10 years by taking out the money in bits, so people are not charged for the parts of the loan that they do not need at the time. In other schemes they have to take out the whole loan because there is a minimum amount: they may need &#163;5,000, but they have to take &#163;25,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">On its website, the Pru has an attractive draw-down scheme, which, instead of saddling customers with a big loan with compound interest, allows them to take the money in bits. The only drawback appears to be that the minimum amount that they can borrow is &#163;20,000, so they would have to take a large amount overall. They can take more&#151;the Pru will set a maximum sum and they can draw money up to that amount&#151;but in the first instance they have to take &#163;20,000, and over 10 years, the customer will have to pay back &#163;40,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">The last point that I want to raise with the Minister relates to the uncertainty in the market about whether the industry can discipline itself to act sensitively on appropriate sales. One of the main reasons for seeking a loan is for house repairs or improvements. Will the Minister begin discussions with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local authorities to see whether the   initiatives launched by councils to formulate loan schemes, often as a replacement for grant schemes that have been withdrawn, are worthy of encouragement and wider publicity?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">If the Minister contacts <i>Which?</i>, he will be provided with a list of interesting initiatives around the country on the basis of which it would be easy to produce a scheme that could be put into the public domain, which would lead private providers to behave more sensibly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">In his pre-Budget report, the Chancellor introduced measures to encourage pensioners to install central heating and energy conservation in their homes. If a scheme could be introduced that meant pensioners did not have to take a chance on such costly, uncertain, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
long-term commitments as equity release to have urgent repairs or improvements carried out, it might mean that only those who genuinely understood the schemes and their consequential costs would use equity release.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">However inadequate my remarks, I hope that I have put across the danger of those products&#151;or, as the FSA describes it, the &quot;high risk&quot; of them. It is a great concern that firms market them as easy, almost painless ways of buying luxuries. Above all, the evidence of products being sold without the customer&#151;who is sometimes frail or vulnerable&#151;being fully advised should be deeply worrying to everyone connected with the product. There is a role for such schemes, but I fear that at this moment in the development of schemes, a number of ordinary decent people are being harmed. That should be made public, and should be addressed.
</p>


<a name="time_1">
<a name="60117h01_time1"><h5>9.58 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60117h01_spnew7"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie) on raising this subject, not least because it affects substantial numbers of our constituents. I have had some appalling cases, as he has, and it is absolutely right that they be brought to light. Where the Government can help, they should. I have the slight advantage of having participated in the original debate in 2003 when the Minister&#039;s predecessor, who is now the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, led for the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">The context, as the hon. Member for Leeds, East has reminded us, is that there was no regulation of this market at all at that stage, in respect of either lifetime mortgages or home reversion. What there was, and is, is a self-regulating scheme called the SHIP&#151;safe home income plans&#151;scheme, which is important because it protects customers at the moment, until the new regulation comes into effect, which may well not be until 2007. Although it gives some credit to the better firms in the industry that have subscribed to the agreement and offers some protection from negative equity, it is seriously flawed in all sorts of ways. It offers very partial coverage and provides compensation that is far less than would be available through the financial ombudsman system. There is no monitoring, and no sanctions for companies in the industry that break the rules.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">The structure of self-regulation was flimsy and it was clearly right to move on from it, which the Government have done. Lifetime mortgages are now regulated by the FSA, and when the Regulation of Financial Services (Land Transactions) Act 2005 comes into effect, it will cover home reversion too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">My second introductory point echoes the point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, East in his introductory remarks. In principle, there is nothing wrong with equity release; indeed, the concept is attractive in many ways. Many people in our society are asset-rich and income-poor. If market mechanisms can be developed to turn assets into income, we should welcome that. Indeed, Lord Turner, in his report, drew attention to the potential of equity release as a partial solution to the long-term problems of pensions. As the hon. Gentleman emphasised, the vast potential has not even begun to be tapped. Total domestic property assets are worth some &#163;2.2 trillion, and probably half of that, as he said, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 182WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is   realisable under equity release. However, less than 0.25   per cent. of the market has manifested itself in equity release products, so the market is very under-developed, but it has a lot of potential if things are done properly, which involves regulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">I shall raise a series of issues with the Minister. The    first and most important question, which the hon.   Member for Leeds, East touched on, is what happens now. The Government&#039;s responsibility will be to introduce secondary legislation, and the FSA&#039;s responsibility will be to consult on the detail of regulation. That process poses a series of questions, some of which I shall list.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">The first question has already been mentioned: what happens in the intervening period? It may be as long as two years before the regulations come into effect, and during that time people will be unprotected. I imagine that at the very least, the Government can give us some assurance about the speed with which the secondary legislation will be introduced, and urge the FSA to get on quickly with its consultative process. Another way of dealing with the matter, which would give confidence to people in the industry and borrowers, would be for the Government to give an assurance that the protection provided by the new regulation could be backdated, possibly to the date on which the existing lifetime mortgage regulation came into effect, or at the very least, to the point at which the new legislation on home reversion was introduced in the House. If that was available, some of the anxieties about the long hiatus would be dissipated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The second set of questions relates to the scope of the regulations when they are introduced, a matter on which the Minister will be reflecting. The National Consumer Council has produced an extremely good report, posing some of the technical questions that will have to be addressed at the next stage. It asks, for example, whether there should be limitations on protection under the legislation in respect of age. Should this option be simply for older people, or for everyone? I think that the NCC concluded that it should be for everyone; an age division would be arbitrary. What would happen if one person in a household was 65 and their partner 55? Absurd situations would be created.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">The NCC also raises the question whether there should be a de minimis provision. I am talking about people being able to raise small amounts of equity to go on holiday, rather than going for this option as a big savings decision. That should not necessarily be discouraged by complex and costly regulation. The NCC makes the point that an arbitrary limit would be easily abused by unscrupulous providers and probably is not practical, but it would be interesting to have the Minister&#039;s preliminary thoughts on that question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">A third issue relating to the forthcoming secondary legislation is value for money. Do the Government intend some protection to be built into the system to ensure not merely that people are not ripped off, but that they get genuine value for money in the transactions? There are various questions about that, one of which is whether there should be a stipulation that an equity release transaction should be accompanied by independent valuation&#151;valuation by an independent valuer rather than by someone from the provider. That seems quite a sensible provision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">Various other arguments have been advanced, such as that there should be a minimum threshold for the cash released from a scheme. Should that be specified in the    regulations? The conclusion of those who have considered the matter is that that simply is not possible, because there are many different dimensions to the cost of a home reversion scheme, and all that can realistically be demanded of providers is full transparency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">A fourth set of questions relates to compensation, and how much there will be. Will it be &#163;100,000, which I think is the Financial Ombudsman Service limit, or, probably more plausibly, should it be equivalent to the compensation available to people under the existing regulations for mortgages&#151;or should it be another amount?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">Those are the questions that I wanted to pose on the follow-up to the new legislation, the secondary legislation and the FSA rules. I shall conclude with a series of broader questions about where all this leaves us. First, there are unresolved questions about the lifetime mortgage regulation. Although the regulation is now in place, it is beginning to emerge that there is a lack of clarity about certain points. As I understand it, the lifetime mortgage regulation protects consumers from negative equity, but in practice the definition of negative equity has proved rather difficult to pin down. Some customers find themselves in a serious net debt position, although theoretically they are protected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">Another big issue is retrospection for people who have suffered from shared appreciation mortgage mis-selling. I have dealt with two such cases in my constituency&#151;appalling cases of people who were blatantly mis-sold products by Barclays or the Bank of Scotland. I think that there were two particular sub-products in their range, in respect of which quite sophisticated people, who had studied the small print carefully, had a very firm impression of their maximum exposure to risk of loss of capital value under the appreciating mortgage. The banks interpreted that in a totally different way, and their interpretation was utterly lacking in transparency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">Those people have never been able to obtain redress. They are not covered by the new mortgage regulation, because what occurred was before the relevant time, and the banks&#039; own self-regulation scheme does not cover them. The banks involved have refused to accept that they have any liability, and some people have lost enormous sums of money because of a not terribly reputable set of arrangements. I wonder whether the Government feel that they have any responsibility for trying to secure some justice for the people concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">The second broad issue was raised, rightly, by the Minister&#039;s colleagues when we had the debate on home reversion protection. The good point was made that when one set of products is regulated and another is not, the more unscrupulous providers in the industry tend simply to migrate from one to the other. One of the main reasons why home reversion protection was introduced was to stop that happening. Now that that loophole has been plugged, the industry will migrate elsewhere.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">In some bits of the property market there is a serious lack of protection for consumers, the most obvious of which&#151;I encounter a lot of these cases, perhaps because I represent a relatively prosperous part of south-west London&#151;are the so-called property investment clubs,

<br>&nbsp;<br>
whereby many people are seduced into parting with large amounts of money as a result of totally specious arguments about the endless appreciation of the property market. All kinds of scams will emerge, and people will lose large amounts of money. It is a completely unregulated market, and the FSA is reluctant to take responsibility for it. Are the Government considering the possibility of being proactive on that matter?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">The third general point was touched on by the hon.   Member for Leeds, East&#151;the relationship with the benefits system. It matters enormously to an individual whether the income that they derive from the liquidation of capital is counted, or how the capital is treated, from the point of view of savings disregards under the pension credit system, and the benefits system more generally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">The arguments are extremely complex, and I do not want to make a political point about them. I wonder whether it might be helpful for the Minister, in conjunction with the Department for Work and Pensions, to publish a note describing the relationship between the benefit system and equity release, and whether there is any need for reform. I am not proposing anything; I am just suggesting to the Government that there is an issue that somebody needs to address comprehensively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">My final point, which the hon. Member for Leeds, East made effectively, is about advice. Large numbers of financial advisers, who vary enormously in quality and integrity, are simply not in a position to give quality advice on this matter, because they have never been trained, they do not understand the complexities of the benefits system, and ultimately, they have an interest in selling products. They do not have an interest in telling people to find a simpler solution such as trading down. As a result, people often receive bad advice. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s implication was that the way to deal with that problem is through the framework of regulation. That may be appropriate, and the advisory process may need regulation, but I have a slightly different take on the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">I thought that the Treasury would broadly agree with the view, which I have expressed for many years, that some kind of independent pro bono system of advice is needed, so that people can go along to a body, be it a citizens advice bureau or some other organisation with no axe to grind, and obtain a financial health check. They should be able to go to an adviser who has no interest in the transaction for some simple, common-sense advice, and ask: &quot;Do I trade down my house, or do I buy a home reversion product? Do I use cash to pay off my debts? What is a sensible way to approach my family finances?&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">I debated the matter with the Minister&#039;s predecessor. Three years ago the Government were thinking about putting certainly some energy and possibly some money into a national roll-out of independent financial advice centres, which would provide such advice in order to avoid the difficulties that the hon. Member for Leeds, East so eloquently described. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some answers to the, regrettably, rather large number of questions that I have put to him.

securing this important debate, and on the way in which he introduced it. He rightly pointed out that the schemes exist to address a need. Many pensioners who find themselves asset rich but income poor look for some form of financial security by trying to use the equity in their house.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">The hon. Member for Leeds, East was right to point out the complexity of the schemes, the problems that people have understanding them and the need to ensure that consumers understand their consequences. One duty of the Financial Services Authority is the promotion of financial literacy and education. It is important that consumers understand the product, and are not reliant on the sales process undertaken by an independent financial adviser or a direct sales force. The hon. Gentleman identified some of the issues involved in that process, which were brought out by the FSA&#039;s mystery shopper programme. Customers must be able to understand the consequences of what they are attempting, and organisations such as Age Concern, which focus on supporting people in retirement in particular, must take part in that education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">The importance of the mystery shopper campaign was not just to identify problems in the sales process and tie up those loose ends; I was pleased to hear the FSA say in August that enforcement action would be taken against continuing problems. Crucially, that means that issues arising from the sale of such products will be identified now, rather than when the person dies, or 10 to 15 years down the track, when a significant problem with the products is found. Enforcement will accelerate the regulatory process and ensure&#151;I hope&#151;that the proposed regulations for home reversion plans reflect some of the issues that were identified earlier.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">One point on which I would question the hon. Member for Leeds, East is the minimum draw-down and the minimum amount borrowed. Setting a minimum, even at a high level, forces&#151;or perhaps &quot;should force&quot; is the right way of putting it&#151;independent financial advisers, direct sales forces and the consumer to think, &quot;Is this the right route? Do I really need to borrow &#163;25,000 when all I want to do is go on a &#163;5,000 holiday?&quot; The other factor to bear in mind is that the cost of selling such products can be significant, and the greater the regulation of those products, the higher the costs incurred by the provider, which need to be recovered. Regulation increases either up-front charges or interest rates, so a balance needs to be struck.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">The hon. Member for Twickenham was right to say that including a de minimus level in regulation would encourage smaller loans. Rather than one &#163;25,000 loan, there would be a series of &#163;5,000 loans, if the de minimus happened to be &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000, for example. We must be careful about the use of de minimus limits in terms of    regulation and the amounts borrowed, because borrowing larger amounts can work in the consumer&#039;s favour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">The hon. Member for Twickenham touched on the issue of shared appreciation mortgages. I, too, have come across examples in my constituency of people taking out such mortgages. In the marketing literature 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 186WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
supplied, I was struck by the crystal clear calculation of the amount that&#151;in this case&#151;Barclays would take. The obligation or liability that the customer would take on was apparent; however, the complexity of the decision making that one would have to go through to take out a shared appreciation mortgage in the first place was not clear. That is the issue with such products, and it applies to all equity release schemes. With a shared appreciation mortgage, one is taking a bet on one&#039;s longevity, on interest rates and on the appreciation of the value of one&#039;s house.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">In the cases concerned, it turned out that the lender achieved a good deal at the end of the day&#151;but if circumstances had been slightly different, the lender could have suffered and the borrower could have been better off. The decisions are complex. People need to understand them, and they need to be taken through the sales process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">As the hon. Members for Twickenham and for Leeds, East have identified, there is a legitimate demand for equity release schemes. A report yesterday said that the   value of pensioners&#039; housing assets had reached &#163;1 trillion. Many pensioners who consider themselves asset rich but cash poor&#151;in particular, those who have been retired for some time and have seen their pension eroded through inflation or higher costs such as council tax, or those who have relied on the returns from lump-sum investments or savings and seen those returns diminish&#151;want to use their equity to meet some of the costs of retirement. They want to use it to help themselves and, perhaps, their families too. Given that demand, it is right for the financial services sector to respond to it with products that can meet the needs of consumers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">There is rightly some concern about some products, and we must analyse the sales process. One of my concerns, which was touched on earlier, is about the delay in the regulation of the home reversion market, given that the Regulation of Financial Services (Land Transactions) Bill went through this House last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">The hon. Member for Leeds, East noted that the sale of home reversions is on the increase. I suspect that that is in part because of the heavier regulation of lifetime mortgages, with people squeezed into the home reversion market because of the lighter regulatory touch on it. In a report from <i>The Times</i> last August, one comment speaks volumes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;A further brake on sales growth is expected as the second part of the equity release market&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">home reversions&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">becomes regulated.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">The report implies, first, the need for firms selling such products to tighten up their sales process, and secondly, the suspicion that business that would otherwise have gone through the regulated lifetime mortgage schemes has been channelled through home reversion schemes. Prompt action is important. I look to the Financial Secretary to give us an update on that process and say what discussions are taking place with the FSA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">Regulation is important. Two thirds of advisers in the mystery shopper exercise were not gathering sufficient information about their clients. The hon. Member for Leeds, East gave examples of that. How can products be sold properly if the information process has not been gone through? I hope that the FSA will learn from the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 187WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
lessons of the mystery shopper exercise when looking at home reversion plans to see how it can further tighten regulation of lifetime mortgages to deal with the concerns, and that it will repeat the exercise at regular intervals to see how member firms are tackling the problem. As I said earlier, mystery shopper exercises will help to reduce incidents of mis-selling later in life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">Regulation leads to increased costs being imposed on providers. Those costs are recovered from their clients. The up-front fees that some advisers charge on equity release schemes can be greater than 2.5 per cent. of the loan value. Obviously, that will recover in part some of the cost of regulation, so we must make sure that the regulation is right, but does not inhibit the condition of the market and lead to a bad deal for consumers. Complementary to regulation is the importance of competition in the market. We need more providers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">The hon. Member for Leeds, East referred to Prudential. Some in the industry said last year that its involvement in that market would add new stimulus to sales by reducing cost. When Prudential published details of its scheme, Saga reduced its loan costs to 6.39 per cent. That was still quite high, but competition was acting to spur the reduction of the costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">Given the importance of the interest rate in calculating the final liability for lifetime mortgages, the further interest costs are driven down by competition in the market, the better deal it will be for the consumer. Last year, Dean Mirfin from Key Retirement Solutions said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Interest rates on equity release plans have been falling since the start of the year and are likely to fall further as competition becomes more intense.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">There will be a benefit to customers. More competition will lead also to more sophisticated products being introduced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">The hon. Member for Leeds, East referred to the Prudential policy with the draw-down. That is an important benefit for customers because it reduces costs. If people draw down sensibly when they require it, there will be a lower interest bill. That process has been spurred on by competition and by the involvement of more sophisticated providers in the marketplace. It works to the advantage of customers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">Competition by itself is not the only answer. We need better regulation, but we must bear in mind that the products are of interest to constituents. They look to use the equity in their houses, perhaps to help their families, and to provide some income in retirement, given the threat that many people now see their to pensions. We need a regulatory competition regime that helps to meet the aspirations of our constituents, but in a way that encourages the market and protects customers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">I say to my hon. Friend that I will make sure that the chairman and chief executive of the Financial Services Authority receive a full transcript of the debate. I know that they will take carefully into account his specific comments about certain products and companies. I am certain that the FSA will take into account the broader comments that have been made in the debate as it puts in place the full regulatory cover that we intend to result from the legislation passed last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">Like my hon. Friend, I pay tribute to the work of the Consumers Association, and in particular the work of the publication <i>Which?</i>. With other publications, it plays an important job in providing in-depth, well-researched and reliable information to consumers in such matters. He was right to say that the last time that equity release schemes were fully debated, it was before the Government made moves to regulate in this area. I welcome the fact that in opening the debate, he said that there was no doubt that things had got better since then. I welcome the debate; now is a good time to take stock because, as some contributors have said, many anticipate an increasing market in equity release, based on the regulation, and the fact that it should give greater confidence to consumers and lead to better products, and to the better provision of those products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">However, while stressing the potential of this market, it is worth keeping its scale in perspective. The SHIP&#151;safe home income plans&#151;group produced figures that suggested that the value of new lending in the equity release market in 2004 was just above &#163;1.2 billion. That means that the size of the equity release market in that year compared with the volume of overall mortgage lending was less than 1 per cent. While the number of firms specialising in equity release is only 57, lenders and brokers in the more general mortgage market total almost 14,000.As the debate has made clear, it remains a fact that the products are complex. They can be valuable to consumers, but accurate information, good advice and care is required when taking them out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East asked specific questions. He referred first to mystery shopping and talked about discussions that Ministers plan to have with the Financial Services Authority about some of the worries that he thinks were arose from the mystery shopping exercise. As a result of the exercise and the FSA&#039;s review, many main trade bodies have issued new guidance to their members. The FSA remains in active discussion with the industry and consumer groups about how to secure higher standards of advice for consumers. My hon. Friend will know, better than I do, that the FSA holds firms to account and has been clear that it will take a hard line with those that do not sort out the problems about which it is concerned. As my hon. Friend will be aware from   his work on the Treasury Committee, the FSA is operationally independent of the Government. However, it is required by law to ensure that regulation is effective and proportionate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) raised his concerns about the timetable and the process for getting the regulation in place, especially home reversion schemes. The first step towards bringing the arrangements into full FSA regulation was the primary 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 189WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
legislation that enables home reversion plans to fall within the scope of potential FSA regulation, and that received Royal Assent last year. The second step is the secondary legislation required to amend the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 to bring home reversion plans into FSA regulation. The Government&#151;led, of course, by the Treasury&#151;are preparing for consultation on that stage. The third stage is for the FSA to draw up and consult on the rules that it proposes regarding sales of home reversion plans, and the fourth is for firms then to apply for permission from the FSA to sell home reversion plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">The Government have a commitment to allow 12 weeks for public consultation based on secondary legislative proposals. Further down the track, the FSA normally needs to allow a minimum of six months between the publishing of its rules and the regulations coming into force. I concede to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East that some may consider that process to be somewhat lengthy, but I assure him and other Members that this process is currently proceeding very smoothly, and my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and I do not anticipate any unnecessary delays.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">I welcomed the presence, and brief contribution, of      my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor). He is a former accountant and I welcome his interest in, and concern for, the consumer. I regret that he has been unable to stay for the conclusion of the debate, but I will ensure that he receives a copy of the <i>Official Report </i>so that he can catch up with the points that he has missed&#151;perhaps that is a threat rather than a promise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">The hon. Member for Twickenham correctly stated that there is nothing wrong in principle with equity release schemes, although he has concerns that in certain circumstances they may not be fully appropriate for the consumers who purchase them. He asked a number of specific questions about backdating, scope, value for money in transactions and independent valuations. I   expect that he will appreciate that those specific matters will be settled during the period when secondary legislation is being made, and in particular, when the FSA draws up proposals for the detailed rules.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">The hon. Gentleman made a point of stressing his participation in debates during the passage of the Regulation of Financial Services (Land Transactions) Act 2005, and some of the issues that he raised&#151;such as the de minimis question&#151;were discussed during the consideration of that legislation. I think that on that issue it was agreed on all sides&#151;the hon. Gentleman can correct me if I am wrong&#151;that a de minimis rule risked distorting behaviour; it would probably allow unscrupulous firms to avoid the regulation intended by the legislation by dividing a loan up into more than one loan in order to keep below any de minimis threshold.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 190WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
what are the advantages and disadvantages of backdating the coverage that consumers would derive under the financial ombudsman scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60117h01_spnew10"><b> John Healey </b> : I think that that specific issue would be better examined in the context of the introduction of the regulations and rules, rather than in this general debate. However, the hon. Gentleman raised several more general points, to which I can respond.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">The first point was about shared appreciation mortgages. I understand the concern arising from the particular cases that the hon. Gentleman cited. All MPs come across such constituents, and they&#151;and certainly Ministers&#151;have every sympathy for consumers who find themselves in financial difficulties having taken out a shared appreciation mortgage. Consumers can access the Financial Ombudsman Service if they feel that they have been badly advised about the mortgage or that it    was mis-sold to them. However, the financial ombudsman has not to date found any evidence of mis-selling, and in those circumstances it is difficult to see that there are any grounds for compensation, let alone for the Government to step in and accept some sort of responsibility for compensation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">The hon. Gentleman then turned his attention to property investment clubs. Regulation to deal with collective investment schemes is already in place. In the light of concerns about the activities of property investment clubs, the FSA has reviewed what it calls its perimeter guidance. In general terms and in principle, the Government do not believe that it is appropriate for the FSA to regulate property purchase; that is a very different matter from the financial services regulation that it was specifically set up to deal with. However, the FSA&#039;s clarification of the perimeter has made it clear that some schemes that have previously regarded themselves as unregulated might need to be regulated by the FSA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of the provision of free money advice. He may not be aware that only last week the FSA launched, jointly with the BBC, an online advice tool designed to help consumers by offering good advice on financial services. The FSA&#039;s more general financial capability work is now looking into what might need to be done further. In addition, the Chancellor&#151;the hon. Gentleman will remember this, because he was shadowing the Chancellor at the time&#151;announced in the 2004 pre-Budget report a &#163;120 million financial inclusion fund, part of which goes towards supporting the development and provision of free face-to-face money advice through providers such as citizens advice bureaux, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.

<a name="60117h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">That leads me directly on to the contribution of the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban). He began by stressing the importance of good financial literacy and understanding by consumers. I hope that he welcomes the moves that we have made and the investment we have put into financial literacy and money advice for consumers. He also stressed the fact that there is a legitimate demand for equity release schemes, and in a reflective contribution he helped to set the broader context for some of the specific issues that have cropped up. He urged us to bear in mind the interests that our constituents have in these financial products and their potential, and emphasised that they help to provide income for some people in retirement. He also rightly

&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 191WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
said that there is a need for regulation, but that we must also regulate in order to meet the aspirations of our constituents and potential consumers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">Regulation has been the crux of the debate. Regulation is not intended to discourage the sale of such products. Instead, our approach is to enable people to make informed choices, to offer necessary consumer protection, and to ensure that there is a competitive level playing field in the equity release market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">I was prepared to set out a degree of detail and background for equity release products and the development of regulation in this field, but the participants in the debate are probably far better informed than many other Members. Therefore, suffice it to say that there are two basic types of scheme: mortgage-based schemes or lifetime mortgages, and reversion plans. The difference between them is clear: in mortgage-based schemes the householder retains ownership of the property, whereas in reversion plans the reversion provider becomes the owner of whatever proportion of the property is sold.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">Mortgage-based equity release schemes have been regulated by the FSA since 2004. However, home reversion plans are not currently regulated by the FSA, as they are, effectively, transactions in land and are therefore not covered by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. However, the Government fully accepted the case that such schemes needed to be regulated to help people to make informed choices, to offer proper and valuable consumer protection, and to make sure that there is a competitive and fair market in these products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">As I have said, home reversion plans are not currently regulated by the FSA, but that is not to say that purchasers of such plans are completely without protection. The home reversion market is subject to voluntary regulation through the SHIP group. Members of SHIP agree to comply with the code of practice and to undertake a fair, simple and complete presentation of any plan that they offer. Crucially, they also offer a guarantee that consumers will never owe a lender more than the value of their home; in other words, they give a &quot;no negative equity&quot; guarantee. Clearly, those protections are a long way short of the protection offered by statutory regulation and by the FSA&#039;s more general regime.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60117h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Mudie </b> : When I looked at the SHIP website, I counted 19 firms that are members of SHIP, which is a voluntary organisation, whereas there are 57 providers. Does the Minister not agree that the home reversion scheme operates in a market in which a minority of providers are in SHIP, and so give some cover? The majority are free to operate as they think appropriate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60117h01_spnew12"><b> John Healey </b> : My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point, but just to be clear, the figure of 57 that I gave earlier is the number of firms operating in the equity release market. The majority offer lifetime mortgages rather than home reversions&#151;in other words, they offer the products that are already regulated&#151;so he should take as an encouraging sign the total number of members of SHIP, as that represents a large part of the biggest providers of the home reversion-type product.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">Because the current voluntary system does not provide the sort of protection that consumers need, we launched a consultation in November 2003, and in 2004 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 192WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Government announced that we would in future empower the FSA to regulate those financial products. We introduced the required primary legislation, the Regulation of Financial Services (Land Transactions) Act 2005, last year. I am pleased to say that it received support from both sides of the House. It was debated pretty fully, and my close friend and colleague the Economic Secretary led the debate as the Bill made its passage through Parliament. It gained Royal Assent just before Christmas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">As I have said, as soon as possible we in the Treasury will introduce the necessary secondary legislation to define precisely which products and activities will be regulated by the FSA. Once the secondary legislation has been consulted on, the FSA will consult on the detailed rules that will apply to those products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">Given the powers granted by the 2005 Act, the sort of rules that one would expect the FSA to apply to home reversions would include rules to ensure that providers advise of risks as well as benefits when advertising reversion schemes, and rules on advice to consumers to ensure that advisers have considered implications for tax and benefits&#151;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East and the hon. Member for Twickenham&#151;and have matched the consumer&#039;s overall needs and circumstances to the product features. Also, one would expect a requirement for firms to issue key product information to consumers in a clear and understandable format. Furthermore, FSA regulation will offer consumers access to the Financial Ombudsman Service in the event that they wish to make a complaint, and that will provide them with cover under the financial services compensation scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">Encouragingly, although perhaps not surprisingly, the industry has been a keen proponent of regulation for reversion plans, as it wants to remove any consumer confusion and, of course, boost consumer confidence in the market as a whole. Indeed, when my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East had secured this debate, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary was contacted by the Association of British Insurers, which made clear to   him directly its support for enhanced consumer protection of home reversion schemes. It makes three recommendations: first, advice provided by firms to consumers should be simple and complete; secondly, advice should include schemes&#039; implications for tax and means-tested benefits; and, thirdly, consumers should have their properties independently valued, a point raised in this debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">In summing up, it is fair to say that equity release schemes can help people&#151;particularly the asset rich but cash poor&#151;to enjoy a higher standard of life, but they are complex products and are not suitable for everyone. It is important to understand what they will mean in practice, and consumers should always seek independent financial advice. I direct consumers and hon. Members, if they do not have copies to hand in their constituency office, to a leaflet on equity release published by the FSA called &quot;Thinking of Raising Money from your Home?&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">FSA regulation ensures that consumers have the right information and advice to hand when choosing a mortgage, and it provides redress mechanisms in the event of complaints. Proportionate and effective regulation should protect elderly people, who are some of the most vulnerable people in our society, allowing

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
them to make informed choices about the financial arrangements that are best for them. Of course, increased consumer confidence is an essential foundation for a competitive, diverse and fair mortgage market in the UK&#151;a general economic aim that I am sure all hon. Members who participated in this debate would support.

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60117h02_spnew0"><b> Sir Nicholas Winterton  </b> (in the Chair): We have just had a tranquil period and I am sure that that will be typical of the next debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60117h02_spnew1"><b> Dr. John Pugh  (Southport)</b>  (LD): It is a pleasure to see you in your place, Sir Nicholas. The new environment for these debates strikes me as somewhat funereal in comparison with Westminster Hall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para0"><a name="stpa_94">The debate is a timely one, because the Government are proceeding on an agenda that has little resonance or connection with circumstances that prevail throughout most of the country. As I understand the Government&#039;s forward-looking educational agenda at the moment, they think that choice of schools is a serious issue for a large number of parents, that there is not enough choice and that there is a need for an ever-new variety of providers and an ever-increasing number of them. They seem to feel that choice between schools&#151;competition of a direct kind&#151;is the main mechanism through which quality in education will be driven up and pupils will get a better deal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para1"><a name="stpa_95">The Government also seem to feel that schools and parents are crying out for greater independence for schools. That is reflected in the proposals that schools   should have charge of their own admissions arrangements and, in some cases, control over the land, which alienates public assets in the process. In addition, the Government are fairly relaxed, unlike many people to whom I speak, about the increase in traffic and travelling around that will follow on from the proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para2"><a name="stpa_96">In looking at the matter and trying my best sympathetically to understand where the Government are coming from, I have decided that they are fixated by what I can only call a London perspective. I understand that in London there are pressures on admissions and that there is a mix of schools; some are quite poor and some are heavily oversubscribed. There is sometimes competition for the best ones and there is also a mixed pattern of local education authorities, some of which perform well whereas others are distinctly unpopular or are rather ideologically driven.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para3"><a name="stpa_97">London has the luxury of much better transport infrastructure than is available in most parts of the country. If parents need to move their children around or children need to move around in order to get to schools, the transport infrastructure will support that, despite its flaws. Other places do not have the advantage of the London bus and tube system or the like.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para4"><a name="stpa_98">Most people would accept that London is different from the rural environment, where the problems that schools face and the problems that parents have in choosing them are quite different. We must also accept that the situation is distinctly different in parts of the north. In fact, my research for this debate has shown that the problems are distinctly different almost everywhere outside the London fringe. There are severe problems as close to London as Essex.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para5"><a name="stpa_99">The big problem is falling rolls. There are simply more places than there are children to fill them. Projections show that the problem will not diminish but will increase, in the short term at least.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 195WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60117h02_spnew2"><b> Bob Spink  (Castle Point)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue. He mentioned Essex and falling rolls, so this is an apposite moment to state that in the Thames Gateway area, in which my constituency lies, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is planning to build another 124,000 houses. Some communities in that area which have schools with falling rolls will get thousands of new houses, bringing along hundreds more children. Does he agree that it is premature to be considering closing schools in such communities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60117h02_spnew3"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a sound point. It just goes to show that sometimes education policies and other sorts of policies do not dovetail in the way that we hope.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para6"><a name="stpa_100">Traditionally, when we faced such problems, local authorities endeavoured to balance out the situation by controlling admission limits, by sometimes forcing amalgamations and mergers through, and by using what was then their considerable power to put gentle pressure on management who simply were not performing. That was the traditional recipe in the 1970s, 1980s and before. Falling rolls are not a new problem; numbers fell by about a third in the 1970s and 1980s, but picked up a little later. Although it is not a new problem, it is now a severe one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para7"><a name="stpa_101">I believe that falling rolls are the major problem facing educational planners. A survey in <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> showed that 54 per cent. of local authorities think that they will merge or close schools in the coming year. The birth rate in 2001 hit a historic low for modern times. The Audit Commission says that two thirds of council areas will have more than 10 per cent. surplus places, and so it goes on. The Government clearly recognise that because they are cutting back on training places, except in areas where shortages have already been identified, such as in science and maths.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para8"><a name="stpa_102">If we consider specifics, some drastic statistics can be found. One in 15 schools in Cumbria is scheduled to   go. A 47 per cent. surplus in places&#151;almost half&#151;is predicted in Nottingham by 2009. Two thirds of Gateshead primaries have too many surplus places and in Derbyshire there will be a considerable fall in the roll of between 10 and 15 per cent. in the next four years. According to answers provided to me by the    Department for Education and Skills, about 250   schools close per year, and that has been the picture for the past five years. The picture is a dramatic one and the problem is severe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para9"><a name="stpa_103">I will address the specific issue of my own LEA, comment on what I know happens there and on how we have tried to approach the matter. I will also point out why the current Government policies are of no real assistance and have no resonance. They seem to be formulated on another planet, although it is merely down here, in the DFES.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para10"><a name="stpa_104">Most people would accept that Sefton LEA is a good one, and has been for many years. It is popular with its schools, has statistically had good results and has funded its schools for many years above the average level. The schools may be caught out by the new national formula. An indication of the tenor of the educational environment in Sefton is that no school opted out of LEA control when it was possible to do 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 196WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
so. There were two votes; one was lost miserably and the first vote was lost&#151;I campaigned to ensure that it was lost&#151;by persuading parents that an opt-out by one school would disadvantage others. That shows something about the parents. They were offered the opt-out, but they declined on that basis; they did not see themselves as the adversaries of the other schools. Hon. Members will recall that in those days funding for opt-out schools was top-sliced from the LEA in a rather generous and inequitable fashion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60117h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Nick Gibb  (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</b>  (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that parental views are paramount in education policy, given that he valued the views that they expressed in the two votes to which he refers?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60117h02_spnew5"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : Parents&#039; views are very important. I am not sure what stress the hon. Gentleman wishes to place on the word &quot;paramount&quot;. One must accept that in addition to parents&#039; views there are the views of the community at large, in respect of the utilisation of its resources. The community&#151;the council tax payers&#151;ultimately funds facilities as well and its views are also an issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para11"><a name="stpa_105">Mine has not been a backward-looking authority. We introduced local management of schools&#151;or independent finance for schools&#151;long before we were obliged to do so. The LEA was democratically accountable, and I am not flattering myself because I served on it. I want to pay tribute to the quality of the other members. I was impressed with their knowledge and involvement and with the standard of the debates that took place. The level of understanding of educational issues on the council was far higher at that time than I believe it to be now. In addition, most parents got their first choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para12"><a name="stpa_106">If I were a Government ideologue, I would say, &quot;Well, the snag with that sort of system&#151;a local authority managed system&#151;is that it is too secure an environment for schools that are underperforming. Although they get the numbers, they may not also get the results&quot;. However, we were mindful of that even in those days and pressed for comparators between schools so that their performance could be judged. We insisted&#151;again, we were ahead of the Government&#151;that those be value-added.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para13"><a name="stpa_107">We therefore have a history of school rationalisation, and it has not been half as contentious or difficult as the current process. In those days, to be fair, we could cushion some of the effects of school rationalisation by increasing nursery provision, abandoning old buildings that were past their useful life, proposing reorganisation that seemed popular and using local authority capital funding to ameliorate the effects of the process. There was, however, still a lingering issue of surplus places, and the Audit Commission repeatedly reminded us that allowing the situation to persist would not be the most effective use of public resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para14"><a name="stpa_108">However, those were the old days, and I preferred them in some respects, although not in an absolute way, because they had certain advantages over the current education environment. I say that because the Government have said several times that the surplus places rule has been dropped. Indeed, they have had to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 197WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
say that several times because hon. Members did not take up their comments straight away or did not take them at their word. However, the Government are quite genuine, and the existence of surplus places is not a consideration when deciding whether to encourage other schools in the same community to expand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para15"><a name="stpa_109">The net effect is that we risk massive expansion in one place, while schools in a similar place not too far away topple over. The local authority&#039;s role is no longer to manage the process, but to deal with the fallout&#151;clearing up when one school goes down because another has come up. In the Chamber, I told the current Home Secretary, who was Secretary of State for Education and Skills at the time, that the local authority&#039;s residual role was to be the undertaker for unsuccessful schools and that it did not have much of a strategic role beyond that. That is certainly how things look at times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para16"><a name="stpa_110">In Sefton, we have been through a process of painful primary school reorganisation. It was preceded in other places by unplanned expansion that was not terribly well thought through. The net effect for parents and children in the schools that were targeted for closure was pain, upheaval and a sense that time and resources had been wasted. Indeed, appreciable amounts of investment had been put into some of the schools that became vulnerable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para17"><a name="stpa_111">The free market in education was cross-grained with some of the more imaginative transport plans that were being drawn up to reduce traffic to and from schools. As has been mentioned, it also cut across community strategies. Indeed, one of the vulnerable schools played a pivotal part in reinvigorating a community that had been through some hard times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para18"><a name="stpa_112">To be honest, the process was not well handled, although that was not entirely the Government&#039;s fault. It was also partly the fault of the local authority, which released a plan from on high&#151;suspiciously, it was immediately after the local elections&#151;and with a lack of agreed criteria. It has now learned a little and agreed a matrix of assessment for primary schools and it is considering how it can better conduct any future reduction in surplus places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para19"><a name="stpa_113">The process was also dogged by difficulties and anomalies with the formula. There were difficulties with the funding of smaller as opposed to larger schools and there was a sense that some schools were being set against others. It will interest hon. Members to know that, whereas we previously had a knowing LEA that would have seen the problem coming and been part and parcel of the solution, councillors&#151;apart from the cabinet member&#151;were fairly baffled about their role in the process and about what they could and could not say. Many were governors of schools that would be adversely or positively affected by the closures of other schools and had to get a special dispensation from the standards board to get round the declarations of interest that they would have to put in if they were still to cast a vote. At one stage, there was a serious danger that practically nobody on the council who had not previously declared an interest would be able to vote at a full council meeting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para20"><a name="stpa_114">The second point that should be made at this stage is that the local authority promptly proceeded without a clear idea of where the Government were going on 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 198WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
initiatives such as extended schools or children&#039;s centres, and that problem probably dogs many a closure proposal in many a place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para21"><a name="stpa_115">Even under the current circumstances, things could be done better if there was the prospect of new building or of better use being made of facilities that were relinquished for direct school use. However things are done, the mantra of calling for new providers, more independence and greater competition is relatively meaningless. Private providers of education in my constituency are currently failing, although I do not mean that they are not performing very well. The Birkdale school for hearing-impaired children, which is a private school, was performing exceptionally well, but it could not sustain the course for financial reasons. Another private school recently closed down for precisely the same reason. There is no flood of private providers trying to get into the market. That is a hard case, but let me give hon. Members a harder case still.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para22"><a name="stpa_116">Currently, the problem in my constituency is most manifest at Ainsdale Hope high school, which is earmarked for closure. It has seen a sharp fall in rolls, and a horrendous financial crisis is looming as a consequence. In business terms&#151;I hate using them&#151;we would say that it has lost market share and is starting to suffer. It is the only co-ed, non-Catholic school in the southern part of my constituency, and of the two schools up the road&#151;they are not very near&#151;one is an all-boys school and the other is an all-girls school. If Ainsdale closes, there will be a sharp reduction in choice, which will have been brought on by competition between schools. Ainsdale provides a distinctive special needs environment, for which it is highly commended, but that, too, may go, resulting in a fair reduction in choice. Ainsdale has had its problems academically and in terms of numbers, but that has not always been the case. In my observation of schools in my neck of the woods, the reputation of schools hinges very much on factors as transitory as who happens to be the current headmaster.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para23"><a name="stpa_117">However, it gets worse. Ainsdale was taken over and became a Church school only last year. It has received capital investment and the parents have gone out and bought new blazers for their children. I have spoken to the Church about its capacity to help, and it has told me that if capital is needed, the Church can find it&#151;or, rather, it is legally allowed to find it. After all, the same diocese is opening an academy in Newsham Park in Liverpool. What the school needs, however, is revenue to tide it over, but charity law forbids the Church from providing that revenue. Furthermore, the Government have arranged the funding external to the local authority in many respects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para24"><a name="stpa_118">We now have the danger of implosion, which is offset only by the authority leaning on other schools not to take in pupils who want to find themselves a more secure education environment. That is legally contestable and is probably the wrong strategy, but it shows the difficulties that arise when a school faces such a severe problem. Leaving the education market is not like leaving the retail market&#151;there is an awful lot of human damage involved in the process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para25"><a name="stpa_119">The solutions involve increased travel and reduced choice. Ainsdale is a victim of a market philosophy in education, and the effect of its closure will be traumatic. The local authority and the Church, which are the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 199WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
school&#039;s sponsors, cannot help. If the Government are confronted with the problem at some point, they will undoubtedly wash their hands of it and say that it is all down to local decision makers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para26"><a name="stpa_120">I do not want the Government to tell me what I know&#151;that it is all down to local decision makers. If the notes are already written, I suggest that they be hurriedly revised. I do not want them to give me the criteria for school closures. I have read them and I know that they say things about community involvement, travelling distance, alternative schools and so on. That does not help Ainsdale Hope high school to deal with a massive financial headache.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para27"><a name="stpa_121">The Government would be right to say that they have repeatedly told local authorities that they must take community needs into account. They have also repeatedly given them a slightly different message&#151;that they need to make efficient use of public resources. However, I do not want them to say that for two reasons. First, I know it already; it is perfectly true. Secondly, however, I do not want them to say it because it is evasive. The Government set the rules for this game. They fix the finance, define the objectives and micro-manage the process. In the past the LEAs would have managed the process in a benign way. They would have set admission limits and replaced failing management. They would have used LEA capital funding and they would have intervened early&#151;at least, the best would have done. I accept that not all of them would have done; there are some poor LEAs. They would have inspected often. That is what I should like to have seen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para28"><a name="stpa_122">I should like the parents of pupils at Ainsdale Hope high and lots of other schools across the country to be spared some of the agony, and not to be drawn into the political debate. I had an interesting political debate about primary school closures with my Conservative opponent during the general election campaign. I think that the then Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Mr. Tim Collins, came down and said that schools would never be closed under a Conservative Government. Sadly, he is not here to deliver on that promise. However, I checked out what was happening in Cumbria, and I found that he had precisely the same problem as I had. He was trying to deal with a difficult human problem and a difficult problem of resources.

<a name="60117h02_para29"><a name="stpa_123">To get to the main point, the White Paper lays down a new strategic role for the LEAs&#151;I have spotted that. However, it is not for the LEAs; I do not want to talk about LEAs any more. Let us talk about the &quot;Cabinet member for education&quot;, whoever that is, because LEAs are a thing of the past, and it is silly to dignify them with the old description. There is a strategic role, and there is talk about early intervention and so on. Perhaps anybody who has difficulty believing me will believe the Audit Commission, which observes that analysis of the detail of the role is limited. In its most recent report it says that

<a name="60117h02_para31"><a name="stpa_125">What we have instead is a view of the educational world from the more salubrious dining tables of Islington and Notting Hill. We are not clamouring for more choice. In the real educational world, outside Islington and Notting Hill, we are not clamouring for more choice. Again, these are not my words but those of the Audit Commission:

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para32"><a name="stpa_126">We are not calling for more independence. In fact, we are attracted by the White Paper&#039;s concept of federation; co-operation; a learning and sharing community. We are not really calling for more travel&#151;we do not want our schools to be further away. There may be special reasons for travelling further at times, as there are reasons why one might make a trip to the Trafford centre, but in the vast majority of cases, people prefer good, local facilities. We are not calling for more providers, we are not calling for the end of the LEA provider role, and we are not calling for cut-throat competition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para33"><a name="stpa_127">However&#151;this comes not just from me but from the main body of the educational community&#151;we are calling for the intelligent management of public resources and less waste; for the recognition that schools are not supermarkets and that the effects of closing them are not like the effects of closing a supermarket. We are calling for the problem of poor local provision to be solved by improving local provision, making schools beacons in their communities, not deserted by their communities. We very much welcome the capital investment proposals in &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot;, which would ameliorate the situation, improve the process and sugar the pill. However, if they are linked to suggestions such as that the price of receiving the investment is to have an academy, then they are not such an obvious solution. In addition, we are calling for   proper, local, accountable control. If that is not available, perhaps because a council is composed of just one party, there are remedies that can be considered. We can introduce a better electoral system if that is the price of getting a better, more accountable educational system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para34"><a name="stpa_128">If LEAs did not exist, it would probably be necessary to invent them. I fear that one day we shall have to do that. We all want children to achieve their best. If we disagree, it is on how to enable them to do it. It is manifest in the language of the White Paper that the Government are poised between two incompatible strategies. They can either go down the competition-led, free-market line of the think-tank ideologues, or they can listen to the voices of educational experience. I am pleased to see that an increased role has been found for the former chief inspector of schools, David Bell. He will provide that voice.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60117h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. David Anderson  (Blaydon)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Sir Nicholas. It is a pleasure to appear in front of you again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para36"><a name="stpa_130">I want to speak about my part of the world, Blaydon, which is part of the Gateshead local authority area to which the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) referred. We have no debate in Blaydon about governance, letting private companies run our schools or the failure of the LEA because we have good shared governance. We have accepted a local academy that has produced some good results. We have a well-respected, well-run LEA that has helped us to deliver good services to the children of Blaydon with good standards and improved results against any check list. The real educational debate is about two issues, particularly in Blaydon&#151;the need for additional money to upgrade the buildings at some of our schools and the future of our primary schools in a time of falling numbers, which is the subject of today&#039;s debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para37"><a name="stpa_131">In Gateshead as a whole there has been a review of primary provision, and the figures speak for themselves. People have taken lifestyle choices, and responsibilities come with those choices. Between 1995 and 2005, 1,991   fewer children went to school across Gateshead. Without any changes, the figure of at least 847 fewer has been projected for the next five years. At a time when the aim of the LEA is to have no more than 10 per cent. surplus capacity, 35 schools have between 10 per cent. and 25 per cent. surplus places. Without a change, that will increase by 23 more schools by 2010. At the moment, 17 schools have more than 25 per cent. surplus places and without a change there will be 26 such schools by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para38"><a name="stpa_132">The local authority has taken a positive view of the problem within the parameters laid down by central Government and sees it as an opportunity rather than a problem. It is trying to improve the quality of children&#039;s education and wants to improve the learning environment and accessibility. It wants to develop and extend community use of schools and to make best use of the limited resources, but it also has no choice but to reduce the capacity by 2,000 places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para39"><a name="stpa_133">Stakeholders across the community have been involved. During the summer there was a general consultation and awareness-raising exercise with people in the schools and parents. In November and December there were consultations on detailed options, area by area, and every home in the area was given leaflets about what was going on. This month formal proposals will be brought forward and statutory consultations will take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para40"><a name="stpa_134">In the review, a number of options have been suggested. First, the size of schools could be reduced and alternative uses could be found for the buildings. Secondly, the schools could be reorganised and amalgamated with other schools. In most instances, two schools would become one. Thirdly, schools could be developed or replaced altogether and existing schools could be improved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para41"><a name="stpa_135">The review also considered alternative uses such as expanding children&#039;s centres, extending activities within the school, developing more special educational needs provision and allowing more use by the community and by health services&#151;a key area of expansion. Other people were asked whether there were other ways in which their school could be better used in out-of-school hours. Finally, people are being asked to give other options and say what they think. Nothing has been set in stone, except that the capacity has to be reduced by 2,000 places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para42"><a name="stpa_136">As the hon. Member for Southport said, there are issues raised in the wider education debate that come out in the White Paper. I know that the White Paper is specifically about secondary education, but the people concerned with primary education are asking where their role is. How do we square the foreword in the White Paper, which is written by the Prime Minister and states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;Parent choice can be a powerful driver of improved standards&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;a system driven by parents doing their best for their children&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para44"><a name="stpa_138">with the fact that the parents affected by the proposals in Blaydon tell me that their choice would be &quot;Leave our schools alone&quot;? They want the schools developed on site, not closed. I realise that that option is probably obvious to parents, and that it may be costly, but if the Government are serious and want to respond in a positive way to parental choice, they should address the key issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para45"><a name="stpa_139">We could reduce class sizes at primary level. That would be the radical choice for education in this country and would give young people in their formative years the opportunity to develop in the way provided by private education, which would be a step change in people&#039;s lives. It would make them much better equipped to go into the secondary system and help to fulfil the diktat of Government in a way that is both radical and bold. To quote someone not many miles away, we are best when we are bold. My Government proved that in the first term and when they reduced class sizes to under 30, despite howls of protest from some people. Reducing class sizes would also provide parental choice, removing the confusion between the rhetoric and the reality of education policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para46"><a name="stpa_140">The local authority in Gateshead will do its best to square the circle within the parameters in which it has to work. Those parameters will, inevitably, leave some parents less than happy. If we as a Government are serious about parental choice, about improving children&#039;s education and about being radical, we should seize the opportunity.

I accept that we should consider the matter and take on board what the hon. Gentleman said about the previous Minister. Rather than a problem, there is an opportunity that we should grasp with both hands. We should commit ourselves to small class sizes with more personalised learning and provide a real base for the next generation to move on from.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60117h02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ian Austin  (Dudley, North)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate and to bring to the attention of the House the situation in my constituency, where the Conservative-controlled council plans to close two schools, Highfields and Sycamore Green. I want to focus in particular on the unsatisfactory consultation undertaken by the council and the thin case that it has presented for closing the schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para47"><a name="stpa_141">I wrote to the council in October objecting to the proposed closure of the two schools. I enclosed letters and petitions that had been sent to me by parents and children, which demonstrated the strength of feeling. I received no response to those letters, to the proposals and suggestions that were made in them or to the questions that I raised. More important, parents told me that they received no response to their letters, questions or petitions. The local authority also failed to ensure that people were properly notified of the statutory notices that it has since issued proposing the closure of the schools and has not set out properly how parents can respond.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para48"><a name="stpa_142">Parents should have been told in writing exactly how they could respond to the notices. At the very least, the council should have written to all who wrote to it during the initial consultation period and set out the details of the statutory notices, inviting a response. I am sorry to say that I and many parents believe that the consultation process has been deeply unsatisfactory. Other proposals suggested by the schools, the governors and parents should have been properly considered and they have not. The council should halt the process, think again and look carefully at the alternative suggestions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para49"><a name="stpa_143">I object to the proposals because I do not agree with the council&#039;s premise for changing the pattern of primary school provision in Dudley. It has failed to answer entirely legitimate criticism and questions about the projected birth rates. I have looked at the figures from the Office for National Statistics and the data suggest that birth rates could be increasing, not falling. It is true that birth rates in 2001 were very low, but they have subsequently risen from 1.63 in 2001 to 1.77 in 2004. Research by the House of Commons Library shows that the council&#039;s underlying assumptions do not take into account the fact that trends may rise further in the future. They do not consider the impact that policies such as child tax credit, increased support for child care, better maternity and paternity pay, and the child trust fund could have on family size in future, nor do they take account of issues that could result in an increased population in Dudley. For example, one of the objectives of the black country study is to increase the black country&#039;s population by 100,000 and it is not clear 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
whether that has been taken into account. The council cannot show that it has taken account of the impact that the increased housing development planned for sites close to both schools could have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para50"><a name="stpa_144">It is not clear that rolls are falling so dramatically at the two schools that closure is the only option. The council&#039;s policy, as I understand it, is to have no school with more than 15 per cent. surplus places. Pupil numbers at Highfields are not far below that at the moment, and meeting that requirement could easily be done by other measures, which I will set out briefly later. Dudley council&#039;s policy is also to have 7.5 per cent. spare capacity in each locality and it is not clear in its proposals where that spare capacity could be found under the present proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para51"><a name="stpa_145">Even if the council&#039;s case that surplus places have arisen and that the birth rate is falling is correct, I do not accept that closing schools is the only way of addressing the matter, and I do not accept the council&#039;s assertion that small schools with fewer pupils would find it difficult to sustain high-quality education. It would be better to provide extra facilities, and both schools would be ideal for Sure Start centres. Both are in deprived areas that would qualify for such provision, both have the necessary space and such provision would generate increased revenue to help to meet the cost of running the buildings. Governors at both schools have drawn up proposals for extended school provision and have plans for new nurseries. Highfields has already applied to Ofsted, with a target date of January 2006, and governors at Sycamore Green are in discussion with the local authority about early-years provision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para52"><a name="stpa_146">There are many other ways in which local authorities have reduced surplus places without closing schools&#151;for example, by combining schools with other community facilities, providing wrap-around child care, educational support facilities, libraries, extended schools and so on. Both schools&#151;Sycamore Green in particular&#151;serve areas of high deprivation where children need more support and stability, not less. Results at both schools are improving. Sycamore Green is achieving 82 per cent. in literacy, 63 per cent. in maths and 82 per cent. in science. Standards are also increasing rapidly at Highfields. Facilities at both schools are of high quality and have improved with extra investment recently. Those facilities, combined with the ethos of the schools and the support that they receive from parents and the wider community are serving the children well. I am worried that their education will be destabilised by the changes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para53"><a name="stpa_147">At the very least, the council should respond to the questions, criticisms and suggestions properly. It should think again and bring forward proposals to prevent the closure of the two schools. What power do the Government have to examine Dudley&#039;s proposals and the process that it has adopted?

It is incredibly timely for two reasons. First, the debate on the education White Paper frames much of our discussion today. Secondly, we have recently seen the Audit Commission&#039;s submission to the Education and

Skills Committee, which deals with many of the issues, particularly surplus places. Many of the points from his constituency and his wide experience were particularly apposite, and I want to build on his comments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para54"><a name="stpa_148">In the White Paper the problem of falling rolls in the secondary school system is mentioned once, but the number of secondary school-aged children in England will decline in the next 10 years by half a million. Every English region will see a significant decline. In London, where everyone believes that there will be lack of capacity, the number will decline by 40,000, or the equivalent of around 40 secondary schools. I am not suggesting that that decline is spread evenly throughout the capital, but it is large, even in London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para55"><a name="stpa_149">When I have asked questions about that, the Minister has tried to hide the extent of the problem in the way in which the Government set their base years and final years and the way in which they make the different definitions. However, it is difficult to hide the large fall, so they try to make other little points in parliamentary answers. For example, they say that they hope to increase the number of people staying on post-16. I hope that they do, but still the numbers would nowhere near make up for the certain fall. The children have already been born and we know how many places will not be taken up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para56"><a name="stpa_150">The hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin) talked about an upturn in birth rates in the last year, but that will take some time to feed through to secondary school education, even if it is maintained. I do not suggest that the White Paper should be based on one year&#039;s increase in birth rate last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para57"><a name="stpa_151">There is a huge problem in the demographics. The Government admit that on one hand&#151;one hon. Member said that they were cutting the number of teacher-training places&#151;but, on the other, they refuse to admit it in their provision for the future. I would have thought that a White Paper on English schools would have had that at its centre. This is such a major problem for local authorities, schools and education finance that I would have thought that the White Paper would have had at least a section on it, not half a sentence. That is a major dereliction of duty. I have made the point on the Floor of the House and to the press about how significant the problem is, but some people just do not get it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para58"><a name="stpa_152">How can we manage the problem? There are two basic choices&#151;a market-based system and a system with strategic management through the local authority. The White Paper, as we all know, moves towards the market direction, with parental choice deciding which schools stay open and which close. The Minister may say that chapter 9 of the White Paper proposes that local authorities should have extra powers to close failing schools immediately. She would be right, but note the word &quot;failing&quot;. In the White Paper, that means failing academic performance, not financial viability or whether there are too many surplus places. The White Paper is clear and it is not a solution to the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para59"><a name="stpa_153">The White Paper&#039;s focus is very much on a market-led reduction in the number of surplus places. Will that be efficient? Will it involve parents? Will it ensure that it happens quickly? My answer is, of course, no. It is the most expensive way, the most delayed way and the

&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 206WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
least consultative way of dealing with this major problem . Indeed, the Audit Commission&#039;s response to the Select Committee report on the White Paper is absolutely devastating. On page 5 it argues in a slightly underplayed way, which is typical of bodies such as the commission, that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;communities and&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<a name="60117h02_para60"><a name="stpa_154">local government&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;would benefit from the government acknowledging explicit advisory levels of acceptable surplus places within a council or a sub-regional area. There will be of course be regional local differences but the Audit Commission&#039;s view is that the previous benchmarks&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para61"><a name="stpa_155">they have been downgraded by the Department&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;of 10 per cent of places in aggregate and 25 per cent in individual schools should be reinforced.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para62"><a name="stpa_156">That may be a way forward. I am not saying that it is the only solution, but we could debate it and discuss the level of spare capacity that is sufficient to provide parental choice. I am not against that. Spare capacity is necessary, but the question is how much. That should be the debate and the figures used may help that. Spare capacity costs council tax payers money and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southport said, council tax payers, the wider community and parents want to know that public resources are being efficiently managed. They want some guidelines on how many extra places they are being asked to pay for. Will the Minister tell us whether her Department has some guidelines in mind and whether it will publish some guidelines? If not, what is the Minister&#039;s estimate of the cost of a surplus place today? How much does an empty place in a secondary school or a primary school cost the taxpayer? Obviously, there are various assumptions about that. If she cannot give an answer to the question today, I hope that she will confirm that she will write to me with one, as the question is germane to this debate and to the debate that we will have during the next few weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para63"><a name="stpa_157">We have done a few sums. In 1996, the Audit Commission took an authoritative stab at an estimate in a document called &quot;Trading Places&quot;. If that figure is augmented by the extra amount that the Government have allocated per pupil, by the increase in surplus places and by inflation, it starts to approach &#163;600 per surplus place. That is a huge amount, given that surplus places are increasing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para64"><a name="stpa_158">Let me give an authoritative notion&#151;a feel&#151;for the number of surplus places. Again, I quote from the Audit Commission&#039;s submission to the Select Committee. It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;In 2004 there were nearly half a million surplus places in the primary sector.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para65"><a name="stpa_159">That is half a million at perhaps &#163;600 each. The report states that that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;represented over 11 per cent. of the total capacity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para66"><a name="stpa_160">Perhaps that is value for money in terms of parental choice, but let us at least have a debate about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para67"><a name="stpa_161">The Audit Commission also looks forward to what will happen. Worryingly, despite the increase in the birth rate in Dudley, North, the report states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Unless action is taken, two thirds of council areas will have over 10 per cent. surplus places by 2008&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<a name="60117h02_para71"><a name="stpa_165">The extra capacity will have a huge cost. Are the Government saying that they will fund local authorities and schools to meet that cost? I do not think so. Therefore, they ought at least to have a strategy. They ought to tell us today what they will do. I would like the Minister to tell us whether the Department for Education and Skills commissioned any research or reports on the issue from anybody, be it the Audit Commission or anyone else, this year, last year or the year before. If it has not, it has been negligent. If the Minister cannot answer the question today, I hope that she will write to me and to other Members with the information.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para72"><a name="stpa_166">There is a real issue about value for money and about the future of our schools. At present, we hear nothing from the Minister that suggests that the Government are at all on top of the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60117h02_spnew12"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : I suspect that many hon. Members who have spoken will disagree, when it comes to practical cases, on the most benign way of keeping surplus place figures down, but, surely, we are confronted with a Government strategy that is, in fact, likely to increase the problem&#151;not only not address it, but make it much worse.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60117h02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : My hon. Friend anticipates exactly what I was about to say. We can see a little of the future. The Government may say that their plans are not like those for the grant-maintained schools of the past, and they are right&#151;they are not identical. However, there are some lessons to be learned, as the grant-maintained school system was based on more independent decision-making by governing bodies and head teachers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para73"><a name="stpa_167">London had more than its fair share of grant-maintained schools, and what happened? In London, more than in any other region, there was a decline in planning for future places and a reduction in the spare capacity that was needed for youngsters. London has had more problems because of the Tory experiment with grant-maintained schools. Bizarrely, the Government have looked at London and said, &quot;Let us find a solution for the whole country based on London&#039;s problems. In fact, let us give the rest of the country the Tories&#039; solution for London and all the problems of London.&quot; That is bonkers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para74"><a name="stpa_168">My hon. Friend is right to say that we can debate the best way to manage the problem and how much surplus capacity we are prepared to pay for&#151;the right amount of money to put into maintaining some capacity for parental choice&#151;but we surely cannot think that the proposals in the White Paper are the way to deal with the issue. They are chaotic and non-strategic and would not involve parents in the way that the hon. Member for Dudley, North wishes.

<a name="60117h02_para75"><a name="stpa_169">Those who talk about parental choice as if it is the only thing that matters have some questions to answer. We may all want parents to be involved, but should that be the first-order issue when we are considering the management of schools? When parents do not choose choice because they want a good local school, should policy makers force choice down their throat or spend taxpayers&#039; money in other ways&#151;on smaller class sizes, on improving the supply of teachers and on improving the curriculum choice for young people? There are many reforms other than the ones on offer that would improve standards in our schools. There are many other ways of dealing with the surplus-place problem that is hitting English schools, and I hope that the Government, even at this late hour, will change their strategy.

<a name="60117h02_time4"><h5>11.56 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60117h02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Nick Gibb  (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</b>  (Con): I should like to start by congratulating the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) on securing this important debate. There is no more important issue in today&#039;s world than education, and all of us in this House who take an interest in education matters set out with the objective of improving the quality of education in our schools and raising standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para76"><a name="stpa_170">I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is always tragic when a local school is forced to close. It is deeply unsettling when rumours abound that a school is about to be closed. Falling school rolls over the years present real challenges to many local education authorities, as exemplified in the speech of the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin). As the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) said, 17 schools in Gateshead have 25 per cent. or more surplus places, and that is due to rise to some 26 schools by 2010. The parliamentary answer that the hon. Member for Southport received recently shows that, on average, 25 secondary schools have closed every year for the past five years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para77"><a name="stpa_171">The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) spoke eloquently about the problems caused by falling rolls, but I listened and waited in vain for his proposed solutions. He is surely not putting forward the proposition that no schools can ever close in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60117h02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right. I should have been more explicit about my party&#039;s solution. I believe that democratically accountable local authorities with a leadership role in their communities working with parents, schools and the Department is the way to manage the problem. That has been done in places such as Knowsley, where there are many education challenges. That authority is moving from 11 to eight secondary schools and taking the whole community with it. That is good local authority leadership, and that is what we should be promoting.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60117h02_spnew16"><b> Mr. Gibb </b> : I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s explanation, but such an approach is not mutually exclusive of parental choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para78"><a name="stpa_172">I listened carefully to the passionate defence of Ainsdale Hope high school by the hon. Member for Southport, who, clearly, is far better placed than most of us to know the truth about how good the school is. I do not question his judgment or his passion, but he said 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 209WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that parental opinion could often be influenced by transitory factors such as who is the headmaster. Issues such as the leadership of a school are not transitory matters. They are fundamental to the success and reputation of a school, and it is wrong to dismiss such factors as airily as he did.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60117h02_spnew17"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : I hope that I did not give that impression. The point is that there is a rotation of head teachers and we have observed in our own constituencies that the reputation of a school can hinge on its head teacher, even if they are there for a decade. We are talking about institutions in which millions of pounds are invested over many years&#151;several decades&#151;and if a school is needed in the community it should not go under simply because there is a switch of resources from one school to another, which may not be sustained.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60117h02_spnew18"><b> Mr. Gibb </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right, but that shows the paramount importance of governors in selecting heads. The issue becomes increasingly difficult when there is a massive shortage of potential heads, and the number of applicants to schools is very narrow in some instances. In general, parents get things right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para79"><a name="stpa_173">Parents to whom I have spoken about local schools have very well informed views. They may or may not take much notice of league tables or Ofsted reports. Some regard such information as irrelevant, but some regard it as very important and will read the website and pay close attention to the facts and figures. However, few parents, even those who scrutinise the website in detail, rely solely on such information. They base their views on years of local knowledge about the school. I am not talking about Ainsdale Hope high school, but more generally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para80"><a name="stpa_174">Issues such as the behaviour of pupils when they walk to and from the school, how smart they look, the number of incidents of poor behaviour reported in the local newspaper and the number of Oxbridge places that pupils gain are often an influence on the reputation of a school. Word of mouth, the general view of parents of pupils at a school and how happy they are with the quality of teaching, the level of discipline, the prevalence of bullying and the amount of homework that the children take home are all factors. I trust parents&#039; views, and if they dislike a school, I take the view that they are likely to be right. That is why the Conservative party supports the notion of parental choice in selecting a school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60117h02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that all the different factors that he listed can apply now and there should be no bar to parents reacting to them. However, the notion that everything should be decided by parents misleads people. The idea that parents can choose absolutely everything in their local education system is not true and cannot be. Is there not a danger that some of that rhetoric is not telling parents the full truth?
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60117h02_spnew20"><b> Mr. Gibb </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes very valid points, which I shall deal with in a moment.
</p>


<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 210WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
or eliminated is not of the real world. The hon. Gentleman attacks the concept of choice&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Gentleman is either saying that he will increase or reduce choice. Leaving aside the practical realities and considering the legal basis of allowing parents to have choice within what is available, if he is implying by his criticism that choice should be reduced, that is a huge mistake and wrong in principle.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60117h02_spnew21"><b> Mr. Davey </b> : I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has given me a chance to clarify. I am absolutely not saying that. Indeed, one of my concerns about the proposals in the White Paper to give schools control of admissions, which his party supports, is that it will reduce parental choice. In many ways, by opting for the approach that the Government are taking, those in his party have become the enemies of the parental choice that exists at the moment through a fair admissions system decided by local admission forums.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60117h02_spnew22"><b> Mr. Gibb </b> : I am often amused by the concept that increasing choice somehow reduces it, but we shall leave that aside for the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para82"><a name="stpa_176">In many cases, as the hon. Gentleman said, such choice is limited, given the shortage of places at good schools, and there are other practical realities that limit choice. However, that is not a reason to limit choice. It is a reason to do more to expand the number of places at good schools. The hon. Member for Southport is right to say that the situation is very different in rural areas, or in suburban parts of Britain outside London, where the reality is that choice is limited. Again, that is not a reason for limiting choice by law where it is possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para83"><a name="stpa_177">The fact that there are surplus places in an area is not a bad thing in itself. If every surplus place were to be driven out of the system, parental choice would be limited further still. We need a sizeable percentage of surplus places to oil the system to enable the choice mechanism to work, which is why, during the lead-up to the last election, we proposed allowing 10 per cent. of places to be surplus. As the hon. Member for Southport said, the Audit Commission has said that falling school rolls are likely to mean that 10 per cent. of places will be surplus. That carries a cost, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para84"><a name="stpa_178">The Schools Minister in a recent answer to a parliamentary question said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;Local authorities are responsible for planning school places in their areas. They have a duty to ensure that there are sufficient places to meet the needs of the local community and must also ensure that high quality education is provided in a cost-effective way.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19 December 2005; Vol. 440, c. 2425W.]</p>

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
meaning a complete eradication of all surplus places. There was a report in last week&#039;s <i>Southport Visiter</i>. Is that a weekly newspaper?

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para87"><a name="stpa_181">I am not sure what percentage that figure is of the total number of places, but if the drive behind Sefton&#039;s school closure plan is to drive out all surplus places, it is not an efficient way to marshal resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para88"><a name="stpa_182">For a long time, our party has claimed the existence of a surplus places rule, according to which a local authority would refuse to allow a popular school to expand on the grounds that there are surplus places in the area. I know from correspondence that the director of education in West Sussex council says precisely this, but the Government have consistently denied the existence of such a rule. In the five-year strategy published in 2004 it says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;There is no &#039;surplus places rule&#039; that prevents schools from expanding. All successful and popular schools may propose to expand, and we strongly support them in doing so where they believe they can sustain their quality.&quot;</p>

</ul>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para90"><a name="stpa_184">Such denials were blown out of the water in October last year when the Prime Minister said, in a speech on the White Paper given the day before it was published:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;In our schools, as I shall go on to describe, the system will finally be opened up to real parent power. All schools will be able to have Academy style freedoms. All schools will be able to take on external partners. No one will be able to veto parents starting new schools or new providers coming in, simply on the basis that there are local surplus places.&quot;</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;I am simply saying that you cannot say that good schools are unable to expand simply because you have got surplus places elsewhere when the surplus places elsewhere may be in a school that is not up to standard.&quot;</p>

<a name="60117h02_para92"><a name="stpa_186">So there we are. My party agrees with the Prime Minister, but I am less sure whether Labour Back Benchers agree with him.

If the net effect of that is that the local

</p>




<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60117h02_spnew26"><b> Mr. Gibb </b> : Of course the hon. Gentleman is right. We want more local schools delivering high-quality education. Parental choice is not the be-all and end-all; it is not the only mechanism for driving up standards. I am thinking of a range of other measures, taken by the local authority, the Department for Education and Skills and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. All those bodies have a role to play in trying to drive up standards, so that we have more good schools in more localities throughout Britain. Ultimately, however, parents should have a say, and if parents do not want to send their child to a school because they are worried about its reputation, standards and quality of teaching, they are perfectly entitled not to, and consequences follow from that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para94"><a name="stpa_188">The Opposition are concerned about facts in the National Audit Office report and we will do all that we can with the Government, or by opposing the Government, to ensure that the problem is tackled as soon as possible, because in this global world, where high values of education are vital, we can no longer allow 23 per cent. of our secondary schools to be regarded by Ofsted as under-performing.

We might consider today&#039;s occasion to be some of the opening skirmishes of the debate on the education White Paper, but it has been a thoroughly enjoyable and excellent debate. In the time available, I shall try to deal with as   many of the points raised by hon. Members as possible, but given that the debate was initiated by the hon.

We are all engaged as politicians in the game of trying to ensure that we improve standards for children; that children can, as they grow up, meet their full potential and that they have the best possible choices in life, which only a thoroughly good education can bring. By achieving that, they can perhaps overcome disadvantages that they may have in life. That is the core of all the policy thinking and all the interventions and speeches that we have heard today from hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber, so I am happy to acknowledge it.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
increases aimed at improving and assisting in the running of schools in his constituency. Since 1997, its funding has increased by &#163;1,270 per pupil in real terms, which is a 46 per cent. increase and is over the national average. In the current financial year, Sefton will receive a just over &#163;3,500 guaranteed unit of funding per pupil. We are having this debate about standards and organisation of schools in the context of increasing resource levels and of a debate about how best to turn that money into real value and excellent outcomes for as many children as possible.

Gentleman who called for the speech tell the Minister in advance what he does and does not want to hear. None the less, he will have to listen to a little of what he perhaps does not want to hear. There is no doubt that organisation of schools is a matter for local determination. That is just a matter of fact since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, and I for one, as a Minister in the Department for Education and Skills, am happy that I do not have to sit at my desk and try to work out which schools in the constituencies of each hon. Member in England ought to stay open and expand, or close. To be perfectly honest, if I had to do that, I would have no time to do anything else and I would almost certainly be one of the most unpopular people in the country, whether or not every decision that I had made was perfect.

He needs to ensure that he continues to press the council, as I am sure he will, to be as open, honest and transparent as possible, not only with him but with local parents, about the way in which that reorganisation should be pursued. If he is even disputing the facts about the birth rate, a lot more clearly needs to be done to ensure that there is a shared understanding locally of what the needs are in his constituency. However, I am sure that, like any hon. Member, he is perfectly capable of making that point to the relevant people who need it to be made to them, without too much assistance from me.

I attended for the whole of my secondary education one of Sefton&#039;s excellent local schools&#151;Formby high school&#151;so I have personal experience not of Ainsdale high school, but certainly of Sefton schools. That leads me to accept his assertion that it is a good local authority in respect of the way in which it carries out its duties to schools. Certainly, Ofsted reports do not indicate anything other than that, and it is grappling with this issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para101"><a name="stpa_195">The hon. Gentleman did not quite mention what has happened in terms of numbers at Ainsdale Hope. My understanding is that it has gone from having 628 pupils in January 2005, which meant that there were 171 surplus places in the school, to having 366 pupils this January, so it is clearly moving in the wrong direction in terms of parents sending their kids to that local school. I am happy to accept that the local authority has been doing what it can to support the school, not only by closing it as a community school and reopening it as a voluntary-aided school, but by putting investment into the site. For example, a learning centre has been placed, I believe, in a building on the site. It is not, perhaps, in the school itself, but it certainly makes that school a centre of all kinds of educational opportunities in the area. The hon. Gentleman will have more insight into the subject than me, but from the numbers it seems that local parents have not been convinced. We know from constituency experience that we can run into difficulties. If local people feel that the school will inevitably close, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as people move their children before the school closes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para102"><a name="stpa_196">There is no doubt that the local authority will have to handle the issue, as it seems determined to do.

We know that nationally the number of children in primary education is falling&#151;the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) made the point&#151;and that that impacts on secondary schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para103"><a name="stpa_197">In Sefton, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Southport, 15.2 per cent. of primary school places are surplus, which amounts to 3,911 places. Some 4.6 per cent. of secondary school places are surplus, which amounts to 1,013 places. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, it is not sensible to run a system without any surplus places; there have to be enough places to take account of people moving in and out, the needs of looked-after children, who may move from school to school, and people who move home between the usual rounds of admissions. We cannot be silly about that; there must be at least some surplus places. None the less, the point can be reached at which the inefficiency of a local authority operating at such a level means that action must be taken. If the level of surplus places is too high, it can represent a poor use of resources. Those resources could be used more effectively to support other schools in raising standards. In such problem cases, the local authority must take action.

Nor do we seem to disagree that if there is to be any choice, there must be some surplus and slack in the system to enable that choice to be made. I doubt that we would agree on the precise percentage, or that we would even have time for such a debate. I have no doubt that it will feature in our discussions about the White Paper and legislation arising from it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para104"><a name="stpa_198">The problem of surplus places was not created by the White Paper or by any policies introduced by the current Government. In any system, there must always be a question over what to do with surplus places. The problem did not suddenly appear with the White Paper; it is an issue with which every system must cope.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para105"><a name="stpa_199">With the Audit Commission, we have produced a web-based toolkit, of which hon. Members may be aware and with which they may be familiar. It offers a range of practical advice and guidance to local authorities facing such issues. We encourage imagination. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North suggested some imaginative ways of dealing with the issue, and he mentioned his local authority&#039;s need to close two schools. There are ways&#151;less brutal than school closure&#151;in which we can encourage the local education community to deal with such issues. However, I am not saying that school closures are not sometimes necessary.

<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60117h02_spnew29"><b> Mr. David Anderson </b> : The Minister has laid out exactly what we in Gateshead are trying to do. The options include extra community use and use by the health service. Reality clashes with parental choice, however. The parents do not want to see the schools close, and the only way around that is not to close them, and to reduce class sizes and provide a better education. That would be a win-win for everyone.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60117h02_spnew30"><b> Maria Eagle </b> : It is tremendously important that in such debates, all local implications are thoroughly discussed. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North will get back on to his council to be a bit more open. When there is a thorough local debate, local parents are not totally selfish, nor are they interested only in their school; they are interested in all local facilities. There are other ways forward, including amalgamation, federation and collaboration, and the extension of schools to include public service facilities, such as health facilities. They are local solutions that may be appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para106"><a name="stpa_200">I agree with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that parents are not daft. They, much more than somebody in Whitehall or in a council chamber, know what is best not only for their children but for their local community. It is important that parents are involved. Parents will not always be rational locally; they may sometimes do something that is not sensible. However, the essential arguments and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 216WH</b>

discussions must take place locally. Through the school   organisation committees and, eventually, the adjudicator, there is a mechanism for resolving any local disagreements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para107"><a name="stpa_201">The system is designed to attempt to ensure some kind of agreement&#151;unanimous, preferably&#151;among local stakeholders, so that such matters can be taken forward sensibly, without dictation by Whitehall, guided by good practice and toolkits on our website, of which people can make use in order to deal with the local situation in Sefton, Dudley, North or Blaydon.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60117h02_spnew31"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : I am very much in favour of the benign solutions and the consultation of which the Minister speaks, but in trying to anticipate what will befall the local authority, one factor is knowing precisely what it needs to do about children&#039;s centres and extended schools, and precisely when &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot;, for example, will come its way. Early indications can turn problematic situations into almost beneficial situations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60117h02_spnew32"><b> Maria Eagle </b> : I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Those decisions must be made with the maximum information, via the DFES, not only for the big, capital programmes such as &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot;, but for other public services, such as health or children&#039;s centres. It is not necessarily easy to obtain all the information when it is needed, but locally we must try to ensure the availability of as much information as possible in order to make the best possible decisions. I do not resile from the fact that those decisions ought to be made locally. The hon. Member for Southport did not want me to say that, but I have and it is now on the record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h02_para108"><a name="stpa_202">Surplus school places and falling primary rolls will form a key part of the debate about the White Paper. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked me several specific questions about the cost to a local authority of paying for its surplus places. He will not be surprised that I cannot give him a figure, because it varies and one might choose to use many different parameters in order to work it out. Statisticians get excited trying to work out such figures. Although I cannot respond specifically to his points, I am happy to drop him a line to deal with the points that we do not deal with today. There is no doubt that surplus places provide a way to ensure that schools can respond to the movement of pupils. Surplus places are not always 100 per cent. bad. It can become difficult if their level becomes too high in a particular area. I will write to the hon. Gentleman.

I welcome the Minister to the debate. Its subject is not his particular portfolio, but I am sure that it will be a quick and helpful learning curve on Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para0"><a name="stpa_203">I wish to thank Senait Petros who has become the co-ordinator for the all-party group on Sudan, her predecessor Sultana Begum and my predecessor, Hilton Dawson, for the work that he did on Sudan. He is much lamented. We make no apology for continuing to raise the issue in this place, especially Darfur, which is in a parlous state. I thank Christian Aid, Amnesty International and Oxfam, which have also helped to bring to our attention some of the issues on which I shall dwell.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para1"><a name="stpa_204">The humanitarian, security and political situations continue to deteriorate in Darfur. Atrocities happen daily. People are still dying of malnutrition and disease in large numbers and a new famine is feared. According to recent reports by the World Food Programme, the United Nations and the Coalition for International Justice, 3.5 million people are now hungry, 2.5 million people have been displaced due to violence and 400,000 people have died in Darfur. As      the security situation deteriorates&#151;I stress &quot;deteriorates&quot;&#151;humanitarian access is becoming worse. The international community is failing to protect civilians or to influence the Sudanese Government sufficiently to make sure that there is proper access.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para2"><a name="stpa_205">The breakdown of the peace process and the deterioration of the security situation in Darfur have led to worsening relationships between Chad and Sudan, and the rebellion has ramifications that go beyond Darfur into the east of the country and threaten the comprehensive peace agreement. I intend to refer to those issues, but with your permission, Mr. Conway, I   hope that the hon. Member for Buckingham will be able to speak after I have finished.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para3"><a name="stpa_206">The sanction report of the UN Security Council&#039;s committee on Sudan said that small arms and ammunition have increasingly been flowing to the anti-Government rebels from Chad, Eritrea and Libya in violation of the UN arms embargo. The UN appointed panel also accused the Government of Sudan of violating the embargo by moving arms into Darfur from elsewhere in the country arming the Arab militias and deploying additional attack helicopters. That is all well known; the simple fact is that it continues to this day.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para4"><a name="stpa_207">The report of the International Commission of Inquiry on 31 January highlighted the violation of human rights in Darfur.

Following that,

on 29 March the UN Security Council passed resolution 1591. In reply to my parliamentary written question on 12 January, it was good to hear the Minister for Trade, who speaks on Africa in the House, make a robust statement on behalf of my noble Friend Lord Triesman, in which he stated that the UK Government want the International Criminal Court to be able to investigate what has been going on in Darfur. It is lamentable that the Government of Sudan continue to block that and not recognise the ICC. My hon. Friend the Minister might want to cast some views on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para5"><a name="stpa_208">The Security Council has put in place an asset freeze and travel ban on belligerents. It does not seem to be working. What does my hon. Friend have to say about that? What will the United Kingdom Government do to pressurise the Government of Sudan to fulfil their obligation to identify, neutralise and disarm militia groups outside the formal state security forces under their influence, as demanded by the Security Council? What will they do to pressure all sides to abide by the   ceasefire and the security protocols, and the recommendation under resolution 1591 to widen the arms embargo? Clearly, the recommendation is not working. What are the Government doing to put pressure on the key nations of Chad, Eritrea and Libya to stop playing an unhelpful role in aspects of the conflict?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para6"><a name="stpa_209">The ceasefire and peace talks seem to be making rocky progress. Since July 2005, efforts to push forward the peace process have continued. However, a split within the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army/Movement has brought the talks to a standstill. Negotiations with the SPLA/M and the Justice and Equality Movement led eventually to the opening up of a joint position on behalf of the rebels. Given that the rebels have demanded the vice-presidency of Sudan and the return of territory that was removed from Darfur and incorporated into northern Sudan in the 1990s, such matters have been brought to an abrupt halt. I wonder what the UK Government are doing to provide capacity to the rebels but, more particularly, what pressure are they putting on the Government of Sudan to get the peace talks under way?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para7"><a name="stpa_210">I have received much evidence from Amnesty International of awful human rights abuses, such as rapes and sexual violence against women and girls. I have much evidence of illegal detentions, arrest and intimidation of civilians, forced returns of internally displaced persons and evidence of torture. The Sudanese Organisation Against Torture&#151;the wonderful organisation that we met when the hon. Member for Buckingham and I was last in Sudan&#151;comes forth daily with many lists of people who are being discriminated against and worse. In the west of Darfur, an even worse situation is growing. Again, what are the UK Government doing to put pressure on both the Chadian Government and the Sudanese Government to help resolve the problem?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para8"><a name="stpa_211">I shall move on to the wider scene in Sudan. As an all-party group, we have been desperately worried for the past two years that whatever is happening in Darfur can be played out in the east of the country. We met representatives of the Abuja Congress there and we continue to meet them here. They seem to be only a touch away from launching their own conflict, which would be a desperate situation. Matters are made worse

because of the closeness of Eritrea and Ethiopia, which are making their own warlike noises. It would be interesting to know what the UK Government are trying to do to bring some sanity into the situation.Under the comprehensive peace agreement, the SPLA/M must withdraw from eastern Sudan by 9 January 2006. There is no evidence that that has happened. What will the UK Government do to make that happen? The withdrawal is behind schedule and there is a risk that it could spark a full-scale conflict.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para9"><a name="stpa_212">I shall speak positively about the CPA towards the end of my remarks, but if it is to mean anything, it will have to bring peace to Darfur and stop war in the east. It is not only the Government of Sudan who must be brought to task to make sure that that is happening. Pressure must be put on the SPLM/A that will result in something better happening. As for the International Crisis Group, it is recommended that the UN should name a special envoy to do what Senator Danforth was doing several years ago. It needs a lead mediator who can speak to all the different parties. What are the UK Government doing to bring that forward?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60117h03_spnew1"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): The hon. Gentleman is making an excellent case and asking exactly the right questions. Does he wish to comment on the context of the UN mandate? We both went to see Lord Triesman to discuss the issue. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to comment on whether that might be strengthened, and if so, how? Are there sufficient AU troops in the area to enforce that sort of mandate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60117h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : The hon. Gentleman is percipient: I was about to mention the African Union and the support that we should be providing, starting with the point that the AU force is still not up to strength. I believe that it was demanding 7,700 peacekeepers; it said that that was how many it needed to be at least partly effective on the ground. What are we doing to help in that regard?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para10"><a name="stpa_213">I do not know what has been the outcome of the dispute over the failure of the Government of Sudan to allow in the armoured personnel carriers that the Canadian Government kindly offered. Are they still stuck somewhere in Khartoum, or have they now reached the place that they should be at? It would be interesting to get the definitive answer to that; there are rumours that they have now been released, but it would be good to hear what the Government have to say about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para11"><a name="stpa_214">How can we further bolster the AU? In the short term, there needs to be a push for support to the western part of Darfur, but the AU force may need to be strengthened further and linked with UN&#151;and, possibly, NATO&#151;forces because of logistical requirements. We might also need to put pressure not only on the Government of Sudan, but on the Government of China, who have not been helpful through the UN Security Council. I would like the Minister to comment on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para12"><a name="stpa_215">My last point relates to eastern Darfur. It is somewhat bizarre that there are suggestions that Sudan is being nominated for the chairmanship of the AU. Nothing ceases to amaze me, but in this time and place, with AU troops in that country to try to keep the peace there, it is surely not appropriate for the Government of Sudan to be chairing the AU, which is, in a sense, trying to scrutinise what they are doing.

<a name="60117h03_para13"><a name="stpa_216">I will finish on a more positive note, before allowing the hon. Member for Buckingham&#151;who is my good friend&#151;to say a few words. The comprehensive peace agreement is a wonderful achievement; no one wants to underestimate that. However, questions arise out of the fact that it appears that only $112 million out of the $4.5   billion that the donors promised has yet to be made available in the pot. That will lead both the   Government in Khartoum and the SPLM/A in the south seriously to question the will of the wider world to deliver on its promises in respect of the CPA. Although I welcome what the CPA is about overall, the proof will be in the eating, and it will be a bit disappointing if what has happened so far is evidence of an unwillingness on behalf of the western world in particular to put its money where its mouth is.

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60117h03_spnew3"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham)</b>  (Con): I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) for&#151;characteristically generously&#151;giving me this opportunity to contribute to the debate. It was a privilege to go with him to Sudan, including Darfur, in the summer of 2004, and I agree with everything that he has said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para14"><a name="stpa_217">I want specifically to pick up on the point that the hon. Gentleman made about Sudan&#039;s prospective chairmanship of the African Union. I cannot think of a single step that would be simultaneously more absurd and better guaranteed to undermine its reputation, and I very much hope that that is avoided.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para15"><a name="stpa_218">In Darfur, it is extremely difficult to establish with any precision the numbers of deaths&#151;as the Minister understands, and doubtless will himself proclaim. However, we can confidently say, without fear of exaggerating or of being contradicted, that death is still taking place in Darfur on a daily basis and on a significant scale&#151;death through violence, through disease and through malnutrition, and I want briefly to focus on two points. First, given the capacity and funding constraints experienced by the AU mission and the recognition by the mission itself of the need for a step change in tackling the violence in Darfur, would it not now make sense for the international community to go for a direct transfer to a UN mandate? That would allow for the AU force to be blue-helmeted, would make greater resources available, and would speed up deployment. That is my first and very specific challenge to the Minister.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para16"><a name="stpa_219">I will now make my second point, after which I will listen attentively and respectfully to the Minister&#039;s reply, and to anything else that might be said. The international community in the form of the United Nations has adopted the responsibility to protect. I do not want to sound pious about this matter. We in this Chamber know very well that there is a pervasive cynicism about politics and politicians. That is a recurrent theme in debates on many different subjects; that cynicism applies to politicians irrespective of whether we are operating on a domestic terrain or discussing international issues. If the responsibility to protect is not to be merely a pious piece of rhetoric designed to make those who have crafted it look and sound good, but is to be translated into practice for the betterment of the human condition in some of the most difficult and ravaged parts of the world, the time is now for that to happen in Darfur.

<a name="60117h03_para17"><a name="stpa_220">That is simply not happening at present; it is not true to say that we regard it as a great priority to tackle the savagery and the cocktail of barbarity that has been served up there, principally by the Government of Sudan, in recent years. There has been what I would describe as a holding operation by the AU&#151;a new institution that is genuinely committed and that is doing its best with pathetic resources and with delivery on the promises of increased resources being very slow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para18"><a name="stpa_221">My anxiety is that we are in danger of becoming desensitised to death on a dramatic scale; it is almost as though the number, range and seriousness of conflicts around the world are causing us to be numbed by the seeming inevitability of it all. I know that we cannot change everything overnight, but we have a duty to act. I would like the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Minister to be championing the cause for a UN mandate and for a much greater intensity of activity on a daily basis. That is what I want to hear about from the Minister, and I shall now resume my place in the expectation that I might.

In recent days in some of our newspapers, all-party groups have not received the most benign coverage, but the sort of debate that we have had this morning evidences both the importance of the work that this particular all-party group has undertaken, and the expertise and commitment that Members bring to this area of concern. I share with Members who have spoken profound concerns about the grave situation in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan, about the problems in neighbouring Chad and the risks that they pose to Sudan, and about the problems in the east of the country and the slow progress towards a peace agreement in Abuja.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para19"><a name="stpa_222">My hon. Friend and the hon.

I therefore hope that I will have Members&#039; forbearance as I seek to make rapid progress in respect of remarks that I know will be of direct interest to some of them, and then in answering each of the specific questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para20"><a name="stpa_223">The problems under discussion are of huge dimensions with terrible consequences for the people of    Sudan. The situation is extremely serious. My ministerial colleagues and I&#151;and, indeed, the British Government&#150;&#150;are committed to a Sudan that is peaceful, democratic and prosperous and that respects human rights and the rule of law, a Sudan whose people share equally in their nation&#039;s future prosperity and that   is an active and constructive member of the international community. That cannot be achieved until Sudan accepts and implements peace. Of course, the most immediate threat to Sudan&#039;s security comes from Darfur. We need to ensure also that the comprehensive peace agreement of which my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud spoke is fully implemented. There is a further threat in the east from ongoing conflict; that was also addressed in our debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para21"><a name="stpa_224">Against the backdrop of this serious situation, progress has been made. It is worth taking stock of some of the main points. The international community has mobilised the largest humanitarian operation in the world in Darfur, feeding and providing for 3.4 million people. The humanitarian situation has improved significantly: the mortality rate is down and malnutrition rates have almost halved since last year. The United Kingdom is the second biggest national donor to Darfur, providing &#163;75 million this year alone.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para22"><a name="stpa_225">The African Union monitoring force has established an increasingly effective presence, and has improved security and reduced human rights abuses where it operates. As a result of international pressure, the Government of Sudan have withdrawn their Antonov bombers from Darfur and allowed in 105 Canadian-supplied armoured personnel carriers for the AU mission in Sudan. There is now a peace process&#151;the Abuja talks to which I referred&#151;which offers the possibility of a political settlement to the conflict. The referral of the situation to the International Criminal Court sends a strong signal to the world at large that there will be no impunity for those guilty of grave human rights abuses in that conflict.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para23"><a name="stpa_226">Clearly there has not been enough progress, and in some areas there has been a deterioration. The old guard in Khartoum has still not done enough to rein in the forces and their proxies in Darfur, nor has it taken serious steps to punish those guilty of human rights abuses. In Darfur, security has deteriorated. The sheer numbers of people killed or injured through violence are shocking and abhorrent to our Government. The situation is becoming more complex, with the two rebel movements fighting each other. The AU force is still relatively weak and is facing a funding crisis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para24"><a name="stpa_227">I very much regret that AMIS&#151;the African mission in Sudan&#151;has suffered fatalities. I join my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and my noble Friend Lord Triesman in their condemnation as wholly unacceptable the killing of a Senegalese member of AMIS on 6 January. AMIS was originally conceived of as a smaller, short-term operation. Darfur will need a peace- support operation of increasing complexity for several more years, and the recent assessment mission for AMIS recommended that that would be best done by an international force. In principle, the AU supports handing over AMIS to the UN. That makes sense: it would put the funding and logistics on a surer footing and would allow the AU to focus on the longer-term priority of developing its own peacekeeping capacity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para25"><a name="stpa_228">Perhaps the greatest concern is the recent fighting in Chad; it risks spilling over into Darfur. Both Chadian and Sudanese rebels are active in Darfur. There is a risk of a military build-up by both countries on both sides of their borders. All parties need to exercise restraint, to demonstrate their commitment to peace in Darfur, and to seek a solution through negotiation, not violence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para26"><a name="stpa_229">I now turn to the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud and, first, to the role of the International Criminal Court and the progress made there.

On 13 December, the prosecutor briefed the United Nations Security Council, noting that the office had

made good progress in the investigation&#039;s first phase, and that the next phase would involve seeking further assistance and co-operation from the Government of Sudan. Also on 13 December, Sudan&#039;s Justice Minister said that Sudan would not allow investigators from the ICC into Darfur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para27"><a name="stpa_230">My noble Friend Lord Triesman released a statement highlighting our concern and noting that we expect the Government of Sudan to comply with the wishes of the international community as set out in UN Security Council resolution 1593 and to co-operate fully with the ICC, should it decide to visit Darfur. Our ambassador in   Khartoum also raised the matter directly with the    vice-president of Sudan on 23 December. We have consistently made it clear that the Sudanese must co-operate with the ICC. The ICC visited Sudan recently, and the Government of National Unity set up an intergovernmental committee to receive them.

<a name="60117h03_para28"><a name="stpa_231">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud also raised the issue of Chad. We are obviously concerned about its current instability, and the tensions between it and Sudan. We are calling on both sides to rein in their troops and exercise restraint. Our ambassador in Khartoum raised those points with the Sudanese Foreign Minister on 7 January. Chad is host to 200,000 Darfurian refugees, who are in 10 camps located along the eastern frontier with Darfur. We are working closely with the international community to ensure that all contingencies have been prepared for. This year, the United Kingdom   provided &#163;5 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and non-governmental organisations delivering life-saving medical assistance and water supplies. Support for the humanitarian response will continue in Chad during 2006 as part of our response to the problems in Darfur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para29"><a name="stpa_232">In relation to the comprehensive peace agreement and the UK Government&#039;s support, as part of our substantial development programme the UK is providing &#163;380,000    to support a number of key national commissions&#151;on the judicial service, on the civil service, on human rights, on land, fiscal and financial monitoring and allocation, and on petroleum. The UK has already provided experts for the Abyei boundary commission and the constitutional review commission. In relation to the International Crisis Group&#039;s request for a high-level UN special envoy, I assure hon. Members that we have full confidence in the United Nations Secretary-General&#039;s current special representative, Mr. Jan Pronk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para30"><a name="stpa_233">I was asked what information we had on the location of the armoured personnel carriers. All 105 APCs have been delivered and are being deployed across Darfur. During the EU troika visit in October, Lord Triesman urged the Government of Sudan to ensure that equipment such as the Canadian APCs were allowed quickly into Darfur.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para31"><a name="stpa_234">On the regional players&#151;an issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud raised&#151;there is an important role for African countries in addressing the problems of Darfur. Of course, the AU is heavily involved, as I have said. Alan Goulty, the United Kingdom&#039;s special representative for Darfur, recently visited Tripoli for talks with the Libyan Government, and he plans to travel to Eritrea for talks with its

Government shortly. I assure hon. Members that we recognise the importance of the regional players in the conflict.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para32"><a name="stpa_235">On support for the southern Government, we are providing them with &#163;2 million for rapid technical assistance. Addressing that new Government&#039;s considerable capacity constraints is, of course, a priority for us, so we will provide short-term advice on a flexible and responsive basis to fill the critical needs identified. In relation to the east of Sudan, on 11 January a militia allied to the Sudanese armed forces entered the eastern town of Hamesh Koreb and occupied positions held by the eastern front. The UN mission in Sudan&#151;the UN force responsible for monitoring the comprehensive peace agreement&#151;has sent a monitoring team to the area. Its initial assessment is that the incident was less significant than initial media reports claim. Our embassy in Khartoum is monitoring the situation closely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para33"><a name="stpa_236">The timetable for the withdrawal of the Sudan People&#039;s Liberation Army from eastern Sudan has been extended for one month by the joint defence board, which may reconsider the time scale once again before the deadline of 9 February. That is provided for under the terms of the comprehensive peace agreement, and we welcome that party&#039;s efforts to ensure that the CPA actually works.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para34"><a name="stpa_237">On the point raised by the hon. Member for Buckingham of the Sudanese candidacy for the presidency of the African Union, it is of course for the AU member Governments to decide who the president of the AU should be. However, it would be difficult for the AU to maintain its credibility in Darfur, both in terms of its role in the Abuja talks and in relation to AMIS, if one of the parties to the conflict held the presidency. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that I do not wish to say anything further at this stage, not least given the potential for the views of the British Government to become a factor in the discussions under way in the AU, in a way that might not help us to meet the hon. Gentleman&#039;s objectives. However, I assure him that I have listened carefully to the points that he made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para35"><a name="stpa_238">Although the Abuja talks that I mentioned are making some progress, there is still a long way to go. In particular, the rebel movements are still holding too rigidly to maximalist positions on issues relating to power-sharing and are not engaging fully on issues of security. The Government of Sudan could do more to engage the movements and break the impasse. Africans and non-Africans alike need to keep up the pressure on both sides to negotiate flexibly and with a much greater sense of urgency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para36"><a name="stpa_239">The continued problems in the east are also a concern for security in Sudan. The recent increase in attention paid to them is welcome, as are the recent announcements that the eastern front and the Government of Sudan are to meet under Libyan auspices to explore the possibility of a negotiated solution, possibly as early as today. If international observers are invited, the United Kingdom will of course attend. It has already played an important role, providing technical assistance to the eastern front to help it to prepare for peace talks. The international

community needs to co-ordinate its efforts to ensure that there are viable solutions to the humanitarian problems of eastern Sudan as well as to security problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h03_para37"><a name="stpa_240">The UK will continue to play a leading role on Darfur. We are vocal in pressing the Sudanese Government to provide security to their own people and to support the AU in Darfur. Within the UN and the EU, we have also worked to maintain strong international pressure&#151;

<a name="time_14">
<a name="60117h04_time0"><h5>1 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60117h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Bone  (Wellingborough)</b>  (Con): It is a particular pleasure, Mr. Conway, to serve for the first time in a debate under your chairmanship. I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me the opportunity for a debate on what is a very important issue for pensioners in my constituency, the Minister for attending the debate and his Department for its kind inquiries prior to it. I also welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), whose constituency neighbours mine and who also has issues and concerns about pensioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para0"><a name="stpa_241">Wellingborough is a constituency in the east midlands with a mix of urban and rural areas. More than one eighth of the adult population is retired, and many worked in the shoe and boot industry prior to their retirement. The constituency could not be considered a high-income area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para1"><a name="stpa_242">After the general election of 2001, I felt that many politicians of all political parties had become arrogant and out-of-touch. They were more than happy to preach to people, but were not prepared to listen. So I founded the &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushton&quot; campaign, which aimed to seek the views of local people, groups and organisations and campaign for change on their behalf. I listened to local people at every opportunity&#151;through surveys and public meetings, and when I visited residents. People were crying out for someone to listen to their views and concerns and do something about them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para2"><a name="stpa_243">As part of my listening campaign, I was approached by a Mr. Martin Sterrow, a local pensioner who had never before been involved in any political activity. He had become outraged that year after year the small rise in his state pension had been swallowed up by massive increases in council tax. Mr. Sterrow approached me and his local councillor, Councillor Malcolm Waters, to arrange a public meeting. I was more than happy to do that as part of my listening campaign, but my experience of public meetings had been that very few people bothered to turn up. However, there must have been 100 people at Mr. Sterrow&#039;s public meeting, and there was real outrage from the pensioners who attended; some of them were prepared even to go to prison rather than have to pay the enormous increases in their council taxes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para3"><a name="stpa_244">They were concerned that their pension incomes were in decline in real terms, and made it clear that the listening campaign needed to take on board two issues. The first was the ever-increasing council tax with its double-digit increases year after year. They wanted those increases to be controlled. The second was the lack of a decent state pension, and they were adamant that the link between state pensions and earnings should be restored to give pensioners dignity and respect in their old age.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para4"><a name="stpa_245">These people had worked hard all their lives, had not relied on the state and had saved through the years, putting money aside so that they could live comfortably during retirement. However, instead of that, they were being crippled by the amount of tax that they had to pay&#151;first on their pensions, secondly through stealth taxes and thirdly through their council tax.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 227WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para5"><a name="stpa_246">After the public meeting, Mr. Sterrow agreed to organise a petition asking the Government to restore the link between the state pension and earnings and to change how local authorities were funded to ensure that excessive year-on-year rises in council tax would not swallow up the much smaller percentage rises in the state pension. Mr. Sterrow and one or two other pensioners went from door to door throughout Wellingborough gathering signatures for the petition. They received a huge amount of support from local people and gathered more than 200 signatures. I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Sterrow&#039;s work and his raising of a very important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para6"><a name="stpa_247">As part of my listening campaign, I organised a second public meeting for concerned residents to voice their views to local borough councillors and county councillors, including the leader of Wellingborough council. My hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) was present to accept the petition and take it to Westminster to update the shadow Cabinet on the Wellingborough pensioners&#039; campaign.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para7"><a name="stpa_248">That campaign took place in 2002 and 2003 and highlighted the problems local pensioners face long before the issue of pensioners and council tax became the important national issue that it is today. The listening survey, which regularly goes out to Wellingborough residents, highlighted the issue very early on, when pensions and council tax came top of local concerns. I have to say that I asked for the tallies to be recounted, because at that time I did not believe that pensions and council tax were the top local concern. It turned out that they were.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para8"><a name="stpa_249">I am more than aware that the problem is not confined to my constituency, and that pensioners nationwide have been forced into hardship through inflation-busting council tax rises swallowing up very    small rises in the state pension. However, Wellingborough has seen the biggest rise in council tax since council tax was brought in. Pensioners in my constituency have been hit the hardest and are crying out for a change in the method of local government funding so that it does not penalise those on fixed incomes. I am assured by Mr. Sterrow that on occasion, the rise in his council tax bill was higher than the rise in his state pension.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="60117h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms) </b> : I am listening carefully to the points being made by the hon. Gentleman. I was not clear about the date of that very large council tax increase. Will he say what party controls Wellingborough council? This is a matter of local financial management as well as of Government funding.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60117h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bone </b> : I should make it clear that at the time, the    local council and county council were Labour-controlled. However, I am not trying to make a party-political issue of that, because the county council and borough council were working within the difficulties that they had. Mr. Sterrow produced what I would call a rate bill and showed that in one particular year, the council tax increase was higher than the increase in his pension. That was surprising, although we bear in mind that we have seen the highest council tax increases in the country.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para9"><a name="stpa_250">In the Chancellor&#039;s 2005 Budget, the Government announced that pensioner households with residents over the age of 65 would receive a one-off &#163;200 payment towards their council tax as long as they did not receive the guaranteed element of pension credit. They would also receive the annual winter fuel payment, and then    there would be the pension credit&#151;a hugely complicated system in which pensioners have to fill in numerous forms and give highly personal financial information to Government pen-pushers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para10"><a name="stpa_251">Pensioners are unsure about what they are and are not entitled to; one could not make the system more complicated even if one wanted to. To be administered, the system has to employ thousands of staff, all at a cost to the taxpayer. It now employs snoopers to cold-call pensioners to ask over the telephone or at the doorstep for details of their incomes. That is a most disturbing development. When will the Government understand that many pensioners do not want to tell them about their personal circumstances?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para11"><a name="stpa_252">A pensioner recently contacted me because someone from the Government was coming to his house to ask about his income and other circumstances, and I    attended the meeting with the pensioner. The Government official turned up on the doorstep and presented an identity card not much bigger than a business card&#151;most pensioners would have had difficulty in reading it. The official then started asking questions about the pensioner&#039;s income, savings and medical circumstances, and after all that told him that he was not entitled to any extra money. When I asked him, the official told me that he had made very many visits but that very few pension credits had been signed up&#151;so there is much intrusion for little reward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para12"><a name="stpa_253">That method of going to people&#039;s homes to ask them personal questions epitomises this Government&#039;s Big Brother obsession. Their need to micro-manage and control everything has hit pensioners the hardest. Pensioners have to go through the indignity of means-testing, filling out a long and complicated form, to claim back what they have spent years putting in. It is, after all, their money&#151;they have contributed to their national insurance stamp for years&#151;and they should get a decent pension as an automatic right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para13"><a name="stpa_254">I did not enter politics 30 years ago so that, in a matter of a few years, 75 per cent. of our pensioners will have to fill out forms to get a decent pension. The pension is their right; pensioners have the right to retire with dignity and to enjoy the last years of their lives without the hassle of Government bureaucracy and intrusion. I have seen elderly pensioners who have paid taxes and national insurance all their working lives, and who continue to pay tax on their pensions, handing over &#163;10 and &#163;20 notes to pay for private operations because they are not able to get them done quickly enough on the NHS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para14"><a name="stpa_255">The Government are failing our pensioners. People have retired, applied for their state pension and given their bank details with the presumption that the payment would automatically be credited each month. In one instance, a man had asked for his pension to be paid into his bank account. He did not look at his account in detail until a year later, when he found that he had received no state pension at all. When he contacted the Pension Service he was told to make a claim, although he could not receive all the pension 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 229WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
owed to him since he retired because he had claimed it too late, even though his original claim was made on the day he retired and the Pension Service had misplaced it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60117h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): As the neighbouring Member of Parliament, I want to put on   record how much local people appreciate my hon.   Friend&#039;s interest in, and commitment to, his constituency concerns. On the last point that he made, I   had a similar case in my constituency. An error had been made in the calculation of a constituent&#039;s pension entitlement and the Pension Service refused to refund all of the money. Will the Minister give us some encouragement that he will examine the rules, to ascertain whether appropriate reimbursement could be made more speedily, and in full, in future?
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60117h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bone </b> : The situation is extremely strange. Where someone has paid into a pension all their life through their taxes, and then, because of an administrative error, they do not receive it, surely the amount should be backdated to them. That is common sense and fair play.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para15"><a name="stpa_256">We are talking not about the rich and the better off, but about those who have paid into the state all their working lives, worked hard and saved a little for their retirement. Such people have been failed by this Government. My suggestion is that we give back dignity and respect to our pensioners. They have given so much to this country during their lives and deserve to spend their retirement comfortably, and to have dignity and respect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para16"><a name="stpa_257">We need just one system: one proper, decent state pension for all, regardless of how rich or poor people are. We should give pensioners one decent pension, and should scrap the pension credit, means-testing, the winter fuel allowance and living expenses. One proper, decent pension is needed so that pensioners can decide how to spend their money. It is not up to the Government to dictate how much money should go on what, and when and where it should go on it. Pensioners are not stupid; they know best how to spend their own money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para17"><a name="stpa_258">The Government might claim that my suggestion is just too expensive, but that is just an excuse. It is not because they cannot introduce a proper state pension, but because they will not do so. Savings can be made in hundreds of different areas. There are, for example, the millions of pounds currently left in the Government&#039;s coffers of unclaimed pension credit. So much remains that the Government need to employ snoopers and to spend millions on advertising campaigns. How can the pension credit system be working if so much money is not being claimed? It is not only a lack of awareness that prevents pensioners from applying, but the complex forms and the fact that pensioners are asked to disclose so much personal information. By far the most important reason is that pensioners hate the indignity of means-testing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para18"><a name="stpa_259">Millions of pounds are left in the Government coffers and thousands of staff are employed to administer the state pension, pension credit, winter fuel allowance and pensioners&#039; living expenses. If there were just one system with one set of administrative staff, the financial savings 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 230WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would be huge. The Government might still give the excuse that one comprehensive pension system would be financially unviable, but what about all the money that they waste?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para19"><a name="stpa_260">As a cricketer, I must congratulate the Government on reaching a century. Unfortunately, it is not a century of which they should be too proud. By my calculation, since 1997, under this Government, British taxpayers have paid &#163;100 billion to the European Union. If just a fraction of that had been spent on British pensioners rather than on French farmers, we would not be having this debate. Assuming that the Government continue to be too cowardly to stand up for British interests in Europe, there are plenty of other places from which money could pay for a decent income for pensioners. What about the enormous amount of money that the Government waste each year in Britain?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para20"><a name="stpa_261">The TaxPayers Alliance is about to publish a report stating that the Government waste &#163;80 billion a year. On what do they waste that? Some &#163;225,000 was spent on a scheme to advise people not to wear ill-fitting slippers. Some &#163;40,000 was spent on coming up with a 46-word definition relating to patients&#039; experience of the national health service. That works out at roughly at &#163;1,000 a word. The Home Office has employed 142 consultants at a cost of &#163;74 million. My favourite example is the &#163;10,000 being spent by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on examining whether fire engines should remain red.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para21"><a name="stpa_262">Let us have no rot from the Minister that the Government could not afford to pay pensioners a decent pension without means-testing. They choose not to do so, because they want to control everyone and to know everything about everyone. Most importantly, the Government believe that they know best. I urge them to trust our pensioners, to give them a decent pension and to give pensioners and the other people in Wellingborough what they deserve.
</p>


<a name="time_15">
<a name="60117h04_time1"><h5>1.17 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60117h04_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms) </b> : I welcome the opportunity to air the important matters on which this debate touches. It is refreshing to hear some good old-fashioned Conservative tub thumping from the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), at a time when his party is moving in the opposite direction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para22"><a name="stpa_263">Over the past couple of decades pensioner incomes have risen almost twice as fast as earnings; between 1996&#150;97 and 2003&#150;04 pensioner incomes increased by about 21 per cent. compared with 13 per cent. for earnings. In the 1980s, the big increase in average pensioner incomes was mainly driven by increases in private pensions. That was excellent for those with an occupational pension, but not everyone was included. The result was that a large minority were left behind by the general improvement in pensioner incomes. Between 1979 and 1997 the income of the most well-off fifth of pensioners grew roughly twice as fast as that of the least well-off fifth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para23"><a name="stpa_264">In 1997, we were left with many pensioners, particularly older women, on desperately low incomes. There were hundreds of thousands of single pensioners in 1997 whose total income, means-tested through income support, was &#163;69 a week. Tackling that dreadful 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 231WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
legacy was our No. 1 priority when we were elected. We needed to boost the incomes of the least well-off pensioners. That was done first through the introduction of the minimum income guarantee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para24"><a name="stpa_265">In 2003, that was followed by the successful introduction of pension credit, which focuses help on the least well-off through its guarantee&#151;currently &#163;109   a week for a single pensioner rather than the &#163;69 of just eight years ago. That level is being uprated in line with earnings and will rise to &#163;114 from April. In addition, the pension credit provides a reward for those who have managed to save a modest amount towards their retirement income&#151;income which was deducted pound for pound under the old income support regime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para25"><a name="stpa_266">Currently, some 2.7 million households in the country benefit through pension credit. In Wellingborough, more than 6,000 individuals in some 4,900 households receive pension credit; the average weekly payment is &#163;39. Abolishing pension credit as the hon. Gentleman suggests&#151;his position is rather different from his party&#039;s&#150;&#150;would leave every one of    those 6,000 Wellingborough residents worse off. Pension credit is therefore having an immense impact in Wellingborough and throughout the country, and it    is particularly helping women&#151;including the 3,200 women who receive it in Wellingborough&#151;to improve their retirement incomes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para26"><a name="stpa_267">Among the other improvements that have helped are winter fuel payments. This morning, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has been spelling out how the &#163;300 million that he announced in December will be used to improve heating and insulation for pensioners. There have also been above-inflation increases in the basic state pension, the level of which has increased by 8 per cent. in real terms since 1997. Under the Conservative Government, of course, there was no real increase for many years. There are also free television licences for over-75s. The hon. Gentleman wants all those things scrapped, but if he goes to meetings such as those that he described, he will find that those who have benefited from that extra help, including the winter fuel payments, very much appreciate it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para27"><a name="stpa_268">The result of all that has been a dramatic rise in pensioner incomes and, in particular, a proportionately much larger increase in the incomes of the least well-off pensioners. Pension credit and the other measures that we have implemented since 1997 mean that pensioners are &#163;19 a week better off on average than if we had increased the state pension in line with earnings since 1997 and left other things unchanged. The least well-off third of pensioners are &#163;30 a week better off. That is a remarkably effective response to the problem of pensioner poverty that existed in 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para28"><a name="stpa_269">I am certainly aware of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman voiced about council taxes, which are felt by many, and particularly by those on low incomes. We have taken action to address those concerns. Less well-off pensioners who face increases in their bills can continue to get help through council tax benefit. In addition this year, households with somebody aged 65 or over who does not receive the guarantee element of pension credit&#151;pensioner households that pay at least some council tax&#151;are receiving &#163;200.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para29"><a name="stpa_270">Of course, central Government do not set the level of council tax, although we have invested substantial amounts to ensure that local authorities have sufficient 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 232WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
resources. Since 1997, total grant to local authorities has increased by a third in real terms . We have also added an extra &#163;408 million in formula grant above what is in    the published plans for local government, plus &#163;200   million in unfenced specific grants. Given that substantial investment, as well as the scope for efficiency improvements, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman is urging his local authority to make, there is no excuse for excessive council tax rises. In fact, 2005&#150;06 saw the lowest average council tax increase in more than a decade. My understanding is that the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local authority is now Conservative controlled&#151;indeed, I can confirm that that is now the case, although the hon. Gentleman was a little coy about making that point in his speech. However, I hope that he is pressing his authority to improve efficiency in its organisation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60117h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bone </b> : I hope that the Minister will make it clear that Wellingborough council, which is now Conservative controlled, is rated as excellent by the Government. I hope also that he will deal with the crux of my comments. I hear what he says about all those freebies, but do the Government object in principle to giving everyone a decent pension and getting rid of all those funny little bits?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60117h04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms </b> : The point that I am making to the hon. Gentleman is that we have managed to break the historic link between old age and poverty through the policies that I have described. In the past, people in retirement were almost invariably significantly more likely than those in work to be poor relative to others, but that is no longer the case, because of the changes that I described. Andrew Dilnot, the former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has said&#151;there is a good deal of substance to his point&#151;that the virtual eradication of abject pensioner poverty is the most significant of all the major social changes since 1997, and we must certainly not put it into reverse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para30"><a name="stpa_271">The hon. Gentleman mentioned pension credit take-up, but I was disappointed by his rather disparaging comments about the staff of the Pension Service, who work hard to ensure that people can take up the benefit due to them. I can give him the recent example of a pensioner couple in Northamptonshire who were helped during a visit to complete a pension credit application. They received not only pension credit, which, in their case, was worth &#163;106 a week in backdated arrears of more than &#163;1,000, but an increased award of attendance allowance, plus a full council tax rebate. If we are to ensure that people receive the benefit to which they are entitled, we need to work hard. Such visits are extremely effective in helping people to obtain what Parliament has decided is their due.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para31"><a name="stpa_272">The Pension Service is working with the public, private and voluntary sectors to ensure that everyone has access to the help to which they are entitled and to the services that they need to stay well and lead independent lives. If a local authority representative is present during those visits, or the person doing the visiting works with the local authority, they can ensure that people receive the help to which they are entitled from the local social services department. There are more than 70 joint teams, in which local service staff, local authority staff and, in some cases, voluntary sector

<br>&nbsp;<br>
staff work together in a joined-up approach, and we are seeing a great array of benefits and improvements as a result.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para32"><a name="stpa_273">The disability and carers&#039; service is taking steps to improve the receipt of disability benefits, too. In some instances, that requires it to obtain information about people&#039;s circumstances, and rightly so. That is part and parcel of ensuring that people receive their due and maximise their income in retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para33"><a name="stpa_274">The pressing problems of inadequate incomes that faced us in 1997 have been effectively addressed. There is certainly more to do, but we have seen substantial improvements, which have given us a sound foundation on which to build an enduring pensions settlement for the UK&#151;one that can handle the dramatic increases in life expectancy that we have seen over the past 25 years and which seem to be set to continue. The improvements that we have introduced benefit us all, and I hope that that pensions settlement will be based on as broad a consensus as possible between the parties throughout the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para34"><a name="stpa_275">There is certainly more to be done, which is why we asked Lord Turner and the members of the Pensions Commission to produce their report, which was published last November. In it, they called for a national debate, and we shall undertake a major consultation exercise in the coming months to engage with the public and with everyone who has an interest in the issue. We shall want ideas and proposals from political parties, employers, trade unions, local authorities and everyone with an interest in the future of our pensions system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para35"><a name="stpa_276">The hon. Gentleman argued for an earnings link in the basic state pension, and that is, of course, one of the proposals in the Pensions Commission report, along with a pretty comprehensive package of changes. We shall want to explore those ideas thoroughly in debate in the House and in the country and to examine the commission&#039;s proposals for reform in detail. We want to debate them and test them against principles of reform to give people every chance to consider the options and to build the broad consensus that we believe is crucial to securing the long-term confidence that we need. I have asked the commission to continue its involvement in the debate over the next few months, as we move from diagnosis and analysis to proposition and decision. I    want the debate to involve every section of our community as we work towards the publication of a White Paper in the spring.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h04_para36"><a name="stpa_277">We have seen substantial improvements in pensioner incomes over the past eight years, and particularly large increases in the incomes of those who were the least well-off and who needed help most urgently. I can tell the hon. Gentleman with confidence that that was the right thing to do. In 1997, far too many people had a tiny weekly income of &#163;69. The priority was to increase that. We have done so effectively through pension credit, and it is important that we do not go backwards.

<a name="time_16">
<a name="60117h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60117h05_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ashok Kumar  (Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for having granted me this debate, which I have been trying to get off the ground for nearly a year, on and off.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para0"><a name="stpa_278">The subject is extremely important to my constituents who were formerly factory workers employed by Texon UK, and who are deferred members of an insolvent pension scheme run by their former employer. I know that the Minister is aware of the issue, as there has been much correspondence between me and his office on the matter during the past year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para1"><a name="stpa_279">My constituents were made redundant 10 years ago, when Texon UK embarked on the job-cutting exercise that was a precursor to its going into receivership. Texon, once called United Shoe Machinery, had been a local employer for many years, serving the shoe-making industry. Thankfully, the factory, located on the Skelton industrial estate in the East Cleveland area of my constituency, still operates following a management buy-out, but with a much reduced workforce. Nevertheless, 120 jobs are important and I wish the company every success in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para2"><a name="stpa_280">That, however, will not alter the scale of the problem faced by my constituents. They were unhappy about the redundancies, but they accepted them, because they felt that they had the reassurance of a pension from the company pension scheme when they reached retirement age. However, that was not to be&#151;hence this debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para3"><a name="stpa_281">I shall focus on two connected issues. My first concern is the financial arrangements made within the company, at the time owned by Texon, and my second what appear to be grave limitations in the new financial assistance scheme for deferred occupational pensioners. The sorry saga began when USM Texon was taken over by a private equity company, Apax, which made significant changes to the company pension scheme. A new USM pension plan was set up and 279 machinery workers were transferred into it. However, a transfer payment to cover these liabilities was made only in September 2000 when a further 318 deferred pensioners and 360 existing pensioners were moved into the new USM plan. That left several hundred people in the old Texon scheme, a number whom were my constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para4"><a name="stpa_282">The transfer of this second tranche of members was not made until a few weeks before the company went into receivership in October 2000. Once the company ceased trading it was obvious that the pension scheme would be under threat. The threat became reality when wind-up proceedings were lodged because the scheme had insufficient funds to meet its pension liabilities. At   that time the scheme had an estimated deficit of some &#163;30 million. Under winding-up rules, existing pensioners were first in the list for a payout, so 360 old USM pensioners received the bulk of their expected benefits, but the remaining 544 USM members&#151;including those of my constituents who are deferred pensioners&#151;have lost their pensions and any right to contributions they had made to the scheme. The problem was made worse when the Texon scheme went bust in April 2004 with a deficit of &#163;20 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para5"><a name="stpa_283">My first concern is, therefore, whether the former employers concerned have acted in good faith. As I said, the pension scheme was the subject of a number of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 235WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
financial transactions prior to the company&#039;s going into receivership. The original transfer payment made by Apax amounted to &#163;33.1 million&#151;a sum insufficient to meet Apax&#039;s obligation under the minimum funding requirement, but one that had been calculated on the basis of a valuation of the scheme&#039;s assets made three years previously. I understand that the view among senior actuaries was that if the valuation had been conducted on an up-to-date basis, Apax would have had to put an additional &#163;2.3 million into the scheme. Indeed, the independent trustee appointed to wind up the scheme wrote to ask it to reverse the transfer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para6"><a name="stpa_284">Parts of his letter, quoted in <i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> said that reversing the transfer would
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;Avoid the risk of criticism for making a transfer only a few weeks before the firm went into receivership.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para7"><a name="stpa_285">He went on to point out that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;pensioners and deferred members were not asked to consent to the transfer and it seems unfair that they should now suffer a reduction in benefits as a result of a transfer over which they had no control&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para8"><a name="stpa_286">Those financial transactions must have had an impact on the overall health of the USM and Texon schemes. I accept that the Minister has no direct responsibility for individual company pension schemes, but as the behaviour of companies managing such schemes can impact on his responsibilities, such as the finances of the financial assistance scheme, I would ask him to talk to his ministerial colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry about this case. I appreciate that he might want to refer me to the pensions ombudsman and the pensions regulator. However, given the remit of those bodies, that might not produce the results that my constituents seek.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para9"><a name="stpa_287">Past referrals have been made to the pensions ombudsman, but I understand that he was unable to investigate the role played by Apax because he has no jurisdiction over a company&#039;s shareholders. I understand that a complaint to the pensions regulator also made no progress because, apparently, it can investigate only the actions of trustees. In this case, it decided that they had done nothing illegal, although the regulator said that the complaint contained information that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;might be of interest to the DTI.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para10"><a name="stpa_288">I understand that a complaint to the DTI was also rebuffed, because it could investigate only complaints made by shareholders, and that complaints about pensions fell outside its remit due to their &quot;unincorporated&quot; status. Some serious joined-up thinking is needed on all these issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para11"><a name="stpa_289">The second issue I wish to turn to is the way in which the FAS will affect my constituents. They have told me that at first they felt that they could rely on it. However, it is apparent that only a few from Skelton will gain any assistance through the scheme, because of the age profile of the workers who were made redundant. In the main, they are good citizens, hard-working men in their 40s and 50s with families. I have known some of them for more than 20 years. They are not people who were within three years of retirement, and who will get 80 per cent. of their pension from the FAS. I do not for a moment disparage the scheme itself. It was a good start, and helped those people who were facing the worst prospects. I applaud the fact that it injected &#163;400 million to assist those who urgently needed such help. However, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 236WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
as things stand, many thousands of people who are in the same circumstances as my constituents will not benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para12"><a name="stpa_290">This is a serious issue of faith. Past Governments have stressed the need for people to make independent provision for retirement and have backed occupational schemes heavily. My constituents followed that advice and invested in a company scheme that they saw as in their best interests. They now find themselves cut adrift, having to face a future dependent on what the state can provide. I am aware that there is a comprehensive spending review and that there will be a review of occupational pensions. There will also be a review of how the state relates to a member of a scheme who might need assistance. However, I have been told that that review may not report until 2008. If that is correct, it will further dishearten many of my constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para13"><a name="stpa_291">I hope that the Minister will tell me that the review will be expedited. That would mean that my constituents and their trade unions could make submissions and that the finished findings of such a review could be fed into the comprehensive spending review process immediately. The Government need to grasp the problem urgently. We are told that that will be hard, given the financial implications. However, we need to recognise that those affected, such as my constituents, are a numerically defined group. Importantly, as the starting date of the pension protection fund was April last year, they are a closed group that cannot grow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para14"><a name="stpa_292">My affected constituents are of a defined age cohort and will not easily find a job that could give them a reasonable prospect of employment for a period long enough to build matching pension provision. The same demographic consideration would also tell us that mortality will play its part, roughly defining the total time period that the scheme would need to cover. The Government should factor in the costs that would have to be met by the state, in any case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para15"><a name="stpa_293">If we make assumptions about the people affected by such insolvent pension schemes who will need to have recourse to state benefits, another fact emerges. In that equation, the financial transfers between an expanded FAS and the cash that the Department for Work and Pensions would incur could well be neutral, at best. Would there be a cost if the FAS were widened? Of course, but the Government have made bold gestures in the past and can do so again. The Government can seriously explore other funding avenues: receipts from advance corporation tax, perhaps, or, as has been suggested before, the use of dormant assets in unclaimed accounts. I am aware that the Government see the last matter as a long-term issue and are possibly earmarking receipts from that for youth activity. However, the wronged pensioners at Texon UK and other pensioners in the same boat are also a deserving group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para16"><a name="stpa_294">An extension of the FAS to cover those within 10 to 12 years of retirement would bring a lot of joy to my affected constituents. I look forward with hope to the Minister&#039;s reply.
</p>

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60117h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Pensions Reform  (Mr. Stephen Timms) </b> : I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 237WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
(Dr. Kumar) on securing this debate on an important topic of concern to many people in his constituency who are former employees of the company to which he refers. Similar issues face many other people who are former employees of other companies and members of other schemes. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the work that he has done and the eloquent case that he has made on behalf of his constituents. I have had many meetings with hon. Members whose constituents have been affected by the wind-up of underfunded pension schemes. I have great sympathy for all those who have lost part or, in some cases, all of their expected pensions in such a way. It is a devastating experience for anybody to endure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para17"><a name="stpa_295">The USM Texon pension scheme and the impact of the company&#039;s insolvency on employees in the shoe-making industry has been eloquently described this afternoon by my hon. Friend. I want to address, as far as I am able, the pension issues that he raised. First, he raised concerns about the activities surrounding the USM Texon pension scheme, the behaviour of the employer and some of the financial transactions. Other Members have raised similar concerns about the events    in that company. I am advised that both the   Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, the predecessor to the pensions regulator, and the pensions regulator considered the case and came to the conclusion that the activities surrounding the pension scheme did not break pensions legislation. That is rather a narrow test, of course, but the regulator can take action only if the law has been broken. The Pensions Act 2004 greatly strengthened legislation in that area, but without a breach of legislation or regulations, the regulator is not in a position to act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para18"><a name="stpa_296">The pensions ombudsman is still considering cases arising from the scheme. In particular, a scheme member has complained that the trustees failed to produce a transfer value statement when asked to do so and the pensions ombudsman expects to reach preliminary conclusions on the case quite soon. The outcome of the complaint will have a bearing on a number of other complaints that the ombudsman has received in connection with the scheme about bulk transfer issues, and will be of interest to those who have raised their concerns with my hon. Friend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para19"><a name="stpa_297">I gather that there have also been complaints to the Department of Trade and Industry companies investigation branch, but, since the complaints relate mainly to pensions, it was concluded that they should be taken up elsewhere. I do not think that the DTI can investigate complaints made only by shareholders; in this case, Members have made complaints. With investigations that are underway at the moment, the work of the pensions ombudsman is most relevant to the case that we are considering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para20"><a name="stpa_298">My hon. Friend had a good deal to say about the financial assistance scheme, introduced through the Pensions Act 2004. I am grateful to him for recognising that, for some people, the FAS provides valuable help. Neither the Government nor the taxpayer has a liability in such cases, but we have set up the scheme to help members of underfunded pension schemes who were fewer than three years away from the scheme&#039;s normal retirement age on 14 May 2004 and whose scheme had

commenced winding up between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 2005&#151;a contained group, as my hon. Friend rightly said&#151;while being sponsored by a principal employer who had experienced insolvency prior to a given date. Hon. Members will know that protection in cases where insolvencies occurred after 5 April 2005 will be provided by the pension protection fund. However, that cannot be the case for insolvencies that occurred before the fund was created and before the PPF levy supporting the fund was raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para21"><a name="stpa_299">The FAS operational unit opened on 1 September 2004. Work has began on a collecting scheme and member data so that decisions can be made about whether schemes and individuals qualify for FAS. Once that information has been provided, decisions can be made and assistance paid to affected scheme members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para22"><a name="stpa_300">The first qualifying schemes were announced on 25 October 2005. So far, 146 schemes have qualified. The first qualifying members, who happen to be members of the ASW Cardiff pension scheme, are now receiving initial payments from the FAS. Those initial payments&#151;they are 60 per cent. of the expected pension&#151;are payable until the scheme completes wind-up; at that point, full FAS payments of 80 per cent. of the expected pension will commence, together with any arrears due. Work continues on processing data for other schemes, so that we can issue payments to more of those affected as soon as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para23"><a name="stpa_301">Scheme trustees have until the end of the notification period on 28 February&#151;the end of next month&#151;to notify the operational unit that they wish their pension schemes to be considered for the FAS. I urge any trustees who have not yet made such a notification already to do so soon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para24"><a name="stpa_302">The USM Texon pension scheme was on the indicative list of schemes potentially eligible for the FAS that was published last February. The trustees have now made a formal application to the scheme. The scheme notification has been accepted, and the operational unit is considering whether the scheme qualifies. That will involve obtaining additional information from the trustees&#151;namely, the date of the employer&#039;s insolvency and the name of the principal employer. That minor information has only just been requested, so it is not yet possible to confirm that the USM Texon pension scheme will be eligible for the FAS. I am therefore not able to state which members will qualify for assistance. However, I hope that the matter will be resolved within the next month or so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para25"><a name="stpa_303">My hon. Friend felt that the &#163;400 million provided for the FAS is not adequate, and that more money should be made available to extend assistance to more people. He said that most former employees of USM Texon&#151;at least those in his constituency&#151;are too young. They were more than three years from their scheme pension age in May 2004. Our priority when designing the structure of the FAS was to get help quickly to those who faced the most urgent difficulties. We took the view&#151;I think that my hon. Friend will agree that we were right&#151;that those were the people closest to or already at retirement age, who would be least able to make alternative provisions to replace their lost pensions. However, as with any cash limited scheme, some people will fall outside the qualifying criteria.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>17 Jan 2006 : Column 239WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para26"><a name="stpa_304">My hon. Friend said that if we were to extend the period from the current three years of scheme pension age to 10 or 12 years it would be very helpful to his constituents. I understand that. As he knows, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor told the Labour party conference in September 2004 that the Government will be reviewing the funding of the scheme, alongside the Government&#039;s other spending priorities, in the next spending review. In the meantime, however, funding is fixed for the current spending review period, up to and including 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para27"><a name="stpa_305">Should it be decided to provide additional funding, my hon. Friend wondered when it would start. It would take effect from the beginning of the financial year 2008&#150;09. He was also concerned about how long it would take. That answer is a little more encouraging: an announcement will be made in the summer of 2007, so the information will be available rather earlier than he feared it might be. Ahead of that review, however, our plans will cover only those who fall within the criteria that I have set out. I cannot offer my hon. Friend any    prospect of extending eligibility ahead of the review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para28"><a name="stpa_306">Those who were more than three years from their scheme pension age in 2004 will not yet be at their scheme pension age, so they are not yet in a position to need help. I can understand people wanting to know the outcome of the review as soon as possible, but I can give no expectation of it happening before the summer of 2007.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para29"><a name="stpa_307">The position of people outside the current scope of the scheme will be considered as part of the review, alongside the other spending priorities that the Government need to address. I appreciate that such uncertainty will be difficult for many, but Government funding is already allocated, and no additional source of funds is available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para30"><a name="stpa_308">My hon. Friend made some suggestions for obtaining additional funding for the FAS. He suggested using unclaimed assets from banks and other financial institutions or receipts from advance corporation tax to increase scheme funds. On the use of unclaimed assets, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor explained last month in the pre-Budget report that an agreement had been made with banks and building societies that such assets would be used to improve youth and community 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
facilities. Before the election, I was the Minister at the Treasury dealing with that issue. I therefore know that many proposals have been promulgated in various quarters on how to use those unclaimed assets. However, there is much less certainty about how much money is available. Some of the figures that I have seen are significantly greater than the reality is likely to prove. I caution my hon. Friend against seeing funding from that source as being a likely solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para31"><a name="stpa_309">The Government&#039;s view is that if owners and their assets cannot be reunited, the money should be reinvested in the community, particularly in disadvantaged communities, and that that should be done in a sustainable way through a co-ordinated delivery mechanism, with a focus on services that are responsive to the needs of young people; they should also be used to deal with financial education and financial exclusion. That seems logical, given that difficulties with financial literacy and financial education may have led to the assets being mislaid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117h05_para32"><a name="stpa_310">The removal of payable tax credits for advance corporation tax&#151;they were effectively a subsidy for the payment of dividends rather than money to be reinvested in the business&#151;has not led to an availability of uncommitted funds. It was part of a package of measures, which included a reduction in the rate of corporation tax. I know that my hon. Friend has been a strong advocate of increasing investment in manufacturing in order to boost the productive capabilities of the economy; and that package was helpful from that point of view. I note that, at the last election, none of the political parties argued for reinstating those credits. Indeed, as I said earlier, the resources secured from that source have been committed elsewhere.

Friend for his campaigning and for the committed work that he has carried out on behalf of those of his constituents who have been so hard hit by the collapse of the firm and the pension scheme. We made good progress in setting up the FAS, which ensured that the first payments were made on schedule before Christmas. I know that my hon. Friend and many others are eagerly awaiting the review of the FAS; the outcome is due in the summer of 2007.
