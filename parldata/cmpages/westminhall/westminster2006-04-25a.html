</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60425h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Anthony Steen  (Totnes)</b>  (Con): First, I wish to thank you, Mr. Chope, for ensuring that this debate takes place, if you did so; if you did not, I must thank Mr. Speaker. The debate could not be more timely, or better attended, as Back Benchers of all parties are present and will wish to catch your eye. That is most unusual in a 9.30 am debate in Westminster Hall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">I have been a train enthusiast all my life. I have two historic steam train lines in my constituency, with which I am actively involved&#151;if not on the footplate, I certainly give them all the enthusiasm I can. Trains have a long and prestigious history in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">Every train journey offers a sense of adventure. Everyone feels that rail travel has a romantic mystique; rail journeys provide a sense of wonder to us, as we whistle past the countryside. Train transport has been one of the great and most glamorous means of getting around the world. An illustrious former resident of my constituency, the late Agatha Christie, set many of her adventures and murder stories on trains. I have been an MP for south Devon constituencies since 1983. The total train miles that I have travelled during that period would have taken me around the world several times&#151;if not to the moon and back.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">Transport is allegedly one of the three priority policy areas of the current Government. However, in spite of an enormous growth in passenger rail travel, there has been absolutely no improvement in the western region rail network as a whole. The south-west is one of the most neglected regions in the country in respect of public transport. Although Britain is the fifth largest economy in the world, the west country still has a 1960s rail infrastructure, making it difficult to run fast, frequent and reliable services there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">The importance of fast, frequent and reliable services for the economy and for tourism cannot be overstated. We need to have a three-hour Paddington to Plymouth service. The December 2004 timetable demonstrated that Plymouth was, at last, again located three hours from London, as it had been in the &#039;70s and &#039;80s, with two daily services up and three down achieving the three-hour timing. The Transport Committee repeatedly recognised a three-hour threshold&#151;not three hours and a bit, but three hours&#151;as the maximum time that most inward investor location search engines regard as their cut-off period. The Plymouth three-hour journey time has also acted as the benchmark requirement for Network Rail to deliver sustained maintenance standards and new investment in order to allow the necessary line running speeds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">The Government have announced the commissioning of a new fleet of 125 mph high-speed trains, but they will not come into service until 2015&#151;in nine years&#039; time. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 184WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
That is simply to replace the current 125 mph trains that were introduced in the 1970s. Therefore, in nine years&#039; time we will get trains that go no faster than those running in the 1970s. Worse, the new and existing 125 mph trains are operationally restricted by the maximum speed that is permitted along the entire 300-mile length of the Reading to Penzance main line, which is merely 110 mph, and in many places very much less than that. If the speed limit were 125 mph, Paddington to Exeter would be attainable in less than one hour and 50 minutes, Plymouth could be reached in less than two hours and 40 minutes, and the time to Penzance would be four hours and 30 minutes. The Government must upgrade the Great Western main line so that high-speed trains can travel at the speed they were built to travel at in the 1970s, and will again be built to travel at in 2015.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">The high cost of travel acts as a deterrent to business and tourists. The first class return train fare from London to Totnes is now more expensive than a British Airways economy return fare to San Francisco. People can fly to the European Union capitals in less time than it takes to go from Totnes to London at the weekends.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">The impact of a reduced rail service on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and road congestion might be of interest to the House&#151;it is also an extremely topical issue. One would have thought that the Government would have done everything possible to ensure that train travel was more attractive in terms of both speed and cost than car travel, but they have not. If they were environmentally conscious in any way, they would have understood the impact of CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from road congestion, which will get worse if services to and around the west country continue to be reduced. The Government policy should be to get people off the roads, but we learn from last Sunday&#039;s newspapers that, on the contrary, thousands of miles of new roads are planned, but no new railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">A new track should be laid between Exeter and Plymouth along the line of the A38. That would cut half an hour from the journey time to and from the capital. If the speed limits were increased from 110 mph to 125 mph from Reading to Exeter, the journey to and from Exeter would be about one and a half hours. If we were in China or the Chinese were here, that new track would have been built within a year, but the Government have not even given it the consideration it deserves. Instead, the track follows the Brunel line of the 19th century, hugging the coastline, which is threatened by global warming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron), the leader of my party, said yesterday, we must give people, and particularly those living in our towns and cities, serious travel options that do not involve the car. As the TUC said in &quot;Making South West Work Better&quot;, its 2005 regional economic strategy paper:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Carbon emissions from transport in the UK are rising rapidly. Transport is currently responsible for 26 per cent. of the UK&#039;s carbon emissions. The growth of road and air transport has resulted in a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the past decade.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">Although the Department for Transport recognises that, and is responsible for helping to deliver reductions in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, it has totally failed to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">Last year, cars emitted 19.39 million tonnes of carbon equivalent into the atmosphere, and 11.68 million tonnes of carbon equivalent came from other 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
commercial vehicles. Domestic and international aviation accounted for 8.67 million tonnes, buses for under 1 million tonnes&#151;970,000, to be exact&#151;and diesel rail for only 260,000 tonnes. That gives some idea of the scale of the problem from motor vehicles: to repeat, 19.39 million tonnes of carbon equivalent that goes into the atmosphere comes from cars, and 260,000 tonnes comes from diesel rail.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60425h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Michael Ancram  (Devizes)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. I must also declare what I might call an informal interest: the line to which he refers runs 10 yd away from my house, and the high-speed trains shake it gently as they pass, so the idea of faster trains causes me a little alarm in respect of its structure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">However, my hon. Friend is making a point about the effect on the environment. He is also discussing long-distance trains, but, like me, he represents a rural area, and I ask him to reflect on the effect on local rural services. In the town of Melksham in my constituency, where usage has gone up by a factor of nine over the past few years, the services will be cut from one every two hours to two round trips a day. The effect on traffic in my area will be enormous. At a time when we are talking about the importance of the environment, it seems very strange that the Government are acceding to a reduction in services in places such as Melksham, which will be bad for people&#039;s transport, for the mobility of elderly people and for jobs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60425h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Steen </b> : My right hon. and learned Friend must have seen the later parts of my speech, although of course I do not accuse him of cribbing from it. There has been a 40 per cent. increase in commuter traffic in rural areas, but a reduction in the rail service; it is absolutely mad. I shall come on to that. I am most grateful for his intervention, and I am sorry about his house; perhaps he should move.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">I have some figures that hon. Members will be interested to hear on carbon dioxide emissions, in kilograms per passenger per journey, for the journey between London and Bristol. By modern diesel rail, the amount is 10.6 kg, and by car it is almost double: 21.3 kg. Recent Government figures show that, on the journey between London and Edinburgh, the average passenger travelling by electric train is responsible for about 12 kg of CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions; by car, the journey burns up 70 kg of CO <sub>2</sub>  per passenger. By air, the figure is nearly 100 kg. If we really have concerns about the environment, we should be encouraging the maximum number of people on to the railways, not the roads.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">Paradoxically, although road transport emits six times more CO <sub>2</sub>  per passenger mile than rail, motoring costs have fallen, and although rail is far more carbon-efficient, rail fares continue to increase sharply. A moment ago, I illustrated that with the fact that it is cheaper to fly economy with British Airways from Heathrow to San Francisco, return, than to get a London-Plymouth first class rail return. That gives some idea of the level of fares.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">Rural Devon roads cannot handle any more traffic. The same point was made about Wiltshire by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 186WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
(Mr. Ancram). My Urban Regeneration and Countryside Protection Bill, which I introduced six years ago, was talked out by the Government, but it would have played a part in not allowing more building or development if the infrastructure was not in place, and that would include roads and rail. The economic growth of the south-west depends on modern and efficient transport corridors, pre-eminent among which must be a top-class rail network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">I want to deal with the minimum specifications in the Government franchise document. It is important that we get the subject out of the way, so that the Minister has an opportunity to answer on this point. In preparing the franchise document, the Department for Transport came up with the minimum service level commitment timetable. I do not know how it was worked out, but the civil servants who produced it clearly did not know the region, or understand the work patterns of the people living in it. It was hopeless, inappropriate, inadequate and against the interests of those living in the west country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">The December 2004 timetable should have been the baseline for the Department for Transport&#039;s timetable. Why? Because it was developed over a three-year, post-Hatfield period in open collaboration between the train operators, Network Rail, the local authorities, passenger groups, and business and tourism groups. For that reason, it was welcomed and accepted by all such groups. Yet the timetable that emerged from the Department for Transport took no account of the 2004 timetable, and completely ignored the objective 2 status of Plymouth and its need to be within three hours of London. The Department for Transport timetable has done the Government considerable harm and has caused immense friction and anger throughout the region. It is as inexcusable as it is inexplicable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">One thing that the Government did get right was their decision to continue the franchise with the First group. The company understands the area and responded quickly and correctly to the avalanche of representations made by the county and district councils, commercial and voluntary organisations, the TUC and others. I thank the company for its measured and sensible approach, in dramatic contrast to that of the Government. The Government were content to allow trains to and from Totnes to be reduced by 50 per cent. I was deluged with letters from angry and concerned constituents, and that anger spilled over into a protest on the platform itself.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">I must pause to deal with two questions that I tabled and their answers, because they show the Government&#039;s view on the subject. I asked the Secretary of State
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;why his Department&#039;s tender document for the West of England franchise specifies a reduction in the number of trains calling at Totnes&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">and the Minister who will reply today said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;The Great Western Franchise specification was designed to improve the overall operational and financial performance of the train service and to ensure resources were used to best meet market needs. The timetable on each route, including Totnes is derived from these requirements.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Most passengers in the Great Western Franchise area will see the same or improved service&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">but not those in Totnes. He continued:

</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 187WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">In a second question, I asked the Secretary of State
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;what criteria the Department used in deciding to specify in the Greater Western Franchise that the first train from London to Totnes should not arrive before midday on weekday services.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">That is what was going to happen. One would not be able to get to Totnes, which serves the whole south Devon area, before midday. The answer was:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;The specification for the Greater Western franchise was set to achieve value for money for the taxpayer and the travelling public and provide the best service for the greatest number of passengers across the franchise.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>19 April 2006; Vol. 445, c. 711&#150;12W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">That is just not true. The Government were proposing not the best service, but the worst possible service. So much so that at the first round of discussions, First Great Western ensured that the first train will stop at Totnes way before midday. In my view, all that the Government were concerned about was getting their &#163;1.2 million a week, with no regard for the consequences for the travelling public. If they did not like it, they could go by road&#151;that was the Government&#039;s attitude.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">I pay tribute to First Great Western&#039;s management team for understanding the west country people and for listening to the rightful concerns of public authorities, businesses, private companies and, above all, local people. As a result of the appalling muddle and the Government&#039;s mismanagement, there can be only a few people in the west country who feel that the service is better run by the Government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60425h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Don Foster  (Bath)</b>  (LD): The hon. Gentleman puts a lot of the blame on the Government, and I understand why, but I wonder whether he can help me. I am in a difficult situation because I have letters from the Minister in which he assured me that at Freshford and Oldfield Park stations, there would be an hourly train at off-peak times and two trains an hour at peak times. He says in the letter that the plans
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;represent my Department&#039;s intentions for these stations. This is being made clear to the bidders for the franchise&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">So the Government had a clear intention. For me, the problem is the other way round: under the timetable, there will not be those hourly services; there will be a two-hour gap. There will not even be two trains an hour at peak time&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60425h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Steen </b> : My hon. Friends are helpfully answering the hon. Gentleman. In spite of their comments, he is really making the same point as I am about the reduction in services. Whether it is the Government&#039;s fault or the operator&#039;s, and whether or not there are too many trains on the line, we are making the same point. We want more and faster trains, and we want more people off the road. I could not agree with him more. I do not know about his particular problem because I am not a train operator, but the issue is absolutely clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60425h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I was a little taken aback when the hon. Gentleman said that the Government should get all the blame and First should get all the credit. I do not know whether he has looked in detail at the subsidy arrangement involved in this franchise. First probably was the best bidder, but let us consider what it gets out of the arrangement. It admittedly takes some risk, but it also gets the profits, some of which may be shared with the DFT. If the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 188WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
predictions of increased passengers and rail fares are not right, there will be a disproportionate burden on the Government to pick up the impact of the potential losses, so the arrangement is not quite as good as is being suggested. I would argue that the state has not got such a wonderful deal out of the arrangement. What are the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments on that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60425h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Steen </b> : I am not going to make any comments on that at the moment, but the point will be noted by the Minister and by my colleagues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">I come now to the number of trains from Totnes to Exeter and from Totnes to Plymouth during rush hour. The roads around Totnes and the A38 are jammed as people travel to and from work by car. If regular trains travelled in both directions at the right price, a great number of people would go by train rather than use fuel and park their cars in the town centres. Why do people not travel by train? Simply because the number of trains is being reduced, fares are too high and coaches are being crammed to the gunnels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">Some trains that stop at Totnes have only one coach; others have only two. So full are they that schoolchildren are virtually swinging from the chandeliers. People understandably prefer their own cars. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I should say to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) that I do not think trains have chandeliers in his part of the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">Rural rail services have been cut, despite their growing popularity. Passenger numbers on ill-fated branch lines have increased by up to 40 per cent. in recent years, and the branch lines across the west country will lose up to half their daily trains. That list is borne out by the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) about the Barnstaple to Exeter line. She wished to talk about that today, but has not been able to come&#151;mind you, she probably would not have got in. The Barnstaple to Exeter line is greatly used by commuters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">The reduction in rural services has nothing to do with CO2 emissions or passenger convenience: it is simply about reducing the rail network&#039;s &#163;5 billion annual subsidy. The cuts in rural services are as great as when Beeching axed the line in the &#039;60s, and literally thousands of west country people use the roads and increase CO2 emissions because of them. It should be quicker and cheaper for such people to travel by train, but it is not. It is sheer madness to cut rural local services that are used by increasing numbers of local commuters when we should be encouraging such services to the maximum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">I give the Government credit for one thing. I am delighted that we have managed to save the sleeper to Penzance. When I was Member of Parliament for Liverpool, Wavertree, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and I played a part in saving the sleeper service to London, which was going to be axed. I am only sorry that when I moved to south Devon in 1983, that commitment was not continued, and the sleeper service no longer exists. I pay tribute to Lord Freeman, then Transport Minister and responsible for the first franchise document for the west country. He took little persuading that the night sleeper to Penzance should continue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">The only snag now is that as a result of rearrangements suggested by the Government, we have got rid of the Plymouth coach. One finds oneself at 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 189WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.50 am, having come down from London, standing on the platform with nowhere to go and nothing to do. In the winter it is very cold.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">The unreliability of the timetable is such that some say that there is no point in there being one at all, and that we should just go to the station and see what turns up and where it is going. Such jaundiced remarks come from regular commuters who despair of ever having a week free from catastrophe or delay; on the line there may be leaves, or cows or other animals that seem to have a fascination with train lines and have become the keenest train spotters of them all. It is convenient to blame First Great Western for unreliable service, but it is as well to remember that at least 50 per cent. of all delays are caused by track or signalling failures or a combination of both.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">Finally, I come to the question of the track. The situation of the infrastructure is a major cause of ongoing delays and is blamed on the fact that 78 per cent. of the rails were laid before 1970. The approach of Network Rail does not give priority to the needs of the travelling public. For example, after track repairs, temporary speed restrictions are unnecessarily low. Similar priority is given to two or three trains from the Mendips carrying stone each night, which prevents weekday night work on the entire Reading to Taunton track. Network Rail needs to be more flexible and more consumer orientated and to ensure that the speeds allowed after repair are much greater.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">For example, when the track was nationalised under British Rail, there was a 100 mph restriction after repair. Until January this year, the restriction was 20 mph after repair. That has been increased to 50 mph, and we should be grateful for that, but such restrictions knock the west country timetable sideways and throw it out of the window. The knock-on effects throughout the day mean that trains run unnecessarily late. The bulk of mainline repairs using modern equipment is done on weekday nights and at weekends, but not on the Reading to Taunton line. That means that on Sundays all passengers from Penzance upwards go via Bristol. I had such an experience on Sunday; I very regularly take five to six hours to get back to London by train. That is not acceptable on a Sunday, and the trains are packed as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">Network Rail faces an enormous problem, but enormous problems were faced when I dealt with British Rail and Railtrack in the &#039;80s and &#039;90s. There have always been enormous problems with the track, and although it is true that more money is being spent&#151;&#163;46 million this year and &#163;53 million next&#151;on the Reading to Penzance route and that there is a high budget for track renewals, it remains true that even with a revised timetable it will be progressively more unlikely that trains will ever arrive according to their scheduled times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">That is the result not of breakdowns of engines or rolling stock, but simply of Network Rail commandeering sections of the track and forcing the railway to go on an alternative route. There are too many speed restrictions, they are too onerous, and more imaginative and progressive ways must be found to deal with engineering requirements. However, I am impressed by the spirit with which Network Rail is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 190WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
addressing such matters: the regional controller for the area is very enthusiastic and hopes that he can deliver&#151;but there have been such hopes for the past 25 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The centrality of the track problem to the whole issue is illustrated by the fact that if the engineers upgraded the track from Reading to Taunton so that high-speed trains could travel at 125 mph rather than 110 mph, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance could be reached much faster.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">As the programme of track replacement proceeds, with a quarter of it having to be relaid in the next three years, it is important that deeper and thicker rails should be laid and not cheaper ones from eastern Europe. Will the Minister confirm that the best steel will be used and that the general quality and design will last for years to come?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">There are further obstacles that will have to be surmounted, given the entire refit of Reading station and the introduction of Crossrail. Those two developments must not be used as an excuse for further delays, but inevitably they will. I am doubtful whether we will be able to go from Plymouth to London by train in three hours; it will be nearer four or five hours&#151;that is why people take to the road.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">Last but not least, I turn to the track at Dawlish. Climate change is already adversely affecting it: raised sea levels are causing more regular spray on to the track and halting services. On a recent visit to the Met Office in Exeter, I was left in no doubt by the forecasters that in the next 50 years rising sea levels will mean that the line beyond to Penzance will be closed for more days each year. Yet Network Rail and the Government continue to reject any suggestion that I make about providing, or even preparing for, an alternative route. An Exeter to Plymouth line along the A38 would, of course, solve that problem, as well as having other clear advantages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">The west country has only one line each way from Exeter to Penzance, and we have an outdated line, which is too slow, between Reading and Exeter. Major repairs are afoot. Reading station is to be brought into the 21st century&#151;thank you, but at what cost?&#151;and Crossrail is to bring trains from all over the north of the country straight down to the channel tunnel and the south coast. All in all, there is a massive programme for change, but today, public train services to and from the west country have in no way improved and in many cases have dramatically declined.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">No wonder more and more people are taking to the roads in droves: their journeys are faster and cost dramatically less. This debate is an indictment of the Government&#039;s commitment to public transport and a reminder to those of us who live in the west country that they have little time for us and little regard for how we live our lives and the economic prosperity of the region. The Government could do a great deal to put things right. If the Minister has the will. there will be a way&#151;but has he the will?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">There are appalling delays on the railways, overcrowded out-of-date rolling stock and a railway company desperate to see things improve but hampered by the lack of basic requirements: a first-class track, reliable signalling and good communications systems. That lack will lead to ever greater congestion on the roads and ever increasing CO2 emissions.

<a name="60425h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">I have delayed asking for a debate on this issue for 20 years, because each year I hope that things will get better. However, the situation has got worse. In its original state, the new franchise timetable would have been an unmitigated disaster. The only chink of light is that First Great Western has won the new franchise and is as determined as I am to see, in my lifetime, improved, reliable, fast, comfortable and reasonably priced public rail travel.

I am going to uphold the honour of the Commons against the Lords in a charity swim that is a long-standing commitment. I hope that Members will forgive me.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">It is an enormous pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen), whose knowledge of rail matters is well known. From his comments, it is clear that his postbag, like mine, has been filled with letters expressing concerns about the rail service in the south-west.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">Rail transport in the south-west has been one of the dominant issues that I have encountered since I became the Member for Plymouth, Devonport a year ago. The transport needs of the south-west are many, including air and road links, and they are all equally vital. It is the largest geographical region in the country, and it is very sparsely populated. If we are to avoid complete dependence on the car, branch lines feeding into cities such as Plymouth are essential, as are inter-city links.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">Plymouth, which suffers serious peripherality concerns, is a city with an ambitious growth strategy. There are plans to increase its population significantly, by up to 50,000 people. Our economy is doing well. Our skyline is marked out with cranes, and business is looking favourably at the city. However, all those inquiring about establishing in Plymouth ask what the rail links are like. Rail journeys in the south-west have generally increased; they are up by 42 per cent. since 1995. A fifth of the journeys end in London, which indicates just how important the inter-city links are, particularly for business. We need those fast links, and the three-hour journey is essential. We also need the branch lines and the cross-country links that bring workers to workplaces, students to schools and universities, and people to the city for shopping or playing, and for their entertainment generally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">Historically, we have been living with the threat to our rail links. It was thought in 2004, following a detailed consultation, that we had got a timetable with which we could all work. The 2004 timetable seems simply to have been junked, despite the broad support for it, during discussion of what was needed after the Railways Act 2005. That point has been well made. People in the industry, who have much more experience than I do in such matters and who understand the intricacies of rail timetables, did not understand and were not happy with the process that followed that Act. The fact that the detail of the timetable was treated as commercially sensitive and was not published early on along with all the other franchise documentation caused problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">The people who were best placed to spot the anomalies, clashes and gaps in services&#151;the rail users&#151;were not brought into the process, except by the back

<br>&nbsp;<br>
door, when people got leaked copies of the timetable. That is not how things should be. The users of the service well understand whether their connections will work or whether, as was the case in the proposed timetable, two trains are scheduled on the same piece of line at the same time. Given that the Secretary of State had inferred prior to the opening of the franchise process that he did not intend to cross all the t&#039;s and dot all the i&#039;s, we were all surprised at the degree of detail that was apparent in the franchise when we saw the detail of the timetable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">That proved not to be the final word on the matter. There did seem to be some flexibility for the franchisee to make changes. First Great Western listened to the issues that colleagues from across the region and I raised, along with other lobbyists and members of the public, and it has made some changes: there will be four three-hour journey services for Plymouth, not one, and many of the local routes have been reintroduced. However, the vague language sometimes used by First Great Western gives me cause for worry. Terms such as &quot;expected to&quot; and &quot;may&quot; are used in its press releases. Expectation is one thing, reality is another. That is why I am seeking a meeting with Alison Forster, the managing director of First Great Western, and MPs from all parties to discuss, and I hope nail down, some of the suggested changes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">We also want to discuss the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) about the subsidy and the rail utilisation strategy. The final document has only just been released, although it was apparently published to inform the development of the Government&#039;s specification for the south-west franchise. It all seems a little late in the day.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60425h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I must declare an interest: I have a strong link with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. Research that it has done for me suggests that First Great Western will do very well out of the franchise arrangement. The Government would also say that they does well, but they do so latterly in the way in which the franchise has been agreed. The missing variable is the degree to which First Great Western has predicated its figures on a substantial reduction in labour costs. Anyone who travels on its trains will know that after 6 o&#039;clock they are denuded of staff. As a group of MPs, should we not take that issue up, to ensure that those staff costs are not cut?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60425h01_spnew9"><b> Alison Seabeck </b> : I agree with my hon. Friend, who I hope will join me in the meeting with First Great Western so that we can raise some of those issues directly. I am sure that he will also raise them when he speaks to the Minister.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">I hope that the Minister will take away from this debate the strength of feeling that exists in our region and a sense of the importance of rail services to the south-west. I am sure that he will do so, and that he understands that we want further changes in the timetable. Anything that he can do to bring pressure on First Great Western to tweak it further would be welcome. We also ask him to accept the lessons learned from the handling of this first franchise operation and to avoid mistakes when we come to the handling of the cross-country franchise. Will he re-examine the sensitivity issues relating to the publication of the detail

of the timetable and therefore enable valuable input from users, whose contribution will otherwise be restricted to generalities? If such things are not done, we will undoubtedly end up back in Westminster Hall in the months after the franchise is awarded and exactly the same concerns will be raised. We all want to avoid that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">Will the Minister also ensure that issues such as platform length are considered as part of the cross-country franchise? I understand that there is scope for some of the cross-country trains to make additional stops to fill in some of the gaps in the First Great Western franchise, but that some of those trains are too long for the existing platforms. If platforms need to be lengthened, there will be investment issues. If the trains are to keep some of their doors shut in order to stop at such stations, there will be health and safety issues. Such issues have been raised with me by members of the public. All those matters need to be resolved before the next franchise is finally awarded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">I would love people in the south-west and beyond to feel the romantic allure of the trains, which was so eloquently described by the hon. Member for Totnes. Unless we can provide a regular and reliable service, we will be unable to coax people even into considering using the railway. The car is far too easy an option and is so much quicker in many instances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60425h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Ancram </b> : I take the hon. Lady&#039;s point, but does she not agree that cars are for those who have them? Many people do not have them, particularly in the rural environment. If there are no trains and an insufficient number of buses, such people cannot get anywhere. That is why I hope that the Government will closely examine the effect of service closures in rural areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60425h01_spnew11"><b> Alison Seabeck </b> : The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes an important point. One often hears Government officials and others talking about improvements in bus services filling in the gaps caused by the lack of train services. Unfortunately, although there has been some improvement in rural bus services, which we should acknowledge, they still do not meet the demands that exist in the wider Devon area. We need people to be able to get into Plymouth to spend money.

The issue for me is the number of people from rural communities such as Chippenham, Melksham and other towns in Wiltshire who will be travelling in by car if train services are cut. The Swindon-Southampton service, for example, is threatened with cuts. We need people to come in by train and not by car for our urban areas to remain viable. Does my hon. Friend agree?

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60425h01_spnew13"><b> Alison Seabeck </b> : My hon. Friend reinforces my earlier point: such lines are important to Plymouth for exactly those reasons. They bring in money and people to support the urban economy, which in turn supports the wider rural hinterland.

<a name="60425h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) on securing this debate. It might have been 20 years delayed, but it is extremely timely, because there is hardly a bigger issue in the far south-west than its train service. I commend the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck), as she disappears. She has taken a leading role in securing a better train service from the Government and First Great Western, and I pay tribute to her for doing so. Her performance has been impressive and I appreciated what she said in this debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">I also thank the Government for their part in the change of mind about the three-hour service from London to Plymouth. I am unsure how it came about. I know that First Great Western had a major hand in it. It was of immense strategic importance to Plymouth that it secured that change of heart. The service is a vital lifeline for the city of Plymouth, which is the economic engine for the far south-west: Devon and Cornwall. It was critical that that three-hour journey, made four times a day, remained in place. I am grateful that that seems to have been the position, but I share the anxiety of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport that it needs to be nailed down and secured to ensure that the three-hour train journey remains in place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">As you well know, Mr. Chope, those of us in the far south-west, which is what I like to call Devon and Cornwall, live in a very peripheral part of the country. The solution to peripherality is first-class transport links. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes about the difficulties caused by everyone piling on to the roads at certain times of the day and year. Our roads system is clogged up and there seems to be no more scope in that regard. It is therefore crucial that our rail links are excellent, which brings me to my main point. I shall focus for a few minutes on one specific fallout from the new specification and new timetable: the impact on the commuter town of Ivybridge, just 10 miles east of Plymouth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">As I hope the Minister knows, Ivybridge station has been in place since the early 1990s at a cost of &#163;1.5 million of public money. We would all accept that it has been slow to become a viable train station, for various reasons. However, in the past two or three years, usage of Ivybridge station for commuter and student transport, both from Ivybridge to Plymouth and from Plymouth to Ivybridge college, particularly in the mornings, has been growing steadily.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">Studies suggest that in the past 12 months, usage of Ivybridge station has increased by 70 per cent., and that is probably an understatement for the simple reason that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 195WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
during the 10-minute journey from Ivybridge to Plymouth, the service provider has quite often not collected money or taken tickets, so certain lucky passengers have been able to travel free and their presence on the train has not been recorded. The 70 per cent. increase is probably an understatement of how, at last, the station is beginning to take off. More and more people are using it for park and ride. More and more people live in Ivybridge and commute to Plymouth on the 7.49 and 8.21 rail services and return on the 16.48 and the 17.50&#151;how specific is this speech?&#151;every day. That is a viable working service and it is growing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">We are about to have a new town on the east of Plymouth, just south of the A38, at Sherford. Sadly, that will only make the transport issues more difficult and complex. There will be more congestion than there is today, so we want Ivybridge station to have a viable and flourishing future. Sadly, the new timetable suggested by the Government and First Great Western blows Ivybridge station out of the water. Yes, people can still commute from Ivybridge to Plymouth to work, but they cannot get back again. Yes, young people can still catch a train from Plymouth to Ivybridge to go to school, but they cannot get home again. What is the point of that? The new timetable cuts the number of trains calling at Ivybridge by a significant percentage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">We have had a number of meetings about the issue, which is of great importance to the local community. We had one meeting just before Easter. The senior director for transport at the Government office for the south-west, Mr. Richard Bayly, attended and listened to representations at a packed Ivybridge town hall. He said that he would look into whether the Government and First&#151;its representatives were there, too&#151;could come up with a viable timetable for Ivybridge station and for Ivybridge commuters and students.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">The time scale is now very short, so I urge the Minister to deal with the matter. He may never have been to Ivybridge or even have heard of Ivybridge&#151;I hope that he has&#151;but I ask him to find a way in the next two or three weeks, before the timetable is settled, to put in place a viable train timetable for the commuters and students of Ivybridge. At the moment, the timetable is not viable and that will sound the death knell for the station, which was constructed using vast sums of public money. I assure him that the station is a facility that will be used increasingly in the future. We therefore have to find a solution to the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">May I suggest one possible solution? A number of Virgin trains go through Ivybridge every day, but they do not stop because they are longer than the platform. In extremis, it is possible for a train that is too long for a platform to stop at the station and for the guard to announce that people who want to get off should not do so from the two end carriages or they will do themselves a nasty injury, and to say that they should get off from the designated coaches. That might be an interim solution. I understand that if the Government can satisfy Virgin on that point, it would be prepared to have some of its trains stop at Ivybridge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">The estimated cost of extending the platform at Ivybridge by 10 metres is &#163;100,000. Given the amount of subsidy being invested in the railways today and the amount of money that the Government spend year in, year out&#151;I appreciate that there are different jam jars and that that money might be for Network Rail and so

<br>&nbsp;<br>
on&#151;I ask the Minister to do some joined-up thinking and to ask for a discussion with the railway operators, with Network Rail and with his own officials. Is it not possible to increase the length of the platform at Ivybridge, so that Virgin inter-city trains can stop there as well? That would facilitate a proper commuter service, so that people could go from Ivybridge to Plymouth to work and back again and students could come from Plymouth to Ivybridge and get home again safely without having to hang around at the station for an hour and a half, which many parents are worried about. Is that not a simple practical solution?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">I do not expect the Minister to have all the detail relating to this matter at his fingertips when he winds up the debate, but will he please consider urgently the provision of a viable train timetable for Ivybridge?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">My constituents are feeling pretty sore at the moment. Not only is the Secretary of State for Health pursuing a scorched-earth policy as far as our local community hospitals are concerned, but it appears that we face the prospect of many of our rail links disappearing, so we are pretty unhappy. I hope that the Minister will be able to cheer us up a little. I am grateful to him for meeting me last month with members of the west Wiltshire rail users group and representatives of the town councils. We appreciated that meeting and we hope very much that, as a costed option, the service that runs from Bristol to London Waterloo will be back on track.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">I shall principally address two elements of the rail transport network that runs through my constituency. The Minister will know that Westbury is a railway town. People in Westbury and the surrounding areas feel strongly about trains. They are very much part of the local scene, as I hope he understands. Several lines&#151;several little bits of the rail network&#151;run through Westbury. I want to mention in particular the Westbury-Swindon link. On Friday, I had the pleasure of meeting members of the south-west public transport users forum in Trowbridge. They put a number of points to me about the Great Western franchise, and the Westbury-Swindon link featured large in the discussion. There is concern about the high level of cancellations for that service, dirty dilapidated rolling stock, poor connections at Westbury and poor timetabling. That all leads to a general disinclination on the part of the travelling public to use the service.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60425h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire)</b>  (Con): My hon. Friend mentions the service from Swindon to Westbury and onwards. That service goes through Chippenham in my constituency, where a significant number of people use that line down through west Wiltshire. Under the proposals, which, rather bizarrely, the Government are signing off&#151;it should be First Great Western, but the Government are actually to blame&#151;the trains from Chippenham down towards Southampton are being cut. Is that not a disgrace?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60425h01_spnew19"><b> Dr. Murrison </b> : Indeed it is. If the proposals go ahead, we shall see a massive reduction in the service: it will be

<br>&nbsp;<br>
down to about 20 per cent. of its current level. Basically, it will become a vestigial service. We are now several years into the 10-year transport plan, but goodness me, where are we going if we are seeing such a situation in an area whose population is growing all the time? We know from the regional spatial strategy for the south-east and south-west that we expect an increase of upwards of 200,000 dwellings. My constituency and those of my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) will be heavily involved in that growth. In all our areas, the road network is creaking and is going to get worse, and corridors such as the one that I have described will be increasingly important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">As I said in the debate on rail transport in the south-east in January&#151;the Minister may recall it&#151;to get people to travel by train, we have to make travelling by train attractive. It simply is not possible to set up a train service and say, &quot;Here you are, here&#039;s your train. Get on with it.&quot; My hon. Friend the Member for Totnes said that the Chinese would simply set up a railway. They may very well do that, but in our country the difference is that we have to make it attractive to people to travel by train. We do not have that kind of command economy. We have to make using the train attractive to the travelling public and unfortunately that is not happening.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60425h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Ancram </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a real paradox here? While these trains may not be particularly attractive, I have figures from the Melksham ticket sales office, and over the past three years, usage has increased from 3,000 to 27,000. More and more people are using the trains, whether they are attractive or not. In the face of that increase, it seems perverse to start talking about cutting services when more and more people are using them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60425h01_spnew21"><b> Dr. Murrison </b> : My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. No doubt he will have heard, as I have, from the redoubtable Melksham Without parish council about its concerns regarding the siting of Melksham station and its facilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">The line from south Wales to Bristol to the south coast is extremely important. It runs through a number of wards that have some of the highest indices of deprivation in our country. The Minister probably shares the prejudices of many in his party in believing that such wards exist only in the midlands and the north. That is simply not the case. From the suburbs of Southampton right up to the Severn estuary and Bristol, such wards exist in large numbers. Public transport is important to many of our constituents.

The new franchise timetable plans to make yet further reductions, however, making the service completely unusable for people who want to go to work, college or school.

recurring one, because the Waterloo to Bristol service was commended by the Minister&#039;s predecessors. Following the network user strategy of 2003, it was scheduled to be enhanced. We were going to get more trains, but now we find that that particular service is going to be axed completely, unless it can continue through a costed option under the new franchise from February 2007. We are suffering from a stop-start service, and the difficulty is that once people are used to not using a service, they will not go back to it. We found that in west Wiltshire; there needs to be continuity so that people get into the habit of using rail transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">The south coast to Bristol to south Wales railway route is the second most heavily used passenger railway in the west of England: its use is exceeded only by the M4 corridor route that links the west of England with London. That is a very important point, which the Minister must understand. More than 5 million passenger journeys are made each year and growth in use is about 8 per cent. per annum, but we find that this particular service is scheduled for wholesale reductions. That is simply unacceptable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">In the Bristol and Bath to south coast study, endorsed by the South West regional assembly and drawn up by Government office for the south-west, we saw that this route was considered important. I hope that the Minister has examined a letter on this subject dated yesterday&#151;he probably has not seen it yet, but I hope he will do so shortly&#151;from the Cabinet member for the environment, transport and economic development, Councillor de Rh&#233; Philipe. It is signed off by chief executives of Bristol city council, Wiltshire county council, West Wiltshire district council and Salisbury district council, and by the chairman of the South West regional assembly planning and transport committee. They all stress the points that I have articulated today. I hope that the Minister reads the letter. It is a good letter that sets out the points very clearly and relates particularly to an extremely valuable link.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">In the time available, I should like briefly to mention the Bristol to Waterloo service, which is a vital service for my constituents. I know that the Minister will consider the matter carefully as the preferred bidders put their plans forward. It is a costed option, and I hope that he will use that as one of the foremost criteria when deciding which of the preferred bidders should run this important service.

will listen carefully to what has been said about the crucial need to maintain the Bristol Temple Meads to Waterloo route when the South West Trains franchise is renewed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">We have heard from the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) about the importance of the timetable, but there are other crucial issues. Affordability is one and capacity is another. It is deeply disturbing that the current proposals will reduce the number of carriages in some of the crucial commuter trains through, for example, Freshford, Keynsham&#151;it is wonderful to see the hon. Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris), who represents Keynsham, here today&#151;and Oldfield Park. The number of carriages on those trains is to be reduced at peak times, which will cause a huge problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">It is also crucial that we have timetable that is fit for purpose and delivers what is needed. I referred briefly in an earlier intervention to letters that I received from the Minister on 9 August and 13 September, which refer to the three stations of Freshford, Oldfield Park and Keynsham. In those letters, he assured me that there will be an hourly service at off-peak times and two trains per hour at peak time. He made it absolutely clear that these plans were his

<p>
<a name="60425h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">Sadly, however, we see that that is not being delivered in any of those three stations.

<p>
<a name="60425h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">There is a difficulty. Since the initial plans were produced, about 9,000 letters of complaint have been received by First Great Western. As we heard from the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport, consideration has been given to some of those concerns. In about six weeks&#039; time, we shall hear the outcome of that process, and we understand that some of the concerns raised have now been resolved. It would be enormously helpful to my constituents if the Minister would confirm today that the problem of the reduction of services through those three stations is one of the issues that has been resolved. If not, I urge him to consider carefully concerns about the reduction in the number of carriages on peak routes, and I ask him in particular to ensure that we retain the crucial Temple Meads to Waterloo service.

They have done so to such an extent that when the question of the timetable arose, I wrote to the Minister, and I hope that he recollects writing back to me on 18 October 2005. The crucial issue regarding the Tamar valley line is that the eight trains a day that currently run should be retained. I have received communications from many in that area of my constituency, including the parish councils, and it is clear that the early morning service is vital in order to provide connections through Plymouth to the rest of the

<p>
<a name="60425h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">In the letter of 18 October, the Minister assured me&#151;and through me, my constituents&#151;that that service would be retained, that eight trains a day would be guaranteed and that the principle and policy of reflecting the Government&#039;s support of the community rail partnership and the community railway of the Tamar valley line would be honoured. I regret to say that the timetable now published demonstrates that that will not happen. I hope that he will do all in his power to ensure that his assurance, which I publicised to my constituents throughout my constituency, will indeed be honoured. Faith in this Government, reliance on their word and the solidity of their assurances to people in my constituency are at stake.

Earlier on, Mr. Steen referred to the work that First Great Western has done since the protest by many people in the south-west.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">The franchise is London-centric, and it does not meet the needs of people in the south-west.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">Many hon. Members have referred to the issues affecting their constituencies. First, the timetable&#039;s is not fit for purpose in terms of capacity. It does not provide enough seating capacity, so on the Westbury, Bath and Bristol Temple Meads to Cardiff Central line, the Exeter St. David&#039;s to Exmouth line, and the Exeter Central to Torbay line, there is insufficient capacity to meet demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">The second issue is customer flow. The specification takes no account of existing usage or of some of the improvements that, for example, Wessex Trains made through the wider benefits programme in order to build on growing demand. As the hon. Member for Totnes said, there has been a 40 per cent. increase in demand on rural lines. However, the new timetable has no train arrival at Exeter St. David&#039;s from Barnstaple between 7.44 am and 9.40 am. What are commuters who want to go to Exeter going to do? There is no train arrival at Weymouth from Bristol, Westbury or Yeovil before 9.31 am. What about students going to Weymouth college, and other commuters? There is no westbound train departure from Truro to Penzance between 16.24 and 18.40. In other words, one time is too early for Truro college students to get home, and the other is too late for commuters.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60425h01_spnew29"><b> Mr. Gray </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that taking account of where people live and the growth in rail usage should include not only the timetable, but the potential for new stations? Does he not agree that there is a strong case for a new station at, for example, Corsham in my constituency? It is a fast-growing area, with many people commuting to the constituency of the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster).
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60425h01_spnew30"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : I agree entirely. There was a golden opportunity in the timetable for the Government to demonstrate their commitment to rail services by building in those services. However, the fact of the matter is that we have gone backwards in terms of the services that Wessex Trains provides, for example. Train services are not fit for purpose, and they will not meet the needs of local communities. We know the result: people will go back on to the roads, increasing traffic congestion and CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, and the train service will not be improved.

My hon.

However, as he said, we need joined-up solutions. In rural areas where there are no buses, people must be allowed to travel from their homes to the station so as to get on the train to their next destination.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">I return to some more examples. The timetable for the Severn Beach line does not take account of its high usage by schoolchildren.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60425h01_spnew33"><b> Stephen Williams  (Bristol, West)</b>  (LD): My hon. Friend has been very generous with interventions. He mentioned the Severn Beach line and, earlier, interconnectivity with mainline services. I would dearly like to use the Severn Beach line to make my journey from Bristol Temple Meads to Paddington. Frequently I cannot, however, because the service ends at Temple Meads, giving passengers three minutes flat to get from one end of the station to the other in order to get the London service. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) will empathise with the fact that for many people who would like to make the through journey, the constraints of the timetable make it impossible.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60425h01_spnew34"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : I agree entirely. We know about the difficulties between inter-city services, but there is also a lack of interconnectivity between those services and local trains. We must factor in whether the timetable is deliverable. Several experts have said that as currently constructed, it is not. There are three instances every day whereby trains travelling in opposite directions are timetabled to meet on a single line between Kemble and Swindon. That is ridiculous.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">Time is short, and before the timetable is published, those issues must be considered afresh. We need a commitment from the Minister and First Great Western to resolve them. First is committed to provide &#163;1.13 billion to the Government over 10 years. Some of that money must be reinvested in local services, otherwise the situation will get worse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">One of my hon. Friends, who cannot attend today&#039;s debate, said to me that an underlying plot is in operation. First Group runs buses as well as trains in the area, and it would be useful for the group if many of the rural branch lines were replaced with bus services. There is one example of that in the timetable. The Avonmouth-Severn Beach service is being replaced with a bus. If rural lines are being decimated for fast interconnectivity city lines to London, that will be at the expense of many people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">I hope that the Minister will consider those issues with First. The people of the south-west deserve better. We have had an excellent debate today and I hope that those concerns will be listened to.

hon. Friend emphasised the effect on the peninsula and the environment. The debate is also important also because it goes to the heart of the problems with the railways and with how the rail industry is structured and how the franchise process is working. We have had some excellent contributions from hon. Members throughout the Chamber about the problem pertaining to their constituencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">I am aware that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) has led a strong campaign in her area. Two months ago, the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley) initiated a debate on South West Trains in her constituency and I suspected that we would have a debate such as this, so just before Easter I took the opportunity to go down to the west country to look at the problems in detail. I travelled by train from London to Plymouth, where I came across three or four major problems that the timetable is causing. First, points have already been made about high-speed trains and cutting the number of three-hour London-Plymouth services, as well as local services such as those from Ivybridge and St. Germans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">In Plymouth I met local councillors, the local press and especially local railway officials, which was an enlightening experience because it gave me real insight into how the bidding process for the franchise worked and what lobbying is taking place by FirstGroup with the Government for revision of the timetable. I also met local business men, which was crucial. Tim Jones of the Devon and Cornwall Business Council stressed to me that the three-hour train is vital for Plymouth&#039;s success. We have heard Plymouth described as a vibrant and growing city. The regional spatial and economic strategies highlight Plymouth as an area of expansion. The point that was made was that if the three-hour train service were to disappear the business prospects in the area would also disappear.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">While I was in the west country I took the opportunity to look at the Looe-Liskeard line and the impact on local businesses and local employment of people being able to connect with trains to Plymouth and beyond, such as on the Penzance-Plymouth line. All those issues underlie a problem. If the timetable that came into place on, appropriately, 1 April&#151;it replaced the December 2004 timetable, which is being junked&#151;is not revised it will have severe implications for the peninsula.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">Equally, my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) made a point about the importance of the route from the south coast to Bristol and south Wales. The south coast to Bristol and south Wales corridor links the major urban settlements of south Hampshire, greater Bristol, greater Bath, Wiltshire and south Wales with the lines to London. The regional spatial strategy and the regional economic strategy highlight those as areas of growth in housing and economic development. The proposals for those areas are to cut services, and existing passengers will find themselves on shorter and less frequent trains with services starting later in the morning and dwell times at stations being cut. The inevitable implication is overcrowding and the inevitable consequence is that people will be less likely to use the trains.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60425h01_spnew36"><b> Mr. Don Foster </b> : The hon. Gentleman referred to growing towns. The town of Frome is growing enormously and he may be surprised to know that under

<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the proposed timetable there is no train between 7 o&#039;clock and 9 o&#039;clock in the morning from Frome to Bath, where most of the work is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60425h01_spnew37"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : I did not know that, but I am not surprised. That is a consequence of the proposed timetable, and the same is happening throughout the west and south-west. Such reductions will be a real problem when trying to persuade local people to go to local urban centres and centres of regional economic development. That will be a major consequence, and people will either lose employment or be forced into their cars with all the consequences for the environment that my hon. Friend has described.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60425h01_spnew38"><b> Mr. Cox </b> : Another example of which my hon. Friend may not be aware, although I hope that the Minister is aware of it, is that the train service on the Tarka line from Barnstable to Exeter has had removed from it any train that arrives in Exeter for the peak rush hour. That is a clear example of what my hon. Friend is saying.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"><a name="60425h01_spnew39"><b> Mr. Hammond </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that important point. We have heard a number of comments from other hon. Members about lines being cut. We have not said much about Hampshire, but clearly the timetable has implications for Hampshire. I shall not continue to detail the cuts because I want to leave time for the Minister to reply, as do most hon. Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">While I was in Plymouth I had a good indication from FirstGroup about how the bidding process worked. It is important to understand that First is trying to work with local people and to lobby the Government to revise the current timetable, but following the Railways Act 2005 and the demise of the Strategic Rail Authority, the Secretary of State for Transport is effectively running the railways. He is doing that not only strategically, but by intervening in the minutiae of the railways. Under the franchise process for the route in question all bidders were asked to supply three bids, one for a minimum service level which was specified in detail by the Government&#151;the detailed specification option&#151;one on the original timetable and one on an optimum timetable for the route. It is no surprise that the timetable that has been granted and for which First is paying &#163;1 billion over 10 years for the privilege to operate is the detailed specification option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">On 20 March, I asked the Minister to tell me how many rail routes would be cut as a result of that detailed specification and how many stations would be closed. His answer was none. I suspect that that revolved around the word &quot;cut&quot;. If I had asked how many service reductions there would be as a result of that detailed specification option, I suspect that I would have received a different answer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para100"><a name="stpa_101">One matter that will be clear to all hon. Members from the debate is that the current timetable, which started on 1 April, is not fit for purpose. FirstGroup has impressed on me and, I am sure, other hon. Members who had discussions with it, that it is negotiating with the Government to revise the timetable so that when the final version is published in the first week of December a number of the issues that we have heard about today may be resolved. I hope that the Minister will today give

First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) on securing this debate.

My officials are working on the specific issue about service that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) mentioned, and I shall get in touch with him as soon as we have a firmer answer on it. The hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) asked about services at Ivybridge. Obviously, we are considering more options for additional services, but the normal procedure for enhancements such as those to platforms is a business case, and involves talking to Network Rail and so on. I am not sure what stage the matter is at, whether it is just an initial idea or whether there are ongoing discussions. If I hear of anything on that, I shall write to him, but I am not aware of anything at present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">I understand that most Members are here today because they are not happy with various things, but we must consider the bigger picture. It is important to remember that these are good times for the railways. A record amount is being spent&#151;&#163;87million each week&#151;and, on average, train performance is above the target of 85 per cent. that we had for March this year. More than 85 per cent. of trains run on time, and many train operating companies are now hitting 90 per cent. and above. There has been a significant improvement in reliability and significant investment in rolling stock, with about one third of it being replaced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para103"><a name="stpa_104">It is not the case that people have been put off using the railways. Last year, there were more than 1 billion passenger journeys&#151;a further increase. There are more passengers than there have been since the early 1960s on what is, compared with the pre-Beeching railway, a smaller railway. That is a significant improvement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para104"><a name="stpa_105">On the comment of the hon. Member for Totnes about First group, it put in a bid for the franchise because it obviously thinks that it is a good commercial proposition. It believes, as do we, that the number of passengers will continue to grow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para105"><a name="stpa_106">It is important to give some background. It was clear from the start that specifying the service to be provided by the new Great Western operator would be an intricate task. We must balance issues of affordability, service, value for money and performance when awarding a franchise. At the same time, this is a truly 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
regional franchise that brings together services of all types: inter-city, inter-urban, commuter, local and rural. By contrast, most previous franchises tended to be of one particular service type.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para106"><a name="stpa_107">The Great Western franchise is a particularly large and detailed franchise. It also operates across a wide geographical area including, for example, parts of London, the Thames valley, the south midlands, Bath, Bristol, south Wales and the south-west peninsula. That makes it one of the most operationally complex franchises on the network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">One of the great benefits of the new franchise is that it allows us to ensure that Network Rail has to deal with just one train operator across most of the network west of Paddington. That should bring real advantages for passengers, too. For example, it will greatly simplify the operation of major stations on the routes for Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads and Reading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">The core of the specification is the service level commitment, which typically lays down the minimum number of trains that must run on each route, the time of early morning and late evening services, journey times and calling patterns. However, the Government do not specify every aspect of a service. For example, rolling stock, which hon. Members have mentioned, is largely a matter for bidders, who must ensure that trains can achieve the speeds needed to deliver the service, and that there is enough rolling stock to meet the operator&#039;s own forecast of demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para109"><a name="stpa_110">Fares, too, are a matter for the franchisee, provided they comply with the Government&#039;s policy on regulated fares. Increases on such fares are limited annually to 1 per cent. above the rate of increase in the retail prices index. I probably ought to mention as well that catering on trains, a subject which is of great interest to the hon. Member for Totnes&#151;he has previously raised it with me&#151;is entirely a matter for bidders to propose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">In short, we aim for a specification that is detailed enough to ensure that value for money for the taxpayer is properly balanced against the needs of passengers. At the same time, we recognise that operators, not Ministers or civil servants, are experts in delivering train services. We therefore leave to them as much of the operational detail as is reasonably possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">The point that I would like to stress more than any other before I move on to other issues is that the operator is free to vary train times and to amend calling patterns, provided the minimum standards set out in the service level commitment are met. Crucially, they can also operate extra trains, provided there is sufficient track capacity and no adverse effect on other operators&#039; subsidies or premiums.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para112"><a name="stpa_113">Tenders for the new franchise were received in September 2005, and, as we all know, the franchise was awarded to First group. It is worth emphasising that First group has committed itself to &#163;220 million investment over the first three years of the franchise in return for the right to run it, and that that will deliver a range of benefits to passengers. There will be a complete redesign of the high-speed train fleet, at a cost of some &#163;140 million, which will increase by 14 per cent. the number of seats on commuter and long-distance trains to and from London in the peak periods. There will be a programme of station improvements, including better customer information systems, 1,700 new car parking 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
places and, crucially, at a time when there is great concern about passenger safety at stations, improvements in passenger security through the upgrading of CCTV at stations across the network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para113"><a name="stpa_114">Also, there will be revenue protection measures, including automatic ticket gates at principal stations. That is important for passengers, as detecting fare evasion tends to reduce other crime on the railway. The measures will be backed up by extra staff and the recruitment of more community support officers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para114"><a name="stpa_115">New performance and reliability targets will call for nine out of 10 trains to run on time by 2011&#150;12. As the hon. Gentleman knows&#151;he raised the issue with me recently&#151;the sleeper service to Penzance, which many in the media predicted would be withdrawn, has been retained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para115"><a name="stpa_116">Once First group had been awarded the new franchise, it embarked on a consultation about the detailed service that it proposed to offer. As hon. Members have said, that attracted a considerable volume of responses, which tended to focus on objections about specific proposals. I hope that the extent to which it has been possible to meet the points that were raised in the consultation demonstrates that it was a genuine and helpful exercise. Inevitably, there will be some preferences that it has not been possible to cater for, but the service that we now expect when the new timetable is introduced will go a long way to satisfying the points that have been made. Of course, it will still be possible at various points during the lifetime of the franchise to offer additional services if the case can be made for them, but they must meet the criteria that I outlined.

<a name="60425h01_para116"><a name="stpa_117">The hon. Member for Totnes mentioned track maintenance and infrastructure problems. Today&#039;s debate has highlighted the condition of the infrastructure, and I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed by hon. Members about the performance of First group and Network Rail in respect of the Great Western service. The principal causes of problems are track condition and the temporary speed restrictions that are imposed to maintain safe operation. Performance on the route remains unsatisfactory, but Network Rail reduced the delay minutes for track-related problems from 14,000 minutes per period at the start of the year 2005&#150;06 to 10,000 minutes per period. It has a large programme of track renewals over a five to six year period and has invested in high-output track renewal plant that has been successful in reducing track-related faults. To reduce delays, it is working to increase the track handback speed following renewals from 50 mph to 80 mph. A recent programme of rail renewal has helped to reduce temporary speed restrictions, and Network Rail plans to spend additional money over the next five years on more than 100 schemes to improve Great Western performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para117"><a name="stpa_118">An essential element of planning a train service specification is to give Network Rail reasonable access to the railway for maintenance and renewal. Generally, that requires possession, which involves a temporary closure of a section of railway to traffic. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the typical pattern is for routine track maintenance to be undertaken during midweek night possessions, when few passenger trains operate, and for renewal and larger maintenance projects to be done at weekends. At the same time, growing levels of rail traffic pose a challenge to Network Rail, which, if possible, must increase the rate of maintenance and renewal without increasing its demands for possessions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h01_para118"><a name="stpa_119">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Dawlish. It receives special attention from Network Rail. The line and sea wall are regularly monitored and receive enhanced maintenance. The foundations of vulnerable sections have been strengthened, and a team of five people work on the section throughout the year. Network Rail is not currently considering an alternative route.

<a name="time_9">
<a name="60425h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60425h02_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North)</b>  (Lab): Biotechnology, or what is sometimes called the biosciences, is one of the UK economy&#039;s fastest growing sectors and its future looks rather bright. There are 455 bioscience companies in the UK, and about 22,500 people are employed in the industry&#039;s different sub-sectors. The industry is growing fast and can grow even faster, but it will not grow as fast as it might without Government support, because it is in a most competitive environment. The US has the biggest and fastest growing industry, as well as being more experienced, but India, China and other countries are coming up fast on the rails.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para0"><a name="stpa_120">In health care at the end of 2005, the industry carried out deals worth &#163;750 million, thereby contributing significantly to the economy. Indeed, it is in health care that most of the biggest effects are felt and most of the biggest discoveries are made. Article after article on the subject has appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i>, and journalist Lisa Urquhart has highlighted many of the features of the biosciences movement in recent articles. She notes that the business is risky because research is lengthy and costly periods of development are required. There are dozens of failures in the field, as well as endless calls for refinancing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para1"><a name="stpa_121">On the other hand, the sector is beginning to produce some real winners. One example, of which I was not aware, concerns marine biotechnology. Many compounds are being discovered in this planet&#039;s deep realms, which have not been investigated before. We have tended to look up, not down, but we are now finding new substances, which have great effects on cancer, heart disease and so on. Biosensors, which can detect pollution, can also be developed from organisms in the marine environment. Things are therefore beginning to move, and we want to encourage such developments, as well as those in the conventional drug arena.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para2"><a name="stpa_122">Gene therapy in its wider sense is also on the agenda again. It is not a matter simply of injecting viruses into people to eradicate faulty genes, but of suppressing gene activity and so on. Much activity is going on in that respect, and although we do not have the blockbuster yet, it is not far off. Animal biotechnology experiments are also being done. They include, for example, experiments to make racehorses run faster. If I had a business, I might breed racehorses, win the Derby and retire quite happy without telling anyone. So lots is going on in that respect, too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para3"><a name="stpa_123">There is also the field of gene diagnostics, which allows us to assess which illnesses people might develop at different stages in their lives, and who will respond to certain drugs, which greatly benefits the national health service drug budget. In addition, we have all heard of the anti-cancer drug Herceptin and tissue engineering, and those, too, are part of biotechnology. New bladders are also being grown for children. New bird flu vaccines are being produced&#151;perhaps not fast enough, but production is certainly speeding up&#151;in case we should be struck down by that disease, as has

happened in other parts of the world. As Lisa Urquhart notes, biotechnology has been
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;catapulted . . . into the forefront of people&#039;s minds.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para4"><a name="stpa_124">At the same time, however, there are the other stories. There was the tragic stem cell research in South Korea, the impact of which reverberated around the world. As has been well documented, the professor involved was tempted to rig the data, confusing the public and perhaps himself. In this country, six volunteers involved in tests on an experimental monoclonal antibody suffered an adverse reaction last month. We await the report, and everybody has their ideas about what went wrong there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para5"><a name="stpa_125">Still, biotechnology-produced drugs have become the most rapidly growing segment of the drug industry not only in this country but in Europe. In the past year, 23 compounds have come out of Europe and 13 have come out of the USA&#151;activity has accelerated greatly. As Lisa Urquhart notes,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;confidence may have returned to Europe&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para6"><a name="stpa_126">and we should remember that that confidence was shattered by the unmentionable genetic modification. I promise never again to mention GM or to fall out with people in defence of GM crops&#151;at least not until the next one appears. Despite that confidence, however, Lisa Urquhart notes that there is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;a shortage of mature, large, profitable European biotechnology companies for investors to sink either their teeth, or funds, into.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para7"><a name="stpa_127">In America, however, we see quite the opposite. Companies&#039; market capitalisation passes the $1 billion mark, and that trend is growing. I shall explain shortly how that has occurred.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para8"><a name="stpa_128">There is huge international interaction. I mentioned the US, Europe and the UK, but there are interactions between Indian and Chinese companies and between Indian and British companies. Indeed, in the past few years, Singapore has suddenly not only recruited some of our best scientific stars but populated the market with large sums of money and seen the value of biotechnology in health and other areas. Biotechnology is indeed a burgeoning field.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para9"><a name="stpa_129">At this point, I want to digress a little to talk about this country. It is reasonable to ask why biotechnology is growing in some areas and some cities but not in others. I hope that hon. Members will forgive me for mentioning Norwich and Norfolk, because there are few biotechnology companies there, but there are massive research institutes, including the biggest plant research institute in Europe. There is also a university with a medical school, which the Government provided in 1998. Special science schools are developing, where young people study astronomy, information technology and so on. We also have a biomedical centre, a pharmacy school and creative centres, which the public and young people can visit to try out scientific experiments online. On paper, those higher education establishments are as good as any, but why are no companies coming out of that?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para10"><a name="stpa_130">Recently, in Norwich, I attended a glittering BAFTA-type awards ceremony full of entrepreneurs&#151;they were to the left, to the right and in the middle. Many of them were young and were involved in developing films, in the media and in graphic design. It was quite inspiring, and I did not know that so much was going on in that area, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 211WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
but where is the equivalent in science, technology and medicine? Where are the young people who are being encouraged to develop their ideas and come for their glittering prizes?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para11"><a name="stpa_131">Is there perhaps a lack of ambition in Norwich? No, that is the football team&#151;sorry, Delia. Do we need a champion or even a tsar? Do we need an organisation to overthrow what I sometimes think is the dominance of Cambridge on the east coast? We certainly need a regional development agency such as that in the north-west, which knows what a science city is. It sees the glittering possibilities offered by those involved in the sector&#151;from the very young to the very old&#151;and it makes them work together to develop science and technology to the highest level. We have six such science cities in this country, and such bodies would provide a focus for collaboration in the sciences, including astronomy, and I note that Colin Pillinger is coming to Norwich this week to talk to young people and, I hope, at a mass meeting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para12"><a name="stpa_132">We want to get young people into computing. Tim Berners-Lee has said that computational science is the coming thing and he has a vision of our being able to model structures. As hon. Members will know, our understanding of climate change is based on models and on predicting what might happen in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para13"><a name="stpa_133">There is a lot that we should be doing. At the same time, there are vast natural resources in places such as East Anglia, where people should go and see for themselves what nature is. Susan Greenfield has been talking in the other place about the effects on the brain of using computers to blog and so on, asking what has happened to reading books and going to see things for oneself. That is absolutely right: not enough people are going out to the broads to hire boats&#151;not to ram other boats, but to sail peacefully up the broads, which are a national park, and see the wildlife there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para14"><a name="stpa_134">We also have rich birdlife in north Norfolk. We find that many young people, for whatever reason&#151;the Field Studies Council not having the support and money, for instance&#151;are not getting out there to see nature for themselves. They are reduced&#151;not badly, I guess&#151;to watching David Attenborough&#039;s &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; on television to see what life is really like. We have to get out of that and do something much more radical. We have to get young people out there to see nature and to interact with the world face to face.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para15"><a name="stpa_135">Biotechnology is developing in certain parts of the UK. For example, an alternative, junior stock market is being set up that harnesses support from different parts of the world. It has alternative listings from the UK and the US, including those involving stem cell research. I declare an interest: I am on the Stem Cell Foundation, with Richard Branson, Richard Sykes and many others. We are involved in the stem cell initiative, to which the Chancellor has given huge sums to develop stem cell research and biotechnology in this country. I am also involved in the East Anglian initiative, in association with people at Cambridge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para16"><a name="stpa_136">There was a time when big pharma ruled the roost, but it has recently found it difficult to keep up with the research initiatives from smaller companies and individuals. Big pharma cannot keep up with the new ideas, such as the new molecules and proteins that are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 212WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
being produced to treat illnesses, and the genomic science advances, as highlighted by developments at the Sanger institute.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para17"><a name="stpa_137">There is massive potential for new technology in what are called RNA interference molecules, which are molecules that can induce the inaction of a particular gene or activity in a cell. The gene is knocked out rather than replaced, as in the crudest gene therapy. I see from various journals that 40 to 50 patents involving such technology have been applied for. There is huge development, not only through the patents but in new companies using the technology to develop new cures and treatments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para18"><a name="stpa_138">Such research is exciting, but it is outside big pharma. Big pharma it is quite a courageous group of individuals and organisations&#151;it sees what is happening and is taking up a new position. It does not want contracts any more, but a relationship in which the work is outsourced to smaller companies. The boot is on the other foot, and such companies have become much more important in the past few years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para19"><a name="stpa_139">One way round that is to have a mega-merger. A little while ago there was a mega-merger of two companies in this country called Glaxo and SmithKline, into GlaxoSmithKline&#151;it rolls off the tongue as if it were only one company, but it was two companies once. My hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) spent some time investigating that merger. We were told that the company would play a star role and that lots of new discoveries would be made, but it sounds to me as though the merger might not have produced the new products that were promised at the time by Richard Sykes and Jan Leschly when they appeared before the Science and Technology Committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60425h02_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ashok Kumar  (Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland)</b>  (Lab): My hon. Friend articulates his case passionately. However, GlaxoSmithKline is supporting a new centre for biotechnology in my constituency that is to be developed over the new few years as part of the Centre for Process Innovation, so perhaps he is being slightly unfair.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60425h02_spnew2"><b> Dr. Gibson </b> : I would never be unfair to GlaxoSmithKline. It is a subtle company&#151;there has been a merger and smaller companies have been set up within the bigger company, because it recognises that sometimes initiative and innovation take place in that context. I have researched the centres that my hon. Friend mentioned, which are called research and development centres&#151;nothing clever about the name&#151;and GlaxoSmithKline has quite a few, because it sees that small is beautiful. That is the way to get innovation and people working together better. The bigger the organisation, the more bureaucracy there tends to be, with innovation not receiving the support that it needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para20"><a name="stpa_140">Nowadays people tend to be loyal to the technology rather than to the company. That means that small really has become beautiful&#151;that is the name of the game for small biotech companies. However, big pharma companies, with their experience, have something going for them. They are dominant in the development of clinical trials, they chaperone the smaller companies over the regulatory hurdles that they 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 213WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
face and they help them to market their products, so mutually beneficial interaction is taking place. We need to examine how that is happening and to encourage it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para21"><a name="stpa_141">Many applications from biotech companies are going through fast in the United States&#151;much more than from the big pharma companies. For all its benefits, big pharma faces the problem of losing its patents after 10 years. The replacement drugs are down to a trickle, because the research has not been developed fast enough. Big pharma is still cash rich from its drugs sales, while the US Job Creation Act 2004 gives it billions of dollars in tax breaks if it repatriates any earnings for the companies that invest in the USA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para22"><a name="stpa_142">Big, manic mergers are taking place. Pfizer has taken over Vicuron, for example. Therapeutic companies are being bought up by even smaller companies, such as Amgen, about which many hon. Members will have been lobbied. It is a biotechnology company based in Los Angeles that has taken over a smaller biotech company and thus become a middle-sized company. Companies do not have to be producing anything for such takeovers. Development can be part of the reason for the merger.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para23"><a name="stpa_143">Big sums of money are involved in such takeovers, because people see the possibilities. For example, Novartis paid $5.5 billion for Gilead, a San Francisco company that makes Tenofovir, which is used to treat HIV, and Tamiflu, which is used for influenza and which has since been licensed to Roche. The interactions in the market do not follow the typical pattern, however. There are many failures, and many small biotech companies remain just that, in the Coca-Cola league rather than the premier league. However, they must not give up, because who knows what they might discover with the creativity of the people working for them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para24"><a name="stpa_144">It is not fair to compare the UK with the US. We are second in terms of biotechnology production and the amount invested. Much less money is invested in British companies. There are fewer clusters&#151;I mentioned Norwich as an example of where there ought to be one, but there are many other examples where we have been trying for years to get that to happen, but it has not. We hold up Cambridge and Oxford as the star examples&#151;I will not go into the details of how that happened, but it had less to do with Government intervention and more to do with Adnams ale and people meeting in a pub, becoming familiar and deciding to work together. If that is the way developments happen, we should promote it. We should ensure that the right people are together where they have their coffee or pint of Adnams, talking about developing this illustrious field.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para25"><a name="stpa_145">If the goal is to develop new leading drugs, collaboration with a range of partners will be essential. Things will need to be set up so that innovation becomes the name of the game. Creative people can usually find each other&#151;something that the Department of Trade and Industry ought to realise&#151;and they do not need the airfare to LA or San Francisco. They will know that someone else is doing work in which they are interested, and they will get there to work with them. Once they get together and start the ball rolling, we must ensure that they are supported at the various stages.

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60425h02_spnew4"><b> Dr. Gibson </b> : I thank my hon. Friend. In theory, that is what should happen, but I question whether it happens quickly enough and whether we have learned all that we need to learn. Simply talking together over coffee is not enough.

<a name="60425h02_para26"><a name="stpa_146">The industry has not yet matured yet. It has quite a long way to go. For instance, we need to improve the financial environment for UK biosciences.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Such companies quickly outgrow the capacity of private investors to service their cash needs but have few physical assets to offer as collateral to banks and no credit ratings to access bond markets. They therefore have to come to the public markets to broaden their capital base, but represent high risk investments, heavily dependent on equity injections but often the potential for high returns to shareholders if their promise is fulfilled.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60425h02_para27"><a name="stpa_147">We have to be ambitious and want that to happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para28"><a name="stpa_148">We need a cross-party understanding of the problems, and we must work together to make it happen. We also need research and development tax credits to remove restrictions on collecting money in order to develop the business from stage A to stages B, C and D in order to get the product on the market. We have to change that threshold. In the last Budget, the Chancellor recommended that companies with 500 or fewer staff should receive some support. That is a start, but the world is moving fast in this field, and we have to help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para29"><a name="stpa_149">Another problem that we have to face is the inability of the bioscience sector to take up new medicines in the UK as fast as elsewhere. A major pan-European report on access to cancer drugs published in October 2005 by the Karolinska institute suggested that the UK lagged behind in terms of access to cancer drugs. It is generally agreed that our processes and structures do not allow new products on to the market fast enough. We need to fast-track more innovative medicines, with funding to increase their uptake by the NHS. We have all seen the sorry sight of Herceptin not being provided for all in the UK who need it. I hope that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is listening. I am looking for some radical changes in the organisation&#039;s operations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para30"><a name="stpa_150">I turn to the question of animal extremism. Animal testing is needed to ensure the safety of drugs before they are used by people. That might be ironic given the six recent cases in London, but that does not deflect from the need for animal experiments as a preamble to the use of drugs in human beings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para31"><a name="stpa_151">We all know about the campaigns against Huntingdon Life Sciences. We all know that the groups that take such action are not huge: a few determined people have taken the issue across the Atlantic to New York and attacked shareholders in those companies that

carry out animal experiments. They write letters, sound klaxon horns outside houses, use incendiary bombs and throw bricks through windows. That has decreased since Home Office Ministers made efforts to illegalise the processes under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, but there are still cases of damage to private property.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para32"><a name="stpa_152">People have a right to protest peacefully, and I am absolutely in favour of people marching if they think that animal experiments should be limited or completely stopped&#151;a good argument can be made for that&#151;but I deprecate the activities of the small group of people who carry out what could be called terrorist acts. That may be an extreme description, but that is how it seems to those who work in that industry and who are dedicated to producing drugs to improve peoples&#039; lives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para33"><a name="stpa_153">Ironically&#151;I hope that they hear this&#151;some of those extremists must use drugs to cure their own problems. I am sure that aspirin has been useful to them, because they too must hear the noise of the klaxons when they sound them. I have every sympathy for them, and if they keep using the drugs that have been tested by the system, they will be okay, but they should cut it out and let us have a reasonable argument about the technologies that can be developed to test new compounds. I read that the United States is getting tough on such extremism too, and that three individuals are about to be sentenced or have just been sentenced to jail for their activities. We need more such action here, because the problem will not go away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para34"><a name="stpa_154">The Budget was good in highlighting the need for biotechnology to keep us in the world-class environment for health research and development and innovation. The Budget announced support for Sir John Pattison&#039;s stem cell initiative, of which we are a partner through the Stem Cell Foundation. Once new products are almost on the market, we hope that they will be supported in order to ensure that they are developed in this country rather than slipping to other countries for development. Funding worth &#163;100 million has been announced&#151;a further investment of &#163;50 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para35"><a name="stpa_155">I am not saying that stem cell research will cure Parkinson&#039;s or Alzheimer&#039;s, but I respect the right of clever people in this country who can do research, and who question what they are doing, to be able to carry it out peacefully. That includes finding out whether using embryonic or adult cells is the way forward for some treatments. There is a little chink of light in that area, particularly with cardiovascular diseases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para36"><a name="stpa_156">It is good that we have this industry, but we must recognise that part of the innovation process of getting a sustainable industry is training our young people in these methodologies. I know that many young people do not want to go into industry. They still live in that world where people do not want to get their hands dirty or take the filthy lucre. They would rather be GPs and take &#163;250,000 a year, or lawyers and take &#163;500,000. Nevertheless, those in this industry are well paid, and we should do all that we can to encourage them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para37"><a name="stpa_157">It is important that the process of training makes people feel fired up and keen to use their talents. That is why science, technology and engineering should be a major part of the curriculum for our young people. I note that, in a debate in the other place, someone said that the curriculum and the order in which things are

taught has not changed for about 50 years. It can take a long time to recognise that today&#039;s world is so different from the world of those who developed the curricula. I hope that that the Chancellor or whoever is developing sciences in this country&#151;it seems to change each week&#151;gets stuck in and helps to develop new technologies by bringing in young people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para38"><a name="stpa_158">The country needs to steeped be in science. Science and science-based innovation should be right at the top of the political agenda. We must rethink how we are to educate tomorrow&#039;s scientists, and involve the public in the debate, not make them feel anti-science. We should make them feel that it is useful, and not let them be thrown by silly arguments about GM or by what extremists say about animal experiments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para39"><a name="stpa_159">The Treasury is beginning to rethink the whole policy structure&#151;from the last Budget, at least&#151;including how science will be funded; having new research institutes and combining them; and how computer science, which develops almost daily with new ideas and model systems, should be used. Public-private partnerships need to be developed in a way that encourages innovation. We all talk about industry interacting with universities and higher education. Gosh, I have heard about that for almost a hundred years, but we have not found a way to make it work. Last night at a reception, I happened to meet some people who run small businesses, who said that universities do not understand how business works&#151;but universities say that they do not like how business works, so we cannot blame either side. We must try to bang their heads together to make them work together. I do not mean that they should simply form small companies that offer advisory services: they should form companies that take basic, primaeval, blue skies discoveries and develop them into products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para40"><a name="stpa_160">It is time for us to stop simply paying lip service to all this. If we really believe in the future of biotechnology, which is a rosy and growing field, we have to back it up with good, solid training at all levels. The blame is not all on one side as far as universities and industry are concerned. It is time to cut the cackle and set up structures to make it really happen in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para41"><a name="stpa_161">There is no reason why we could not be No. 1 if we really wanted to be. We could produce double the number of companies that we are now producing. Every day&#151;or every week, who knows&#151;someone makes a discovery that, if the right person saw it, could be exploited into something useful to make our lives better. It happens to be drugs at the moment. I think that the use of drugs in this country will increase as we better understand the molecular processes behind diseases and how we can handle them. That will be a growing area. Currently, we do not have not have the right structures to handle things at the rate at which they are coming on board. There is a bright future, but lots to do.

Securing investment should encourage innovation and ensure that the UK economy will benefit as a result.

<a name="60425h02_para42"><a name="stpa_162">Britain&#039;s entrepreneurial bioscience sector is a leader in Europe, accounting for 27 per cent. of all entrepreneurial bioscience companies in Europe. The UK also accounts for 93 per cent. of all publicly quoted bioscience companies in Europe, and has a combined market capitalisation of &#163;5 billion. The industry is one of the fastest growing in the UK, with employment expanding at over 20 per cent. annually. Three quarters of biotechnology drugs in late-stage clinical trials in Europe are produced by British companies. Giants of British biotechnology, such as Celltech, dominate the continent. It is vital that investment and careful regulation should allow us to maintain our lead in this area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para43"><a name="stpa_163">Biotechnology is recognised as being part of the next wave of the knowledge economy. The market in Europe alone was expected to be worth more than $100 billion by 2005. More than 40,000 people are employed in the biotechnology industry, mostly in highly skilled jobs&#151;the sort of jobs that we need for the developing UK economy. The bioindustry has the potential to provide employment for millions of people in the UK, making it one of the most important emerging markets for our generation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para44"><a name="stpa_164">I pay tribute to the Government&#039;s efforts, because they have made significant efforts on the science agenda, but, more importantly, I pay tribute to bioindustry leaders. They have gone through many difficult times to make the industry successful. Before the Government get too excited by my praise, I shall point out that the level of research and development in the UK is poor. We all recognise that. Compared with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and European countries, we are well below the average for R and D. Pharmaceuticals and aerospace are the only exceptions in which we are doing well. Thankfully, however, the bioindustry is starting to pull things together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para45"><a name="stpa_165">There should be more effort to improve investment in R and D. The Government have made some progress in this area with R and D tax credits and the extension that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) mentioned, and with the framework for science and innovation, which is also great progress. There is also progress with Bioscience 2015, which has led to two world-class bioprocessing centres, including one in Edinburgh, and the single budget for medical research of more than &#163;1 billion a year. My Liberal Democrat colleagues and I want to ensure that none of that is just smoke and mirrors. Many expectations were raised through the science and innovation framework, but much of it has not yet been delivered. We need to ensure that it is delivered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para46"><a name="stpa_166">Some areas require further success. The science base in this country does well internationally. We produce many papers and do well in academic journals, but we need to do more to turn those ideas into businesses. That is where much of the transition work is required. With education, we often hear about the number of pupils taking up science, but there are great concerns on both sides of the border that not enough are taking up chemistry, biology and physics. If we are to sustain our economic success, we need pupils to come through the system.

Many academics who I come across do not believe that it is for them to get involved in business. We need to change that and encourage them to make that transition and identify ideas that could be business opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para48"><a name="stpa_168">Among public opinion, there is great concern about terrorists. As we progress with biotech advances, we should take the public with us so that they are not concerned about that progress.

<a name="60425h02_para49"><a name="stpa_169">I am greatly concerned that the financial pressures placed on universities mean that they often try to squeeze every last penny out of intellectual property. There needs to be a freer system in which they are encouraged to let IP go on in a more cost-effective way, so that we can encourage businesses to form clusters around universities rather than there being a squeeze for every last penny that IP is worth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para50"><a name="stpa_170">I turn to the situation north of the border, and my colleagues in the Scottish Executive, and encourage the Government to consider how the Executive are handling the progress of science there. Bringing together enterprise and higher education in one Department has meant that lessons have been learned on both sides of that divide about how to connect and address issues such as attitudinal change of academics. The Government should look at how the Scottish Executive is handling that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para51"><a name="stpa_171">The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, which is now the Scottish Funding Council, works closely with Scottish Enterprise to provide joint funds on the proof of concept and in other areas to ensure that we have seamless government encouraging many scientists to create businesses. A new initiative that is helping to sustain many science departments in Scotland is pooling arrangements, whereby chemistry and physics departments are pooled. I know that people in many other disciplines are considering how they can work together to get the critical mass that is required to compete on the international stage. I hope that the Government will consider the efforts that are being made in Scotland to advance the cause of science.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para52"><a name="stpa_172">It is right to recognise that progress has been made on the science agenda, but there is much more work to do in education and on ensuring that there is attitudinal change. It is also important to address the issue of public opinion. Finally, I hope that the Government will consider the efforts north of the border to make that advance.

For all the years that I have been on the Science and Technology Committee with him, as well as the different occasions when we have been colleagues, he has passionately championed science and technology.

and I started out feeling highly optimistic, but halfway through a sort of gloom took over me. He said that everything was going in the wrong direction and we have not done enough. By the end, however, he had convinced me that the Government have made a great deal of progress and that we need to do a lot more. Overall, I can at least share that spirit with him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para54"><a name="stpa_174">My hon. Friend talked about trying to enthuse young people so that they take science and technology seriously. I agree. Some of the things that are going wrong at our universities, with chemistry and physics departments being closed, are certainly worrying. We need to enthuse our young people to go into science and technology so that we create entrepreneurs and a biotechnology industry and make it a great success.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para55"><a name="stpa_175">My hon. Friend talked about the international and national perspective, and then went on to talk about Norwich. However, I want to talk about what the Government have done and how that has affected my area. I am proud of the Government, as they have done more to support science and technology than any previous Government in my lifetime. The science and technology budget has doubled since 1997. That is due to a step-by-step approach to ensure that we target the money in every sector, tackle problems for the long term and build a strong scientific base. That is to be commended. The Government have a tremendous record. I remember that pre-1997, science budgets were cut. Nowadays, they are increasing. It is a tremendous credit to the Government that that has happened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para56"><a name="stpa_176">I want also to acknowledge the influence of Government policy in the north-east and Tees valley. I want to talk about how biotechnology has affected the area and to say one or two things about where we will go from here, as well as some of the problems that I see. If we are to make progress&#151;we have already achieved a great deal&#151;I want the Minister to think about how we will deal with the problems, particularly in my area, because we should be thinking in the long term. I have talked to people in my area and they wanted me to pass on these matters to the Minister. I know that he cares passionately about the north-east.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para57"><a name="stpa_177">In the north-east, 45 companies have biotechnology interests, with 3,832 employees and a turnover of &#163;634 million. In addition, 23 of the companies actively engage in research and development and see that as a key business activity. The companies support 47 academic research projects, although 60 per cent. of those involve universities outside the north-east. I would love to see such activity within the north-east, but at the moment it is outside.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para58"><a name="stpa_178">In Tees valley, the smaller chemical companies are working closely with larger chemical producers, and they are interacting with the Wilton research centre, which is one of the best European centres for research and development in the chemical industry. The chemical process industry, which is vital to the economy of the Tees valley and the north-east, provides direct employment for 12,000 people and indirectly employs 65,000 across the UK. Of course, the biotechnology industry and the Tees valley have tremendous opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para59"><a name="stpa_179">As I mentioned in my intervention earlier, one of the great success stories has been the Centre for Process Innovation, which is part of the Wilton research centre.

Recently, it was announced that a national industrial biotechnology centre would be built. That was tremendous news for us, to be the first in the north-east to lead with the centre for biotechnology. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North mentioned the regional development agencies. Our RDA, One NorthEast, is certainly at the forefront and working in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline to try to support the centre. I can see that offshoot of the research centre offering an opportunity to those who want to engage in research, develop new processes and try new products. They will certainly benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para60"><a name="stpa_180">I am delighted that the centre, which will be only a few miles from my constituency, will benefit the whole area. We are delighted and grateful for the support that the centre has received from the Government. In years to come, there will be many offshoots in the north-east, in the spirit articulated by my hon. Friend. A study conducted by the north-east process industry cluster predicted a 32 per cent. rise in employment over five years for existing north-east companies, certainly in the biotechnology sector. It predicted that some 1,200 new, high-skilled jobs could be created.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para61"><a name="stpa_181">There is great concern about the skills requirement for our area. If we are to have a competent, successful biotechnology industry, we need to plan ahead. In the Tees valley and the north-east the issue has been raised over and over again that we need technicians. The Minister should discuss that with his colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills. We need biotechnicians, not graduates or advanced graduates&#151;we have them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North mentioned. Clever people&#151;those with PhDs, research fellows and academics of a higher calibre&#151;are not a problem. However, at technician level we are facing great difficulties. If we are to have a successful biotechnology industry, we need degree-level biotechnicians, and to deal with that we will need some sort of advanced modern apprenticeship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para62"><a name="stpa_182">Given that the centre will be ready in a few years&#039; time and that there will be other offshoots of companies, there will be a massive haemorrhage of technicians at the required level. If we do not have the skills, what are we going to do? Will we start looking abroad? We need to plan ahead, and that is the view of the north-east process industry cluster and of One NorthEast. The Minister would find it useful to consult them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para63"><a name="stpa_183">Once the biotechnology industry makes further progress, will the Minister consider having the universities collaborate more strongly together and with the biotechnology industry? There is some collaboration at present, but as we hope to make progress there is room for further interaction between the universities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para64"><a name="stpa_184">In my area, we have a successful chemical industry and a successful research and development centre. The offshoot of that is that we now have an emerging biotechnology centre. There are great opportunities in respect of some of the ideas that my hon. Friend talked about, but it is essential that everything happens in parallel&#151;such as the research work that needs to be carried out, and for which we have the skilled work force&#151;in order for us to have the outcome of a successful economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para67"><a name="stpa_187">Biotechnology is potentially one of the most exciting areas of wealth generation for our country for the foreseeable future. Although the people of the United Kingdom constitute 1 per cent. of the world population, we are responsible for 5 per cent. of the world&#039;s science and 12 per cent. of its scientific citations, and we are the second largest biotechnology country&#151;behind only the United States of America. Biotechnology is also one of the fastest growing industries in the UK; growth is 16 to 17 per cent. compared with 7 to 8 per cent. in the pharmaceutical industry generally. As the pharmaceutical industries are certainly no slouches, that gives us an understanding of how fast the biotechnology industry is moving. There are 455 dedicated biotechnology businesses, and more than 22,000 people are employed in the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para68"><a name="stpa_188">It is an important area, but, in respect of many aspects of global competitiveness, the UK is suffering in comparison with countries such as China and India, which are developing fast on our heels. China has plans to increase its investment in biotechnology threefold in the next five years, and the increase for India will be fivefold. Therefore, we must move quickly. This industry must be supported properly by the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para69"><a name="stpa_189">Members have spoken about their local areas. In the west midlands only last week, 2,300 redundancies were announced as a result of the Peugeot factory closure. It is clear that areas such as Coventry need to reinvent themselves in respect of high value-added areas of industry in order to be able to avoid suffering the problems of mass redundancies and the misery that that generates. Marine biotechnology is a particularly fast-growing field in Coventry. I am looking forward to there being assistance through Government agencies for the development of the infrastructure to enable biotechnology to be developed in the west midlands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para70"><a name="stpa_190">I shall now speak briefly about the role of the Government. We want the industry to be as free as possible to develop itself, but there are issues that the Government cannot avoid some involvement in. The hon. Member for Norwich, North talked about 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 222WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government investment, and my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie) mentioned research and development tax credits. The bioscience for business knowledge transfer network was announced this year, which will promote industries working together. We are looking forward to hearing how that develops. There will be some small additional investment in that as well from the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para71"><a name="stpa_191">The need for skills has also been mentioned. In the UK, it seems that science has been a poor relation in many academic circles, but there are some superb centres of excellence in our universities, which have been referred to. We need to convey the excitement of the challenge that biotechnology and related sciences present for the future of the country. Only in that way will we generate the necessary enthusiasm among young people for them to want to commit to a career in these fields. I also take on board the point of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) regarding biotechnicians; in that area, we need plenty of Indians, as well as chiefs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para72"><a name="stpa_192">With regard to the regulatory pathways, there has been some press criticism about the slowness of the food and drinks administration. That has held up our competitive advantage, particularly with the United States, which seems to get its act together a little more quickly in respect of regulatory pathways. Its pathways are, perhaps, a little smoother than ours in the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para73"><a name="stpa_193">One cannot talk about biotechnology without acknowledging that there are huge ethical issues that need to be addressed, such as stem cell research. We are hopeful that the solution to terrible afflictions such as Alzheimer&#039;s, Parkinson&#039;s and kidney failure can be found from stem cell research. There is also the controversy over the non-prescription of the Herceptin cancer drug. Anyone who has cancer and is in pain will appreciate the fundamental importance of the availability of potential life-saving treatments in those areas. I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Norwich, North about the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and its slowness sometimes in respect of being able to promote faster relief for people by the way that it operates and regulates the introduction of new drugs. There are also the issues of the potential for terrorist attacks, and the safety of the people who produce the various products.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para74"><a name="stpa_194">The hon. Gentleman also referred to animal testing. Although that is clearly an emotive and difficult issue, the Government cannot duck their responsibility in respect of such areas to consider the ethical views of all members of the population. Sadly, we saw the result of faulty testing on people only the other week, when monoclonal antibody tests were done that wreaked havoc in the six volunteers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para75"><a name="stpa_195">The final ethical issues that I want to raise relate to GM. People in this country have been much less accepting of that particular technology than those elsewhere. There are also big concerns about terminator technologies and the ethical effects that they will have for small businesses and farms in poorer, less developed countries. The Government have an interesting furrow to plough in the field of technology. I echo the comments of the Labour Members who have spoken and of my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife: we in this country need to facilitate the

<a name="60425h02_time4"><h5>12.1 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60425h02_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Eleanor Laing  (Epping Forest)</b>  (Con): I sincerely congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing the debate and giving us an opportunity to examine and debate this very important subject, which is so often forgotten. That is partly because if one mentioned that we were to have a debate on biotechnology to anyone walking the corridors, the most common reaction would be, &quot;What is biotechnology?&quot;, but in fact it is a science that permeates just about every area of life, including business and the economy. The hon. Gentleman highlighted all those points extremely well. It is a worthwhile exercise to bring the subject to the House to highlight what has to be done and how we ought to perceive this important industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para76"><a name="stpa_196">I am particularly pleased to support the hon. Gentleman because he and I are exclusive members of a very unusual all-party group, namely the all-party St. Mirren supporters group. For the uninitiated, St. Mirren is the football club of Paisley and has, after many years, just been promoted to the premier league. We are not an official all-party group because there are not enough of us to create one. The subject might not appear entirely relevant, but it is, because it shows that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to go out on a limb on subjects to which other people are not paying attention. He is a trailblazer in bringing to our notice matters that ought to be dealt with but often are not, such as the success of St. Mirren and the biotechnology industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para77"><a name="stpa_197">Normally, my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) responds for the Opposition on debates of this kind, but unfortunately he has other duties this morning. It gives me great pleasure to stand in for him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para78"><a name="stpa_198">Why does biotechnology matter? Several hon. Members have explained that very well. It matters enormously, first because the UK is a world leader, being second only to the United States in the development of bioscience. If we analyse the industries involved, that is not at all surprising. Innovation often begins in the UK, where we have the academic and business climate to let it begin to grow, but when it flourishes, too often our regulatory or economic regimes force companies abroad. That is not happening in biotechnology, and I hope that by highlighting the subject and allowing the Minister to address it&#151;at some length, I hope, for which reason I shall be brief&#151;we can make progress in supporting the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para79"><a name="stpa_199">It is not generally recognised&#151;although the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) mentioned it&#151;that 22,500 people are employed in biotechnology industries in the UK. The effect on the alternative investment market is significant. In 2005, the AIM&#151;sometimes described as London&#039;s junior stock exchange, because the general public do not understand what AIM is&#151;became the de facto global market for small bioscience companies, so biotechnology is important in not only industry and the academic world but the City, too. The fact that AIM is attracting listings from not only the UK 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 224WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
but the US, continental Europe and beyond is important in bringing investment and wealth into the City of London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para80"><a name="stpa_200">I have a few questions for the Minister, one of which regards the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. Sometimes, because of the way in which cross-product price modulation is set up, there can be a problem for smaller companies. As the hon. Member for Norwich, North, rightly said, it is, after all, in smaller companies that innovation occurs. They are the seedbeds of biotechnology growth. However, the way in which the PPRS is constructed can sometimes cause problems, because smaller companies typically launch only one or two products, rather than a range of products, and so cannot take advantage of cross-product price modulation in the way that larger companies can, so they do not benefit from the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. I appreciate that that is a subject that the Minister may have to consider, but it is worthy of consideration, because it would be a great pity if, inadvertently, smaller companies were put at a competitive disadvantage compared with larger companies, when it is those smaller companies that we desperately need to encourage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para81"><a name="stpa_201">We all know, from the excellent speeches this morning and from general coverage of such issues, just how important the development of bioscience and biotechnology are to the provision of antibiotics, vaccines and other drugs that are so important in health policy and in developing a better health service. However, the issue goes wider than that. It applies to international development issues such as the eradication of hunger caused by failed crops, for example. One of the solutions to that problem&#151;and I do not mean to make it sound simple&#151;is the development of biotechnology to improve crops. Likewise, we have enormous problems with energy supply and its security, and effects on the environment. Again, it is research currently being undertaken by small biotechnology companies and by the academic sector that will provide some of the solutions to problems to do with energy and the environment. Biofuels certainly represent an important avenue for reducing our dependence on oil and thus improving the quality of our environment. We have an opportunity here to bring that much ignored and misunderstood fact to general attention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para82"><a name="stpa_202">As has been said, it is unfortunate that the media in general often talk about the development of bioscience because of the illegal extremist activities of some who purport to care about animal welfare. Surely there is a way to balance the animal welfare that we all want to see with the need to test drugs. The UK is a world leader on the issue. Is it not better that testing on animals should occur under strictly regulated conditions in Britain? Companies would otherwise be driven away and test in less regulated conditions, which could be very harmful to the animals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para83"><a name="stpa_203">It is a pity that the criminal extremists who have waged campaigns against companies such as Huntingdon Life Sciences have been the conduit through which the subject of bioscience has been brought to general recognition. That is unfortunate because there is so much that is positive to say about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para84"><a name="stpa_204">What can we as a legislative body do to help nurture and enhance the biotechnology industry? I do not like to ask what the Government can do, because I do not

<br>&nbsp;<br>
believe that they should drive development and so on. However, it is the Government&#039;s role, on behalf of us all, to provide the necessary conditions in which this vital sector can flourish. I echo the words of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar), who talked about the importance of encouraging the study of science, not just among students at university but among technologically educated and qualified people at not only graduate but other levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para85"><a name="stpa_205">Such people are vital. At present, 22,500 people are employed in the sector, and I hope that the number will increase markedly during the next decade. It will not do so if the education system does not produce enough people properly educated in the right basic subjects. The challenge for the Government is to ensure that we have not only enough graduates but enough apprentices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para86"><a name="stpa_206">The second challenge&#151;the clash between public and private sector operations&#151;has been identified by the CBI as a problem. I identify a parallel clash between the business and academic worlds; in the biotechnology sector almost more than in any other, it is vital that the public sector works with the private sector and that business works with the academic sector, but at present there is a lack of cohesion and understanding. I do not suggest&#151;far from it&#151;that the Government could put that right with a legislative programme, but if the Minister assured us that he was aware of the problem, that would be a step in the right direction. I ask not for Government intervention but that the Government ensure that the economic and regulatory regime within which the biotechnology industries, so precious to our future economy, operate, is the right one, and that there are conditions for research and development to grow, to allow this vital sector of our industry to flourish.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para87"><a name="stpa_207">I conclude on that point, because I wish to ensure that the Minister has plenty of time to answer the important questions asked this morning.
</p>


<a name="time_14">
<a name="60425h02_time5"><h5>12.15 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60425h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Barry Gardiner) </b> : It is always a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. We have had a super debate. I always look forward to debates secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). We always touch on Norwich City football team&#151;that is an inevitable part of proceedings&#151;but to get on to St. Mirren was quite remarkable. Here am I, an old Queen&#039;s Park supporter&#151;my team still languishes in the Scottish second division, but we too have hopes and aspirations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para88"><a name="stpa_208">I ask you to forgive my rather croaky voice this morning, Mr. Cummings. I am sure that when I tell hon. Members that my eight-year-old&#039;s football team won the league cup on Sunday morning, they will appreciate why. I know that my hon. Friend, also, will forgive me for sounding rather more peculiar than usual.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para89"><a name="stpa_209">Although there is debate on the exact timing of the birth of the bioscience industry, it is generally accepted that it started with the founding of Genentech in the US in 1976. Since then, the industry has grown from a lone start-up to a sector that generates revenues of $63 billion globally. That is phenomenal growth by anyone&#039;s standards.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 226WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para90"><a name="stpa_210">The industry is still dominated by the US, and the relatively younger companies in Europe and Asia have significant challenges as they try to catch up. However, the UK&#039;s biotechnology sector is the largest in Europe&#151;globally, as has been said, it is second only to the US&#151;so we have an excellent platform on which to build our strategic support for the sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para91"><a name="stpa_211">Let me rehearse some of the basic facts, some of which have been mentioned. Biotechnology is recognised as the next wave of the knowledge economy. It represents one of the fastest-growing industries in the UK. Some 40 per cent. of all European public biotechnology companies are based here, and 43 per cent. of the biotechnology drugs in late-stage clinical trials in Europe are produced by British companies. Global sales of biotech drugs grew by 17 per cent. in 2005, giving sales of $53 billion. The sale of all pharma drugs grew by only 7 per cent., so the growth in sales of biotech drugs is astonishing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para92"><a name="stpa_212">There are approximately 455 dedicated bioscience companies in the UK, employing almost 22,500 people, and in 2003 they generated revenues of approximately &#163;3.6 billion and spent &#163;1.23 billion on research and development. The biotech industry has the potential to provide employment for millions of people in the European Union, making it one of the most important emerging sectors of our generation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para93"><a name="stpa_213">However, in this context it is also important to mention the pharmaceutical industry, a dynamic performer of key importance to the UK economy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar) said in relation to his constituency, it has helped the growth of the smaller bioscience companies and is increasingly benefiting from closer collaboration with them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para94"><a name="stpa_214">The pharma sector has an outstanding record of innovation, having discovered and developed a quarter of the world&#039;s top 100 medicines. Among the G7 economies, the productivity of drug discovery in the UK is second only to that of the US. The UK is home to two of the world&#039;s largest pharma companies, GSK and AstraZeneca, and all the leading global pharma companies have significant manufacturing and/or research and development facilities in the UK. They invest more than any other sector in R and D in the UK. The industry accounts for 0.6 per cent. of the UK&#039;s gross domestic product and generates the UK&#039;s biggest trade surplus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para95"><a name="stpa_215">The hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) said that the UK was not at the top of the European and global league for research and development, but she should realise that in the pharma and bioscience sectors, we are. The percentage of our GDP going into R and D is not at the top of the European league, but we are right at the top and the cutting edge of R and D in the pharma and bioscience sectors. Indeed, companies such as GSK and AstraZeneca make up more than 40 per cent. of the total UK spend on R and D in the private sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para96"><a name="stpa_216">The UK is one of the world&#039;s largest exporters of pharmaceuticals by value. In 2005, exports and the trade surplus totalled &#163;12.2 billion and &#163;3.4 billion respectively. The sector employs 73,000 people across all business segments, approximately 27,000 of whom are engaged in research and development activities. It also generates another 250,000 jobs in related industries. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 227WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Given the sector&#039;s enormous contribution to innovation, it is an essential partner in achieving the Government&#039;s targets under the 10-year science and innovation investment framework.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para97"><a name="stpa_217">The bioscience and pharmaceutical industries are closely related and are interdependent. Many of the factors that make the UK a good environment for those industries are common to both: a strong science base; highly-skilled staff; sound regulation; and close dialogue with Government. Just as big pharma increasingly looks to biotech companies to fill gaps in its product pipeline, so they rely on licensing revenues to finance their activities and on the developing and marketing expertise of big pharma to bring their discoveries to market.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60425h02_spnew9"><b> Dr. Gibson </b> : Can the Minister explain why small biotech companies in the States, of which there were many&#151;Gilead and so on&#151;have become, in a sense, big companies without a merger? Why has that not happened in Britain?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60425h02_spnew10"><b> Barry Gardiner </b> : The short answer is no, I cannot do so off the top of my, head. My hon. Friend raises an interesting question. I would take some time to establish a thesis as to why that has taken place, so I shall speak to my officials in the Department and write to him to develop our answer a wee bit further. There is an interesting difference between the two markets. I suspect&#151;this is off the top of my head&#151;that it has something to do with the more advanced venture capital structure of the US compared with ours in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para98"><a name="stpa_218">A key role of the Department of Trade and Industry is to ensure that the voice of business is heard across Whitehall, that Departments take account of business needs in framing their policies, and that successful businesses are encouraged to grow in an increasingly competitive environment. We need, therefore, to be constantly in touch with industry. There has been a long history of collaboration between Government and industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para99"><a name="stpa_219">I was particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland for the way in which he spoke about my colleague Lord Sainsbury. He was right that Lord Sainsbury has been an exceptional Minister for Science and Innovation. In 2002, he and other Ministers, met representatives from the BioIndustry Association, the UK&#039;s trade body for biotechnology. It was agreed that the time had come to take a more detailed look at some of the major issues affecting the sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para100"><a name="stpa_220">As a result of Lord Sainsbury&#039;s initiative, the Government decided to set up the bioscience innovation and growth team, chaired by Sir David Cooksey. Its task was to identify any barriers that could significantly hold back the sector&#039;s growth in the UK and to make recommendations about how those obstacles could be overcome. Although it has formally finished, a great deal of joint industry-Government activity is continuing. Ministers still have regular contact with industry. That will lead to a mid-term review of the BIGT by 2007&#150;08. Undoubtedly, the taskforce recommendations have helped to influence the shape of Government policy today. As a result, there have been 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
many improvements in the areas of finance and investment, bioprocessing, the European market, and national health service-industry partnerships.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60425h02_spnew11"><b> Dr. Gibson </b> : Does the Minister concede that the idea of a science city will precipitate the development of small businesses, as it has in the six existing science cities? Will that be part of his remit, which he mentioned in terms of biotech innovation and development? Does he think that the science city concept will make such development occur better?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="60425h02_spnew12"><b> Barry Gardiner </b> : My hon. Friend is pushing me for a clear commitment. I am unsure whether I would like to give him such a commitment. However, as he mentioned, anything that enables people to come together&#151;whether that be around a pint of Adnams ale or whether we are talking about a science city concept&#151;to work together and to develop innovative patterns of research and development and then push those through into products must be welcomed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para101"><a name="stpa_221">On finance, I am pleased with the outcome of the work that Paul Myners led on behalf of the Government to examine the issue of pre-emption rights, which, again, was raised in our debate. There is support for the greater flexibility of their application, which he recommended. Scott Dobie&#039;s reformed pre-emption group has been engaging industry and investors to agree new guidelines that will be published shortly. The next stage will be to monitor how they work in practice, but I am pleased with results so far from the constructive engagement of industry and investors. There has also been much dialogue with industry on research and development tax credits and their role in encouraging businesses to invest more in research and development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para102"><a name="stpa_222">On NHS-industry partnerships, the UK clinical research collaboration has been established. It is a partnership of Government, research organisations, NHS trusts and industry, united by the shared aim of establishing the UK&#039;s position as a world leader in clinical research by harnessing the power of the NHS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para103"><a name="stpa_223">EU better regulation was a priority for the UK presidency, and the Department of Trade and Industry is at the forefront of the Government&#039;s drive to improve the EU regulatory environment in this area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para104"><a name="stpa_224">I come to the central issue of skills, which was raised by several hon. Members. In November, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry published a report entitled &quot;Sustaining the Skills Pipeline in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries&quot;, which set out concerns about the supply of suitably qualified graduates and technicians, and in particular the decline of in vivo practical skills. The report is excellent. Lord Sainsbury and Sir David King have responded by supporting some of the key recommendations, and the DTI is working with the ABPI to set up an in vivo taskforce.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para105"><a name="stpa_225">We are also sympathetic to the view that there should be a science diploma for 14 to 19-year-olds. Again, that picks up on the themes of co-operation and joined-up thinking between the DTI and the Department for Education and Skills mentioned by hon. Members. The Government are determined that through that collaborative approach they will play their full part in ensuring that the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have a steady supply of the qualified graduates and technicians that they need.

<a name="60425h02_para106"><a name="stpa_226">Partly because it has been topical, partly because hon. Members have raised the issue, and partly because I wanted to give the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) the opportunity perhaps to correct a misapprehension that she may have shown in her remarks, I want to discuss the issue of the testing at Northwick Park. She said that there was &quot;faulty testing&quot;. I want to scotch such an idea, because it is clear that, to date, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has found no evidence to suggest that there was any problem with the manufacture of the new monoclonal antibody TGN 1412, nor did the MHRA find any problems with the administration of the clinical trial which are likely to have contributed to the serious adverse incidents that took place at Northwick Park.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h02_para107"><a name="stpa_227">The MHRA is still carrying out further tests to confirm those findings, but if they are confirmed, it would appear that there was something peculiar about the product and its mode of operation in human beings which led to the adverse incidents.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60425h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jeremy Browne  (Taunton)</b>  (LD): Thank you, Mr. Cummings, for allowing me to introduce this extremely important, albeit short, debate. As hon. Members from throughout the country but particularly from southern England will be aware, the Government propose to build many hundreds of thousands of extra new homes in the coming years. There is a strong need for some additional development. The <i>Somerset County Gazette</i>, a newspaper widely read in my constituency, had as its front-page splash last Thursday a feature on house prices in Taunton. It makes quite staggering reading. In 1995, the average house in Taunton cost &#163;59,784; by 2005, a decade later, the price of the average house in Taunton had risen to &#163;191,811&#151;an increase of 320 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para0"><a name="stpa_230">The ratio of average earnings to average house prices has made things very difficult for people in my constituency. Indeed, that scenario will be familiar to most, if not all, hon. Members. It is difficult for my constituents to afford to buy a property, so I am in no doubt about the need for extra development. People come to my surgery and say that they cannot find suitable social housing. People also say that they aspire to being first-time house buyers, but that not enough stock is available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para1"><a name="stpa_231">My concern, though, and the subject of this debate is not the numbers of new houses, which we have debated many times in the House, but the quality of those houses and how we go about providing for new communities in the future. I shall touch on three aspects of that issue. The first is best illustrated by an example. There is a community, a collection of houses, about four or five miles from Taunton, although it is still in my constituency. The community is in an area called Cotford St. Luke. Previously, Cotford St. Luke had only a handful of houses, but the local authority decided that it would provide additional accommodation by dramatically expanding Cotford St. Luke and allowing developers to build hundreds of new houses. I think that there are now about 1,000 houses in Cotford St. Luke.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para2"><a name="stpa_232">The expansion started about six or seven years ago, but it was not until three years after it had begun that a primary school was opened in the village. By that stage, several hundred houses had been built. Many of them were lived in by first-time buyers who were attracted to the area and had children of primary school age, yet their children were going to schools in nearby villages such as Bishop&#039;s Lydeard and Oake and they were not forming a new community, even though they had moved to the village presumably with the intention of getting to know people in that area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para3"><a name="stpa_233">It was not until about a month ago that Cotford St. Luke, after many years of effort, finally had a shop. The population of Cotford St. Luke had reached about 2,000, yet it was impossible to buy a pint of milk, a pint of beer or anything else there. The only gathering point was the primary school, which, as I mentioned, opened only three years or so after the development began in earnest. Now, Cotford St. Luke has a shop, which is a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
breakthrough, but it still does not have a doctor&#039;s surgery, a church&#151;at least, none has been built&#151;or many other amenities that people would enjoy, including a pub, which is much sought after by many of the residents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para4"><a name="stpa_234">I say all that because there is a difficulty in building large estates, whether they are in areas such as Cotford St. Luke or part of existing towns, without such amenities and without many public transport routes, which is often the case. As a result, the people who live in such estates are unlikely to know and bond with their neighbours and are forced in nearly all circumstances to use a car, whether to buy a pint of milk or a pint of beer. Here we are as a Parliament and a group of politicians trying to lead a national debate about the importance of climate change and avoiding unnecessary car usage, while throughout the country new estates are being built where it is almost impossible for the inhabitants to manage in even the most basic way without a car. We and the Government need to deal with that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para5"><a name="stpa_235">The second issue that I want to turn my mind to&#151;all the issues are related&#151;is urban spaces and parks. Again, it is well illustrated by an example. There is an area in Taunton called Holway, and at the centre of Holway is Holway green. The council proposes, as part of its quota of houses, a new development on Holway green and that approximately two thirds of the green be concreted over and turned into new houses. The people who live in the area feel extremely strongly about that. The problem is that it deprives them of one of the few areas in their community where they can walk their dog and where their children can play football&#151;often, they can do so within view of their house, so the parents feel that the children are safe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para6"><a name="stpa_236">I read in the newspapers that the Government estimate that about one third of children are overweight&#151;many of them are obese&#151;and that that is creating, in the words of one senior health professional, &quot;a timebomb&quot; for future generations in terms of ill health. At the same time, however, another wing of the Government is permitting green spaces in urban environments to be built on, presumably with the likelihood of a consequent reduction in physical activity by children and others in the area. I therefore support the Holway residents in their desire to see that part of Taunton retained with a green space in it. I understand why that issue is of concern to people throughout the country where councils are being urged to meet the targets on house building and are looking at places that they previously would not have considered appropriate, including parks and other green spaces in urban environments. There is a big difference between those and the brown spaces, the brownfield sites, that people often hear cited.

Is it the policy of his party and of those on its Front Bench to support the ten-minute Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) in his attempt to ensure that garden space is not continually designated as brownfield land?

<br>&nbsp;<br>
for myself and say that I have followed the campaign of the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) closely and I understand the point that he is making. I personally would not wish to see building on gardens ruled out in all circumstances, and I suspect that quite a lot of people who own big gardens would not wish that to be ruled out in all circumstances either. However, I do not believe that the presumption should be towards building on garden spaces that are currently enjoyed by people in a different way from brownfield sites.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60425h03_spnew3"><b> Lorely Burt  (Solihull)</b>  (LD): The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) mentioned the ten-minute Bill regarding garden space. I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) has supported my ten-minute Bill, which relates to the planning law in respect of gardens being designated as brownfield sites instead of green space. Additionally, with regard to his earlier point about the sale of parkland, local authorities should not be in a position to sell off valuable parkland&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60425h03_spnew4"><b> John Cummings  </b> (in the Chair): Order. Interventions should be short.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60425h03_spnew5"><b> Lorely Burt </b> : I beg your pardon, Mr. Cummings. I have probably made my point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60425h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : I do not wish to sound unduly partisan on this issue. Both interventions illustrate a concern, which other hon. Members have, about preserving the natural environment and the quality of life both in our rural communities and in our towns. We accept that additional housing development is needed, but it needs to take place with the utmost sensitivity, because we are talking about a transformation being made in the communities that we represent and sometimes it appears that sufficient thought has not been given to that process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para7"><a name="stpa_237">I shall quote in my support, perhaps unusually, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron). I had not intended to do so, but the opportunity has presented itself. He said in his current campaign for the local elections:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Our parks and green spaces play a vital part in improving the quality of life we all enjoy&#151;especially in urban areas, where they serve as the &#039;green lungs&#039; of towns and cities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para8"><a name="stpa_238">I agree with that. My only difficulty is that it is a Conservative council in the area that I represent that wants to build on Holway green. There are difficult challenges for all of us in trying to reconcile laudable objectives with the reality on the ground.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para9"><a name="stpa_239">My final point concerns the design of houses, and I can divide it into three areas as well. First, houses are built very densely. I understand why that was done, and if I were to tell a group of people, &quot;We can halve the density, but we will take up twice the number of green fields&quot;, I suspect that they would be a great deal less enthusiastic about having less densely packed houses than they might have been. None the less, I am concerned that density appears excessive sometimes. We may be storing up social problems when we build housing estates where people literally cannot see a tree or a blade of grass because the houses built in such a tightly packed area are so oppressive and bear down on them to such an extent.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para10"><a name="stpa_240">The second area concerns distinctive local materials. I would like people who are walking around a new housing development in Taunton to know that they are in Somerset because of the type of brick used and the style of architecture. The experience would be different from being in Warwickshire, Norfolk or any other part of the country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60425h03_spnew7"><b> Michael Gove </b> : Once again, I am compelled to applaud the hon. Gentleman&#039;s sentiments. However, given that it is Liberal Democrat policy to put VAT on the construction of all new homes, would the additional cost mean that many new house builders, including volume house builders, would not have the space in their margins to buy and use the local materials that we would both like to see form part of new housing design and construction?
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60425h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point, but I fear that many developers will look to use their margins for profit, rather than to be sympathetic to the use of local building materials. There is also a wider point about whether we transport bricks hundreds of miles or use materials that are provided locally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para11"><a name="stpa_241">The third area, which may be the biggest challenge on a global scale, is this. In southern England, we are about to build hundreds of thousands of new houses. When people look back a century from now and consider whether we rose to the challenge in this coming decade, they may deem that we were not as successful as we would have liked. I am talking about features such as solar panelling, wind turbines on top of houses and improved home insulation. Many of those features are very difficult to fit to existing houses and are extremely expensive. The financial return comes over many years, if not decades. However, new houses present a new opportunity to improve environmental standards and the amount of energy that houses consume.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para12"><a name="stpa_242">When we are judged by people at the turn of the next century, I hope that they look back and say, &quot;Gosh, 95 years ago there was a boom in house building and a lot of towns changed markedly, but didn&#039;t the people at that time really use their initiative, flair and architectural imagination? They incorporated the latest techniques that really made a difference to the planet, carbon emissions and global warming. And didn&#039;t they do so in a way that was sympathetic to their environment? Far from detracting from the local architecture and character of places such as Somerset, they actually enhanced it. They were imaginative in how they allowed people to walk and how they allowed communities to form. They didn&#039;t just rely on people using their cars.&quot; I fear that when people look back at the turn of this century, they will not look as favourably on this period of development as we might wish.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para13"><a name="stpa_243">Taunton has a population of about 60,000. The regional spatial strategy&#151;a rather ugly phrase to describe housing development throughout the country&#151;proposes a massive extension of the town, particularly concentrated in an area called Monkton Heathfield on the edge of Taunton, which would increase the size of the town by as much as 40 to 50 per cent. from its existing size during the lifetime of that programme. That will make a marked difference to our

<br>&nbsp;<br>
community and we must be mindful of the way in which we balance the legitimate need for extra social housing and of first time buyers to get on the housing ladder with the need to preserve the character of the town, which, after all, is what attracted people to stay there or move there in the first place. That is my challenge, in Taunton Deane, which I represent, in Exmoor and right across the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para14"><a name="stpa_244">I finish with this observation, which the Minister may like to dwell on during his response. It is fairly straightforward to construct a collection of houses, but it is much harder to build a community. The Government, who are putting house building targets before Parliament, and local authorities throughout the country, need to be mindful of the need to build strong future communities as well as extra housing developments.

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60425h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair today, Mr. Cummings. I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) on securing the debate on the important topic of environmentally sustainable housing. I pay tribute to his generosity in giving way to two other hon. Members to promote ten-minute Bills that were not his own, as well as providing them with some ammunition for local election literature during the next week or so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para15"><a name="stpa_245">I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are committed to protecting and enhancing the environment, to improve the quality of life of people today and to provide a more sustainable legacy for future generations, which was at the forefront of his points. New developments bring environmental pressures. However, planned strategic growth rather than incremental development should bring fewer environmental impacts because it allows for environmental pressures to be planned for, accommodated and mitigated at a strategic land site level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para16"><a name="stpa_246">The Department is working hard to use land sustainably, minimise impacts and seize the opportunity to raise the environmental performance of what we build. Draft planning policy statement 3 re-emphasises that brownfield land is the priority for development. Authorities are required to prioritise the allocation of brownfield land when they update their five-year supply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para17"><a name="stpa_247">The hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) referred to the ten-minute Bill of the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark).

This matter is current and the ten-minute Bill will create more interest in it in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para18"><a name="stpa_248">Draft PPS3 retains the requirement that regions and local planning authorities should set brownfield targets in order to contribute to achieving the national target by 2008 of at least 60 per cent. of new housing development being built on brownfield land. In 1997, only 56 per cent. of new housing was built upon brownfield sites. In 2004, 72 per cent. of new building took place on brownfield sites. We are using land more efficiently, the national target has already been exceeded, and the challenge is to sustain that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para19"><a name="stpa_249">The efficient use of land is also achieved through density policy, a point raised by the hon. Gentleman. Draft PPS3 sets out a presumption that the minimum density of housing should be no less than 30 dwellings per hectare. It promotes a more flexible approach to density, setting out indicative ranges of densities by location. Between 1997 and 2004, national average housing densities rose from 25 to 40 dwellings per hectare. The Government have also been looking more closely at how infrastructure is funded to support our growth ambitions, ensuring that we can plan and deliver our infrastructure alongside new housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para20"><a name="stpa_250">Consultation has recently closed on a proposed planning gain supplement, which would capture a modest portion of the increase in land value that occurs when full planning permission is granted. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath has raised that issue in previous debates. A significant majority of planning gain supplement revenues would go back to the local authority area from which they were raised, to help local communities share the benefits of growth and manage its impacts. The remainder would be used to finance regional and strategic infrastructure to promote growth.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60425h03_spnew11"><b> Michael Gove </b> : Will the Minister enlighten us on what that significant proportion is? Will he tell us if and when the planning gain supplement comes in? What proportion will be spent on the local authority in which development takes place? What proportion will be spent regionally?

<p>
<a name="60425h03_para24"><a name="stpa_254">In the Thames Gateway and the three growth areas that were announced as part of the sustainable communities plan in 2003, the ODPM is working closely with partners throughout the Government and the private and community sectors to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is available to support planned housing growth in those priority locations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para25"><a name="stpa_255">In the Thames Gateway, where an additional 120,000 dwellings are planned, significant funding has been committed, including &#163;1.3 billion to provide transport infrastructure, &#163;1.6 billion for skills, &#163;1.3 billion for education and &#163;400 million for health, to ensure that infrastructure is provided alongside housing growth. Although my constituency is urban, being London docklands, the infrastructure deficiencies of the London Docklands development corporation were very much a feature of the difficulties in east London. They are now being remedied with more investment in infrastructure, so I am familiar with those problems that the hon. Member for Taunton raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para26"><a name="stpa_256">In our other growth areas, strategic growth plans are being developed to inform growth ambitions. For example, in Milton Keynes, the Milton Keynes Partnership is in the process of producing for the area a plan called MK 2031. It will act as a stepping stone for future statutory development plans at regional and local levels. It will include proposals for new schools, health centres, parks and open spaces, and identify future locations for housing, jobs and transport links. It will ensure that from the outset of the planning process, the needs of that expanding community are understood. That approach will strengthen the planning process and ensure that growth is sustainable over the longer term.

<p>
<a name="60425h03_para27"><a name="stpa_257">The Government&#039;s response to the Barker review of housing supply, which was released in December 2005, took further our commitment to protect and enhance the environment alongside increased housing growth. We announced a number of new environmental initiatives that aim to address environmental pressures and minimise environmental impact. They include a code for sustainable buildings, a commitment to regulate for water efficiency, new planning policies to help manage flood risk, mandating the use of site waste management plans, earmarking 10 per cent. of growth area funding for green space projects, and ensuring that future locations for growth are identified in partnership with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency and, when established, Natural England.

build. The new changes to part L of the building regulations, taken together with changes to strengthen the regulations in 2002, will improve energy efficiency standards by 40 per cent. The tough new standards came into effect on 6 April. They will deliver savings of 0.9 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, which is equivalent to the amount of carbon that would be emitted from almost 1 million dwellings built to previous building regulations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para29"><a name="stpa_259">We have also developed the draft code for sustainable homes in partnership with the building industry, so that when people make a purchase, they shall be able to see how well their home will perform. It will become a major selling point: people will be able to see how energy efficient their home is, and compare the long-term costs of running their home in the same way in which consumers take into account energy efficiency of household appliances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para30"><a name="stpa_260">We are committed to regulating for water efficiency. This summer, we plan to consult on proposals to drive up water efficiency in new buildings, and existing buildings when fittings are replaced. We are regularly asked, &quot;Why not make the code for sustainable homes mandatory?&quot; We have already strengthened the building regulations to deliver significant efficiency savings. They are mandatory. We are also revising the code to set higher standards. The revised code will form the basis for the next wave of improvements to building regulations. That makes it clear that we are committed to this agenda and to raising standards. However, the code covers a range of issues, so it is complex to impose immediately. Our way of imposing it will give the industry time to catch up with the policy and plan ahead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para31"><a name="stpa_261">The Government are working with a variety of partners to achieve the vision for environmentally sustainable housing. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, which promotes high quality architecture and urban design to raise the standards of the built environment across England, and the Academy for Sustainable Communities, a new national and international centre of excellence for the skills and knowledge needed to create and renew local communities, are key partners in raising the environmental performance of what we build. Through case studies, forums and engagement with industry, we are working together to demonstrate that environmentally sustainable housing is not just an abstract idea, but a reality that can, and more importantly, must be achieved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para32"><a name="stpa_262">We are already seeing huge environmental improvements within residential developments, and in response to the point that the hon. Gentleman just made, we intend to do better still. English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency, has recently completed one of the biggest single public land acquisitions ever: the purchase of the disused Oakington barracks in south Cambridgeshire. The 288 hectare site will become the new town of Northstowe, creating about 10,000 new homes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para33"><a name="stpa_263">In developing the site, English Partnerships hopes to achieve up to 50 per cent. reductions on energy and mains water use, compared with conventional housing. It is considering such designs and technology as microgeneration through photovoltaic panels or tiles on roofs, and through windpower; solar water heating through roof mounted collectors, which can supply 50 per cent. of the energy needed for hot water; reduced energy use through better design features, such as putting the larger windows on south facing walls, using reflective green roofs and installing high performance insulation materials; water efficient fittings, such as taps and showerheads; rainwater collection and grey-water recycling for secondary uses, such as flushing toilets; and reduced waste water, through sustainable drainage techniques, which might include on-site treatment and the use of natural watercourses as part of the landscaping. All that is possible. It shows how far we have come.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para34"><a name="stpa_264">I welcome this debate as an opportunity to discuss those matters, raise awareness of Government policy and seek views from colleagues about those policies. The hon. Member for Taunton raised the issue of green space projects. Developing growth areas is about not only additional housing, but the creation of sustainable and mixed communities. The strapline for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is &quot;Building Sustainable Communities&quot;, as the hon. Gentleman knows. It means providing that green spaces improve the urban environment and create an important place that people can enjoy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h03_para35"><a name="stpa_265">Green spaces provide important environmental functions such as absorbing and filtering airborne and waterborne pollutants, providing shelter and urban cooling, protecting biodiversity and mitigating flood risk.

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60425h04_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Madeleine Moon  (Bridgend)</b>  (Lab): I am glad, Mr. Cummings, that you are chairing this debate, which is my first Westminster Hall debate. It is taking place during Parkinson&#039;s awareness week. The Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society is using this week to launch its &quot;Get it on time&quot; campaign to ensure that people with Parkinson&#039;s disease in hospitals and care homes get their medication on time, every time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para0"><a name="stpa_266">This campaign should not be needed. Having worked in health and social services settings for 25 years, managed a joint health and social services team working with people with dementia, written social services contracts and been an inspector with the Care Standards Inspectorate for Wales, I cannot accept that a charity focusing on a long-term degenerative condition should need to launch a campaign that focuses on patients receiving their medication on time. This is not just an issue of patient choice, but an example of health and social care settings failing to provide basic care, basic rights and basic protection and quality of life for those with Parkinson&#039;s disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para1"><a name="stpa_267">I want to make clear the implications for someone with Parkinson&#039;s disease of not getting the right medication on time. Parkinson&#039;s disease is a degenerative neurological condition for which there is currently no known cure. Consequently, clinical treatment focuses on management and control of symptoms. Parkinson&#039;s disease occurs as a result of loss of cells that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is one of the brain&#039;s chemical messengers and enables people to perform co-ordinated movements. We do not know why those cells die.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para2"><a name="stpa_268">The main treatment for Parkinson&#039;s disease is medication, and specific drugs work by replacing or mimicking the action of dopamine. Patients are often on a number of drugs, each of which must be taken throughout the day at specific times. Alun Morgan, who is chair of my local Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society, needs a mixture of five tablets and capsules at 7.30, 10.30, 12,30, 2.30 and 6.30. They stimulate a complex, carefully timed release of chemicals to the brain to control his symptoms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para3"><a name="stpa_269">Common conditions and features of Parkinson&#039;s disease can include slow walking, poor posture, freezing&#151;that is, inability to move&#151;a running gait of small, unsteady steps with the result that patients are liable to fall, and a tendency to stoop backwards when walking. The proper timing of medication is vital to managing the symptoms. If someone with Parkinson&#039;s disease is unable to take their prescribed medication at the right time, the chemical balance is altered and disrupted, and to their disease can become uncontrollable. With an uneven release of dopamine, a person may suddenly be unable to get out of their chair, walk or get out of bed. Their sleep may become disturbed and their bowel and kidney function and digestion may be affected and they may have mood swings, hallucinations, anxiety and fear. All those things may happen because they do not get their medication on time. Once that balance of chemicals has been upset it may take hours, days or even weeks to get it right again and to stabilise it so that the patient and their carer can get on with life again.

<p>
<a name="60425h04_para4"><a name="stpa_270">The Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society is using this week to lobby hospitals, chief executives, chief nursing officers, chief pharmacists, consultant neurologists and geriatricians, and patient advice and liaison services to promote awareness of the disease and the need for prescribing accuracy and access to correct and timely medication. Following the awareness week, the society plans to move on to target the care sector and raising standards in care homes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para5"><a name="stpa_271">With so many problems, new initiatives, developments and questions concerning Parkinson&#039;s disease, the society should not have to spend its time and money and its members&#039; resources on raising the attention of professionals to what should be a basic standard of awareness, care and provision in hospitals and care homes. Sadly, the daily experience of patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease shows that it does need to spend that time and effort.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para6"><a name="stpa_272">From my past working experience, I know that there is no simple reason why people with Parkinson&#039;s disease may not get their medication on time. All too often, nurses and care staff do not understand the condition or how important it is to stick to a medication regime. With the new faster pace of the national health service, patients may be admitted to wards where the nurses have no experience or background of nursing patients with Parkinson&#039;s disease. Friends who are nurses tell me that with the spread of specialism in nursing, nurses&#039; general bank of information and knowledge about a wide range of conditions is being lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para7"><a name="stpa_273">On the whole, hospitals do not allow patients to bring into hospital the medication that was dispensed at home by their general practitioner and that works for them. The hospital pharmacy may not have the required medication or it may take some time to obtain it. Sometimes the pharmacy sends up standard-release medication as a substitute for slow-release medication, which substantially alters the nature of the medication for the patient. Meanwhile, the lack of understanding of Parkinson&#039;s disease, coupled with the inflexibility of drugs rounds in hospitals and care homes, can have a devastating effect on the patient&#039;s functioning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para8"><a name="stpa_274">A survey of Parkinson&#039;s disease nurse specialists uncovered the nature and extent of current problems in hospitals. None of the nurses who responded to the survey said that in their hospital medication was always administered on time to Parkinson&#039;s disease patients and only one in four said that that normally happens. One in five believed that patients rarely or never received their medication on time, 46 per cent. felt that awareness of medicine management among hospital staff was not high and one in 11 felt that ward staff were very unaware of medicine management in relation to Parkinson&#039;s disease. It was noted in additional comments that missing medication caused disturbance and distress to patients and carers and exacerbated the condition, and knowledge of pre-operative and post-operative medicine protocols and the interaction of Parkinson&#039;s disease drugs with other medication was described as limited.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para9"><a name="stpa_275">If there is slow progress in some hospitals, there is even greater lack of progress in medication management and the rights of patients in care homes. In February this year, the Commission for Social Care Inspection published &quot;Handled with care?&quot; It showed that nearly half of care homes for older people and younger adults, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 241WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
which provided 210,000 resident places, are still not meeting the minimum standards relating to medication. That lack of responsiveness suggests that care homes do not have sufficient incentives to take change on board, despite the risk of prosecution. I saw that at first hand as an inspector. I saw drug rounds not having started two hours after they were due and out-of-date medication on trolleys. I saw medication for a specific patient given to someone else with an adverse reaction as a result.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para10"><a name="stpa_276">The inspectorate&#039;s report shows that between 2003 and 2005, the proportion of homes for older people and younger adults meeting the national minimum standards for medication increased to only 55.5 per cent. in homes for older people and to 61.5 per cent. in homes for younger adults. The report states that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;the standard for medication is amongst the most infrequently met in care homes, and the improvement in performance is slow compared to the marked improvement seen in many other standards over the past three years.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para11"><a name="stpa_277">Inspectorate pharmacists have also identified risks to service users because of the poor standard or complete absence of training for care workers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para12"><a name="stpa_278">That report is about England, but the situation is no different in Wales, where colleagues confirm that the report mirrors practices and difficulties that are experienced there. Why is this happening? Homes must meet standards on medication, which require administration by designated and appropriately trained staff. Training for care staff must be accredited and include basic information about how medicines are used and how to recognise and deal with problems of use, but sadly there is no commonly agreed accreditation programme. I have seen older, experienced staff pass on bad practice to new staff, then sign a training form and call it accredited training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para13"><a name="stpa_279">I do not want to be unremittingly depressing during this debate, as change is happening, and good practice does occur. Changes are made as a result of listening to patients and their carers. One simple change has been to provide pill timers to nurses. They carry the timers and know when the alarm sounds that it is time for the Parkinson&#039;s patients to have their medication. Sadly, the timers are not generally available&#151;a Parkinson&#039;s patient will find them extremely difficult to get from their local pharmacy&#151;but some hospitals are gradually rolling them out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para14"><a name="stpa_280">Some hospitals have made training videos with their local Parkinson&#039;s society and provided laminated posters and information sheets for ward staff. One hospital has a database that highlights Parkinson&#039;s patients coming in, so that the pharmacy will know that it has to get in a supply of their medication.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para15"><a name="stpa_281">When doing the research for this debate, I was most impressed by a new procedure piloted in a hospital where joined-up thinking has helped solve many of the problems. By establishing medication records within hospital and community pharmacy services, patients&#039; records can be updated if a GP changes their prescription. A new drug chart with a different appearance and colour that highlights the fact that

&nbsp;<br>

Parkinson&#039;s patients have different medication needs reminds nurses that such patients must receive their medication on time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60425h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jeremy Browne  (Taunton)</b>  (LD): I applaud the time and attention that the hon. Lady has given to the needs of Parkinson&#039;s disease sufferers. Does she share my desire for the Minister to speak about the search for potential cures for Parkinson&#039;s disease, in particular stem cell research? Britain has a real opportunity to carry on with pioneering work and lead the world in easing the suffering of millions of people around the world who suffer from Parkinson&#039;s disease and, for that matter, other terrible genetic conditions. People could benefit on an even greater scale from the work being done here in Britain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60425h04_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Moon </b> : I thank the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) for his intervention. I appreciate his interest in the debate, and especially for staying on after his own debate to take part in this one. I know that he has a personal interest in the matter, as a member of his family has developed Parkinson&#039;s disease. I hope that the Minister will be able to give some time to the issue that the hon. Gentleman raises, but today I wish to emphasise the importance of Parkinson&#039;s awareness week and the campaign about medication. This matter must end here, this week. We must not have this debate ever again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para16"><a name="stpa_282">In the hospital to which I referred, a new system is being developed for Parkinson&#039;s patients to self-administer their medication, which is important. The hospital has been able to develop clinical governance and an assessment that allows staff to decide whether a patient needs nurses to monitor the timing of their medication. If such patients cope at home, why cannot they cope in hospital? They can manage their own medication, and they know that they will get it on time. The hospital also has a system in place to ensure that it is well supplied at all times with Parkinson&#039;s medication.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para17"><a name="stpa_283">Those arrangements mean that if a patient is deemed capable, they are given a little bum-bag&#151;excuse the expression&#151;containing their medication, which they can take when they are ready. They do not have to wait for nurses to be ready. Patients with Parkinson&#039;s are not always able to self-administer their medication, but the campaign and the hospital provided a training regime for all the nursing staff in the hospital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para18"><a name="stpa_284">As well as the &quot;Get it on time&quot; campaign, the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society is making one small financial request for an extension of funding for the medicines management collaborative project, which has done so much good work to promote progress and best practice in medicine management across so many trusts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para19"><a name="stpa_285">There are care standards, clinical governance standards, medicine management frameworks and national service frameworks, yet we are having this debate. It is still necessary for staff working in hospitals and care homes to receive training and to come to understand Parkinson&#039;s and why timely medical management is critical. Hospital and care home staff must be asked to listen to people with Parkinson&#039;s and to their carers and families. Monitoring and recording of adverse drug incidents due to mistimed medication must increase, hospital pharmacists must stock an easily

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
accessible, broad range of Parkinson&#039;s medicine and people with Parkinson&#039;s who have the capacity to self-administer must be urged to do so. Finally, people with Parkinson&#039;s must get their medication on time, every time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para20"><a name="stpa_286">Those are modest demands. If implemented, they would not only improve the care and protection of those with Parkinson&#039;s, but save patients, carers and care and nursing staff from having to cope with the trauma and indignity of Parkinson&#039;s patients not being able to stand, walk, think, hold a cup or turn in bed, or becoming confused and hallucinating or being distressed by incontinence. Medication on time means independence, dignity, safety, control, protection&#151;all priorities set out in the Government&#039;s dignity in care campaign. Along with medication that is given on time, people with Parkinson&#039;s will be given dignity. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s reply.
</p>

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60425h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne) </b> : Thank you, Mr. Cummings, for the opportunity to respond to this debate. I did not compete in the London marathon yesterday, but I am training for a half-marathon that will take place soon. Frankly, it would have been quicker to have run from Liverpool street this morning. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) on her powerful contribution this afternoon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para21"><a name="stpa_287">This is Parkinson&#039;s awareness week. I wish to start by recognising the importance of raising public awareness about those who live with the disease&#151;not just the people who have the disease, but their carers and families. I pay tribute to the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society for the important part that it plays in providing support, advice and information that make a world of difference to so many people who live with Parkinson&#039;s every day. The society is an essential part of the support and care that is now on offer in this country, and it should be proud of the work that it has done in the past few years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para22"><a name="stpa_288">The background to today&#039;s debate is the transformation of care, particularly for older people. Most people who suffer from Parkinson&#039;s disease are over 50, so they are the very people who have benefited from the remarkable changes in the national health service and the social care system over the past few years. Life expectancy is at a record high, and GPs and consultants are now far less likely arbitrarily to deny care to older people in the way that we know happened once upon a time. For example, heart surgery for the over-75s has gone up from 2 per cent. to 10 per cent. That is a good example of how age discrimination has been stamped out in the past few years. That did not happen by accident, but because of our approach, the application of our values and our record investment in the health and social care system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para23"><a name="stpa_289">Not only do older people now get treated when they go into hospital but they get home faster. We have slashed the number of delayed discharges from over 7,000 on any given day in 2001 to just over 2,000 by December 2005. When older people get home, they are provided with far greater support than in the past. Homes with home care are up by more than 52 per cent. since 1998&#150;99, and 40 per cent. more people are supported in living at home than in the past. That is very 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 244WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
much the result of implementation of our idea that, for most people, the best care home is their own home. We made that possible through free nursing care, regardless of setting; rapid assessments for social services; and free community equipment and intermediate care services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para24"><a name="stpa_290">There are just five points that I want to make in response to my hon. Friend. The first is about how we conduct care. She talked about the national service framework, and it is important that we have such a framework. It took a long time to develop, and I am particularly grateful to the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society and others for ensuring that there was effective input into it. The NSF focuses on improving services across England; it is an ambitious plan, and we will not achieve it overnight, which is why it has a 10-year time horizon. However, the vision on every page of the NSF is very simple: it is about ensuring that people with neurological conditions live life to the full in 21st century Britain. We have done an enormous amount to transform opportunity over the past few years, and everybody needs to live life to the full, including those with Parkinson&#039;s disease.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60425h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : Will the Minister comment on my earlier point? Obviously, we are all enthusiastic about people who suffer from neurological conditions having the highest possible quality of life, but what are the Government doing to support scientific research, including stem cell research, on potentially groundbreaking treatments and cures for terrible conditions such as Parkinson&#039;s? How are they supporting and encouraging such scientific activity?
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60425h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> : I will be delighted to write to the hon. Gentleman about stem cell research later, but I will touch on research into neurological conditions in a moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para25"><a name="stpa_291">Although the NSF is in place, we want to go further. That is why we commissioned the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to publish clinical practice guidelines on Parkinson&#039;s disease for the NHS in England and Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para26"><a name="stpa_292">My second point relates to our continuing labour, together with the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society, to find a cure and a treatment that can mitigate the conditions suffered by those with Parkinson&#039;s disease. At present, the medical profession has no means of curing Parkinson&#039;s disease or preventing it from developing. One day, we hope to find a solution through new research, but for now it is possible only to minimise symptoms through medication. That is why the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society and my hon. Friend are right to underline the necessity of delivering medication on time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para27"><a name="stpa_293">We have established &#163;20 million of initiatives to speed up the development of new medical treatments for dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, and the dementias and neurodegenerative disease research network will be led by University college London and the university of Newcastle upon Tyne.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para28"><a name="stpa_294">To ensure the effective treatment that is the hallmark of the NHS at its best, however, we need to ensure that medical staff operate with the right knowledge. My hon. Friend mentioned stories about poor practice being passed on from one generation of medical practitioners to another. That is absolutely unacceptable and must be eliminated from the NHS and the social care system.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 245WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para29"><a name="stpa_295">One example of the way in which we are supporting care staff is systems such as PRODIGY, which is an online, up-to-date, interactive decision support tool. It is a source of clinical knowledge that helps health care professionals and patients manage common conditions that are generally seen in primary and first-contact care. I noted with interest that the section of PRODIGY that is devoted to the diagnosis, treatment and management of Parkinson&#039;s expressly recommends the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society as a source of information and support. That is an example of how the society is well and truly embedded in our health and social care system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para30"><a name="stpa_296">My fourth point&#151;this is central to my hon. Friend&#039;s remarks&#151;is about how we ensure that medicines are properly managed. She is right to talk of the need to administer medicines on time, and I have asked that national minimum standards in social care be reformed to tackle unacceptable practices. As she knows, I recently set up a panel of dignity guardians&#151;experts in the care of our citizens&#151;to advise me on how those standards can best be revised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para31"><a name="stpa_297">Similar reforms are under way in the NHS. A good example is the team based at the National Prescribing Centre, which has helped NHS organisations improve medicines management services since 2001. The medicines management collaborative has worked with 146 primary care trusts throughout England and the hospital medicines management collaborative has helped 44 trusts. The community pharmacy framework collaborative has 28 PCTs participating in its programme, together with a number of other PCTs, and the integrated medicines management programme has 25 trusts participating in its programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para32"><a name="stpa_298">I was especially glad that my hon. Friend highlighted the importance of the self-administration of medicine. In all the conversations that I have had with societies and organisations that support patients and carers in this field, I have been struck time and time again by the degree to which patients in the NHS often know much more about their conditions than anybody else. We must support that instinct, and that is why the White Paper, which we published in January, sets out ambitious plans for expanding the expert patients programme, and we want to increase the number of places in the programme to up to 100,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para33"><a name="stpa_299">We also said that we needed to do something else alongside that and that we needed to introduce and expand the expert carers programme. Again, that idea was not thought up in Whitehall, but was brought to us by the Alzheimer&#039;s Society. In my constituency office in Hodge Hill, its representatives told me that carers who work with patients or users of social care are working with people whom they love very much and whom they want to support in completely different ways. However, they are often denied information about how they can best help and they are also denied the mutual support and reciprocity that come from peer networks. The expert patients programme and the expert carers 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 246WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
programme need to develop those networks so that people can do more to support each other in our communities, and we shall introduce plans in respect of both those programmes a little later this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para34"><a name="stpa_300">I touch on carers because they are sometimes much neglected in the debate about the health and social care system. There are 6 million carers in this country, and when we went out to the public to ask for their list of priorities for the health and social care White Paper, it was striking how high carers came up that list. That underlines how neglected carers have been in the debate to date. We want to ensure that carers who look after people with Parkinson&#039;s disease are given the best possible care themselves, because caring for a person with a long-term condition can be socially, physically and psychologically demanding, and it is important that we provide the support that such carers need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para35"><a name="stpa_301">We listened carefully when carers told us what they needed and we have outlined a new deal for carers. We will update the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy on carers. We will also encourage primary care trusts and local authorities to ensure that they have in place a lead to deal with carers&#039; issues so that there is somebody in every community whose day job is to think about carers&#039; needs. In addition, we will introduce the national helpline that carers&#039; organisations have sought for some time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para36"><a name="stpa_302">When I talk to carers in my constituency, I am constantly struck by the fact that they often have no sense of what they are entitled to. The Government supported the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which the House passed last year. It will induce a step change in the support that is available to carers throughout the country. We will add to that through White Paper initiatives such as emergency home-based respite care. We will also continue support through the carer&#039;s grant, which will have been worth about &#163;1 billion by the end of 2007&#150;08. Those are all important aspects of improving the quality of life of those with Parkinson&#039;s disease and their families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h04_para37"><a name="stpa_303">My final point relates to the need for further reform. The health White Paper set out an ambitious programme for shifting care out of hospitals and into the community, which is exactly where people want to see it&#151;they want a national health service that is available not only around the clock, but around the corner. Throughout that reform programme, we must send a clear signal that this is ultimately about standards. That is why we have introduced the dignity in care campaign, which underlines the point that treating people with dignity is about treating them in the way that they want to be treated, not the way that we want to be treated. That is why we are taking steps to regulate the social care work force and why we have introduced the safeguarding vulnerable adults legislation. That is also why we are cracking down on elder abuse and working with Comic Relief to understand the issue in greater depth.

He is a reasonable man and I hope that he will be able to offer some hope to my constituents, for whom the problem is causing much distress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para0"><a name="stpa_304">West Yorkshire police has already decided to close 12 police station help desks. They are at Ovenden, Heckmondwike, Sowerby Bridge, Rothwell, Ossett, Normanton, Brighouse, Cleckheaton, Batley, Otley and, more importantly to me, Shipley and Bingley. West Yorkshire police has also said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;Further work to identify if any other help desks should close is being carried out and this will also take into account the working hours of help desks, some of which will be reduced, however the details of these have yet to be finalised&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para1"><a name="stpa_305">It is clear that the list is not final and that more could follow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para2"><a name="stpa_306">I hope that you will forgive me for being somewhat parochial, Mr. Cummings, and allow me to focus on the two police station help desks at Bingley and Shipley that are to close in my constituency. The closures would mean that no police station would be open to the public throughout my constituency at any time of the day. That is a disgrace. The Government and West Yorkshire police alike often sing the praises of neighbourhood policing and stress its importance. Indeed, I support the concept of neighbourhood policing, which is important to the general public. However, it would appear that I have a different understanding of neighbourhood policing from that of the police and the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para3"><a name="stpa_307">Neighbourhood policing should surely be about much more than seeing an extra officer walking down the street, although that would certainly be welcome. Surely neighbourhood policing should be about how close the police are to the community and how accessible they are. Having police stations open to the public is a vital part of neighbourhood policing. I would be grateful for the Minister&#039;s view on the importance to the Government of police stations in delivering their programme of neighbourhood policing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para4"><a name="stpa_308">Shipley used to be the centre of its own police division. Now it will not even have a police station open to the public. Are we really seeing a move towards more neighbourhood policing? From my constituents&#039; perspective we are moving further away from neighbourhood policing, towards something much more remote.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para5"><a name="stpa_309">The closure of these police stations to the public is not merely symbolic; it will have a real impact on people. What will happen, for example, when somebody in the centre of Shipley or Bingley sees something that they want or need to report to the police, but they do not 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 248WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
happen to have the phone number to call at hand? What will happen to people who want to hand in lost property? What will happen when courts ask people to report to a local police station as a condition of bail? What will happen when, say, a motorist is asked to take their documents to a local police station? The answer for many people in my constituency will be that they cannot do so, because there will be nowhere to go locally. People will probably end up having to go to the divisional headquarters in Keighley. Surely that is unacceptable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para6"><a name="stpa_310">No doubt the Minister will say that those are operational matters that are best left to the police, without Government interference. I would certainly welcome a move towards allowing the police to work without Government interference, but West Yorkshire police does not want to take that decision. In a letter sent to me on 18 March, Chief Constable Colin Cramphorn says
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;I of course understand your concerns and indeed your unhappiness; none of us are happy about making cuts but we have been left no choice. This year&#039;s budget settlement, together with the failure to apply the needs based funding formula has cost West Yorkshire Police &#163;15 million.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para7"><a name="stpa_311">There is now talk in the local newspapers of West Yorkshire police needing to find savings of more than &#163;17 million. It is clear from that letter that we are not talking about an operational decision entered into willingly by the police, but something that has been forced on them by the Government&#039;s inadequate funding. The police have said they are going ahead simply because they need to save &#163;700,000 in their budget.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para8"><a name="stpa_312">The police are placing the blame for the closures on the Government, so could the Minister explain why the funding for West Yorkshire police has left it so strapped for cash that it needs to take such drastic measures? Are we seeing another example of the Government presiding over feast and then famine in our public services? What will the Minister do to make up the chronic shortfall in funding for West Yorkshire police?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para9"><a name="stpa_313">I am not entirely sure how West Yorkshire police has calculated a saving of &#163;700,000 from closing these police station help desks. The force has said that the police stations themselves will not close and that they will still be used as operating bases. They will still be open, lit and heated; it is just that the public will not be able to have access to them. I therefore do not see how any savings can be made on the buildings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para10"><a name="stpa_314">West Yorkshire police has also said that it intends to avoid redundancies, so it appears that there will be no saving on staff costs either. Without savings on the buildings or on staff costs, I am not entirely sure how the figure of &#163;700,000 was reached. Perhaps the Minister will be able to help me out and explain how such savings can be made without the closure of the buildings or staff cuts. Many people are concerned that the closure of the police stations will follow shortly to realise these savings. I intend to take up that point with the assistant chief constable when I meet him on 5 May to discuss the closures further.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para11"><a name="stpa_315">The closure of the help desk at Shipley is even more of a scandal. It has already been closed for weeks, for refurbishment&#151;yes, refurbishment. West Yorkshire police has spent tens of thousands of pounds 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 249WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
refurbishing the help desk at Shipley, yet it will not even reopen to the public so that we can see it in all its splendour and glory. Surely the Minister must agree that that is a scandalous waste of taxpayers&#039; money and more waste in our public services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para12"><a name="stpa_316">The Minister might also be interested to know that, at a time when West Yorkshire police has had to close these help desks, it is delivering an eight-page newspaper to every household in the county. Surely if money needs to be saved, that should be the first thing to go. The newspaper does not even inform people of the closure of the help desks. You could not make it up, Mr. Cummings. Do the Government encourage their money to be spent on that wasteful propaganda or does the Minister agree that a police force should not be able to afford to dish out a newspaper full of propaganda that nobody is interested in when it cannot even afford to keep its police station help desks open?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para13"><a name="stpa_317">West Yorkshire police says that the help desks to close have been chosen because fewer than 100 people a week use them. That might be the case, but it does not reflect the importance that help desks have as a reassurance to the local community. The small number of people who use them is also due to their opening hours. Bingley police station is open from 9 am to l pm, Monday to Saturday, while Shipley police station&#039;s opening hours are only slightly more generous, with an extra two hours in the afternoon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para14"><a name="stpa_318">If the police can afford to open the stations to the public for only four hours a day, which bright spark decided that the best hours to open were between 9 am and 1 pm, when the fewest crimes are committed and most people are at work? No wonder hardly anybody is using the help desks. Has there been some encouragement to open the help desks at the most inconvenient times, so that we have fewer operational police stations and an excuse to get rid of them? Does the Minister agree that these stations should be open at hours that suit the public, not the people working in them?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para15"><a name="stpa_319">If all these police stations are to be closed to the public for good, surely a trial run could be held with them opening in the evening to see how many people used them then. We could then ascertain whether people would use the local station if they had the opportunity to do so. Would the Minister agree to fund such a trial, keeping those stations open in the evening for a limited time to see how they were used?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para16"><a name="stpa_320">The closures were forced through without public consultation, and with no one from the police authority or the senior ranks of West Yorkshire police even having the decency to come to Shipley and Bingley to explain why the help desks were being closed. If it was such a good idea to close them, I would have expected someone to explain the rationale behind the decision and to tell the local community why it was such a good idea.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para17"><a name="stpa_321">People in my constituency feel extremely strongly about the matter. I have conducted one survey after another in my constituency, and crime and the fear of crime is constantly said to be the most important issue. Keeping local police stations open, even for a few hours a day, would at least give people the reassurance that the police were close at hand and that they cared about crime in the local community.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para18"><a name="stpa_322">A 900-signature petition from people concerned about the closure of the help desks was collected in a only few days by local residents Andrew Rowley and David Herdson, to whom I am grateful. It was presented to me last week. The fact that they were able to collect so many signatures in such a short time shows the strength of feeling in my constituency about the closure of the help desks; it shows how important they are in reassuring the local community. Some who signed the petition had used the police stations and some had not, but all felt that it was important that they should be able to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para19"><a name="stpa_323">The Minister could prevent the closures by giving West Yorkshire the necessary funding. The &#163;15 million cut referred to by the chief constable in his letter to me would be extremely welcome, as it would safeguard the stations. Even &#163;700,000 would keep them open to the public. Only &#163;100,000 would keep the two stations in my constituency open to the public; that is all that would be needed to safeguard those two help desks. Given that the cost to West Yorkshire police of its unnecessary merger with other forces has been calculated at &#163;50 million, with a nationwide cost of about &#163;500 million, that is a drop in the ocean.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para20"><a name="stpa_324">Keeping police stations open to the public is surely far more important than spending money on new logos and mottos for a regional police force. If the Minister were to ask my constituents, or even his, what else could be done with the money, how many of them does he think would ask for a regional police force? Does he not think that most would prefer to see the money spent on more police officers, and allowing more police stations to remain open for longer? I believe that the stations should be open for longer, not closed. Not only is it a bad move, it is a move in the wrong direction. I therefore urge the Minister to find the money to keep the police stations open. This issue demonstrates to us all how important neighbourhood policing is to the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para21"><a name="stpa_325">I am grateful for having been given the opportunity to put the case for keeping these stations open. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to save them.

<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60425h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) on obtaining this debate. He is right that in his constituency and in mine&#151;and, I believe, in every constituency&#151;crime and the fear of crime is a top priority. It is certainly a Government priority to ensure that we deliver greater safety and security to our communities. He is also right that a matter of such intense debate in his locality should be brought to Parliament, so that his and his constituents&#039; views and concerns can be aired, and I congratulate him on doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para22"><a name="stpa_326">The hon. Gentleman anticipated one aspect of my response early in his speech. The management of the police estate in West Yorkshire, the allocation of resources and budget decisions, and the ownership of police stations and how they function is a matter for local decision-taking&#151;it is a matter for the chief police constable and the police authority, although they should do it in a way that is open to public scrutiny and debate. The hon. Gentleman referred also to the fact 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Apr 2006 : Column 251WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the assistant chief constable is anxious to enter into discussions with him and his colleagues. People want to have ready access to the police service. It is an important aspect of modern policing, so any change in the way that services are delivered should be taken only after surveys and appropriate consultation have been undertaken. That was certainly the case in relation to access to police station help desks in West Yorkshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para23"><a name="stpa_327">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the opening times of help desks is not the sole determinant of the effectiveness or accessibility of the police. There are other more modern methods of taking the police service out into the community in a more accessible way&#151;in shops on the high street, in kiosks and in mobile police stations, which are particularly relevant and helpful in rural areas. We need to get the right balance between access to the service and the visible presence of police officers and community support officers on the street. None the less, I applaud the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support for neighbourhood policing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para24"><a name="stpa_328">West Yorkshire police authority&#039;s decision was informed by research undertaken by Thornton management service, which was commissioned by the police authority to investigate the number of visitors attending front-counter help desks at police stations throughout West Yorkshire. That commission was the result of data provided by Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of constabulary comparing the proportion of personnel working in various functions across the country. The HMIC data highlighted the fact that West Yorkshire had a higher than average proportion of personnel working in help-desks functions. Not only did the consultants gather data; they also made observations about the way in which the help desks were used. They concluded that, for reasons of efficiency, it made sense to close some desks, particularly those with low levels of activity. It was not done simply to close the service; it was done because it would allow the staff and resources currently used to keep those desks open to be redeployed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para25"><a name="stpa_329">That required not only number crunching but professional judgment and local knowledge. Although the criteria used to judge low activity was fewer than 100 visits a week, regard was given to the circumstances of the area. For example, although Todmorden police station had fewer than 100 visits a week, it remains open because it is in a more remote area. It is worth recording that the consultants found one station that had 54 visits a week by members of the public, but that 2,190 visits a week were made to another.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para26"><a name="stpa_330">The police authority decided to consider the efficiency and effectiveness of the system to ensure that resources are used to the fullest effect. Like the hon. Gentleman, I have a list of the police stations that are affected. Most of those that are to remain open had help desks that were already open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They will continue to provide that service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para27"><a name="stpa_331">The hon. Gentleman noted that the help desk at the Bingley police station was open only from 9 am till 1 pm. He invited me to say that if it was open for longer, more people would visit it. That may be true, but opening it for longer would require more resources; it would be more expensive. Again, that is a decision for the police authority.

<p>
<a name="60425h05_para28"><a name="stpa_332">I emphasise that West Yorkshire police has assured me that it is listening to the concerns of the hon. Gentleman and others. Assistant Chief Constable Crompton has written to Members of Parliament and local authority councillors to explain the changes and invite dialogue. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is taking up that offer on 5 May, I think&#151;

Gentleman an opportunity to raise several of the points that he has raised today. He asked a perfectly legitimate question, which I cannot answer, about why money has been spent on refurbishing Shipley when, he alleges, that resource will not be used properly. I do not know the answer to that; I trust the hon. Gentleman&#039;s assertion in this debate, but he will get a better answer from Assistant Chief Constable Crompton than I can give him. He will also be able to ask him how the figure of &#163;700,000 was estimated as the overall saving, and about several other practical issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para29"><a name="stpa_333">Not everyone shares the hon. Gentleman&#039;s view&#151;not even everyone in his party. I noticed with interest a report in the <i>Brighouse Echo&#151;</i>a journal which I regularly look at&#151;on 14 April, I think, which quoted the Conservative candidate for the Brighouse ward in next month&#039;s council elections, Alan Taylor, as saying that

<a name="60425h05_para30"><a name="stpa_334">It went on to say that he claimed there had been &quot;posturing and over reaction&quot; to the proposed closure. I do not allege that the hon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para31"><a name="stpa_335">Most people contact the police by telephone. We should encourage them to do that and to do it in an appropriate way. With the commitment to neighbourhood policing, we want not only for there to be telephone contact, but for officers to be known to local people by name, for mobile phone numbers to be available so that ready contact can be made, and higher visibility of officers on the street. All that is important in taking work forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para32"><a name="stpa_336">The question of reducing and, in some places, closing police station help desks needs to be set against the overall record of the West Yorkshire police authority and the police officers in its area. The build-up of resources, their effectiveness and their deployment to reduce crime and make the area safer are impressive in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area, as is the commitment to neighbourhood policing. West Yorkshire had a record 5,691 police officers in September 2005, which is 482 more than in March 1997 and an increase of 60 within a year. West Yorkshire is deeply committed to the introduction of community support officers and the development of their role. There were 433 CSOs there by last September, and those numbers will rise, not least with the Chancellor&#039;s commitment in the Budget to bring forward money to ensure that we can recruit CSOs in even greater numbers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para33"><a name="stpa_337">There is a strong commitment to neighbourhood policing, which is clearly a great priority for the Government. We recognise that citizens and communities want local policing that enables greater police understanding of local priorities and problems and enables them to tackle the issues that are most important to local people. We have committed ourselves to working with the police in West Yorkshire and elsewhere to ensure that neighbourhood policing is introduced to every community, including those in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, by April 2007. Initially, we thought that it might be 2008 before that development could occur, but the Chancellor&#039;s Budget commitment has enabled us to bring matters forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para34"><a name="stpa_338">When neighbourhood policing teams are operating nationwide, communities will have access to policing services through a named point of contact. I accept that front desks and help desks are important, but it is that contact and access to individual police officers that is at the heart of our neighbourhood policing strategy, and that is what will make a difference. I am informed by West Yorkshire police that it has set up the framework for neighbourhood policing, which has increased local access to police throughout West Yorkshire. Teams of officers and community support officers already offer a highly visible and popular service. Increasing numbers of people are attending surgeries at police contact points. These are some of the innovations that I mentioned. They are held in accessible locations such as shops, schools and places of worship. West Yorkshire is firmly committed to rolling out these new and more modern places of contact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para35"><a name="stpa_339">West Yorkshire police has also recently established a neighbourhood policing website, which provides relevant, up-to-date information and a means of direct contact for people in every neighbourhood. Our constituents increasingly use new technology and go on to the internet to gain more information about their local police and public services, which is a good thing and will give more immediate contact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para36"><a name="stpa_340">West Yorkshire police has performed impressively on crime reduction. The latest crime figures for West Yorkshire show considerable improvement. A comparison of the figures for 2004&#150;05 with those for 2003&#150;04 shows that robbery offences are down 41 per cent., burglaries are down 37 per cent., and the theft of motor vehicles is down 28 per cent. These are impressive developments in West Yorkshire, which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman applauds, as do I, because it comes from the determined and focused efforts of police in his area.

<p>
<a name="60425h05_para37"><a name="stpa_341">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of funding and budgets; I have responded to debates in this place secured by Members from West Yorkshire. To be clear, the general Government grant for 2006&#150;07 for West Yorkshire is &#163;306.2 million. That is an increase of 3.2 per cent. over the comparable figure for 2005&#150;06. However, a number of other elements need to be added to that. There was &#163;800,000 in adjustments from budgets in earlier years. The police authority will also receive &#163;4.32 million in a special formula grant, which is a consolidation of four former specific grants that will enable the authority to operate more flexibly. It will also benefit from about &#163;41.6 million in funding for specific initiatives and capital provision. Therefore, the final police authority budget for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;380.2 million, which is a cash increase of &#163;14.5 million compared with the year before.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para38"><a name="stpa_342">I acknowledge, as I have in earlier debates, that if a strict application of the needs-based formula had been made, an extra &#163;14.8 million would have been given to West Yorkshire police. We have to make a balanced judgment when it comes to ensuring that needs are met and that we have stability in the police service throughout the country. That is why we have floors and ceilings in relation to the way in which we set our budget. We want to retain that stability in the system, but we also want to move, as and when we can, to a situation in which the needs formula is more closely adopted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60425h05_para39"><a name="stpa_343">The hon. Gentleman invited me to give an extra &#163;700,000 to West Yorkshire police authority, but that is money that I do not have. As I said at the start, this is a matter for local decision making. However, even if we had been able to follow the needs assessment more clearly and give more money to West Yorkshire, questions of efficiency still arise. If there is inefficiency in the way in which the front-desk service is provided in police stations in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, and if it needs to be made more efficient, that should be dealt with by his police authority. I would expect local Members of Parliament to look for those efficiencies.
