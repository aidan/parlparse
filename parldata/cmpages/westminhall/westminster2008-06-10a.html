 I am pleased to have secured this debate during arrhythmia awareness week. Early-day motion 617 has been tabled by the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch), and it is timely to focus this morning on one aspect of arrhythmia: its threat to young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000011">I declare an interest as the chair of the all-party group on cardiac risk in the young. When I was elected in 2001, I was, like many people, totally unaware of the tragic consequences of cardiac death in the young. I came to it, like many people, because of a related personal tragedy: the death of Levon Morland, the son of my good friends, Jeff and Sandra Morland. Jeff was a full-time trade union official for the electricians&#146; union and then the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000012">Jeff&#146;s son died in terrible circumstances. He went to bed one night and when his mother went to wake him the following morning she found him dead in bed. The circumstances were heartbreaking and, unfortunately, they are repeated weekly throughout the country. Since then, I have worked closely with the charity, Cardiac Risk in the Young, and I pay tribute to the founder and chief executive, Alison Cox, who works tirelessly on behalf families and supports people such as my friends, Jeff and Sandra Morland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000013">CRY&#146;s work has three main strands. It raises awareness of sudden cardiac death in the young, saves lives through some of its work on research and screening, and reduces the anxiety of family members who are left behind. Because sudden cardiac death in the young is not well known, it does not receive great attention, and I pay tribute to CRY&#146;s work during the past few years in raising awareness. We all assume that people die of heart attacks in their old age or middle age when they develop symptoms, but sudden cardiac death in the young is much more common than we like to think. Research so far suggests that one person in 500 has some sort of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, making it five times more common than cystic fibrosis, which is well known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08061078000014">A recent study in Iceland is worth examining. It suggested that 1.47 of the 100,000 population aged under 35 die of sudden cardiac failure. That major study examined death certificates spanning 30 years and found that the incidence was higher in men than in women. The figures reinforced CRY&#146;s message that 400 apparently healthy young people die every year, which is eight young people a week. I shall explain later why some of those figures are not recorded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000015">The all-party group that I chair now has 112 right hon. and hon. Members, and during the past few years we have worked with CRY and CRY families. I pay tribute to those families who have lost a young person  <br>

because anyone who meets them can only be inspired by their resilience and determination that some good should come out of their personal tragedies. That is expressed in two ways: fundraising to enable CRY to continue its work, and their enthusiasm in trying to spread the message. Sandra and Jeff Morland are an example. Since their son&#146;s tragic death, they have raised some &#163;100,000 for CRY, ably assisted by Mr. Jack Doyle, another former trade union colleague, and my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor). They have worked tirelessly to raise money, and that is repeated throughout the country by CRY families. I know that Alison Cox and CRY&#146;s officers greatly appreciate that, because those families work hard to ensure that some good comes out of their tragedies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000016">One issue has been to raise awareness, and I played a small part in CRY&#146;s postcard campaign in 2004. It was launched in every region and encouraged CRY families to write to MPs and other opinion-formers, and to the devolved Administrations to draw attention to the tragedy of the eight young people who die weekly from sudden cardiac failure. I understand that the campaign will be relaunched this year. It is a dramatic way of raising awareness of sudden cardiac death in the young. The dramatic front page is a postcard with eight photographs of young people. They are not models, but young people who have died of sudden cardiac failure. That brings the issue home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000017">I was at the launch of some of the campaigns, and meeting the parents or partners of the people shown on those postcards brings home the issue, especially when they explain not only how those young people died, but what they were doing. It is difficult for many people to understand the tragedy, but there is a story to each death. Many of those young people were active in sports and many, like Levon Morland, were just starting out on their professional lives. The issue becomes personal when one sees the photographs on the postcards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000018">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South, and I am pleased that she has been able to attend this debate. In 2004, her private Member&#146;s Bill paved the way for a new chapter on arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death to be added to the national service framework for coronary heart disease. I pay tribute to the Minister at the time who took that on board in the Department of Health and recognised that that new chapter was important. It was not just written and set in stone; it was developed over time and we must continue to revisit it. It has raised awareness of sudden cardiac death in the young up the political agenda and within the medical community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000019">Another issue in which CRY is involved is saving lives through testing and screening with electrocardiograms for young people. I accept that that is controversial and that some members of the medical profession are sceptical about whether that is the correct way forward, but having seen the evidence, I am a strong believer that mandatory testing for young people is the way forward. I shall refer to some of the international evidence showing that it has a positive benefit. If it could avoid just one photograph being on the postcard in future, it would be worth it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000020">Research in Italy has shown that since 1982, any young person taking part in competitive sport must be medically screened with and ECG. That research has shown that some 2 per cent. of those screened have  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jun 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 3WH</b><br>
some type of cardiac arrhythmia. In the research done since then, the figures speak for themselves. From 1979-80 to 2003-04, the annual rate of sudden death among athletes decreased by 89 per cent. That is an astounding figure. One might ask whether that is a one-off, but during the same period, instances of sudden cardiac death among the non-athletic population in Italy did not change at all. Those figures show that screening is identifying individuals with the problem. Likewise, if we compare the figures with, for example, the United States or other countries where people are not screened, the contrast is clear. The Italians have got it right and have shown that screening helps to identify young athletes and others who are at risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08061078000021">The other problem associated with sudden cardiac death in the young is that although it is the people who die on the sports field who sometimes get the publicity, many people die away from the sports field. In addition, some people have self-selected themselves out of competitive activities because they have exhibited certain symptoms. The arguments show that screening is well overdue. CRY is setting up testing centres in different parts of the country, and I am working with it to try to get one in the Freeman hospital in the north-east. We are in negotiations on that. Having testing centres would help many families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000022">Controversy over testing is caused by people saying that it raises anxiety levels among the individuals concerned and their families and siblings. It is clear that some of the conditions are hereditary, and that siblings can be found to suffer from similar problems. It is important to tackle the issue of anxiety, and to be fair to CRY it is trying to do so. It is not just a matter of randomly testing people and leaving them. If, for example, someone finds that they have sudden cardiac arrhythmia, support needs to be given afterwards&#151;not just to the individual youngster, but to family members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000023">I am convinced that testing is needed. The next major step forward that we need to campaign for is to have a similar system to that in Italy. That would mean that young people who take part in competitive sport must go through some kind of ECG test. We should also consider whether to go further and build testing into school medicals. For example, I believe that when youngsters go from primary to secondary school, they have a medical&#151;I do not know whether they still do, but before I went to secondary school, I had one&#151;and I would welcome consideration being given to building the test in at that stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000024">Within sport, there has been some movement on the issue. I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. When he was a Back Bencher, he spoke about the problem at the first event that I held on the subject. He, too, came to the issue because a constituent had raised with him a problem related to a personal tragedy. I was pleased that, a few months ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer allowed CRY to use No.11 Downing street to launch profiling screening in sport&#151;along with the Football Association, the Professional Footballer&#146;s Association and the Football Foundation. The Secretary of State has been pushing the issue with the Football Foundation, and I know that the Minister present also attended the event. It was a great event and many of the CRY families were there and gave a lot of support. They are raising awareness of the matter among  <br>

young footballers. The FA and the PFA are introducing voluntary screening for 16-year-olds and are considering whether mandatory screening can be introduced across the board. If organisations such as those support the campaign of awareness, it does a great deal of good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000025">The concentration on sport over the next few years in the run-up to the Olympics in London will also provide an opportunity to raise the issue. CRY and Alison Cox are working hard to raise awareness among the professional bodies of other sports. The Olympics is a great opportunity to try to do something specifically in relation to cardiac risk in the young and screening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000026">I mentioned the work of the all-party group, but I must also thank the Department of Health because it has been proactive not only in listening to what I and other members of the all-party group have said, but in working closely with CRY. A few weeks ago, I was pleased to attend the launch of the new fast-track pathology service for coroners at the Royal Brompton hospital. The service is a ground-breaking and I do not think that it is provided anywhere else. Dr. Mary Sheppard&#151;one of life&#146;s characters&#151;is a dedicated clinician in that area. Under the service, coroners can send away the hearts of young people whom it is suspected died from sudden cardiac conditions and get a fast-track diagnosis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08061078000027">The service, which has been funded by CRY and by the fund-raising efforts made on behalf of those young people who have died, does two things. First, it gives a fast-track solution to coroners and allows them to get expert advice and diagnosis on what the young person died of, or what the problem with their heart was. Secondly, the service helps families by providing a quick turnaround on a diagnosis. Having spoken to many CRY families, I know that one of the things they ask when a young person who has been healthy until that day dies is, &#147;Why have they died?&#148; They need an answer to that and the service is invaluable in providing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000028">Mary Sheppard is also building up the research and data on the subject, which I know CRY is dedicated to doing. It is only by incrementally building up the data that we will get a better understanding of why healthy young people suddenly die. On a note of criticism towards coroners, it can take many months or possibly a year to get a diagnosis, and the speedy service helps with that. The service is also important because it allows siblings to be tested. It is clear that if a young person has died, their siblings could also be affected. Early intervention and screening is important in that regard, and it also helps with the associated anxiety and with answering the question of why this happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000029">I turn to the forthcoming coroners Bill, which I understand is in the draft programme and will be in the Queen&#146;s Speech in the autumn. CRY and I have pressed hard for that legislation. The current coroner service is patchy and is based on an archaic system. When I was in charge of public health in Newcastle, I remember being told by the chief officer that I had to appoint a coroner. I said that I did not realise that that was my responsibility, to which he replied, &#147;Oh yes it is.&#148; It was only when I had to go through the process of appointing Newcastle&#146;s current coroner, who is a very good individual, that I realised how ad hoc the system is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000030">We need not only a well-resourced coroner service&#151;it will take money to achieve that&#151;but a system whereby sudden deaths are examined in detail and treated uniformly.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jun 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 5WH</b><br>
The difficulty at the moment is that if young people die suddenly during sport&#151;for example, in a swimming pool, while riding a bike or even by falling out of a tree&#151;their death is put down to an accident, when in many cases they died because their heart stopped beating. In a number of cases, the deaths of individuals in swimming pools have been put down to drowning&#151;a tragic accident&#151;rather than to sudden cardiac failure. It is important that we establish a standardised system for coroners throughout the country, so that cases can be referred and the data properly collected. I do not think that the data are properly collected at the moment. I hope that when the coroners Bill comes before Parliament in the autumn, the Minister taking the Bill through the House will meet representatives of CRY so that she can hear about issues that need to be included in the Bill, because I think that coroners, too, would be educated by some of the wealth of information that CRY has obtained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000031">The campaign to raise awareness is aimed not only at the general public, but at GPs. Some GPs clearly understand the subject, are on the ball and are aware of the referral process and what the possibilities are, but sometimes we expect GPs to be experts on everything, and this area is a specialism. Part of the work by the Department of Health could involve saying to GPs, &#147;This area needs to be looked at closely.&#148; I talked to Alison Cox this week and discovered that only last week, CRY had a case involving a young chap of 27. He had visited his GP with swollen ankles and breathlessness and was treated for tonsillitis. Unfortunately, two days later he collapsed and died. Sadly, that is not an isolated incident. There are numerous cases of young people having presented with symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia, yet that has gone undetected. Levon Morland was diagnosed and more or less told to get on with his life, but there are simple procedures that can be followed. Pacemakers can be fitted and other things can be done that will ensure that people do not suddenly become another statistic in the long list that we already have. Trying to get that across to GPs is important, and that is one thing that the Department of Health can do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para22"><a name="08061078000032">It has been a great privilege to work with CRY over the past six years. It has been a great privilege to work not only with Alison Cox and her team, who are very dedicated and passionate about ensuring that young people do not become another statistic, but with the CRY families. Many people are cynical these days and say, &#147;Oh, what can politicians or MPs do?&#148; Well, as a Member of Parliament, if I can help to avoid one more family going through the tragedy experienced not only by Sandra and Jeff Morland but by the many families whom I have met through CRY, it will all be worth it.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) on securing this very important debate. In March 2004, I had the great privilege of presenting to the House the Cardiac Risk in the Young (Screening) Bill. More than 100 hon. Members wanted to sponsor my private Member&#146;s Bill and, on the day, the Back Benches were reasonably full of Members speaking to the substance of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para23"><a name="08061078000034">As my hon. Friend stated, the Bill was inspired by the tragic death of Levon Morland. He was an energetic, athletic 22-year-old&#151;a young man with his life before him. In fact, those were the words that his consultant used: &#147;Get on with your life.&#148; He could have had an operation, but such operations are pretty nasty affairs and that was especially so at that time, so his consultant said, &#147;Get on with your life.&#148; The fact is that he has no life to get on with. The heartache that that has caused his family has been monumental. The community and many of us who worked with the family, especially Jeff Morland, as a trade unionist, understood clearly the depth of the heartache that they were going through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para24"><a name="08061078000035">Inevitably, questions were asked again and again about the tragic death of Levon Morland. The belief was that it was a needless death, and the hope was that we could start to understand why he died when he had been diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and was receiving medical support. How on earth did it happen? Levon&#146;s death caused us to ask many questions, and we became more and more informed about the genetic inheritance of diseases that cause heart problems&#151;cardiomyopathies&#151;specifically in young people who are particularly athletic. As time went by, we understood more and more about such diseases, and with that understanding, we became more and more convinced that more widespread screening and easier access to screening would enable us all to understand the symptoms and the causes of that fatal heart condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para25"><a name="08061078000036">Significant to that process was, without a doubt, Cardiac Risk in the Young and particularly Alison Cox, the founder member and chief executive of the charity. There was very close support from Dr. Sanjay Sharma, who is a heart specialist at Lewisham hospital. Those people put an enormous amount of time and energy into persuading politicians and the medical profession that there was a real problem with cardiac risk in the young that needed careful analysis and understanding. Once they had attempted to do that with the medical profession, they attempted to do it with politicians. We are never the easiest group of people to persuade of anything, but they convinced us that, with the appropriate screening and the right pathology, people would begin to understand the genetic nature of those diseases and, with that understanding, put together treatments that could be effective and prevent the needless deaths of young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para26"><a name="08061078000037">That is where we started, and my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham clearly outlined much of the process that we went through, but it is appropriate to add that we managed to persuade the Department of Health. We got support from the Minister, but we also got support from Dr. Roger Boyle, who is the Government&#146;s heart tsar. He understood that there was a gap in the provision and in the understanding of cardiac treatments, and when I withdrew my private Member&#146;s Bill from the Floor of the House, I was offered a national service framework. For me, that became a medical model that would enable people to understand the symptoms that young people were expressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para27"><a name="08061078000038">Those symptoms were often breathlessness disproportionate to action or blackouts or fitting, and medics, especially GPs, were keen to say that that was a problem of stress or asthma or had another cause. Slowly but surely, with Dr. Boyle and the national committee of experts that he set up, those myths were  <br>

being exposed. We have seen that national framework introduce a process whereby individuals who experience episodes of sustained palpitations or unexplained impaired consciousness trigger in the health service either ECG monitoring or echocardiography. That begins to give medics an understanding of irregularities in the heart beat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para28"><a name="08061078000039">The national service framework has also put together a suitable bereavement package, so that parents and families can understand what has happened, and through that understanding, they can begin to cope much better. Sudden death is a hideous thing to have to manage, especially in young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para29"><a name="08061078000040">Added to that, we have the expert post-mortem, which is crucial. It is absolutely and profoundly valuable, because it centrally defines causation. Without it, we will not know what caused the heart attack. The post-mortem has resulted in a welter of research, explaining why Marfan&#146;s disease, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and the whole group of cardiomyopathies occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para30"><a name="08061078000041">With that knowledge, medical services are beginning to become much more specifically related to the needs of young people. We are starting to evaluate families that have had cardiac diseases; that is critical, because if there is a genetic trace, the children have a 50 per cent. chance of inheriting the disease. It is crucial to see the trace working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para31"><a name="08061078000042">All in all, I believe that the national service framework and the committee of experts have been working in a most persuasive way to enable us all to understand what is happening and what medical provisions should be put in place. I wish it were as perfect as I want it to be, but it is not. The charity, Cardiac Risk in the Young, and the Back-Bench group are constantly pressing for better local understanding. We hope that the national service framework is being fully implemented, but we are aware that it is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para32"><a name="08061078000043">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said that, in Newcastle, people are still pressing for a piece of kit that will enable effective diagnosis. That has taken from 2004 to 2008. We are four years down the line: how many more children and young people have died? Four a week? Eight a week? That is the scale of the problem; it is also the scale of the need. Good work is being done, but there is more to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80610h0001.htm_para33"><a name="08061078000044">We are&#151;specifically, I am&#151;concerned that GPs still do not understand the symptoms that they often see; they are not quickly tying those young people into the effective medical processes that could diagnose and offer treatment. There are gaps in what is being delivered, but I assure the House that what is being delivered is infinitely better today than it ever was.</p>

I am delighted that she is a member of the committee. She is taking up the counselling process for all. Counselling takes place when a young person has died.

team and enables others to go in with their teams to explain and, we hope, to prevent the disease from occurring again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000046">Roger Boyle, another member of the national committee of experts, and Alison Cox have achieved&#151;quite painfully, and with a serious fight&#151;the recognition that cardiac risk can occur in the young and an understanding of why it occurs. That is a tremendous step forward. However, my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham is right that there is still scepticism. The absolute belief is that, to have a heart attack, one must be 50, fat and smoke fags. It is not true. One can be 15 and a seriously good athlete, with an inherited heart condition that could be fatal. It is about getting that understanding and that perspective. It is difficult to believe that someone who is so superb at his or her sport can have an inherited fatal condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000047">Achievements to date have been excellent. I praise the work done on Teesside, most particularly at the James Cook university hospital in Middlesbrough. When my Bill was introduced and accepted by the Department of Health, the hospital had one electrophysiologist; it now has three. That is a great improvement. It widens access to specialist electrophysiology treatment, which is valuable. A cardiac genetics programme is also up and running. As I said, most cardiomyopathies are inherited, so the genetic relationship is crucial. That programme will therefore enable an understanding that, in some cases, but not all, genetics is the problem. Again, it is an incredibly valuable bit of kit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000048">Specialist nurses are being employed to support cardio-physiologists. Again, their work filters out into the community; it is explained to groups, young people in schools and parents what could happen if a young person has palpitations disproportionate to the activity that he or she is involved in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08061078000049">We also have an arrhythmia clinic&#151;a tremendous innovation. Sadly, it is available only in Redcar and Cleveland. I wish it were universally available, because it has a nurse-led team to do the screening. They support the work of the GPs, enabling them to understand when a problem is serious. They are incredibly valuable part of the complex delivery of treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000050">It would be totally inappropriate not to mention the charity, South Cleveland Heart Fund. The group works in the most persuasive way to raise funds. It has provided the James Cook hospital with an evoked potential mapping computer programme, which quickly diagnoses the problems being suffered by young people. It is a most valuable piece of kit. I offer the charity a big thank you; it is deserved. Again, however, a charity is raising funds to deliver essential national health service machinery. I do not criticise, but it tells us that, despite all the money that is being invested in the system, it still does not provide the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000051">The developments that we have seen in Middlesbrough are most valuable, but we still have a shortage of cardiac physiologists. There is a training process, but people have to be persuaded to become involved in that area of medicine, and a job still has to be done to achieve a full complement of cardiac physiologists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000052">In the past four years, we have seen the all-party group on cardiac risk in the young working in a very persuasive way. We are delighted with the work of the  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000053">It is disheartening that a tragedy should have been needed to persuade Parliament and the medical profession to take seriously the fact that young people can have fatal heart conditions. I wish it were not the case, but I hope that Levon Morland&#146;s family will accept that his tragic death has made us all wake up to the fact that we should include in the legislative programme the delivery of good health through a screening process and that we should have a greater understanding of what happens when sudden death occurs. I hope that the family accepts that it was not for nothing. It was not an accident but was caused by a fatal heart condition.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) on securing the debate and on his work for the all-party parliamentary group on cardiac risk in the young. I was pleased that he highlighted early-day motion 617 on arrhythmia awareness week, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch). I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), who has brought her usual passion to the subject today. She always carries me along with her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000055">Sometimes, we parliamentarians think that we do not make much of a difference, but this is an example of making a real difference by working together with charities and the Government. I congratulate all the charities involved, many of which arose out of an incident in a particular family&#151;those families, who have suffered, have shown great leadership and support. Obviously, we are going to refer mostly to Cardiac Risk in the Young, but I should like to acknowledge the many kinds of fundraising throughout the country to purchase equipment and push for change. It all adds to the partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000056">As well as the high-profile sports cases that hit the national news, I am sure that many of us know of cases from our local areas. A rugby team from our local comprehensive school was touring in New Zealand a few years ago when a sixth-former suddenly died during play. Distance added to that tragedy and made the situation more difficult to cope with. It affected the whole of the community that the school serves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08061078000057">The precise incidence is difficult to quantify, but CRY has estimated that eight young people die every week of unexplained cardiac arrhythmia&#151;400 per year&#151;and throughout, it has continued to campaign for universal electrocardiogram screening of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000058">We know that a number of types of cardiac disease affect young people and that symptoms and severity can vary from person to person&#151;some patients never have symptoms. Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome can cause unexpected sudden death during or after excessive exertion. The reason for the onset of symptoms is not really known, and no particular symptom or complaint is unique. Many do not even realise that they have a disease&#151;not until a member of a family presents are other family members screened and found to have a condition. The disease can be hereditary, so if a parent presents, there is a 50 per cent. chance that each child will have the disease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000059">Statistics show that the loss of a child is the hardest loss for families to bear. More than half of marriages in which a child dies break down. In cases of chronic illness, families have the opportunity to prepare in some way for the loss of a child, but because the heart abnormalities responsible for cardiac death in young people often cause no symptoms before sudden death, there is additional shock. As Professor William McKenna, who set up a clinic at the Heart hospital, has pointed out, SADS deaths are preventable and their impact is disproportionately severe. He said:</p>
<a name="80610h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08061078000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It&#146;s not like losing your grandfather at 92. Families fall apart.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000060">The average age for sudden cardiac deaths is 17. I have been re-reading the 2005 national service framework for coronary heart disease&#151;chapter 8&#151;and it is fascinating to see how much of what we are saying today is in it. For example, the aim of quality requirement 3, on sudden cardiac death, is</p>
<a name="80610h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08061078000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to reduce mortality from sudden death and improve services for families&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000061">As the hon. Member for Stockton, South said, as well as the medical side of the matter, the bereavement package is absolutely vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000062">National policies for heart screening vary from country to country&#151;I was interested to hear the hon. Member for North Durham describe the Italian situation. In Greece, children are monitored from the age of four until adulthood, and in Japan, all school children are screened and given ECGs. I accept that screening across the board may not be feasible, but screening even of high-risk individuals is lacking&#151;perhaps it is a postcode lottery, but I am not sure. All children with a family history of sudden cardiac death should be screened, as should children and young people who complain of palpitations and feeling faint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08061078000063">Because the symptoms relating to sudden cardiac death, for example fainting or shortness of breath, are easily attributable to something else, such as asthma&#151;it is easy to put that label on conditions these days&#151;it is thought that the statistic of eight apparently healthy young people dying each week could be conservative. When the cause of death cannot be detected during a post-mortem examination, the inquest verdict can be incorrectly recorded as, for example, accidental death, asthma, epilepsy, which is sometimes misdiagnosed, or drowning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000064">CRY has campaigned for the screening of all secondary school pupils and offers screening to that group. When the Government issued their first NSF in 2000 describing the rights of patients, they did not acknowledge SADS, perhaps because only eight young people die of it each week, compared with the nearly 2,000 who are killed by coronary heart disease in the same period. Thanks to the work of CRY, the hon. Member for Stockton, South, who has shown great leadership on the matter, and many others, the chapter on arrthymia was added to the 2005 NSF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000065">I should like to pick up on some of the points that the NSF makes because, as has been said, a lot has been achieved in raising awareness, but it would be foolish to pretend that we do not have a long way to go. I compliment what has happened, but it is my job, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, to ask the Minister where we are and what are the plans to take us forward.   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000066">The NSF states that</p>
<a name="80610h0002.htm_brev2"><a name="08061078000405"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it is particularly important that children and young people suffering from blackouts are expertly assessed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000067">However, that statement was made in 2005. Will the Minister give us an update on how many specialist blackout clinics are in operation? What processes are in place to encourage referrals for GPs, accident and emergency staff, and other specialists?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08061078000068">When I looked on the internet last night, I saw that a blackout checklist has been developed by Syncope Trust and Reflex Anoxic Seizures to help doctors and parents. How widely is it used? The framework also said that the majority of those cardiac deaths are genetic. How far are we proceeding on genetic testing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para23"><a name="08061078000069">The markers of good practice for children and young people state:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para27"><a name="08061078000073">It says that:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para29"><a name="08061078000075">and so on. My real questions, therefore, are where are we on the implementation of the framework and what plans do the Government have to take things further?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para30"><a name="08061078000076">As has been mentioned, targeted screening has received some Government support. In February 2008, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport spoke at the 11 Downing street launch of the targeted screening campaign that was jointly organised by CRY, the Football Association, the Professional Footballers Association and the Football Foundation. That was around the time that Motherwell footballer Phil O&#146;Donnell died, and his death not only gave us the impetus to highlight the issue of sudden heart failure, but got us into the mindset of seeing that young sportspeople should have a degree of screening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para31"><a name="08061078000077">The issue is how we extend provision to other sports activities. Most deaths do not involve high-profile sportsmen; many involve children whose lives might have been saved had the problem been diagnosed. The siblings and cousins of anyone who has died of cardiac failure have a significant chance of inheriting the problem. It is therefore of the utmost importance that they are screened and monitored for the symptoms of heart problems. The whole family may have the condition, and a second, third or even fourth shocking bereavement  <br>

might occur if individual members are not checked&#151;that has happened. It is shocking that 20 per cent. of people who die from SADS faint or black out during the previous year, while 25 per cent. have witnessed another sudden death in the family. The figures are there for us to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para32"><a name="08061078000078">I congratulate CRY on making &#163;300,000 available to coroners so that they can refer the case of a young person who dies suddenly of unknown causes to an expert cardiac pathologist, thus speeding up the inquest process and making parents aware of the genetic implications of what has happened to their child. In some ways, that might help families to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones, but it could also save the lives of family members and others who may be at risk. As other hon. Members have said, we must look for good to come from such tragedies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para33"><a name="08061078000079">The hon. Member for North Durham referred to the coroners Bill and he has urged us to see that there are ways forward. I, too, hope that Departments will liaise on this issue, because it is vital that they do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para34"><a name="08061078000080">I was interested to read about the work done at the Heart hospital on family trees, and that is just one of the preventive measures of which we should make more use. More than half the individuals who have had family trees constructed are found to have a problem. I want awareness to be raised among GPs so that all children with a family history of sudden cardiac death are screened, along with young people who complain of palpitations or feeling faint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para35"><a name="08061078000081">The way forward is to pursue a step programme and gradually widen the scope of screening, and we have an opportunity to do that, because more and more young people are being encouraged to take part in sport in light of the Olympics. We could really add something to the preparations for the Olympic programme by making screening a special feature. That is worthy of consideration. We need to go step by step. If we do, we will perhaps reach CRY&#146;s aim of universal screening. It certainly makes sense to take a step-by-step approach within some sort of a time framework. We need to prevent the needless deaths of young people.</p>

 I, too, pay tribute to the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) for securing the debate and for his work with the all-party group. I also pay tribute to the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para36"><a name="08061078000084">I pay tribute to the work of CRY, which was founded in 1995 to raise awareness of cardiac risk in the young. The fact that people can take a personal tragedy of immense proportions and transform it into a campaign to raise awareness, seek solutions and prevent the same tragedy from happening to others is outstanding.

consequences of not having adequate bereavement support for families can be profound. The incidence of marriage breakdown and of depression and mental illness among parents and siblings is often undiagnosed and left at the bottom of the list and it is often not associated with bereavement. Dealing with such problems can take up considerable NHS resources&#151;not necessarily at the time, or in the first year or two after the loss of a child, but many years later. We often do not count the cost of offering support in such cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para38"><a name="08061078000086">Sudden cardiac death, which is dramatic, is thought to be caused by a heart condition that is brought on by exercise. We have heard a few statistics, but it is worth re-emphasising some of them. The hon. Member for North Durham said that sudden cardiac death is far more common than cystic fibrosis, which generally gets slightly more publicity. The figures for sudden cardiac death are, however, quite significant. Dr. Sharma, whom the hon. Member for Stockton, South mentioned, concluded that 395,000 people might have an undiagnosed condition that could trigger sudden cardiac death and that 130,000 of them are under 35. As had been said, that is often indicative of inherited cardiac disease. The Government have a real opportunity to prevent further tragedies by offering family members the appropriate care and screening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para39"><a name="08061078000087">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the association with sport. Like many people, I have a personal story. A good friend of my son&#146;s played football every Sunday, but his family came home devastated one day because this young, fit 24-year-old had suddenly collapsed and died. That is devastating for a family. Why do we feel that a sudden death is so acute because the young person was playing sport? As the hon. Member for Stockton, South said, this is not about people being fat and over 50 and smoking fags; it is about young, fit people and about tragedies that we could avoid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para40"><a name="08061078000088">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned death certification and coroners, and there is no doubt that the issue needs addressing. It is difficult accurately to measure the deaths caused by cardiac abnormalities because when tragedies happen and young people die unexpectedly, the cause of death is often given as accidental or as the result of natural causes. CRY commented:</p>
<a name="80610h0002.htm_brev8"><a name="08061078000411"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the UK unexplained &#145;sudden death&#146;, where there is no cause identified, is frequently classified as due to natural causes. Experts believe that the majority of these deaths are due to Sudden Death Syndrome or Sudden Cardiac Death. Until the law is changed and coroners have to refer hearts on to specialists we cannot find the true statistics.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para41"><a name="08061078000089">Not knowing the case of death of an apparently fit and healthy young child or other family member must be agonising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80610h0002.htm_para42"><a name="08061078000090">The UK&#146;s first ever fast-track pathology laboratory, which will help to analyse the causes of unexpected cardiac death in apparently fit and healthy young people, is very welcome. I gather that the unit, the CRY centre for cardiac pathology, is based at the Royal Brompton hospital, and was jointly established with support from Imperial college. The centre will allow coroners to refer cases directly and receive a full report on the cause of death, usually within two weeks. Currently families must endure a wait of anything from three to 18 months. One can only imagine how terrible that must be for them.</p>

thought to have hit the bottom of the pool. I have no doubt, in retrospect, that it was an instance of the kind that we are discussing. I remember the top diving board being closed; it was a very long time ago, but there is no doubt that until we begin to find out accurately what causes such deaths of young people, we shall not make proper progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000092">The hon. Member for Stockton, South, who presented a private Member&#146;s Bill, and the hon. Member for North Durham raised the issue of what we do in this place, and the work that is done by members of all-party groups. I stress that I, like them, am questioned by constituents about what we do when we are not in the Chamber. Often it is commented that the Chamber is very empty. Today&#146;s debate, in fact, represents the huge amount of valuable work that goes on almost behind the scenes, away from the glare of the television cameras. I am not sure whether doctors or MPs are the more difficult group to persuade. It is probably even-steven. It is often difficult to hammer home to hon. Members the evidence about an issue, and the truth of it&#151;and is not it curious that it is often difficult to hammer it home to doctors too? We are probably as bad as each other, but that is why the work of CRY has been so invaluable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000093">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned the national service guidelines. Chapter 8 sets out clearly:</p>
<a name="80610h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="08061078000412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;When sudden cardiac death occurs, NHS services should have systems in place to identify family members at risk and provide personally tailored, sensitive and expert support, diagnosis, treatment and advice to close relatives.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000094">In a CRY survey carried out in March 2006, 97 per cent. of PCTs said that they had failed to develop a strategy for implementing any of the NHS guidelines outlined in chapter 8. Some progress has been made, and we must compliment the Department and the Government for that, but it has been very slow and turgid. Another CRY survey, from 2006, which was carried out in partnership with the all-party group, showed that 13 PCTs were taking active steps to review and improve their services. I hope that the Minister will bring us up to date and demonstrate what progress has been made, and how things are moving ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08061078000095">The issue of specialist nurses has been raised. The Royal College of Nursing published a survey this week: 330 specialist nurses had been contacted, and there was still talk of vacancy freezes and redundancy. There are also numerous anecdotal accounts of specialist nurses having to undertake general ward duties, so that although on paper they show up in a head count as specialist nurses in practice, they do not spend time in their specialism. There is no doubt that specialist nurses can make a crucial difference. Working with cardiologists they can have a significant impact. The issue of GPs and diagnosis has been mentioned several times. Continuing education and the raising of awareness among GPs is exactly the sort of work that specialist nurses can do. The picture is not dissimilar with respect to conditions such as epilepsy. Children with epilepsy are left undiagnosed for months or perhaps even years because teachers and GPs are not aware of the implications of something that the parents or child might describe in terms that would not necessarily suggest a more serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000096">I want to finish by asking the Minister what she is doing, what impact the debate has had on her thinking, and what she will do to encourage PCTs to do more to  <br>

implement the national service framework. Time and again charities and organisations welcome, as CRY has done, guidelines and documents; but precious little happens by way of implementation. With every week that goes by without the implementation of the guidelines, another child dies and there is a personal tragedy for the family. The implications of that tragedy will probably go unrecorded, but the family will be left with the enduring suffering that they will have to bear for the rest of their lives.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) on his success in the ballot, and I am grateful to him for continuing to raise awareness of this important subject, particularly through his work as chairman of the all-party group on cardiac risk in the young. I pay tribute to the group&#146;s membership as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000098">Every young death is a tragedy, but when that death occurs very unexpectedly in an apparently fit and healthy young person, in the prime of their life and with so much to look forward to, the impact is much greater. Hon. Members have expressed that passionately today. In this day and age, we have come to associate death with increasing old age. When young people are struck down before their potential is fulfilled, without the time for their families and friends to adjust and say goodbye, and when the fear that another family member may have inherited the same potentially fatal condition is added, the stress on the grieving family is almost impossible to imagine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000099">Most sudden deaths in young people occur, as we have heard, as a result of an inherited cardiac condition. It is often difficult to detect the risk beforehand, because the person will probably not show any symptoms. That makes it very difficult to find proactively everyone who would benefit from targeted support and treatment. As an absolute minimum, when a tragic sudden death occurs, we must do everything that we can to determine the risk to other family members and ensure that they receive the best advice, support and treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000100">Chapter 8 of the coronary heart disease national service framework, which was launched in 2005 and covers arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, is the Government&#146;s statement of intent for the development of those services. It states that, when sudden cardiac death occurs, NHS services should have systems in place to identify family members at risk and provide personally tailored, sensitive and expert support, diagnosis, treatment, information and advice to close relatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000101">I will in a moment cover some of the key progress that has been made since chapter 8 was launched, but I want first to pay tribute to those whose hard work resulted in the launch of that important document. It is widely recognised that chapter 8 might not have come about without the considerable efforts of Alison Cox of Cardiac Risk in the Young, who I am proud to say was awarded a well-deserved MBE last year.

for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) are also very able people who have contributed to chapter 8. We are keen to ensure that ownership of the policy is retained by all who had a hand in its conception and development and that they are encouraged to work together on its implementation. We are delighted that Alison Cox and other members of CRY, along with other patient organisations such as SADS UK, the Cardiomyopathy Association and the Arrhythmia Alliance, continue to be involved in the implementation of chapter 8 nationally and locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000102">On the day that I was appointed to this post, I was fortunate enough to be invited to speak at a CRY parliamentary reception. I have endeavoured to follow the organisation&#146;s progress closely ever since and to lend it whatever support I can. It is a privilege to be the Minister responsible for cardiac services, but with that privilege comes great responsibility. I hope that I can explain some of that work in my reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08061078000103">As well as working with the Department of Health and other national organisations to develop high-quality cardiac services for young people and their families, CRY provides significant funding to help join up and fast-track the complex range of services necessary after a sudden cardiac death to determine the risk to other family members, which is very important. In addition, CRY provides funding for research into heart conditions and has recently established, in collaboration with the Royal Brompton hospital, the CRY centre for cardiac pathology. CRY and all those involved in the development and ongoing implementation of chapter 8 are to be congratulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000104">It is important to recognise how complex this clinical issue is. Families who have lost a loved young person and may themselves be at risk from a familial heart condition need access to specialist services provided by a range of different professions. If families are to be assessed properly and get the right information, support, care and treatment, the different professions need to work together. Getting the various service elements to complement each other takes time, and some might say that the development of such services has been slow, but it is important to recognise that many significant developments have taken place since the launch of chapter 8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000105">Under the auspices of the Royal College of Pathologists, pathologists and cardiologists have established a UK network of specialist cardiac pathologists to ensure that coroners can call on the right expertise in suspected cases of sudden cardiac death. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham praised Dr. Mary Sheppard, and I add the Department&#146;s praise for her work. The Department of Health recently funded the establishment of a database to record information on cases referred to those specialist cardiac pathologists; &#163;35,000 was made available. The database should provide invaluable information on where and why such deaths are occurring, what specialist pathology is sought and provide cardiac pathologists with a local audit tool. My hon. Friend asked whether I would meet the relatives; of course I will, to gain as much information and knowledge as we can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000106">At the other end of the spectrum, the Department of Health issued a document in March 2007, setting out a blueprint for the development of specialist inherited cardiac conditions services in the NHS. We are working  <br>

with service commissioners and providers to ensure that all who require a risk assessment for such conditions get a comprehensive assessment from a service with all the necessary expertise and knowledge, but it is what happens between the coroner&#146;s involvement and assessment and treatment at a specialist centre that is crucial and needs to be better co-ordinated. Organisations such as CRY have made an enormous difference through patient awareness and bereavement support and by linking directly to specialist NHS and wider services. However, the Department of Health, with other stakeholders, is currently working with the British Heart Foundation to determine how the pathway for those at risk can be better co-ordinated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000107">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned specialist black-out clinics, which are being developed across the country. Manchester in particular has a specialist unit, from which many other units are learning and gaining expertise.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="08061078000108"><a name="80610h0003.htm_spnew0"><a name="08061078000450"><b>Anne Milton:</b>
 When does the Minister expect those specialist centres to be available to people throughout the country? There is concern in many areas that services are patchy. It is important that they should be rolled out and available to everyone.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="08061078000109"><a name="80610h0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="08061078000451"><b>Ann Keen:</b>
 Such services are being developed across the country. They are at different levels of development, of course, as I am sure the hon. Lady appreciates. To sum up today where we are with them is not possible. Every clinical expertise develops at its own pace. Best practice at many centres is being considered. As I mentioned, Manchester has the ability to offer best practice to other centres in progress. Important developments have taken place. The developments promoted by organisations such as CRY are the building blocks&#151;or steps, as were mentioned&#151;for a better-quality service for those who need it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000110">I mentioned that an absence of symptoms can make it difficult to determine who may be at risk from one of the inherited conditions that could result in a sudden cardiac death and what that risk may be. There have always been arguments for and against the national screening of population groups for inherited conditions. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham mentioned the important possibility of considering what medical assessments could take place in secondary school. That is something that we could and should consider; it is a valuable contribution to the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08061078000111">The UK National Screening Committee has reviewed the evidence for screening for the most widespread inherited cardiac condition&#151;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#151;on a number of occasions and is doing so again. However, the committee has always concluded that there is not enough evidence to warrant either a blanket screening programme or one targeted specifically at those groups thought to be at high risk, such as young athletes. If a person is found to have an inherited heart condition, it may never affect them. Also, if they are involved in sporting activities, there is little evidence to suggest that removing them from that environment will either reduce or increase their risk of dying suddenly from the condition. A person who tests positive will therefore face significant dilemmas. Should they continue the career that they have mapped out for themselves? Should they start a   <br>

family? They can also be penalised financially with higher insurance premiums. Those are some of the hard facts that would be faced by those screened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000112">Whether or not widespread screening takes place, we must encourage and support any initiative that raises awareness of inherited cardiac conditions and gets people to question whether they may be at risk. That might involve people simply asking themselves straightforward questions about the health of living and deceased relatives and deducing whether there might be a risk. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South mentioned the James Cook university hospital in Middlesbrough and the work taking place there. Without question, I endorse the work of specialist nurses in that area.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="08061078000113"><a name="80610h0003.htm_spnew2"><a name="08061078000452"><b>Anne Milton:</b>
 Does the Minister therefore share my concern about the Royal College of Nursing report that I referred to, which deals with the number of specialist nurses facing frozen vacancies and redundancy?</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="08061078000114"><a name="80610h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="08061078000453"><b>Ann Keen:</b>
 The hon. Lady raises the issue constantly as though we were not considering it. Of course, everybody is concerned about the reports that professional bodies, such as the Royal College of Nursing, bring to the table, but I think that she would agree that, at this time, all the specialist nurses in the country are being used as effectively as they can. That trend is only growing, and I am sure that she would want to represent it positively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000115">Parents of physically active children might want them to undergo a clinical test, having weighed up carefully the pros and cons associated with such an action. If the family decide that they want to have a personal test carried out, CRY can offer that service, for a small fee, along with all the necessary information and support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000116">This country has about 6 million footballers, ranging from those who have a kick about&#151;one with whom I live was having one this morning&#151;at the weekend to professionals. I was delighted to be part of the recent launch of an initiative promoted by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and hon. Members referred to the reception held recently in Downing street. It is imperative that we work in partnership with a number of organisations, including CRY and national football organisations, to promote awareness of such conditions. The initiative also raises awareness of the excellent services that CRY offers, giving people the choice of personal testing if they wish to exercise that choice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="80610h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000117">In conclusion, we heard the statistics for young people and their families: we are told that eight young people die every week, which is such a tragedy. The heartache of all concerned is well-recognised by hon. Members here and those of the all-party group on cardiac risk in the young. We have a long way to go in the development of services, but I believe that, in the spirit of the all-party group, we have made progress, as has been mentioned by most hon. Members today. For those at risk of an inherited cardiac condition, we need to do, and have done, so much. We must thank stakeholders more widely and recognise the way in which everyone has worked together. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham mentioned the Olympics being used to raise awareness, which is a very positive initiative that we should consider further.</p>

Let us have it spelled out exactly what sort of operations we are expecting in the future&#151;or is this a case of next-war-itis?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000132">General Dannatt, Lord Drayson&#151;the former Minister with responsibility for procurement&#151;and the Secretary of State himself have all stated that FRES, future rapid effect system, vehicles will play a dual role for high-intensity warfare and counter-insurgency. Although I believe that equipment that has been designed for counter-insurgency can be used successfully in high-intensity warfare, I do not believe that the reverse is necessarily the case, for reasons that I shall give.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000133">Using Afghanistan as an example, it is not difficult to predict, in any counter-insurgency warfare, that if the insurgents are heavily defeated in straight-on conflicts, they will resort to other tactics such as the use of various explosive devices. The MOD has responded to that threat by purchasing Mastiff, Ridgeback and Bushmaster vehicles, and I pay due credit to the Secretary of State for taking such vital procurement decisions. There are now 282 Mastiffs, 157 Ridgebacks and 24 Bushmasters. In total, 463 such vehicles are ranged against 169 Vector Pinzgauers, which are fast cross-country vehicles but are not designed to protect soldiers from mines or improvised explosive devices. There are 180 mobility weapon mount installation kits, or MWMIKs&#151;known as Jackals&#151;and 2,000 proposed Piranha V vehicles. I emphasise that those vehicles are proposed, because they have not yet been built. That makes 2,349 vehicles in all. With the best will in the world, one could hardly say that that is a very balanced mixture, bearing it in mind that the whole future Army structure is geared to the latter type. I would hardly call that situation &#147;making present operations the top priority&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000134">However, I take heart from a recent answer from the Minister that future requirements for the Mastiff and other vehicles of that type will be reviewed when operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have been completed. However, as we are likely to be in Afghanistan for the long term, that could realistically be at least 20 years down the road. How many more conflicts of that nature will the UK be engaged in or have been engaged in by then, with 2,349 vehicles that are not particularly suited to purpose&#151;they are in storage or tying up manpower&#151;compared with 463 vehicles that have a proven track record in counter-insurgency operations?</p>

The downside is that the resulting vehicle is somewhat butch in looks and taller, but it is perfectly acceptable in today&#146;s conflicts. The upside is that the vehicle can take punishment, as the hon.

answer is due to be taken out of service by 2015, has the driver sitting right up over the front wheels and is a death trap in which lives have sadly been lost. The Jackal is a slight improvement, with the driver sitting inside the front wheels, but it has had to be armoured, adding 42 per cent. to its unladen weight at a cost of &#163;83,000 a vehicle. That is similar to what happened with the Land Rover. Armour was added to the chassis, increasing its weight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000145">Finally, there is Piranha V, which is incredibly expensive. Its weight, with all the additions, will creep up from 27 tonnes to more than 30 tonnes. The Canadians have had problems with their Piranha III, a lighter version, becoming bogged down in Afghanistan. If the appliqu&#233; armour is penetrated, the vehicle is a write-off. That is acceptable in high-end warfare, but when it happens in counter-insurgency engagements, the ground has to be secured in order to try to salvage the vehicle. With nightfall, unless many troops are to be tied down, the vehicle has to be abandoned, with a subsequent massive write-off in value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000146">It has soon been forgotten that the original concept of FRES was a network-enabled system of vehicles that would engage the enemy at a distance. The new FRES does not meet those objectives. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions, in the kind of warfare that our troops are encountering now, the enemy is not at a distance and is often indistinguishable from the local population. The danger is all around them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000147">I imagine that the powers that be have noticed how many attacks occur either at a pinch point or near base, usually when a patrol is returning. I happen to agree with Robert Gates and believe that future conflicts in which the United Kingdom will be involved are likely to be similar to the present ones. I contend that UK troops will need considerably more of the type of vehicles of which we have 463, and perhaps considerably fewer of the others, if they are to be successful in future with minimum loss of life. I trust that the Minister will make an argument as to why the vehicles of which we have 2,349 are so numerous, when others are more suited to present day warfare. The case needs to be made by both the Government and the military. The morale of our troops is based to a great extent on having the right tools for the job, and at present the jury is well and truly out.

 I am listening carefully to what the hon. Lady is saying. Is it not the case that the commanders need a range of different vehicles? Anybody who has actually seen a Mastiff knows that it is quite a large beast that is perhaps not usable in some terrain in Afghanistan, for example. Commanders need a range of vehicles, including lightly armoured vehicles that, with the best will in the world, could not be armoured to a greater degree because the terrain that they cover means that they need to be quick. If they were armoured up, they might be unusable.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman, who serves with distinction on the Select Committee on Defence, raises another old chestnut that is mentioned time and again. Of course there must be a range of vehicles. I thought that I was arguing that the range seems to be rather heavily biased on one side, and that there has not been strategic thinking by either the military or the Ministry of Defence about what may be required in future better to serve the interests of this country and our soldiers by preventing deaths in counter-insurgency operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000151">What insurgents aim to achieve is to make us send home as many body bags as possible. Their main task is to defeat whom they would call the &#147;invaders&#148; and to make the &#147;invader nation&#148; withdraw its forces by having an impact on public opinion in its country, leaving them a better chance of taking over. As for the concept of vehicle design and construction, ask the drivers which vehicles they would prefer if they want to stay alive, not be crippled, and avoid being in a body bag and becoming yet another triumph for the insurgents to gloat about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000152">In order to defeat any insurgency, it is necessary to train the host country&#146;s own military forces so that they can deal with the problem and protect their own people. That is happening successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan; their armies are doing a great job and allowing our forces gradually to be withdrawn. More often than not, the host country&#146;s forces have the same vehicles as ours, and in some cases better ones. For example, Iraqi forces have a variant of the Cougar and armoured Humvees. The Afghani forces lag slightly behind, probably for good reasons; they use Toyota trucks. Such parity ensures that there is no feeling of inferiority and that the host country&#146;s troops are on a par with the UK troops who are training them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000153">When we come to the Royal Air Force, I fear that the contrast is extreme and the situation nothing less than an unmitigated disaster. For Afghanistan to succeed after the withdrawal of UK and other troops, it must have sufficient air power. Yet can hon. Members see us training the Afghan air force to use the Eurofighter, an aircraft that was never designed for ground attack? We are using equipment that we have been landed with for the sake of using it and because the UK does not have anything more practical to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000154">I have argued long and hard that in counter-insurgency situations, turbo-prop aircraft, which the host country&#146;s pilots can be trained to use alongside our own pilots, are the most suitable aircraft. However, in a similar way to the arguments about vehicles, the powers that be compare single or double-prop aircraft with fast jets and do not consider the practical alternatives. Our pilots train on the Tucano, so what is wrong with a ground attack version?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000155">Let me reinforce the point. Fast jets have to sit at suitable bases that are limited in number. It could take 20 to 30 minutes for them to get into the air and to reach the target, which they cannot see, given the speed they fly at, so they have to rely on a forward air controller. Obviously, they do not stay long over the conflict area. By way of contrast, a prop aircraft can loiter overhead giving surveillance cover, because it can see exactly what is happening on the ground. A prop aircraft can attack accurately within a minute or two and give genuine air cover. What an advantage that would have been over these last few years.</p>

 Often, the attitude seems to be that the UK needs the best to cover every eventuality, and therefore the nation will cough up the funds for that. Once again, however, that is exactly the attitude to which Robert Gates referred and it is one of the reasons why we are so short of helicopters. Similarly, 12 Type 45 destroyers were ordered but only six are to be delivered, which is a direct consequence of high costs. The military are not living in the real world if they believe that they can have anything at any price, and that is one of the reasons why the UK is short of what it actually needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80610h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000160">According to the Ministry of Defence, in February the serviceability of the Mk 3 Merlin was 50 per cent. against a target of 70 per cent., which was only beaten by the Navy Mk 1, the serviceability of which was 41 per cent. Similarly, the serviceability of the Sea King Mk 4/6 Navy version was 45 per cent. against a target of 65 per cent. I repeat: platforms are needed across the board for counter-insurgency that are simple, robust and will last in the long term. Yes, they must also carry the latest technology, but at the same time they must be as simple as possible to maintain. It is not practical to have overly complicated, highly technical platforms that require massive back-up to remain operational and are unsuitable for training the host nation&#146;s forces. I sometimes think that the military have been seduced by the European Union agenda and the possibility of having gleaming, highly technical toys with which to fight a conventional all-out war.</p>

Whichever party wins the next general election, some very large financial commitments have been made by this Government that will come into effect during the period from 2010 to 2015. If the military believe that they will get more money out of a Conservative Government, I think that they are deluding themselves. That extra money is not likely to be forthcoming, bearing it in mind that the country will probably be broke by then.

Does she not think that an important feedback is that foreign policy should also be aware of the capability of our defence policy? If that were the case, we would not have walked away from Afghanistan too soon and moved on to Iraq without finishing the job that was to be done in Afghanistan, and without focusing our resources to see through the task that we had gone there to do.</p>

We should face facts and recognise that the United Kingdom can no longer fulfil all its aspirations as far as defence is concerned, and that stretched resources and manpower will limit what we can achieve in the future.</p>

Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) sits at home at night going through statistics and, obviously, gaining a vast knowledge about various pieces of kit and then moving them around some fancy battlefield on her kitchen table. From my experience of visiting Iraq five times and Afghanistan on three occasions, I do not think that what she said is realistic or reflects what is happening on the ground.</p>

I do not think that most people at that time would have foreseen that, seven years later Britain, would be in both Afghanistan and Iraq. There has been rapid change. Of course, I agree with the hon.

counter-insurgency improvised explosive devices and enemies that&#151;let us be honest&#151;are not stupid or foolish. They are developing not just tactics to attack our forces but technology. We should not think that, just because people live in the caves of Tora Bora, they are not also using the latest technologies and techniques of counter-insurgency. An aspect to which we do not pay enough attention&#151;the hon. Lady mentioned this&#151;is the way in which our enemies use the media and the internet to get their message across.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000179">The hon. Lady is right about some of the equipment failures in the early days. There were questions to be asked, but we have responded to what was happening. As she and the Minister know, I am not afraid to criticise the MOD when it gets things wrong. In the past few years, vehicles such as the Mastiff and other urgent operational requirements have been put into theatre quickly, and lessons could be learned from that for other procurement processes. When we actually need pieces of kit, we can get them into the field quickly&#151;industry is up to the challenge&#151;so why can we not do it on other occasions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000180">On the future rapid effect system, the hon. Lady and I are the two anoraks in Parliament. We have both been asking questions about the process. Frankly, it is a farce of a programme. It has gone on far too long, and it has been chopped and changed. As the hon. Lady knows, I have asked several questions, as she has, about FRES. The MOD may wonder why those two anoraks are asking all those questions, but, to be honest, there are issues not just about delivering kit to our armed forces but about value for money, which she rightly raised.</p>

 I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me about this. When looking at FRES, the Defence Committee learned that the military could not make up their minds about their requirements. They continuously changed their minds, and pressure was created because nobody had a clear indication of what was actually needed. The Defence Committee should take some of the credit for getting the military to look differently at how they were assessing their requirements.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, who serves on the Defence Committee with me. The hon. Member for Congleton mentioned in her speech something that we should do. There is a tendency for the Army and others to hide behind politicians, but the hon. Gentleman is correct that, in respect of some decisions, they are not clear about their requirements. Things get changed. Alongside that, there is Abbey Wood, which, frankly, grows ever more and employs more and more people to evaluate things down to the finest point possible.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point. He knows my background. I cannot help but feel that regular soldiers, professional officers and so on are sometimes far too close to the problem, and that things become more obscure the more knowledgeable one is. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is up to Ministers to give the firm smack of leadership and insert the toe of their boot into regular Army, Navy and Air Force officers where they do not like having boots inserted? Make them do their job, and make sure that taxpayers&#146; money is properly spent and that MOD  <br>

 I agree, but I have to tell the hon. Gentleman&#151;he knows that I have a great deal of affection for him&#151;that we cannot then have his Front-Bench team attacking Labour Ministers for not understanding the military, or somehow not being in tune with the military ethos. There is a military ethos, and there is expertise, which we have to take on board and listen to, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman that sometimes we also have to turn around and say that tough decisions need to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000185">What the hon. Member for Congleton said about the defence budget was very interesting. I am one who would argue for more money to be spent on defence, and I am sure that she would as well, but, whether we like it or not, we cannot take funds from the budgets of the entire Government&#151;defence competes with other things. I sometimes think that some of the present debate about more money for the military is taking place in a vacuum, in that people are not realising that money would be taken from the health service and everywhere else. Would the public necessarily agree with that? Added to that, as the hon. Member for Newark rightly said, there will be criticism if the money is not well spent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000186">I should like to concentrate on FRES for a minute. We have now had the trials of truth. I am not quite clear where we are at with FRES. Last year, I went with the Chairman of the Defence Committee to the trials of truth for the three vehicles. The hon. Member for Congleton made a good point about one of the three vehicles, the Piranha V. There is no such vehicle; it does not exist. I get different views from industry and various people from the MOD and military whom I speak to, but I suspect that the reason why it is being promoted is that the Army wants it. That is its preference. We have had a coming together of various interests. Clearly, the Army wants the Piranha V, because it thinks that it is the best vehicle, which is fair enough. The Treasury is also behind it, knowing that it can take the bow wave of that procurement into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000187">This is where I come on to the Mastiff and other vehicles. The hon. Member for Congleton raised an important point. When I attended the trials of truth, I asked Lord Drayson, who was then the Minister, how the vehicles fit into the FRES requirement.</p>

 I am sorry, but they do; they are apparently now part of the FRES family of vehicles. The original concept was about wonderful all-singing, all-dancing vehicles, but I am not clear what it is now. That is why I tabled several questions last week specifically about weight and other things to which the hon. Lady referred.</p>

more years, or that perhaps we do not actually need it? That would be more honest than the nonsense that we keep getting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000191">There have been three or four in-service dates for FRES. I found the most recent information that I was given funny. I was told that the MOD does not give in-service dates, even though the answers to parliamentary questions that I received a few years ago actually gave such dates and even though General Jackson, when giving evidence to the Defence Committee, gave a date for FRES. I think that a little bit of honesty needs to be brought into this debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="08061078000192"><a name="80610h0005.htm_spnew9"><a name="08061078000480"><b>Ann Winterton:</b>
 I agree. It would be much more honest to say that FRES is not what was intended, that it has come to an end and that we are going to change the name of the future requirements programme. Doing so would give a clear indication that the Government were going in the right direction.</p>

 It is the future rapid effects system, Mr. Olner. That is a good question. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, it is a mystery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000195">I pay credit to urgent operational requirements, because although there has been a lot of criticism of kit, I think that the kit has been delivered now. I saw a Mastiff vehicle that had run over a mine in Basra last time that I was there and spoke to the lads that were inside it at the time. Clearly, it saved their lives. Not only is that vehicle repairable, it is popular with the personnel using it. That is one solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000196">In respect of counter-insurgency, commanders need a suite of different vehicles&#151;sometimes the press do not quite grasp that&#151;and some of those vehicles cannot be heavily armoured, because of the terrain that they are working in. If we are not careful, we will have a vehicle that is so heavily armoured that it will not be able to move. We must recognise that counter-insurgency warfare is a dangerous business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80610h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000197">In conclusion, the MOD has a good track record. I should like more urgent operational requirements, because that would provide better value for money and cut the long delays and the sense of frustration, not necessarily on the part of some of the generals, but on the part of some of the men and women who are being asked to do a difficult job in some difficult parts of the world.</p>

I hope that, if and when the Conservative party gets into power, it will take on board the many good points of the current crop of Ministers, including how they handle themselves, and I hope that we will put further pressure on the senior officers and senior civil servants in the Ministry of Defence to make our armed forces more effective.</p>

We don&#146;t know what is about to happen, but we know these are going to be some of the most seminal, thought-forming experiences for the next decade or so.&#148; It was great that we had Saif Sareea and great that the armed forces understood that operations in hot climates would occur and that they would probably be of a counter-insurgency nature.

Compared with what we had the last time we were in Afghanistan and compared with what we had when we were in Bosnia, this kit is really excellent.&#148; Yes, there are anomalies and problems, but we are realistic about such things. For instance, in relation to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton, those soldiers told us that the WIMK vehicle, the converted armoured Land Rover, was not perfect, but, by golly, they needed vehicles that they felt that they could get on and off quickly. While there were certainly more heavily armoured vehicles in the pipeline, as my hon. Friend pointed out, the vehicle mix was important, and commanders had to be flexible. Yes, they pointed out that the armour plates were inadequate. Yes, there was a lot of find and fix going on by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, but they accepted that because they were professional soldiers. The bottom line was that, although they had difficulties, which they understood, equipment was good on the whole and much better than it had been.</p>

The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5 Scots, has a paper strength, give or take, of 700. Its actual strength or deployed strength is 500. It has been able to go into the field with only 500 of the 700 bayonets that it should be taking to the Taliban. If that is examined in more detail, only about 350 Argylls have gone on operations with 5 Scots, with the rest being made up of reinforcements from the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2 Scots, and other Army battalions.

In truth, it is only marginally under strength by about 5,000, so let us say that on paper that it has 98,000 men. However, the Minister is well aware that only about 50,000 are able to deploy. The rest have problems with compassionate issues, are not qualified, are still in training or are sick. That is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000217">The Minister fully understands that manning is made up of a three-part equation. The first part is recruiting; the second part&#151;I do not mean to be patronising&#151;is retention during training; and the third part is retention during service. If we ask how recruiting is going, the answer is, &#147;Not bad. It is going very well.&#148; If we then ask how many men are retained during training and we concentrate on combat arms and particularly the infantry, the Minister will find, if he does not know already, that between 35 and 40 per cent. of infantry recruits drop out during training. The next part of the equation is how many men&#151;trained non-commissioned officers and senior private soldiers&#151;are retained in service? I do not know the figures, but inability to retain trained personnel is major problem.</p>

 If the Army is under the pressure that the hon. Gentleman is describing&#151;the Defence Committee is compiling a report on retention and recruitment&#151;and if we are looking not only for value for money, but to retain people, is it not time to review Army structure in the UK, so that we do not have a plethora of commands and soldiers carrying out activities that are not front-line commitments?</p>

 I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I had dinner with a major-general the other day at his house in London. I had better not give his name. Two sergeants had been abstracted from a battalion on operations&#151;one was a mortarman and the other belonged to the battalion&#146;s mechanical transport platoon&#151;to serve food dressed in little red monkey jackets, while the battalion was on operations against an enemy abroad. That cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000220">I roundly condemn the future infantry structure, for all sorts of different reasons. The only parts of the organisation with the curious name of the Mercian Regiment that are fully manned and recruited are battalion headquarters and the headquarter companies&#151;with the greatest respect, the non-combatant side and officers and senior non-commissioned officers carrying the rank, the pensions, the pay, and so on. The bayonet power of those three battalions amounts to only just one and a bit battalions. Lieutenant-colonels and below neatly and comfortably carry on along their career paths, while the fighting manpower is flexed between the three battalions, almost like rent-a-mob, and does not receive the necessary tour gaps, rest and recuperation, training and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000221">The Minister has heard me talk about the matter&#151;I am sure that he is extremely bored with they way in which I do so&#151;but the Ministry of Defence is in denial, and I do not believe that Ministers are being told the correct story by people in the Ministry. For example, I appreciate that recruiting is only part of the manning equation, but if it is so important, if Headquarters Recruiting Group&#146;s job is so crucial in getting the petrol into the Army engine and if a key player in that is the brigadier in charge of recruiting, why was he absent for eight months last year on a court martial? That really cannot be right. Such decisions are wrong, and I ask the Minister to dig beneath the surface of what he is being told by career-conscious and ambitious officers to find out what the truth is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000222">What used to be called the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment was 90 men over strength eight years ago when I left it; it is now almost 100 men under strength when conditions are easier than they were eight or nine years ago, the Army is in the public eye much more than then and the opportunities to recruit are better. The measure that is being discussed to relax recruiting boundaries will result in a free-for-all and to all intents and purposes the regimental system that we have had for 250 years will be finally stabbed to death. That is a serious error. If regiments have the word &#147;Irish&#148; in their name, they should be allowed to recruit in Ireland and to continue to take on Irish recruits. The 2nd Battalion the Mercian Regiment is now for ever forlornly stationed in Palace barracks, Holywood. Why on earth should it recruit Irishmen? That is what the Ministry of Defence is proposing, and if the Minister is not aware of that, I ask him to consider the matter is more detail. It is dangerous, insidious and a final blow to the regimental system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000223">I shall finish by saying that much of the kit has improved and that much of the detail that has gone wrong in the past is now much better, but above and beyond everything else, if we do not have the manpower to fight the wars that our Government and nation want to fight, it is not only unfair but immoral.</p>

 First, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, I would like to give my condolences to the families of the three paratroopers. As hon. Members have said and as I am sure the Minister will repeat, all of our thoughts and prayers go to the families and friends of the three young men whose lives were cut short in such tragic circumstances while they were fighting on our behalf. We owe a big debt of gratitude to them and to the other 97 families who have been affected in similar ways by the fighting in Afghanistan. We also owe a debt of gratitude to those fighting in Iraq and those who have been injured and seen their lives change significantly. The hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) should be congratulated on initiating this debate and on providing an opportunity to speak up for those people. The families of many of those affected by the issue have made many criticisms about equipment and have complained to the Defence Committee in order to try to bring home to Parliament the need for equipment failures to be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000225">I was going to interrupt the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer), but he spent so much time talking about bayonet power I was nervous to do so because I believe he was quite handy with a bayonet at one time. He was at full flow and I did not think he would take kindly to being interrupted by someone reminding him to get on with it and give us a chance to have our say. Bayonet power aside, I found the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution extremely interesting. He is right: the biggest failure is not having the manpower&#151;men and women; the most precious of all commodities&#151; available to deliver what we expect from our armed forces. His figures need to be verified and the MOD needs to answer the points he made about an on-paper 700 strong battalion only being able to deploy 500 people, many of whom are from other units. More importantly, it is worrying that so many of a returning battalion are unfit for service in a similar circumstance in the future. If, for example, a third of the battalion is unavailable for combat because of sustained injuries, such as deafness, what does that do to the morale and effectiveness of the unit?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08061078000226">I have a great deal of time and affection for my colleague from the Defence Committee, the hon.

It is beyond me why he has never been looked at for further advancement, and I am sure many of his colleagues on the Defence Committee also share that view. He would make a useful contribution to dealing with this issue and would bring some straight thinking.</p>

 No. He knows, as well as I do, that the Defence Committee has never shirked from its responsibility of taking on the military in relation to equipment. We do not have in-service dates now because the MOD learned through Eurofighter, which had more in&#151;service dates than Frank Sinatra had retirement and farewell concerts, that it cannot do so because they fail to materialise. One has only to look at the Committee&#146;s most recent report on defence equipment for evidence of that. The report talks about the failure of in-service dates on nearly every project. In some instances, the in-service date has been shifted five or six times. Therefore, we do not now give in-service dates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000229">The hon. Member for Congleton spoke well about understanding what is needed when fighting an insurgency. I agree with her entirely. The suggestion that we will fight some sort of conventional war in the future is long past its sell-by date. I do not think we will be in that position. The lessons from Iraq one and two, and from our experiences in Afghanistan are vitally important to understanding where we go in the future. That is why the military have to be more realistic about what they expect a Government to deliver. I do not sympathise with Ministers, but I can understand the predicament they are in. They are challenged time and again with repeated requests for different things and have to prioritise matters that the military themselves fail to prioritise and be clear about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000230">Again, I commend the Defence Committee&#146;s report to hon. Members and to the whole House. Time and again, the report mentions the failure to have a clear perception of what is required and the fact that the spec of the equipment is continuously changed. There is also the issue of Abbey Wood and wanting to check the reliability of the design or structure of the product to the nth degree instead of looking at what is required and first of all seeing if it is available anywhere else in the world. There is a distinct reluctance on the part of the Ministry of Defence to look for something already tried and tested and take it off the shelf.</p>

 The Minister shakes his head. The hon. Member for North Durham who spoke earlier said that there has been a change. That change has been a long time coming. In the past, predecessors of the Minister have repeatedly spoken to the Committee and the House and have flatly refused to look at the off-the-shelf option. Bowman, and Clansman before it, are classic examples of the Government not wanting to buy products that are available, even though they do what they want them to.</p>

 Would the hon. Gentleman agree that although what the Minister says is correct, the default setting in the MOD means that even when something is bought off the shelf, an integrated project team still has to be put in place to look at how it has been evaluated. For example, the Minimi machine gun, which was purchased during early operations in Afghanistan, was welcomed, did a great job and everyone loved it.

knew that it was the weapon required, yet every obstacle possible was put in the way of early deployment. Why? We do not know why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000237">I draw hon. Members attention to an old issue that we face time and again. In last night&#146;s <i>Evening Standard</i>, there was a picture of five members of the Parachute Regiment on deployment in Helmand. It was interesting to look at their feet because not two of them have the same pair of boots and three of them have different webbing packs. Equipment is important. The hon. Member for Newark is correct: servicemen have seen a dramatic improvement in the provision of equipment. However, some issues still cause them concern and safety in vehicles is a classic problem. We have had the argument time and again about boots that do not work in the desert and I do not want to go over that. However, our service personnel still buy their own equipment because what they are issued with is not suitable for the conditions that they are in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000238">I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members to some of the things mentioned in today&#146;s debate pack. An issue that has not been mentioned is that of vehicles enabling the treatment of injury and the cases of victims who need to be transported and worked on by medics. Space is confined and facilities for proper medical vehicles are lacking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="80610h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000239">There is much to be said on the matter. I realise that time is short and that hon. Members want to hear the Minister respond, so on behalf of my colleagues and as a result of my experience on the Defence Committee, I would like to say that there are improvements on the way that will have a great effect&#151;for example, the Mastiff and other changes that have occurred in vehicles. However, I share the view that the flexibility of the command to have a series of vehicles and choices is vital. I also share the view of those hon. Members who have said that it is no good settling for just one correct option&#151;one has only to see the consequences of not having such an approach to realise that. I also agree with the hon. Member for Congleton: we have to deal with our colleagues who have failed to share the burden&#151;not in the European Union, but in NATO. This is a NATO issue; not an EU issue. If it cannot share the fighting and dying, I hope that at some stage it can at least share the equipment. The fact we had to buy helicopters from the Danes is once again a clear example of co-operation just not existing.</p>

I just warn her against being too zealous in going down the route of concentrating wholly and exclusively on the immediate, for we face a much more complex world now than that which we faced when the cold war was at its height and we could see exactly where the threat was coming from. The threat is now all around us. We know what the threat is from insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq, but I would be very nervous about dismissing Mr. Putin&#146;s intentions in building up his armed forces. Although I agree with my hon. Friend that it is unlikely that our shores face attack in the foreseeable future, it would be a foolish politician who decided to take the gamble that we could safely ignore consideration of, for example, renewal of our nuclear deterrent or, indeed, some of our other capabilities that will not be required in the immediate future.</p>

I alerted the former Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid), when I returned from an armed forces parliamentary scheme visit to Iraq in 2005 that we were in grave danger of having completely inadequate equipment to deal with improvised explosive devices. He assured me that he was already on the case. My hon. Friend has been absolutely stalwart in arguing the case for the V-shaped hull. The recognition by the Ministry of Defence that that was needed was too slow. The Government&#146;s response was too slow, but my hon. Friend has been utterly consistent on that issue and has been proved right by virtue of what has been happening in theatre. We have all seen the Mastiff in operation and it is undoubtedly an excellent piece of kit.</p>

Friend would say that rather than having the most expensive, most sophisticated UAVs, we should be considering cheaper options. In my constituency, QinetiQ is developing something called Zephyr, which is a UAV for very high altitudes. It looks like something from a balsa wood kit. It is operated using solar panels and is doing a fantastic job. It is still in research mode, but I hope that the Minister will tell us what is being done to harness UAVs to provide better reconnaissance and, for example, to be able to identify disturbed death, because if we can identify disturbed earth, we can see where IEDs may be being laid.</p>

hon. Friend is on to something here: we need to consider more practical equipment. I will just give a warning, though. New kit such as that going into theatre requires defensive aid suites to be fitted and they do not come cheaply. We cannot just stick a Tucano or other turboprop aeroplane into theatre and say, &#147;That&#146;s it.&#148; Quite a lot of amendment work has to go on. Essentially, what my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000253">My hon. Friend mentioned helicopters. The Government have been caught napping on that issue. They cut the helicopter budget by &#163;1.4 billion in 2004 and the result has been disastrous. We simply do not have enough helicopters. We have bought six Merlin helicopters from the Danes, but I understand that the floor of the helicopter is completely unserviceable  for our use and will have to be subject to further adaptation. It is appalling that further action has not been taken to ensure that we have more helicopters. It is not as though this situation came on us suddenly, as a surprise; it has been obvious for a long time that we need more helicopters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000254">My hon. Friend the Member for Newark is right about the shortage of manpower. He said that the armed forces, particularly the Army, were in a parlous state. I will just add to his other points that there is too much reliance on overseas recruits because we cannot recruit from the United Kingdom and therein lies a damaging prospect for the British Army. Representing Aldershot, I know that people are resigning because they cannot take the constant tempo of operations. Even if they can, their families cannot. That factor needs to be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000255">Time is limited, Mr. Pope, and we will be able to resume the debate next week, but I wish to make five brief observations. First, we require a defence review. It is essential that we have one, and that is what my party will be putting before the people at the next election. Secondly, we need flexible equipment that is capable of subsequent adaptation, depending upon changes in circumstances. Kit must be designed with the prospect of needing to adapt it. Thirdly, the system of urgent operational requirements works extremely well, but it does not dovetail into the main procurement programme. We should migrate the excellent swift decision-making process that applies to UORs into the main procurement programme. I believe that that is absolutely essential, and I am working on it now. Fourthly, the Government should tell us what they are doing about UAVs, because there is a life-saving capability. Fifthly, where are we on FRES? A number of hon. Members mentioned it; perhaps the Minister can tell us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000256">Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton says that there will be no money at the time of the next election, when the Conservative party hopes to come to Government. I assure her that I am conscious of that fact. I am also conscious that a huge bow wave of commitments is building up in a wide range of areas. In particular, the British people are going to have to acknowledge our growing commitment to the war wounded. They are not yet visible to the health service; but they will become increasingly visible and will add hugely to the defence budget. That, I believe, is not fair; it should come out of another budget. However, that is for the shadow Chancellor to decide.</p>

 I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) and other Members in expressing my deepest sympathy for the families, comrades and friends of the three paratroopers who recently lost their lives in Helmand. Earlier this year, I saw for myself the dedication of those remarkable people and what they are achieving on behalf of the Afghan people. We need always to remind ourselves that those achievements come with great sacrifice&#151;and, for those three individuals, the greatest sacrifice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000258">The hon. Member for Congleton was right to highlight the fact that we have to live within the reality of finite resources. I am enormously pleased to see her toeing the party line and expressing the same view as her leader, who said that a Conservative Government would not increase defence spending. If only the Front Bench defence team would spit that out. Despite the fact that the leader has said it, and the Back Benchers recognise it as a fact&#151;as the reality&#151;the Front Bench continue to pretend that the situation is something else. However, I do not agree with the hon. Lady&#146;s conclusions. Effectively, she said that we ought to equip our armed forces to conduct counter-insurgency operations, neglecting to some degree all other types of conflict.</p>

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="08061078000259"><a name="80610h0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="08061078000503"><b>Ann Winterton:</b>

 That is the way that the hon. Lady came across. In my view, that would be dangerous; it would undermine the country&#146;s ability to meet the security challenges that we may face in a rapidly changing and unpredictable world. That is to misunderstand the nature of the current operations and the way in which conflicts are likely to evolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000261">Secretary Gates, who was quoted by the hon. Lady, said in a speech to the Heritage Foundation that defence procurement was a matter of balancing risk:</p>

That is what Secretary Gates called &#147;next war-itis&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000263">Our priority is and will be to ensure that our forces are properly equipped for current operations. However, a balanced force is a key national strategic asset that we would give up at our peril. We live in an uncertain world. We all remember the siren calls of the pundits who declared the end of history and were eager to push for the realisation of the peace dividend at the end of the cold war; those calls were hard to resist, but they were proved tragically premature. Since then, international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the challenges posed by failed and failing states have emerged as threats to our security. They will continue to remain a challenge. Emerging trends such as climate change, competition for resources, geopolitical change and the proliferation of weapons technology will increase the uncertainty. A balanced force, mixing a range of capabilities will stand us in the best stead to deal with the unpredictability of future security challenges.</p>

with no counter-insurgency element&#151;for instance, in the Falklands and the first Gulf war. No matter what people thought of the decision to invade Iraq, in Operation Telic, we could not have done so with Mastiff and Ridgeback vehicles. We could not have crossed the Al-Faw peninsula in that sort of vehicle. Yes, we could have gone up the road to Nazaria, but that was not the reality of the situation. We were recently faced with the need for an existing army and air force capability on behalf of the Iraqis; as recently as five years ago, we had to be able and equipped to face that threat as well as counter-insurgency.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. What he suggests is a parody of what I said. He is right to say that we have not been engaged in counter-insurgency for a number of years. We were very good at it at one time, but virtually every serving officer&#151;anyone now serving in the armed services&#151;has no direct experience of it. There is one exception: Jock Stirrup. I was saying that we do not have a balance when providing for our troops at present, and we have to over-egg the pudding to get over any kind of story. Not only do we not have balance, but we have forgotten some of the lessons that were hard-learned a long  time ago.</p>

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="08061078000268"><a name="80610h0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="08061078000508"><b>Mr. Ainsworth:</b>
 I know that the hon. Lady has given a lot of thought to the matter, but her basic argument was that there was a complete lack of balance; she said that we had 463 vehicles that were effectively useful in the circumstances and she wrote off 2,000. The hon. Lady chose to draw a line in order to make her case, but Jackal is on the other side of that line. That vehicle was purchased for Afghan counter-insurgency operations. We cannot put people only in heavy armoured vehicles; we also need light recce vehicles that are capable of getting around and that give vision and flexibility. The Jackal was produced with that in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000269">The hon. Lady assumed when drawing that line that FRES will not be configured for deflection of blast, but it will be. I do not know whether it will have a lower profile but the same manoeuvrability as Mastiff, but it will have many other capabilities that Mastiff does not have. I do not detract from Mastiff; it is armoured up in Coventry in my constituency. It is a fantastic vehicle that gives huge protection to our troops, but its use is extremely limited. The hon. Lady said that the Secretary of State visited Basra in a Mastiff. I was not allowed into Musa Kala because I would have to have done so in a Mastiff and it was not the right vehicle; but someone will have to go there if we want our troops to be effective in the Afghan theatre. Mastiff cannot be the only vehicle; as has been said, we have to provide a range of vehicles to meet the threat and to allow our troops to do the job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000270">The hon. Lady seemed to be complaining that we are using the equipment that we have in the theatres in which we are fighting. Yes, we are using the Tornado, but using it effectively. They fly in pairs, so they can stay over target for a long time.</p>

 I confess that I applied for this debate because I enjoy swimming. When I was a child, I learned to swim in the baths at Penarth, which are now a nightclub; my younger brother suddenly realised that he could swim when he fell out of his water wings and into the pool at the age of two; and I won the scout diving cup in Stirling in 1974, I believe. It is therefore a delight to be able to raise this issue, even if the Government pre-empted me, after I had obtained the debate, by announcing further support for swimming last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000272">I shall come to some of the specific issues that the Government announcement has made us think about, but I should first say that I started putting my speech together in the pool in Bronwydd in the Rhondda&#151;more or less in the pool, at any rate. Swimming beside me, interestingly, was the Wales triathlon champion, who is the grandson of my predecessor as MP for Rhonda and a fine member of the Labour party. I hope that he wins his races this summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08061078000273">Britain has a fine tradition in swimming. It is one sport that we have done particularly well at in Olympic games&#151;we have won 15 gold, 23 silver and 28 bronze medals, and we won the gold in water polo in 1900, 1908, 1912 and 1920, but not since. I am sure that many British people were proud of the haul of swimming medals not only from Australia but from Athens, and that they look forward to Liam Hancock, David Davies and Kirsty Balfour, among others, doing well in the summer. I am sure that the media will be more fascinated by how Tom Daley, the teenage diver, does in his first Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000274">One of the great things about swimming is that it is not only about the elite. It is the only sport that is enjoyed equally by girls and boys and by people at different stages of life, which makes it inclusive. It is a joy to see whole families go swimming&#151;they cannot take part in other sports together in the same way. The health implications are significant, because even a person who has sprained an ankle, or who has back pain or arthritis, can go swimming. Even people with severe mobility problems can go swimming. It is a low-impact sport and&#151;unless one is playing water polo&#151;non-contact. Bringing the whole community together is one of the great aspects of swimming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000275">The downside is that swimming is one of the most expensive sports&#151;not for the individual, but for the state. Whereas 50 years ago, swimming baths were mostly open air and relatively cheap to run, they are now almost universally indoor and expensive to run. The people at the baths at Ystrad in my constituency recently discovered that several million pounds would have to be spent simply to restore the base of the pool&#151;they realised that the pool had concrete cancer and that one could easily punch a hole in the cement. Perhaps no one will notice the significant difference that the investment made, but it goes to show that swimming is an expensive sport for local authorities and Government to make available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000276">I am delighted by the commitment that the Government made last week to try to make swimming free for over-60s and younger people. We have tried the same  <br>

thing in Wales in the past two years following a commitment from the Welsh Assembly, and it is important that the Government spot some of the problems that we have had there. For instance, it is all very well saying that swimming is free for over-60s, but if the same people simply swim more frequently for free, we will not increase the number of people who swim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000277">There are all sorts of barriers to people going swimming. First, obviously, a lot of people cannot swim. The Government have for a long time had a commitment to ensuring that every child going through school learns to swim so that they can swim by the time they leave, but the number of people in poorer communities in England and Wales who cannot swim is still high&#151;some 25 per cent. cannot do so. The number of people who cannot swim is markedly higher in poorer areas. I am sure that there are all sorts of reasons for that, but it brings me to one of the most important barriers: money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08061078000278">Middle-class and wealthier families can afford tuition fees for their youngster to learn to swim, which amount to about &#163;5 an hour in most areas of the country, but many poorer families cannot, especially if there are two or three children, so many youngsters do not get the opportunity to learn to swim. Also, some people in their 30s and 40s stop playing football or rugby because of injury and look to take up another sport, but they cannot take up swimming because they cannot swim&#151;they feel embarrassed about it and never go near a swimming pool. It is important to ensure that swimming lessons are more affordable, particularly for children from poorer areas, and that schools are more effective at ensuring that children learn to swim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para23"><a name="08061078000279">A greater barrier to many people taking part in swimming, particularly women, is that they find the whole environment of the pool unfriendly, embarrassing and lacking in privacy. If changing rooms are dirty and not frequently cleaned, people worry about hygiene and getting infections. Other countries have learned about those things rather faster than us. Many people go on holiday and stay in hotels with beautiful, well looked-after swimming pools with private changing rooms, so when they get back to their local baths and find that there are no such rooms, nowhere for families to change together and that the showers are either scalding hot or freezing cold, they think, &#147;Maybe this isn&#146;t for us.&#148; Other countries have invested as much in changing rooms and other facilities in swimming pools as in the pool itself, which we need to do. Some local authorities have transformed the swimming experience, especially for families, but we need to ensure that that best practice is followed throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80610h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08061078000280">Some local authorities work jointly with the private sector to ensure that new baths, nearly all of which are in private sector facilities such as hotels and leisure centres, are available to the wider public. That way, there is an investment in the whole community. We need to do far more of that kind of thing. There are between 1,400 and 1,600 public swimming pools in England, and about 6,000 private pools of one kind or another. If we could make the latter available, we could make a significant difference in enabling more people to take up an active, healthy lifestyle through swimming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para0"><a name="08061078000281">There is a further difficulty. Local authorities have a mix of leisure facilities&#151;they may have football and rugby fields and so on, and changes in society may mean that local sports clubs change from football to  <br>

rugby or the other way around&#151;and are constantly working to get the right mix. All too often, decisions on older swimming baths, which might need dramatic amounts of financial investment, are delayed year after year until it is too late to save them. That is why, even in central London, quite a few historic baths have closed. That is a shame, not particularly because the buildings were of enormous historical merit, but because some of those baths were in exactly the right place&#151;in the centre of cities, where they were convenient for people to use at lunch time and other times of the day, and in the evening. We need to do more to ensure that local authorities have an ongoing, rolling programme of investment in their swimming pools so that they do not suddenly realise that they have a dramatic problem and must find &#163;5 million or &#163;10 million, with the result that they decide that they cannot afford to keep their pools open.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000282">Large numbers of people go swimming, but the truth is that we could not survive without the volunteers who run the swim clubs. There are 300 volunteers involved in swim clubs in Wales, and they ensure that people can do not only the jumping-in-the-pool, messing-around kind of swimming, but the hard, up-and-down lane swimming&#151;1,000 m of breaststroke, freestyle and so on. However, swim clubs are finding it increasingly difficult to survive not only because of the charges that local authorities levy on them for holding sessions, but because it is more and more difficult to get volunteers to commit themselves&#151;particularly to getting the training that they need to act as coaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000283">In that respect, I wholeheartedly support the introduction of the United Kingdom coaching certificate, which is an excellent measure that is increasingly professionalising the coaching that we provide in swim clubs. However, it is expensive to do the courses. A level 1 course, which takes 37 hours, costs &#163;370 per individual, while a level 2 course costs &#163;650 and requires 50 hours of commitment. That requires a significant investment from the individual, and I wonder whether there is a way of ensuring that Government resources can flow more readily down to the swim clubs so that more people can train as coaches, particularly in some of the poorer areas of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000284">As has been well attested in the Culture, Media and Sport Committee report on swimming in 2001-02 and in many debates in the House, one problem for elite swimmers in this country is that we have remarkably few 50 m pools&#151;we have 19 in England and one in Wales, which is fewer than in Berlin or Paris. That is a problem not because everybody wants to swim 50 m all the time, but because we have only two venues where we can have an international-standard event. To hold such events, one must have not only a 50 m pool for swimming but a warm-up 50 m pool, and the pools must be 10 lanes wide, with a variety of adequate facilities on site. There is also the difficulty of training elite swimmers. It is difficult for Team GB to find somewhere for the whole team to swim continually for a fortnight or three weeks without completely disrupting everybody else&#146;s ordinary swimming. That is why the Government need to think further about developing more 50 m pools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08061078000285">The new 50 m pool in Wales is wonderful, and creative ways have been found to use it so that a variety of events can be held there&#151;it is not used just for elite swimming or by people ploughing up and down the lanes. Everybody is proud of the new pool, but it would  <br>

be nice if we had more like it. Obviously, we will have the new aquatic centre for the Olympics, but it is important that the whole of London and, indeed, the whole south-east feel that it has a stake in it after the Olympics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000286">The next issue that I want to raise is one that affects volunteers and those involved in swimming. Fifty years ago, everybody would have been happy to take photographs of all the kids taking part in the annual swimming gala or the school swimming gala, but the sad truth is that most local authorities now understandably have strict rules about what photographs can be taken, and everybody has to have signed a form giving permission for their child&#146;s photograph to be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000287">Similarly, it is obviously important that swimming coaches and everybody involved in teaching young people to swim have proper accreditation, so that parents can be secure in the knowledge that their child is safe in every sense. With the passage of the Criminal Records Bureau to the Independent Safeguarding Authority, it is important that the cost of checks, which may be quite significant for small swimming clubs, be met by the Government, not the clubs themselves. Checks should also be done swiftly. Furthermore, it should be possible to transfer a check that was made when somebody wanted to become a rugby, cricket or golf coach, should they then wish to become a swimming coach. One difficulty is that we are overloading the system by not allowing people to transfer checks from one sport to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000288">There is another issue alongside that. When we move to the new points-based system of immigration, which I wholeheartedly support, it is important that we ensure that coaches&#151;particularly in international sports such as swimming, which rely on coaches travelling around the world and working in different countries&#151;can enter this country without facing an overly complicated process of immigration checks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000289">I wholeheartedly support what the Government are doing to ensure that more people swim. Swimming is one of the few sports in which everybody can engage, whatever their age or physical ability. My only concern is that if we simply make swimming free for those who already swim, we will have achieved nothing through our investment in swimming. We need to overcome some of the barriers to people taking up swimming. In particular, we need ensure that there are more coaches and volunteers and that it is easier for local swimming clubs to survive and prosper. We need to ensure that there are more swimming pools and that private pools are more available to the whole of society, while public pools are more engaging and pleasant places to go for a swim. If we can do that, the number of people who go swimming will significantly increase.</p>

 I wholeheartedly support my hon. Friend&#151;I do mean my hon. Friend&#151;the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) and I congratulate him on the timing of his debate. He talked about the announcements last Friday, but he has been keen on this issue for a long time, and he mentioned his exploits as a young child, on which I congratulate him.</p>

whether they are taking part in the Olympic games in Beijing or training and developing for the London Olympics in 2012. I particularly offer my support to Tom Daley, who has inspired many people not only with his diving exploits, but with his demeanour and the way in which he acts as a role model for many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08061078000293">My hon. Friend rightly set out a number of issues, which we are aware of, to ensure that we are successful in our ambition of getting more people swimming. It is important that we get more people active in sport. My hon. Friend will be aware of the legacy challenge that we set ourselves of getting 2 million more people engaged in physical activity and sport by 2012, and swimming can play a key role in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000294">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s points about swimming provision, the quality of pools and the need to make sporting experiences, whatever they are, credible and something that people want to pursue. If the sports superstructure is not up to standard, young people in particular will do other things, so we must ensure that the sporting experience that we present is enjoyable. My hon. Friend is particularly right about matters such as changing rooms and how confident people feel in the environment of the swimming pool. Those points are important and I hope that they will be dealt with when we consider the facility strategies that local authorities need for new and existing pools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000295">My hon. Friend&#146;s timing is, as always, impeccable, given last week&#146;s announcement by the Secretary of State. That really was joined-up government, with several Departments coming together regarding the aspiration for free swimming for the over-60s and making under-16s a priority by 2012. My hon. Friend is right to say that that has been happening in Wales for some time&#151;I know that Rhodri Morgan and the Sports Minister in Wales are particularly pleased by the development&#151;and that we must keep the initiative alive by encouraging more people to take part, not just the same ones who are now doing so. I hope that, with the support of the Amateur Swimming Association and British Swimming, it will be possible to offer good experiences of swimming, whether for people who want to enjoy the fun pool or for serious swimmers who want to get involved in competitive swimming. We want to ensure that there is a route all the way through, so that swimming is enjoyable and there is an opportunity for people to get involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000296">The active people survey in 2005-06 showed that swimming was perhaps the nation&#146;s most popular physical activity, with 17 per cent. of women and 12 per cent. of men swimming at least once a month. Swimming is the sport with the second highest rate of participation, after football, for children aged 11 to 16, with 38 per cent. participating in and out of school. It is also the most popular physical activity for the over-60s, with 7 per cent. taking part at least once a month. The Government are committed to good quality swimming and diving provision throughout the country. Since 1997 almost &#163;250 million of public money has been invested in swimming&#151;more than for any other sport. More swimming pools are opening than are closing, in both local authority and private sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000297">It is too simplistic, however, to look at sporting provision simply in terms of quantity. My hon. Friend touched on a very important point about where pools are, and whether those are public or private. I am engaged with several bodies in considering the spare capacity that private sector pools might have to offer swimming to others, at times when the private sector cannot fill the pools. I believe that we should, particularly through county sports partnerships, local area agreements and local authority facility strategies, come to a greater understanding of how we can bring public and private sectors together, and of the opportunities that exist in that context. What we envisage will not work unless there is a willingness to use the available facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000298">As part of the incentive, I am trying to ensure that we drive through a strategy to achieve world-class swimming facilities throughout the country. Local government has a key role to play in that. The offer of free swimming that we announced last week is, as I have explained, part of getting 2 million more people active by 2012. Swimming will make an important contribution to the meeting of our goals. In broad terms, we shall offer local authorities funding to allow them to introduce free swimming for people aged over 60 and further measures designed to promote increased participation in swimming, particularly for under-16s. We are also offering a capital fund for the renovation and maintenance of pools, including school pools, in support of such schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08061078000299">I had a constituency issue regarding the closure of a pool in my constituency&#151;the Buttershaw school pool. There is an opportunity now for Conservative-led Bradford council to put its money where its mouth is and support what we are trying to achieve through allowing greater access to swimming by making sure that the pool stays open. I should be happy at any time to meet the local authority to discuss future funding to do that. As my hon. Friend has said, swimming is an emotive issue. People want pools to be protected, and in some cases there is an opportunity for local authorities to shut a dilapidated pool in the hope of replacing it. In Bradford, pools have closed but have not been reopened elsewhere. I hope that that can be put right. My hon. Friend made the same point about pools in Wales. We must protect existing pools, and through the offer of the capital fund it may be possible to assist some local authorities in Wales and elsewhere to maintain pools that need attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000300">It is important to consider the issue of elite sport and to take the opportunity to make sure that we have the right pools. Particularly relevant are the 50 m pools that my hon. Friend described. There are 18 indoor 50 m swimming pools in England, and a further nine, such as at Portsmouth and Hillingdon, are either under construction or proposed. Therefore, every region in England will have at least one 50 m swimming pool. We are told by Sport England that that will meet the demand that exists for quality and the right location.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000301">School swimming is vital, and my hon. Friend is right to raise the issue of lessons and their cost. We want to include that in our discussions about how we fulfil the aspiration of free swimming, particularly in relation to hard-to-reach groups: people on low incomes who cannot afford to learn to swim, and people who do not think that swimming is for them. We want to open the access and opportunities as much as we can. My hon. Friend has pointed out that swimming is universal&#151;it is an  <br>

activity that people can do together. Whole families at different levels of ability can go together and enjoy being in the pool.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000302">We believe that the situation in Wales is a good example of how things can be done. To develop things further throughout the country, we need to learn some lessons from what happened in Wales. My hon. Friend is right to say that broadly, everyone is happy with the proposals and the development of the free swimming agenda in Wales. It is encouraging for me to see how leading local authorities such as Wigan, which now offers opportunities for free swimming, have learned lessons from what has been done elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000303">All hon. Members of all political persuasions will welcome the announcements that we made on Friday, on the basis that we have an opportunity to consider the health and well-being of the nation and the need to get people physically active. The Foresight report revealed problems in relation to obesity and the horrendous challenges that we shall face if people do not become more active in future years. We all know the burden and the cost that there will be to society and Government because of the effect on health. Swimming gives people the opportunity to experience the delight and health benefits of being active and an increased heart rate, thereby becoming fitter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08061078000304">Swimming is a key element of the sporting activity that we can enjoy. We need to be successful in what we propose and to make sure that we achieve our aspiration by 2012. The swimming authorities&#151;particularly the ASA&#151;have given detailed attention to the matter. My hon. Friend will be aware of the recent cycling championships and the 10 out of 17 available gold medals that were won; cycling is a sport that has been looked at right from the start. The same has happened with swimming at every level; there has been consideration of what is needed to improve participation levels at recreational sites, and of how to develop the sport all the way through. I was pleased a few weeks ago to be at the 50 m pool in Manchester to see swimmers&#151;UK swimmers in particular&#151;succeeding at the Paralympic World cup. It was inspiring to see them deliver championship performances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08061078000305">Swimming, like most sports, connects people and is an inspiration to them. It can develop self-esteem and encourage teamwork. The timing of today&#146;s debate is appropriate. I hope that my hon. Friend will continue to support our ambition of making sure that swimming is delivered according to the widest possible remit. I congratulate him on securing the debate.</p>

<h3 align="center">NHS Co-payments (Mrs. O&#146;Boyle)</h3>
<a name="time_14"><a name="80610h0008.htm_time1"><a name="08061078000441"><h5 align="left">12.59 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_67"><a name="08061078000306"><a name="80610h0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="08061078000511"><b>Mr. John Baron (Billericay) (Con):</b>
 I am grateful for this opportunity to raise the case of my late constituent, Linda O&#146;Boyle, who died earlier this year, sadly, after treatment for bowel cancer. Her case is both terribly sad and hugely frustrating. She was a warm-hearted woman with a great sense of humour who gave much of her life to the national health service and helping others. When she became ill, she had every right to expect that the NHS would be there for her, but it was not. The health service let her down in her hour of need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08061078000307">Many patients have suffered because the NHS does not allow co-payments, which involve a patient paying privately for a drug not funded by the NHS while continuing to receive the basic NHS package of care. If patients want to top up their care, Government policy requires that free NHS treatment be withdrawn. Often, treatment is eventually delivered within the NHS setting, but the patient is presented with the bill for all aspects of care. Sometimes, as in the O&#146;Boyle case, the patient is forced to go private for everything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08061078000308">The facts of the case are straightforward. Linda was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and at first her treatment at Basildon and Southend hospitals went well. However, it was decided that she needed a second line of treatment with irinotecan earlier than planned. Then her consultant had to inform the family that treatment was not working, which came as a great shock. The desire to save or extend the life of a loved one is immensely strong. The family were desperate to find another treatment, and the consultant suggested that only cetuximab offered a realistic hope of extending Linda&#146;s life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para26"><a name="08061078000309">However, as we know, cetuximab is not available on the NHS, as it was turned down by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on the grounds of cost-effectiveness. Whatever one&#146;s views about NICE and the fairness of some of its decisions, the relevant fact is simply that state-funded health care was unable to provide Mrs. O&#146;Boyle with the treatment that her clinician said she needed.</p>

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="08061078000310"><a name="80610h0008.htm_spnew1"><a name="08061078000512"><b>Mr. Frank Field (Birkenhead) (Lab):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman talks about &#147;free&#148; and &#147;state-funded&#148; NHS care. I remind him of his Thatcherite roots. We taxpayers, including Linda, pay for our care.</p>

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="08061078000311"><a name="80610h0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="08061078000513"><b>Mr. Baron:</b>
 I accept that point 100 per cent. Mrs. O&#146;Boyle had paid for her care through her taxes, of course, which is why her care should have been free, to use my terminology. She should not have had to pay for it. That is the cause of the problem.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="08061078000312"><a name="80610h0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="08061078000514"><b>Mr. Field:</b>
 If one accepts that we pay for our NHS care at a different time than we draw the benefit, the false dichotomy that the Government have erected falls to the ground. One wishes to top up the payments that one has already made. Given that the Government want to encourage public-private sector arrangements, I find it extraordinary that they do not want public-individual citizen projects such as the one Linda wished to do.</p>

many other areas of the NHS, patients can top up without having their care withdrawn. That is a contradiction that the Government need to resolve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para27"><a name="08061078000314">The family decided to pay privately for the drug. Mrs. O&#146;Boyle had hoped to receive cetuximab at the family&#146;s expense at Southend hospital while continuing to receive care as a cancer patient. It is worth emphasising that the family were exceptionally happy at that stage with the care that they had received within the NHS. The issue is not about doctors, nurses or consultants, for they did an excellent job of caring for Linda as far as they were allowed; it is about Government policy, which prevents them from doing their job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para28"><a name="08061078000315">One might have expected the NHS to do everything possible to help Linda O&#146;Boyle&#151;after all, its purpose is to extend life&#151;but the family were told that that would not be the case. The family ended up paying for all the necessary treatment, including care that ought to have been available on the NHS. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the NHS effectively walked away from a dying woman in her moment of need, a woman who had given most of her life to the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para29"><a name="08061078000316">Naturally, the cost to the family was huge. They also had to meet the cost of private consultations, prescription charges and home nursing care and pay the full market price for irinotecan and cetuximab. Taking everything into account, the total cost was around &#163;14,000. It would have been &#163;50,000 if Linda had survived the full six months of treatment. Seeking to extend the life of loved ones is not an aspiration unique to the rich. People are prepared to make great sacrifices to hold on to someone they love.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para30"><a name="08061078000317">With the family&#146;s consent, I raised the issue with some newspapers, and it has received very good coverage during the past few weeks. Such publicity is never easy for the relatives involved, but Mr. O&#146;Boyle and his sons took the decision to go public because they feel strongly that what happened to Linda was wrong and must not happen to other people. I commend them for that attitude. Mr. O&#146;Boyle and one of his sons have joined us for this debate. Many other patients all over the country find themselves in similar situations. <i>The Sunday Times</i>, among others, has done splendid work to give them a voice. The best-known example is probably the breast cancer patient Colette Mills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="80610h0008.htm_para31"><a name="08061078000318">As for the arguments used by the Government to prevent patients from making co-payments, I have the benefit of anticipating some of the Minister&#146;s remarks, as I wrote to the Secretary of State earlier in the year about the issue. The reply that I received was, in my view, confused and inhumane. Let us be clear: co-payments are not about taking care from any other patient in order to help another patient go private. A drug is paid for privately, not subsidised by the state. The arrangement represents a move to a Pareto optimum. One patient benefits without any other patient being harmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para0"><a name="08061078000319">The Government say that co-payments must be banned because otherwise we would be treating patients unfairly and creating a two-tier system, in which all patients would not be treated equally. That argument misses the point. Simply because a patient opts for some non-NHS treatments does not mean that the NHS cannot treat all patients equally in respect of the state-funded care that they receive. Each patient can still receive the same level  <br>

of NHS care. Patients seeking co-payments are not asking for special favours, preferential treatment or a hand up from the NHS; they are simply asking for their standard package of care to be continued alongside the top-up. Patients whose NHS care has been withdrawn feel, understandably, that they are the ones being discriminated against because of their ability to pay. That cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000320">There is a world of difference between treating all patients equally and penalising some patients because they have the means to top up their treatment. It makes a mockery of the Government&#146;s second argument for banning co-payments, which is that a ban is somehow needed to keep the NHS free at the point of need. However, in the case of Colette Mills or Linda O&#146;Boyle, the NHS is the very opposite of free at the point of need. Not all drugs are available on the NHS, because NICE turns down some treatments. Also, free NHS care is withdrawn when patients try to top up. That is not care free at the point of need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000321">The Government have a novel way of trying to get around the problem: they hide behind semantics. The Government argue that NHS guidance states clearly that someone cannot simultaneously be an NHS and a privately funded patient of the same NHS hospital within the same episode of care and that all NHS treatment for the same condition, such as bowel cancer, counts towards the same episode of care. Ostensibly, it is because the Government do not want to mix private and public funding, but that argument is clearly absurd. For one thing, some drugs are available free on the NHS and others are not. How can two treatments be part of the same episode of care if one is free and the other is not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000322">If the health service itself has chosen to differentiate between treatments through the NICE process, it is hypocritical to condemn patients for seeking to do likewise. Michael Summers of the Patients Association made that point in a similar way. He suggested that the public does not see the same episode of care as being a crucial distinction. At the end of the day, the public will just say that care is care. The Government are hiding behind the semantics of how one defines an episode of care, because they lack the courage, or perhaps even the initiative, to deal with unjust policy. All that is required is an open mind, and then guidance can be changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08061078000323">Another reason why the Government&#146;s position is perverse is that co-payments are already happening throughout the NHS and other public services. If I go to an optician as an NHS patient, and receive a free pair of glasses, nothing is to prevent me from using my own money to buy contact lenses&#151;NHS care is not withdrawn. Likewise, if I go to a dentist and have an NHS filling, and then pay privately to have teeth cleaning or whitening, NHS care is not withdrawn. Meanwhile, we have private beds in NHS hospitals, using NHS equipment and staff. Again, patients do not have other aspects of care withdrawn. We could look outside the NHS: state education is not withdrawn simply because a child has access to private tuition. The state education system is there for everyone, regardless of whether private tuition takes place&#151;state education is not withdrawn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000324">What is so different about cancer drugs and treatment? If co-payments are good enough for teeth whitening and contact lenses, why are they not good enough when it comes to prolonging, extending and perhaps even  <br>

saving life? Many people are asking those questions outside this Chamber, but no one seems to have an answer&#151;certainly not the Government. Britain&#146;s cancer survival rates still lag behind the European average, partly because we do not have the same access to the best new drugs. In that respect, we are the poor patients of Europe, which is shameful given that Britain is home to some of the leading drug companies in the world, and to some of the leading cancer research institutes in Europe. The NHS needs all the help that it can get. If anything, we should be empowering, not penalising, patients who opt for co-payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000325">This issue will not go away. Many exciting new drugs are coming through the pipeline, and it is forecast that they will be available over the coming decade. Patients and their clinicians will, understandably, want to use them, but NICE will not be in a position to give the thumbs up to all of them. The NHS has a hard choice to make: does it stick with the current policy, born of ideological dogma? Does it hold back patients from accessing the best care for themselves and their families? Does it walk away from dying men and women whose only offence is to use their own money to extend their lives? Or do we, as a nation, do what we can to empower as many people as possible to access the best of the new treatments, without holding back, or penalising, those who cannot afford top-ups? The only civilised answer, for any nation facing this dilemma, is to save, or prolong, life wherever possible. Anything else is a far greater betrayal of the founding principles of the NHS and medicine. This inhumane and illogical policy will one day change. The question is: how long will it take the Government to recognise that, and how many patients will pay the price between now and then?</p>

privately funded to NHS-funded status, and should then receive treatment on the same basis as any other NHS patient, and be offered treatment based on clinical need. Any previous status as a privately funded patient should, as far as is practical, neither disadvantage them nor allow them to access NHS care in a preferential way.</p>

However, any publicly funded health care system will always have to make difficult decisions about what treatments are available, and some treatments are not generally available on the NHS. We set up NICE, which is now regarded as a world leader, to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of drugs and treatments based on the latest evidence. Primary care trusts have a statutory duty to fund the use of drugs that are recommended by NICE technology appraisals, ensuring that proven treatments are available to everybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000331">The inevitable consequence of the NICE process, however, is that some PCTS will decide not to fund some treatments. For example, a treatment might not have received a safety licence from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or NICE might find that it does not give patients enough clinical benefit to justify the expense. Those decisions are never taken lightly, and NICE will always find itself in difficulty when making decisions seen to deny people drugs that they genuinely believe will make a difference to the length or quality of their lives. There is never a controversy when NICE approves drugs, but it will inevitably follow some of the incredibly difficult decisions that it must make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000332">There has been tremendous political consensus about the virtues of having a NICE-type system to make some of those very difficult decisions: it is removed from party-politics and creates an entirely independent process governed by legislation established in this House. It is important to be clear that it would be inappropriate for Ministers to intervene in and undermine every difficult decision that NICE makes.</p>

 I accept what the Minister says to a certain extent, but in this context NICE is a bit of a red herring. The point here is about co-payments and access to drugs not available on NICE&#151;not about how it makes its decision. Patients should not be penalised by an NHS that then withdraws care simply because they have access to those drugs.</p>

 I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but for many patients and families, the difficult decisions that NICE makes are sometimes a great source of angst.

It is important to contextualise the debate in that sense.</p>

patient cannot be both a private and an NHS patient for the treatment of one condition during a single visit to an NHS organisation, but an in-patient can choose to change their status before the treatment begins provided that they are then assessed to determine their priority for NHS care. I reiterate that that has been the position in this country for at least two decades and is not a consequence of any particular NHS reform by the Labour Government. The position is more difficult when a patient seeks to pay for part of an episode of care while expecting the NHS to pay for the rest. That has never been allowed in the 60 years of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000336">The legal basis for the ban on mixing private and public funding is in section 1 of the National Health Service Act 2006, which says that NHS services</p>

It also prevents an NHS body from providing an incomplete package of care that patients then top up. For example, if a patient&#146;s treatment is the administration of a particular drug, their treatment includes both the purchase and administration of that drug. If an NHS organisation allows a patient to pay for a drug but administers it on the NHS, it is effectively charging for an NHS service.</p>

co-payments takes the form of guidance rather than instruction, which means that NHS trusts across the country are using their discretion when such cases arise. If the Minister truly believes his argument against co-payments, why does he not close that loophole? He says that this matter has been discussed for quite some time.</p>

 We are not being party political, so we can be generous in giving way. Perhaps I did not express myself clearly, but the Minister did not address my central point. The Department&#146;s policy on co-payments&#151;the ban on them&#151;is in the form of guidance, not instruction. That allows PCTs up and down the country to use their discretion when implementing co-payments or not doing so. If the Minister is absolutely convinced by the case against co-payments, why does not he simply ban them and close that loophole? The Government are allowing the loophole to exist.</p>

 We will have to consider that point as a consequence of this debate. No one is suggesting that we can ignore the sensitive and difficult considerations that the issue of top-ups raises, such as whether NHS guidance is being applied consistently across the country. We have a constant debate in the NHS about the balance between having a universal, national service and having local flexibility, discretion and autonomy. To some extent, the aspiration of all Governments is to minimise postcode lotteries where possible. We know that decisions taken at the local level can, from time to time, be very different depending on the judgments of managers and clinicians, and this matter is no different to that. However, we are willing to consider the implications of the debate in the context of an ever-moving landscape of treatments and drugs that are becoming available.</p>

 I am pleased to have secured the debate and privileged to take part in it under your chairmanship, Mr. Pope. I must declare an interest at the outset: my wife is a locum pharmacist. Obviously, the words that I shall deliver will be mine, but I am bound to be influenced by our conversations at home. It is because of them that I have taken a long-term interest in medicines management in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000353">Unused medicines are costly. It is estimated that they cost the taxpayer as much as &#163;800 million a year in the UK, as the Department of Health estimates that as much as 10 per cent. of all drugs prescribed are wasted. The value of medicines returned to pharmacies and general practice surgeries is thought to be some &#163;100 million annually. Wasted medication is costing the NHS in the north-west, for example&#151;you will understand this yourself, Mr. Pope&#151;some &#163;40 million annually, and &#163;2.5 million in Wirral alone. That could pay, for example, for 500 more hip replacements, 350 more heart bypass operations or 3,500 more cataract operations. I am not saying that they are directly related, but that is a lot of money that could be used for beneficial health treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000354">In addition to those vast sums, the National Audit Office has estimated that primary care trusts could save more than &#163;200 million, without affecting clinical outcomes, through more efficient prescribing. There is thus a business of waste that costs something of the order of &#163;1 billion. There are two issues at hand: the prevention of medicines wastage and the encouragement of more efficient prescribing. I have limited time at my disposal, but I shall suggest some ways in which we might conserve time, money and staff resources. I wish first to explore how we can prevent the wasting of medicines, starting with the patient&#146;s role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000355">Patient concordance, as it is known&#151;the extent to which patients comply in taking the medicines prescribed to them&#151;is a key issue, and more research needs to be conducted. Those who prescribe and administer medicines need to ask more questions about the deficit in patient concordance. The recently published White Paper, &#147;Pharmacy in England: building on strengths&#151;delivering the future&#148; acknowledges that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80610h0009.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000356">An analysis of unused medicines returned to one PCT alone showed that half the packs were returned unopened. There are a few key reasons for that. Often, patients prefer their GP not to know that they are not taking their medicine, so they go on ordering it. There are those who think that they simply know best. They believe, broadly speaking, that drugs are harmful to them and they therefore do not take the medicine prescribed. Patients can also be fussy, often wanting a more expensive brand rather than a generic version of a drug. They do not like foreign or parallel imported medicine, or the less well known brands. Newly qualified doctors and dentists, perhaps out of caution, prefer to prescribe brand rather than generic medication. The costs associated with over-prescribing are therefore exacerbated by expensive prescribing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para0"><a name="08061078000357">There are large variations between PCTs in the extent to which GPs prescribe lower-cost drugs for the same conditions. Statins are one example. In the second quarter of 2006-07, the proportion of statin prescriptions that were lower-cost versions varied from 28 to 86 per cent.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Jun 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>10 Jun 2008 : Column 59WH</b><br>
among PCTs in England. Analysis of the prescription of four common types of medicines, which represent 19 per cent. of the drugs bill, showed that more than &#163;200 million could be saved if all PCTs prescribed as efficiently as the top performing 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para1"><a name="08061078000358">In patients&#146; minds, there remains an incorrect assumption that drugs can be reused if returned. For example, 14 per cent. of patients believe that medication given back to a pharmacist or pharmacy can be redispensed to others who come in with a prescription for the same thing at a later date. Some 26 per cent. believe that unwanted medicines are sent to poorer, underdeveloped countries and can be used by patients who live there, and 14 per cent. of patients appear to believe that the NHS can get its money back when it returns drugs to their original producer. They think that the pharmacist can just send them back to the people who produced them. Those assumptions clearly need to be corrected if we are to reduce the amount of wasted drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08061078000359">On a separate note, the environmental message does not appear to be well understood, either. Some 21 per cent. of patients dispose of waste medication in the dustbin together with their domestic rubbish, and 10 per cent. flush it down the toilet, with obvious environmental effects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08061078000360">Repeat prescriptions can be administered through automatic reordering. That obviously has its advantages, but it also has its disadvantages. The fact that two different medications prescribed to a patient can have different cycles&#151;for example, one lasting two weeks and the other eight&#151;is not necessarily taken into account on the repeat prescription form. Therefore, each time a patient uses the form to get their next supply of medication, a backlog of unused medicines is collected. Equally, when repeat dispensing takes place, the process perhaps needs to be monitored more for errors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08061078000361">The negative outcomes of unmonitored repeat prescribing and dispensing include stockpiling and patients taking medication that is no longer required. Should there not be a clear requirement that the patient or carer should request items individually every month? That is a matter for consideration. It is also important to note that our current system allows pharmacists to be paid one fee for each item on a repeat prescription. Perhaps that, too, needs to be considered and its cost-efficiency examined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08061078000362">On another note, the self-administration of medicines by patients, which allows them custody and administration of their own medicines while they are in hospital, has been proved to improve patient compliance with medication regimes and so prevent treatment failure. In 2001, it was estimated that a quarter of hospital admissions were due to non-compliance with medicines regimes. Self-administration might therefore be encouraged whenever possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08061078000363">I wish briefly to mention the impact of medicines packaging on drug usage. Packages are often too large. Therefore, a patient might take only half the medication in any given packet. EU legislation on original pack dispensing stipulates that all relevant documentation should be included in a medicine&#146;s packaging. So, for example, blister packs of pills cannot be halved, as they would not necessarily be accompanied by the drug information found in the original packet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08061078000364">There is no standardisation of pack sizes. Multi-packs regularly contain 30 pills for what might be a 28-day month. In itself, that is not a large difference, but multiplied across the board it means a fantastic number of wasted drugs. Other solutions such as smaller packets of drugs need to be found, to decrease medicine wastage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08061078000365">I shall explore briefly how more efficient prescribing might be achieved. GPs&#146; surgeries and hospitals can play their part, and GPs may need to communicate more effectively with their patients to ascertain whether they are taking their prescribed medication, so that it can quickly be stopped if that is no longer the case. Some patients decide to do as they think fit and not take drugs that they allege are harming them. Some surgeries give repeat prescriptions for two or three months as standard, which can result in huge wastage. Recent studies suggest that the supply of trial quantities of new medications to patients before the prescription of large amounts can help to reduce wastage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08061078000366">An NAO report on medicines management in NHS hospitals raised concerns that some medical schools&#146; curricula do not provide thorough enough instruction in medicine administration. About 70 per cent. of prescribing decisions are made by house officers and senior house officers, even though at that stage of their career they may have had little experience of medicines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08061078000367">Only a small percentage of doctors in training report that their induction dealt adequately with medicines management issues. In addition, not all consultants are aware of the 30-day prescription limit on drugs, such as those for treatment of attention deficit. That suggests that much could be done to make those who prescribe medicines in hospitals more aware of up-to-date prescribing practice, which would encourage more efficient prescribing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para11"><a name="08061078000368">We must also look at the practice whereby prescriptions are passed directly from the GP to a pharmacy, whether it is one attached to the GP&#146;s surgery or another local pharmacy, on the basis of a phone call from the patient. There might have been little checking about whether the patient needed the ongoing prescription. There is also evidence that pharmacists are five times more accurate than doctors in writing discharge prescriptions. Where it is properly planned and supported, investment in clinical pharmacy improves the quality of patient care and reduces costs; I am sure that my wife will take note of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08061078000369">Pharmacies also inevitably play a role in this issue, especially in the form of medicines use reviews, which qualified pharmacists often conduct on behalf of individual patients. MURs, as they are known, are designed to help to reduce prescribing costs and wastage. However, MURs come at a significant cost, at around &#163;27 each. They involve a patient having a one-to-one consultation with their local pharmacist about the medicines that they are taking, and in doing so they attempt to ensure that unnecessary wastage of medicines is prevented. Of course, I approve of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08061078000370">Furthermore, according to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, local evaluations of patient satisfaction with the service show that patient satisfaction is high. However, it has not been definitively proven that the benefits of that service outweigh the cost. In 2006-07, for example, accredited pharmacies in the Wirral PCT area alone were paid more than &#163;100,000 for providing   <br>

about 4,000 MURs. There have been instances where individual pharmacies have exceeded their maximum of 400 claim payments a year for MURs. In 2006-07, the excess payment was &#163;67,650, or about 2,700 claims. It needs to be established that that exercise is necessary and not just an exercise for making money; that is perhaps not a well-chosen phrase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08061078000372">There have been numerous awareness-raising campaigns locally to try to encourage patients not to waste their medicines. Wirral PCT recently launched a campaign to highlight the problem of wasted medicines, which was very effective. Indeed, I was able to be present when one pharmacy, P. Williams Pharmacy in Lower Heswall, received an award recently for the best window display in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08061078000373">GPs and community pharmacists joined the overall campaign by producing window displays that encouraged people not to stockpile medicines, only to order what was needed and to take all their prescriptions if they were going to hospital. However, I believe that such local campaigns only go so far, as they do not have the coverage that, for example, a national TV campaign would have. We need to invest in getting the message across, not just locally but across the country. An effectively co-ordinated national campaign and more work by and in relation to hospitals, pharmacies and GPs would increase awareness of this issue significantly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08061078000374">I should like to comment briefly on the White Paper, &#147;Pharmacy in England: building on strengths&#151;delivering the future&#148;, which was published in April. That White Paper is obviously a very considerable step in the right direction, and its call for a more integrated approach when dealing with patients and their drugs is welcome. However, the White Paper failed to include significant detail about how that aim was to be achieved. In particular, it is crucial that it is explained how the Expert Panel on Health Services Research in Pharmacy will consider the longer-term impact of MURs on compliance with prescribed medicines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08061078000375">I hope that I have helped to demonstrate that there are many reasons why medicines go unused and many factors that contribute to their wastage. Part of the problem is that there is no uni-professional approach. Various health care institutions have tackled the problem independently, rather than there being a single integrated health service structure situated within a given community. It is perhaps notable that there is no official guidance on the duration of prescriptions&#151;a situation that may not be helpful. I believe that a national awareness-raising programme would be cost-effective in highlighting this issue, both to health care professionals and to patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08061078000376">It is fair to say that patients are not fully educated about medicine usage, first about the advantages of patient concordance and secondly about what happens to their medicines if they are not administered, even if they are later returned to a pharmacy. If people were more aware of the waste and the cost involved, surely less waste would occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08061078000377">What is needed is not just an approach that raises awareness but a systemic approach. I hope that the publication of the White Paper helps to bring together the strategy needed to tackle the issue of unused medicines, with the result that more money can be spent on health care services that will be used and valued, giving the   <br>

 It is a particular pleasure, Mr. Pope, to serve under your chairmanship today. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman) on securing this debate, and I know that this issue is of great interest to him. He has given a further explanation of that interest in relation to his home life, and I am pleased to see that it is so well cared for and that he is so well-informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08061078000379">I can assure my hon. Friend that the Government are concerned about wastage from unused, unwanted and returned medicines. From my own experience working as a district nurse, I am very aware of the importance of community pharmacists and of the explanations that patients receive from them about how to use and look after medication. However, I would be the first to first to put up my hand and say that we do not have a robust method for determining the scale and cost of medicines that are unused and therefore wasted. The figure of &#163;100 million a year is often quoted for such wastage, but according to some, the figure may be as high as &#163;800 million a year, as my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08061078000380">Medicines wastage was highlighted in recent reports from both the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee when they considered prescribing in primary care. The view of both bodies was that a potential saving of &#163;200 million to the NHS could be achieved by more effective prescribing, and that at least &#163;100 million could be saved by reducing the amount of medicines that are wasted. They recommended that the Department of Health should update previous research to produce a more robust estimate of the scale of medicines wastage in England, and better information on why patients do not take their medicines as intended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08061078000381">We have accepted those recommendations, and I am pleased to announce today that we have recently awarded a contract jointly to the universities of York and London to carry out research to determine the scale and cost of unused medicines and the varied and complex reasons why people do not take their medicines as intended. The findings of that research will inform policy development, influencing both health professionals and members of the public to reduce the amount of unwanted medicines, and providing value for money for the NHS. That research is now under way, and the results are expected to be available in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08061078000382">My hon. Friend mentioned medicines concordance and I am glad that he did so, as that is about involving patients in decisions on their prescribed medicines. This is another area in which we are working to improve matters, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is developing clinical guidance on medicines concordance. It expects to publish its final guidance to the NHS in January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para24"><a name="08061078000383">I agree with my hon. Friend that patients must play a big role in reducing the amount of wasted medicines. As I said, the reasons why people do not take their medicines as intended are varied and complex. Primary care trusts across the country are developing initiatives to raise  <br>

awareness about waste medicines. In fact, NHS North West, which includes Wirral PCT&#151;my hon. Friend&#146;s local PCT&#151;carried out a major public awareness campaign toward the end of last year, aimed at achieving a significant reduction in the amount of unused medicines in the region, which would free up resources for local NHS services. We would encourage other areas to follow that example.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para25"><a name="08061078000384">It has long been the Department&#146;s policy to encourage the prescribing of medicines by their generic name. That is good professional practice, and it provides opportunities for more effective use of NHS resources. Generic drugs are generally cheaper than their branded equivalents, but just as effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para26"><a name="08061078000385">As far back as 2000, we recognised that patients used to managing their own medicines while at home should be supported in managing their own medicines while in hospital, if appropriate. Linking the two will create a professional team to raise awareness, and I know that good work is taking place in that area. We also know that non-adherence to medicines can be a cause of hospital admissions, so it is important that we tackle it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para27"><a name="08061078000386">My hon. Friend pointed out that many patients do not realise that returned medicines cannot be reused, and he is right to highlight that. Ministers regularly receive correspondence from Members and the public about that. As my hon. Friend said, we cannot promote the reuse of returned medicines from patients. Recycling of medicines is both unethical and unsafe, as it is not possible to guarantee that any returned medicines are still of good quality. They may not have been stored correctly&#151;medicines left too close to a radiator or in direct sunlight may deteriorate&#151;nor is it possible for a pharmacist to guarantee quality on physical inspection alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para28"><a name="08061078000387">The code of ethics of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain states that, for reasons of hygiene and safety, medicines returned to a pharmacy from a patient&#146;s home, nursing home or residential home must not be supplied to any other patient. That applies similarly to donating unwanted medicines to developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para29"><a name="08061078000388">Equally, while returned medicines cannot be reused, it is important, as my hon. Friend said, that people return them to their local pharmacy. All pharmacies provide services for the safe disposal of unwanted medicines. That helps to ensure that unwanted medicines are disposed of safely, not flushed down the toilet or placed in the dustbin, thereby helping to reduce harm to the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para30"><a name="08061078000389">I have not addressed all the points that my hon. Friend made on packaging and pack sizes, for instance, but research that we commissioned should indicate the extent to which they are a factor in preventing people, literally, from taking their medicine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para31"><a name="08061078000390">Another issue that my hon. Friend raised was over-prescribing. The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee considered that real savings could be made through better prescribing by general practitioners&#151;and now, of course, suitably qualified nurses and pharmacists.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="08061078000391"><a name="80610h0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="08061078000533"><b>Ben Chapman:</b>
 I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend. I wonder whether she might respond to the point about packaging at a later date.</p>

 Of course I will. My hon. Friend raised such important issues and such a variety of questions that, sadly, because of the time, I am unable to deal with them all now, so I would be happy to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para32"><a name="08061078000393">The National Prescribing Centre is a nationally funded NHS body that supports the NHS in England in improving the cost-effective and safe use of medicines to the benefit of patients and the service. It has produced good practice guidance on the approaches that the NHS might adopt to secure efficient and effective use of resources across primary and secondary care, including repeat prescribing. The General Medical Council has also produced good practice guidance on prescribing medicines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para33"><a name="08061078000394">Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts employ more than 1,200 prescribing advisers, often pharmacists, to encourage and secure rational and cost- effective prescribing and to provide a source of advice and support for prescribers in their area. Research indicates that the input of a pharmacist can yield &#163;2 for every &#163;1 invested. Many PCTs are encouraging prescribers to issue 28-day prescriptions to help reduce waste, and most GP practices have developed repeat prescribing systems that require them to review a patient&#146;s treatment at fixed intervals before issuing a new prescription. That provides an opportunity to discuss with the patient whether their treatment needs to be continued, and can help to reduce waste by stopping unnecessary treatments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para34"><a name="08061078000395">However, we continue to believe that prescribing is a matter best left to the health care professionals involved in a person&#146;s care. We therefore need to balance that with patient convenience and minimising waste, but we do not think that new regulations are the best approach. Building on the success of the better care, better value indicators on the prescribing of statins, which has already realised savings worth some &#163;80 million a year, the Department and the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement are considering developing a composite indicator comprising statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors and generic prescribing. However, we would consider issuing guidance to the NHS to tackle waste medicines, if the research that we have commissioned provides clear data that show that such guidance would make a significant difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para35"><a name="08061078000396">Turning to my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, I am pleased to learn that Wirral PCT has invested in a medicines management team since 1999. It is responsible for promoting rational, safe and cost-effective prescribing, identifying and implementing areas for improvement, engaging GPs, managing the interface with secondary care prescribing, ensuring that systems are in place for the safe administration and use of medicines, and monitoring and developing community pharmacy services. The PCT has been successful in achieving year-on-year savings of more than 1 per cent. of its prescribing budget, which allows it to re-invest in patient care. The efficiency savings have driven a range of service, premises and educational developments, and I congratulate Wirral PCT on its achievements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para36"><a name="08061078000397">I am pleased that my hon. Friend acknowledges the role that pharmacies have to play in all this. I shall not mention any personal lobbying. Pharmacists, with their specific expertise in the use of medicines, can be capitalised on to tackle persistent problems relating to poor use of medicines, and the safe and effective use of medicines and associated costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="80610h0010.htm_para38"><a name="08061078000399">However, there remains room for improvement.

Instead, it should allow us to move forward in the spirit of partnership with those charged with commissioning and delivering pharmacy services. We have therefore recently held several listening events around the country, which were well attended.
