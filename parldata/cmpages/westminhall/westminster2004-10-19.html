<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Joan Ryan.]</i>
</p>



<a name="41019h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="41019h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Win Griffiths  (Bridgend)</b>  (Lab): I appreciate my good fortune in obtaining this debate. It was only a year or so ago that we had another debate on Iran. It is quite fair that after eight years of the so-called efforts of constructive engagement by the British Government and the European Union, we should review the situation with regard to the outcome of that constructive engagement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para0">First, I shall start with a piece of constructive engagement of my own, although it arose out of difficult circumstances. A year ago last April, two members of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, who were in Syria on proper visas, were arrested by the Syrian Government. Their names are Ibrahim Khodabandeh and Jamil Bassam. They were political refugees in Britain, and had been so&#151;in the case of Ibrahim&#151;even before the revolution and the removal of the Shah.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para1">They were illegally handed over to the Iranian Government, who for many weeks did not admit to having them. Eventually they said that they did have them in custody. After they had been in custody for about a year, I was allowed to visit them, as were Ibrahim Khodabandeh&#039;s daughter and her family.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para2">I had been told verbally that I would not get a visit, but having made a formal written request I was surprisingly allowed one. When I got there, I could see that the purpose of the visit was not only for me to speak to Ibrahim Khodabandeh and Jamil Bassam&#151;I was able to, not in completely confidential circumstances but    in reasonably private circumstances. However, during my visit from 14 to 17 June, on which I was accompanied by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor)&#151;my travelling companion, so to speak, although we were looking at the Iranian Government from different sides of the fence&#151;we had several meetings. For example, we met families who claimed that the People&#039;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran did not allow them to see relatives who were members of the mujaheddin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para3">We went to the Workers&#039; House of the trade union movement, where we met people who said that they had been injured, or that their relatives had been injured or killed, in attacks made by the mujaheddin in Iran. We also went to the Museum of Martyrs, where we met a charity that works to provide for those who lost breadwinners in the Iran-Iraq war, and in any activities carried out in Iran by the People&#039;s Mujaheddin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para4">We went to the revolutionary tribunal; of course, in any circumstances, the words &quot;revolutionary court&quot; tend to send a shiver down one&#039;s spine. I met the judge considering the case against Ibrahim and Jamil, and was assured that everything in Iran&#039;s prisons was fine. I then 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 178WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
raised the case of Zahra Kazemi, the Canadian photographer of Iranian family who had been battered to death in Evin prison, and was told that judicial proceedings were going on. Originally, her death was attributed to an accident, but two Iranian Government officials in the prison were then tried. However, after we got back, at the end of June or perhaps the beginning of July, we found out that the Canadian Government were not allowed to have representatives in the courtroom, that the trial was cut short, and that no one was found guilty of anything. That is a comment on Iranian justice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para5">I also was taken to a demonstration outside the French embassy by those who claimed that they had been hurt in some way by the activities of the PMOI in Iran and who were seeking redress in French courts. So far as I know, nothing has come of that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para6">I also met Mohsen Mirdamadi, an ex-reformist MP whom the Council of Guardians had prevented from standing in the February elections. He was one of many reformist MPs prevented from standing. Iran&#039;s system of democracy is still very much in its infancy if the Council of Guardians can prevent those who had spoken up against certain aspects of the regime from standing for election.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para7">I tried unsuccessfully to meet the deputy head of the judiciary, Mr. Larijani, but I did meet Dr. Araghchi, whom I suppose we would call the Minister for Western European Affairs. I put it to him that the two political prisoners were illegally handed over to the Iranian regime and should be returned to the United Kingdom; if Iran was confident of its case, it could make an application to our courts. After all, the PMOI is on our terrorist list; if we thought that a case had been made, we could return them to Iran in a proper judicial manner. I am still awaiting the outcome of that request.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew1"><b> Sir Sydney Chapman  (Chipping Barnet)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman is talking about constituents of mine and of the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis). I applaud the hon. Gentleman&#039;s efforts&#151;indeed, we are both very grateful for what he has done&#151;but would he not agree that the real test will be whether those two prisoners are returned to this country? If they are not, there should be no question&#151;I for one certainly will not be doing so&#151;of trying to co-operate in any way with the Iranian regime.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Griffiths </b> : That is important because the case, or the individual cases, could test the whole idea of constructive engagement, and of whether the Iranian Government are really determined to introduce equality before the law, and justice for their citizens. Yes, it is a good test of whether that can happen, and I certainly hope that it does.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para8">My visit was incredibly badly reported on various websites, and I spent quite a lot of time issuing rebuttals to things that had been said. To give one example, it was said that the National Council of Resistance of Iran had tried to prevent me from going. Not only did the council not prevent me, but it was positive and helpful in providing information and so on for my visit. That is the sort of thing that I have had to contend with since my return.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para9">One important element relating to what has just been said is that a senior member of the prison service, Mr   Haj Mortezr, was present at one of our meetings. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 179WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We had three meal-time meetings&#151;two with one prisoner and one with both. An official statement was read out, mainly for my ears rather than for the benefit of the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East, although he was listening carefully, saying that amnesty would be granted to any member of the PMOI who returned to Iran. I explained that that was fine and that it had been spoken of before, but that given the 20 years of hostility, deep distress and broken promises, it would not merely be a matter of people returning to Iran. There would have to be a properly negotiated settlement and a properly monitored return. Before such things could happen, the prisoners Ibrahim and Jamil would have to be returned to the UK, to show that the Iranian regime was making a positive effort to turn things around.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para10">I am very grateful to the Iranian Government for having allowed me to go. That was part of the process that has been going on for eight years&#151;we are given some hope, then we are sat on pretty firmly, and it is a struggle to find a way to secure a positive outcome. I am still doing that with regard to Ibrahim and Jamil. When I returned, I had a meeting for about an hour and a half with the Iranian ambassador. I then wrote to him to take up the issue of the amnesty, and how we should proceed with the return of the two prisoners to the UK so that their case could be tested in our courts. All that is still going on, and the PMOI is still on our terrorist list and that of the EU. Events have moved on since July, and we should think about removing it from those lists. I shall return to that later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para11">I now want to discuss the outcome of the eight years of constructive engagement.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew3"><b> Sir Teddy Taylor  (Rochford and Southend, East)</b>  (Con): To avoid misunderstanding, would the hon. Gentleman make it abundantly clear that the NCRI is the political wing of the Mojahedin-e Khalq&#151;or MKO&#151;which has been classified by Britain, America and Europe as a terrorist organisation on the basis of the most appalling terrorist incidents, of which we have details? I can supply many more&#151;it is all clarified in a book that I have here, and of which I think the hon. Gentleman has a copy.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Griffiths </b> : I was not given a copy of that book; I do not know why the hon. Gentleman received one and I did not, but he will know that in Iran I was challenged on many occasions to explain why I support the PMOI. I frankly told my hosts that their Government had been responsible for killing many, perhaps over 100,000, members of the People&#039;s Mujaheddin, and that in 1988 there had been a particularly savage murder, the slaughter of about 30,000 political prisoners. A religious fatwa was issued by Ayatollah Khomeini, part of which stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is decreed that those who are in prisons throughout the country and remain steadfast in their support for the [mujaheddin] are waging war on God and must be executed.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para12">More people were killed in that series of executions in 1988 than are listed in the book that the hon. Gentleman has in front of him. Yes, I am mindful of the fact that this violent military argument has been going on for a long time. Such arguments and disputes have gone on in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 180WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
many parts of the world where there have been hatred and bloodletting. However, there have been agreements in the end. Think of South Africa, where the African National Congress had a military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and Nelson Mandela stayed in prison for 27 years because he would not give up the concept of the armed struggle.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para13">In this country, there have been negotiations to try to bring to an end the long, bloody conflict in Northern Ireland. All that I have said about constructive engagement is in the context of trying to find real change in the relationships between the European Union and Iran, and between the NCRI and its members, of which the PMOI is the largest&#151;there are four or five others. We need to find a way to bring the current violent period to an end.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para14">The issue of human rights has dogged the post-Shah period from the very beginning.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Before the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) gives way, I ask Members who use acronyms to use them in full the first time to give the <i>Hansard</i> transcribers a chance.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I shall try not to use an acronym, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para15">My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend makes a powerful case. Would he also accept that the measure of the quality of a democracy is how it treats its minorities? Iran&#039;s treatment of its Christian minority is utterly disgraceful. Would he care to comment on that as well?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Griffiths </b> : As in so many cases, there are always two aspects. The Iranian Government point to churches in Tehran where Christians are allowed to worship; on the other hand, I know of cases of Christians and other minorities being persecuted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para16">In that context I would like to mention the persecution of followers of Baha&#039;i. Our Government have been strong in trying to change the Iranian Government&#039;s attitude to Baha&#039;i, but there has been a long history of persecution, which has intensified markedly this year, since the removal of virtually all the reformists from the Iranian Parliament. For example, followers of Baha&#039;i are denied access to higher education. About 800 of those who took the exam for university this year and were accepted found that when they received their acceptance notices they had been listed as Muslims. They said, &quot;Sorry, we&#039;re not Muslims, we&#039;re Baha&#039;i,&quot; but were told, &quot;Well in that case you can&#039;t go to university.&quot; Progress on the treatment of followers of Baha&#039;i ought to be a litmus test of how the Iranian Government intend to commit themselves to improving human rights&#151;indeed, it could even be a test of the success of the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para17">The Canadian Government do not have the PMOI on a terrorist list&#151;not all Governments in the world do. This year they are sponsoring a resolution on Iran at the UN General Assembly session&#151;I cannot remember whether it is the 55th or the 59th&#151;to raise many issues relating to human rights and the treatment of the Baha&#039;i faith. In years past, but not in the past few, the EU has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 181WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
supported resolutions on Iran, but again last year it did not. I hope that there will be total EU support this year for a resolution on Iran, as a way of raising the prospect of the Iranian Government responding positively on such issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para18">When we consider the events of the past year in Iran, we can only say that, unfortunately, the human rights situation appears to be deteriorating. Since March this year, the regime has announced more than 100 executions&#151;the figure is taken from official, Government papers&#151;many of which have been carried out in public. One or two cases have been highly publicised. For example, on 15 August, a 16-year-old girl was hanged in public. She was charged with acts incompatible with chastity. In another town called Marivan in western Iran, a 13-year-old girl was sentenced to execution by stoning because she was allegedly made pregnant through an incestuous relationship. She was stoned, but it seems that the person who committed the misdeed was not brought before the courts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para19">I mentioned Zahara Kazemi and the fact that the trial of the two people who allegedly caused her death in prison was brought to an end without any public viewing. It seems that she was battered to death, but that the Iranian Government accept that she was killed by falling down and hitting her head on a stone floor, even though her recorded injuries were more than would have been caused simply by falling down.The human rights situation is not good.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para20">The UN rapporteur of the working group on arbitrary detention, Louis Joinet, was in Iran in 2003. On his return, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There were probably more members of the mujaheddin being held in ward 209 of Evin Prison whom we were unable to see. We believe that the treatment of those held in this ward is inhumane and contrary to human rights.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para21">While I was there, on 14 and 15 June, the EU-Iran dialogue was going on in Tehran. On 11 October, the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted a resolution on the conclusions drawn following the dialogue. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Council remains deeply concerned that despite this commitment, serious violations of human rights are continuing to occur in Iran&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para22">and that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;little overall progress has been achieved since the start of the dialogue in December 2002.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para23">It added that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;little progress has been made on implementing the recommendations arising from&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para24">the visits of UN special rapporteurs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para25">It went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Council noted that the situation with regard to the exercise of key civil rights and political freedoms, such as freedom of expression, has deteriorated since the Parliamentary elections of February this year. The Council . . . expressed its concern about the recently increased number of reports about execution being carried out in apparent absence of respect for internationally recognised safeguards, and about the executions of juvenile offenders. It regretted that . . . discriminatory practices continue against women as well as against persons belonging to religious minorities, both recognised and not recognised by Iran.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 182WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para26">I conclude with this quote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Council further reaffirmed its position of principle that the dialogue remains without prejudice to the tabling of a resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights or at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. It agreed that at the 59th session of the UN General Assembly, the EU will convey its deep concern at the serious violations of human rights in Iran.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para27">After eight years, there has been little, if any, progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para28">I now come to the nuclear issue, which is one of concern and which has received much publicity recently. This ongoing debate was not much of an issue until the NCRI announced that the Iranians have a secret nuclear programme, and that there was a possibility of them enriching uranium and plutonium to make weapons-grade materials. Then, of course, the Americans, with their satellite technology, focused on the places mentioned, and it was all confirmed. Since then, the Iranians have revealed some things, but not everything, and it is only as a result of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency that more has come to light.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para29">The so-called EU three thought that they were on the verge of getting the Iranians to accept that they should give up their enrichment programme, and although the Americans were trying to take an even stronger line, the   EU thought that it had achieved a workable compromise. However, we now read in the Iranian press   that Iran intends to carry on with its uranium-enrichment activities. Hossein Mousavian said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Iran is not prepared for cessation&#151;any package including a cessation of fuel cycle work would be rejected&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para30">The Iranian press&#151;not only the Government press, but what could be regarded as the reformist press&#151;has made it clear that the Iranians should stand firm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para31">Again, this is a major issue, and I hope that the UK Government will consider it. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has expressed concerns, and in an interview on Radio 4 on 4 July, he talked about us taking
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;two steps forward and it&#039;s sometimes two back as well&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para32">He also expressed some optimism. Like him, I am an optimist, and I hope that there will be some positive outcomes from these revelations about a programme that could have resulted in the Iranians getting nuclear weapons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para33">There are some worrying signs given the situation in Iran. From reports in the press, it is clear that the Government of Iran have used the chaos following our invasion of Iraq to send in a lot of their people. Thousands of armed operatives have gone into Iraq, and there is an extensive clandestine intelligence network in the country. It has been suggested that Iran has moved into the best position for decades to influence the political shape of Iraq. Indeed, on 20 July, Iraq&#039;s Defence Minister himself, Hazem Shaalan, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Iranian intrusion has been vast and unprecedented since the establishment of the Iraqi state. Generally speaking, Iranians have penetrated the country&#039;s sensitive centres and set up many intelligence and security centres in Iraq.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para34">That is the position, and it is a cause of great concern. The matter must be pursued at diplomatic level to see whether we can get to the bottom of it and remove that Iranian influence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para35">I return to the terrorist tag on the PMOI. Even though it did not participate in any of the fighting, it was bombed in the war. Since then, the Americans have taken over its camp at Ashraf and have interviewed thousands of its members there. The Americans&#039; conclusion, which was published on 27 July in <i>The New York Times</i>, stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i> &quot;</i>A-16 month review by the United States has found no basis to charge members of an Iranian opposition group in Iraq with violation of American law.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="41019h01_para39">The interesting thing in relation to the terrorist tag is that as part of the agreement the people at Camp Ashraf have rejected participation in or support for terrorism; they have given up all their military equipment and weapons; they have rejected violence and will not unlawfully take up arms or engage in any hostile act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para40">I have a copy of the document that those people are signing, probably at this very moment. There is a very strong case for the European Union to remove the terrorist tag, because they have been accepted as protected persons, and have said that they will not engage in or support terrorism or violence; they have also given up their arms. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Minister will announce that positive steps will be taken on that point, and that there will be renewed efforts to make constructive engagement work or to find another way of peacefully allowing democracy to continue.

<p><a name="41019h01_spnew12"><b> Sir Teddy Taylor  (Rochford and Southend, East)</b>  (Con): I shall be as brief as possible. First, I have the highest regard for the integrity of the hon. Member for   Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). He is one of the few Labour Members for whom I would vote, because I know that he is a man of principle, although I disagree fundamentally with his views on Iran. I have had the highest regard for him in many years in the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para44">I have three brief points to make. First, we have an obligation to Iran. When we were engaged in discussions about the Iraq invasion I checked quite a bit of material about the war of 1980 to 1988 and the invasion of Iran by Iraq. The plain fact is that the western powers were, at that time, giving full support in every way to Saddam Hussein. I have a list of all the appalling weapons of mass destruction, including anthrax, with which the United States Government provided Saddam Hussein. I mentioned them in our debate on Iraq last March. We have an obligation to appreciate that we are not innocent parties on this issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para45">My second point, which I hope the Minister will at least discuss and perhaps study, even if he does nothing about it, relates to today&#039;s motion on the European Union. I hope that the Minister will make a special point of carefully considering the Funding for Peace Coalition paper, which I am sure he will have read, on the vast amounts of money that the EU gives to the Palestinian Authority that go straight into funding terrorism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para46">The publication is not simply one of those argumentative pieces, but a pamphlet that goes into great detail. It mentions names, amounts, and how, because of the sheer inefficiency of the EU in managing its funds, a vast amount of money goes towards the purpose that I mentioned. It says, for example, that 60 per cent. of the PA budget was supported by overseas donations, and that, last year, the EU gave &#163;112 million to the PA. It mentions in particular how the funding goes in various ways to al-Aqsa Martyrs and to other terrorist organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para47">Of the many members of the PA-funded militias involved in acts of terror against civilians, including Europeans, the most notable is Marwan Barghouti, the leader of Fatah-Tanzim, who was convicted on charges of murder and yet is still, unbelievably, drawing a salary from the European-supported PA budget. It is all there

<br>&nbsp;<br>
in great detail in the paper, which I hope the Minister will study. If he has not seen it, I will be glad to give him a copy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para48">My third point relates to Iran and to the MKO&#151;or MEK&#151;and other terrorist organisations. Here, again, the EU has a responsibility, because the headquarters of those organisations were in France for a time until the EU recognised that they were nasty, serious terrorist organisations, and they left as a result. They went to Iraq, which, as we know, has had an obsession with Iran for many years. First, are they innocent, decent and respectable people? The groups&#039; worldwide campaign against the Iranian Government stresses propaganda and occasionally uses terrorism. In the 1970s, the MKO/MEK killed US military personnel and US civilians working on defence projects in Tehran. It also supported the 1979 takeover of the US embassy in Tehran.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para49">In 1981, the MKO/MEK placed bombs in the head office of the Islamic Republican party and the Premier&#039;s office that killed some 70 high-ranking Iranian officials.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Griffiths </b> : Unfortunately, there are different truths on either side of the fence in all these activities&#151;let us call them wars. The People&#039;s Mujahedin of Iran, or the followers of Mr Rajavi, were not accused of the particular incident to which the hon. Gentleman refers until some time afterwards. In fact, the Iranian Government originally accused other elements of that attack. They focused on the supporters of Mr Rajavi only later, for, I believe, political purposes.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew14"><b> Sir Teddy Taylor </b> : I fully appreciate that there are different views. That is why I do not go in for propaganda on these issues. I do not listen to what organisations say, but take different quotations provided by the Library&#039;s research department. All I can say is that I have the full details of all the activities provided by the Library, which is excellent when one is trying to find out the truth, as the hon. Gentleman will know. I will be only too glad to give him all this information if he so wishes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para50">On the question of the MKO/MEK and its activities in Iran, I have the paper that I mentioned. I urge anyone to read it before they take a firm line on the matter, as it details the people involved in terrorism. The hon. Gentleman and I took out for a meal a gentleman who was sentenced to, I believe, 33 years&#039; imprisonment for killing two children in one of these activities. Sadly, the paper details a huge number of the organisation&#039;s activities that involve terrorism. That is frightening, and we should not ignore it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para51">Time is short, so I shall make only two more points. First, does the Minister accept that by and large Iran has a good reputation in many areas? I was impressed&#151;this might surprise people&#151;to find out that while some Arab countries have terrible problems in religious matters, in Iran we saw a synagogue&#151;there are five. There is a large Jewish community, which has freedom to worship, and there are many Christian churches. I met the people coming out of one of them and asked whether they had any problems. They replied, &quot;Absolutely none.&quot;

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 186WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para52">My second point is about the nuclear issue. I accept that it is always difficult to arrive at the truth in such matters. However, the only way in which we can make progress is to treat countries with respect. Could the Government not suggest that there might be merit in calling a conference to promote the middle east as an atomic-free zone? That would involve Israel and others in getting rid of atomic weapons, but it would be a way of making progress, which will not happen if things continue as they are.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para53">Finally, is there not a case for the Government to make it abundantly clear that the terrorist organisation MKO has little support in Iran? The impression I gained&#151;I am in no sense an expert&#151;was that public opinion, which used to be supportive to an extent, turned against it because, unfortunately, the MEK and the MKO supported Iraq at the time of the invasion of    Iran. There is no question&#151;there are detailed allegations in a House of Commons paper&#151;but that they not only gave it support but were involved in the armed conflict. What is the Minister&#039;s assessment of the support of the people of Iran for that organisation? My impression is that it is meaningless.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para54">My final point is about universities. We had the pleasure of visiting some. I was impressed to find out that university education is a big factor in Iran. Many people attend, and receive free education&#151;unlike those in the United Kingdom, who have to pay a great deal. Remarkably, more than half the students were women. Speaking to the students, I got the impression that the universities, far from being extreme organisations putting forward extremist views, are highly motivated educational institutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para55">I hope that the Government will take a positive attitude towards Iran. It has a form of democracy. Although it is not total, there is an elected parliament and an elected president, and public opinion counts for a great deal. After the cases in which people were prevented from standing&#151;we met one of them&#151;we were told that it was thought that that would never happen again because of the public response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para56">My final point&#151;I recognise that I have made a final point three times&#151;is that one gets an impression of a country by walking around its streets. There are some deplorable countries in the middle east, where I feel terrified to walk, but in Iran my general impression was of a civilised society with high standards. I hope that the Minister will make it clear that we will not co-operate in any way with terrorist organisations, and that we respect Iran for the many positive developments there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para57">Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask hon. Members to be as brief as they can. The object of these debates is to allow adequate time for the hon. Member initiating them to receive a reply from the Minister.
</p>



<a name="41019h01_time2"><h5>10.14 am</h5>


<p><a name="41019h01_spnew15"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester, Central)</b>  (Lab): I shall try to be brief. I shall concentrate on Iran&#039;s nuclear capacity, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) touched upon. There is no doubt that Iran will move to the top of the political agenda, and that that will almost certainly occur after the presidential election in the United States. It will be driven there by the preoccupation in Washington&#151;on all sides&#151;that the nuclear issue has to be dealt with.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 187WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para58">It is in our interests and those of the European Union that the EU should engage with the issue at the moment. We should have the sort of debate on the handling of Iran&#151;if that is the right expression&#151;that we failed to have in the case of Iraq; we learned a lesson there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para59">In recent years, the United States and the European Union have approached Iran in different ways. Essentially, the European Union has handled Iran in a much more intelligent fashion than has the United States, partly because the United States has varied in what it has sought to achieve, and how it has gone about it. Sometimes it has engaged in intense co-operation, as, for example, over Afghanistan; at other times it has been very distant. However, the EU, the United States and, indeed, countries such as Russia, must deal collectively with the nuclear situation in Iran.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para60">The evidence is that Iran is at least in a position to move towards obtaining nuclear weapons, which, given its strategic situation, ought to be unthinkable. That would almost certainly lead to a nuclear arms race in the region, with countries such as Turkey, possibly Saudi Arabia and even the Syrians looking to obtain a similar capacity. That would be massively destabilising in a region that is already unstable, and the response of Israel would of course be difficult to predict.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para61">Is military action an option, as in Iraq? Of course, all things are possible, but experience in Iraq should warn us of the enormous dangers. That said, Iran is not Iraq. It has a millenniums-old tradition and it is cohesive; indeed, it was prepared to accept up to 1 million casualties in the Iran-Iraq war in fighting for its national integrity. So, at this stage at least, most of us would say that the direction that the United States and others will want to take if Iran is not prepared to move forward would be the worst possible option, although we would not reject it in all circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para62">If the European Union can begin serious dialogue with the United States and places such as Moscow, and, most importantly, maintain its serious dialogue with Tehran, we could set out something like a road map, making it clear to the Iranians what they would get from moving in a positive direction. We would have to take account, for example, of the fact that Iran would look for security guarantees in its own region, and the United States would obviously have to play a fundamental role in implementing such guarantees, particularly given its extraordinary influence over Israel. However, Iran is entitled to security in its own region, and it is also entitled to recognition and access in economic and social terms. In that respect, there is a lesson for the Americans, because the EU has already offered the possibility of progress on such issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para63">In response, however, Iran must attend to the agenda that has been discussed this morning, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend. It will be fundamental to any dialogue that Iran move forward and clearly disavow its nuclear programme, and that means that it must be much more ready to accept proper inspection regimes. It would also have to move significantly on the human rights issues to which my hon. Friend referred; that, too, will be fundamental to any dialogue.

<p>
<a name="41019h01_para64">I have tried to be brief so that other hon. Members can speak. I simply conclude as I began by saying that Iran will be at the top of all our agendas within six months, almost irrespective of what happens in the American election. If Europeans do not begin to take Iran seriously now, we will have lost influence by the time the debate begins in the United States. If we are to take a cohesive approach at the global level, the time to do so is now.
</p>



<a name="41019h01_time3"><h5>10.18 am</h5>


<p><a name="41019h01_spnew16"><b> Sir Sydney Chapman  (Chipping Barnet)</b>  (Con): I    am    grateful to the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) for raising the important issue of the European Union&#039;s relationship with and policies towards Iran. The human rights situation there has been deteriorating for the past three years, and probably longer, which was confirmed by the outgoing EU Commissioner, Chris Patten, who is deeply concerned about reverses in human rights in Iran.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para65">I also want to put on record the statement by the Iraqi Defence Minister&#151;not the coalition forces&#151;that there has been a vast intrusion into Iraq by Iranians since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Given all the information that I have garnered, including from the research facilities of our excellent Library, I have every reason to believe that Iran can produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb within a year. I merely say to my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor)&#151;whom I greatly respect&#151;that Iran has spurned repeated attempts by the European Union to find a diplomatic solution to that nuclear crisis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para66">I have every reason to believe that Iran, or people from Iran, have taken control of many Palestinian terrorist cells. The hon. Member for Bridgend mentioned some abuses of human rights; I need not repeat them, except to mention that at least 120 people have been publicly executed since March. It is on record that about 120,000 members of the People&#039;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran have been executed in the past 20 years. One has only to study the articles in Iran&#039;s penal code to see how far that country disrespects human rights.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para67">The acquisition, development and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction have been a central policy of the Iranian regime. To say the least, their Government have been forked tongued over the issue. They have spurned attempts at a diplomatic solution, and denied and hidden evidence on the one hand and then, on the other, proudly boasted that they have two nuclear weapons programme sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para68">I want to stress my gratitude to the hon. Member for Bridgend for all that he has done to try to secure the release of one my constituents, Mr. Khodabandeh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para69">I have one other thing to say, and that is about religious tolerance. I cannot think of any religious organisation that contains so many peace-loving, kindly and gentle people as the Baha&#039;i faith, although I like to think that they all do. The Baha&#039;i faith has 6 million adherents in 235 countries; some, I am sure, in all our

&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 189WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
constituencies. There are up to 350,000 in Iran, which is the birthplace of the Baha&#039;i faith.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para70">The Baha&#039;is&#151;and maybe other groups&#151;have consistently been denied access to higher education. Early last August, the Baha&#039;i community in Iran learned that the Iranian authorities have now ordered the Baha&#039;is to suspend all educational activities and to close the Baha&#039;i Institute for Higher Education. It has been the policy of the European Union, and the United Kingdom, to engage with the Iranian regime to seek trade and to try to release the tensions between the west and that great country. I believe that that policy was wrong and ill considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para71">I hope that the EU and the UK Government will change their tune on Iran, given the dreadful persecutions and violations of human rights that have consistently taken place in that country over a long time.

</p>



<a name="41019h01_time4"><h5>10.24 am</h5>


<p><a name="41019h01_spnew19"><b> Dr. Rudi Vis  (Finchley and Golders Green)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) on securing this vital debate. I thank him profoundly for informing me over the years of the politics of this rich country, Iran, where most of the people are desperately poor. He has raised many aspects of the inhumanity of the present regime in Iran, and to my mind the central aspect of his contributions is    his analysis of why the People&#039;s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran should be removed from the British, EU and United States terror lists. That would be in the interests of the PMOI and of all the democracies in the world, and would send shockwaves through the oppressive regime of the mullahs in Iran. They would no longer be able to hide behind the smokescreen that allows them to argue that the EU and the USA agree with their regime. As my hon. Friend said, by labelling Iran&#039;s principal opposition as terrorists, the EU and the USA have distanced themselves from the Iranian people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para72">The Iranian people share the objectives of the president-elect in waiting, Mrs Maryam Rajavi, and support her policies, central to which are democracy, equality, human rights and accountability. One aspect is also worth stressing. The Government in waiting, with their headquarters near Paris, would recognise the state of Israel and would strive for a two-state solution, which is to say, a safe state of Israel and a safe, viable and democratic state for Palestine. Such an outcome, which seems so distant at present, would be of enormous benefit for the entire middle east region and beyond. It would also be a major blow for all the terrorist groups in the middle east and beyond that are financially supported by the mullahs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para73">I repeat what I see as the main contribution of today&#039;s debate: the request to the USA, the EU and the UK to remove the PMOI from the list of international terrorists. That would be a major achievement towards peace in the world and something in which the UK, the EU and the USA should be most interested.

<p><a name="41019h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Michael Moore  (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</b>  (LD): This has been an important debate and, like others, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) on securing it and introducing it in truly comprehensive style. The valuable insight that he and the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor) drew from their trip to Iran has enhanced the quality of the debate enormously.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para74">Iran&#039;s significance is lost on none of us. To take a short-term perspective, Iran has been at the centre of    many key events in the past century: western involvement in regime change, then Islamic revolution and, more recently, the Iran-Iraq war. Taking a wider sweep of history, we see that Iran has always made a striking contribution, not least to the development of learning and culture across the world. Iran is of huge strategic significance to its region and the globe. To put the matter simply, Iran, with its oil and gas reserves and central location in one of the most sensitive areas of the   world, has an influence way beyond its borders. Sadly, Iran also finds itself at a key junction on the international drugs routes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para75">In its recent report, the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs described Iran as
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;half in and half out of the international community.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para76">For all our past and current difficulties, constructive engagement is important for the UK, the European Union and the broader international community, so that Iran can be fully engaged internationally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para77">A number of hon. Members have focused their comments on nuclear weapons, which must be our most pressing concern. Despite its huge oil and gas reserves, Iran is known to have been developing a nuclear capability for some time. The regime has always protested that the programme is peaceful and civil, and consistent with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency&#039;s visit in February 2003 cast serious doubts on that claim and its work since has reinforced our legitimate anxieties about Iran&#039;s capability and intentions. Recent reports of Iran&#039;s ability to build and fire missiles have added to those concerns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para78">Inside Iran, of course, many arguments are made in favour of developing nuclear weapons. To the east, neighbouring Pakistan and nearby India are known to have nuclear weapons. To the west, Israel has had a nuclear programme for a generation or more. Around the region, the United States and its coalition partners have a strategic presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, countries that border Iran.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para79">Compelling as those issues may appear, none can override Iran&#039;s obligations under the non-proliferation treaty. Nor can they justify the massive escalation in the arms race that Iran&#039;s possession of nuclear weapons would represent for the region and the    world. For those reasons, the international community has spent much of the past 18 months urgently attempting to persuade Iran to comply with international law. It was right to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para80">History suggests that engagement with Iran is best done through careful diplomacy. Efforts by the United Kingdom, France and Germany have been extremely important in that regard, and I applaud the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for their work.

<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 191WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para81">The EU three have made significant progress in brokering a deal with Iran to suspend its nuclear programme and to allow greater access to IAEA inspectors. The signing of the additional protocols to the safeguards agreement was a key development. The deal offered the prospect of Iran ending its uranium enrichment activities in return for guarantees that it could import all the nuclear fuel required for a civil nuclear programme. However, throughout 2004 the Iranians have been resiling on the agreement, which its Parliament has never ratified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para82">Critical reports were made by the IAEA in March and June; they were followed by an announcement in July that Iran would resume manufacture of centrifuges, which are critical to the enrichment process. Further criticism was made in the IAEA&#039;s September report, which set the scene for an important decision by its council when it meets in November.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para83">Throughout the past few months, the EU&#039;s position has appeared to unravel, and it seems to be without a plan B. There is increasing American pressure for Iran to be referred to the United Nations Security Council, with threats in the background of what that might lead to. So far the EU has properly resisted that pressure, but it seems that the EU has been offering only carrots and the US only sticks. We need hard-edged constructive engagement from now on. We can offer improved trade and investment, and ultimately perhaps an EU trade and co-operation agreement, but we must also set out penalties, with the prospect of sanctions if Iran fails to comply with its obligations. Iran already has a high value of trade with the EU, which allows that prospect; it seems anxious at present to avoid such sanctions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para84">The Iranians are rightly concerned about the middle east peace process and the ongoing conflict in Iraq. It behoves the west&#151;the European Union and the United States&#151;to make serious progress in the middle east. We must demonstrate that we will tackle issues there even-handedly. Perhaps next year&#039;s conference review of the non-proliferation treaty will offer us an opportunity to confront the undoubted double standards that now exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para85">Others have mentioned human rights issues; I echo what they said. To put it mildly, the elections in February were a disappointment. In political terms, Iran seems to have been going backwards since then. Many eloquent testimonies have been given about the infringement of personal freedoms, and the worrying increase in executions throughout the country. We must ask Iran to address these serious issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para86">We have reached a critical moment. Human rights is a key issue between the EU and Iran. There are also concerns about drug trafficking and links to terrorism. Most frightening of all, however, is the possibility&#151;even the prospect&#151;of Iran developing nuclear weapons. The EU must continue to engage peacefully with Iran as we tackle that threat. The engagement must be hard edged: on one hand, there must be clear opportunities for civil and nuclear developments supported by the prospects of greater trade and investment; on the other, there must be a serious intent to use sanctions.

<p><a name="41019h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Graham Brady  (Altrincham and Sale, West)</b>  (Con): This short but useful debate has amply illustrated the complexity of relations with Iran and the sensitivity of the challenges that we face. I congratulate the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) on securing it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para88">Iran will, undoubtedly, be one of the greatest foreign policy challenges of the next Parliament and, indeed, of the next presidential term in the United States. If we get our policy towards Iran wrong, the result will be more conflict, more instability in the middle east and the added threat of nuclear weapons. If we get it right, however, there is the prize of an open and democratic Iran, a force for stability in the wider region and a country with which we can trade and co-operate freely. The stakes are therefore high.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para89">I want to make it clear that I do not doubt the Iranian people&#039;s will for peace. It is also very clear that Iran sees the benefits of reaching a trade and co-operation agreement with the European Union. To date, however, too many members of the Iranian Government have found confrontation easier than engagement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para90">My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor) spoke of the positive aspects of Iran and the importance of positive engagement. The Opposition supported the Foreign Secretary on his visit to Iran last year with his French and German counterparts. That act of engagement was a brave act that held out the prospect of a new relationship with Iran and an end to its military nuclear programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para91">We must, however, now recognise that that strategy of engagement has nearly run into the sand. Iran has reneged on its commitments to the international community and to the International Atomic Energy Agency by continuing to pursue nuclear technology that would enable it to become a nuclear power. Iran enriches uranium far above levels needed for a purely peaceful nuclear programme. The heavy water reactor in Arak is a cause for concern, and the scale of the centrifuge plant at Natanz is suspicious. Iran also continues to enhance its ballistic missile capability. This is all cause for the most serious concern. It is rumoured that the Iranian Government have ordered that the first nuclear bomb should be ready by the middle of next year. Does the Minister believe that to be accurate and, if so, is Iran on course to achieve that threat?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para92">Our anxiety must not be limited to Iraq&#039;s weapons programmes. As several hon. Members on both sides of the House have shown, the human rights situation appears to be deteriorating again, particularly since the beginning of this year. That was exemplified recently by the execution of the young girl to whom the hon. Member for Bridgend referred in his opening address.

<a name="41019h01_para93">Worsening human rights appear to be matched by the declining strength of reformist forces in Iran and the reassertion by radical hardliners of control over the Iranian Government. Press freedom has been further constrained in recent years. The daily newspaper <i>Bahar</i>, for example, was closed in 2003. The Tehran public

<br>&nbsp;<br>
court claimed that the newspaper had &quot;insulted the authorities.&quot; On the same day, the special court of the clergy closed another journal and arrested two members of the editorial board whose whereabouts, so far as I am aware, remain unknown. The Minister might have more up-to-date information on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para94">There have been difficulties in our bilateral relationship, too, not least of which was the seizure of eight British servicemen and their equipment earlier this year. Everyone was delighted that the servicemen were returned safely, albeit after their public humiliation. Their equipment, however, was not returned. The Government have been very quiet about that, and I hope the Minister will update us about their efforts to see our equipment returned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para95">The situation is difficult, but at least we know what we want to achieve. I believe that there is very little difference between Members on both sides of the House about what our goals should be: friendly relations with an Iran that is nuclear weapons free, stable, respectful of human rights and on the road to true democracy. That goal is also shared by our partners in the EU and more widely across the Atlantic. We can achieve it only by working with our European partners and the United States.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para96">In the past couple of years, a worrying state of affairs has developed in Iran&#039;s relations with the wider world. An impression appears to have developed that Iran has nothing to lose by snubbing the Europeans and nothing to gain by engaging with the US. While that impression persists, we may be doomed to unproductive confrontation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para97">In that context, will the Minister elaborate on the current Russian diplomatic initiative and its implications? The Russian Foreign Minister has visited Iran during the past fortnight, paving the way for a visit by President Putin next month. What assessment have the Government made of the prospects for success in persuading the Iranians to end their nuclear enrichment programme and submit to IAEA inspection? If the Russians reach such a deal, will the trade-off be the retention of a civil nuclear programme in the shape of the existing, although inactive, power plant and a second nuclear reactor using Russian technology? If that is the case, what steps can the Minister promise to ensure that the civil nuclear programme will not be used to allow the development of nuclear weapons to resume in future?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para98">Bearing in mind the comments of the hon. Member for Bridgend about close involvement of Iranian nationals in Iraq, I ask the Minister whether there is evidence of personnel or equipment from Iraq&#039;s nuclear programme having found their way to Iran, either directly or through a third country. Is there evidence to support recent press comment that Iraqi nuclear weapons technology would be sold to Iran by Syria?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para99">As the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) said, we are approaching a crossroads in our dealings with Iran. Our relations are likely either to improve or to get markedly worse. I hope that it will be understood on both sides of the Atlantic that crude military measures are likely not simply to be unproductive, but perhaps to be counter-productive. They might delay Iran&#039;s nuclear programme but they 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 194WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would not stop it. They would also unite the Iranian people&#039;s passionate national pride with hard-liners&#039; hostility to the outside world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para100">Are the British Government making the case against military action to any who might be tempted to pursue it? Equally, we must make it clear to the Iranian Government&#151;this, too, was mentioned by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale&#151;that there will be negative consequences if Iran continues to   develop a nuclear weapons programme illicitly. Likewise, our dialogue on human rights must be robust, so we need to back up our position with some credible threats of consequences for the Iranian regime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para101">We and our European partners have expended political capital in obtaining US agreement for talks on improved economic and political ties if Iran suspends its nuclear fuel enrichment programme. I hope that the Minister will tell us how fully behind the talks he believes the American Government to be. If Iran perceived that the US Government were ready to commit to better relations, the chances for the latest round of dialogue would be greatly increased. If agreement were reached, what mechanisms would be put in place to reassure the west that Iran was keeping its side of the agreement?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para102">If agreement is not reached, there must be consequences. Does the Minister believe that, in that case, Iran&#039;s nuclear weapons programme should be an urgent matter for discussion by the Security Council, as has already been requested by the US? What measures might the Government recommend if Iran failed to suspend its fuel enrichment programme? Do the Government agree that Iran&#039;s further integration in the world economy would certainly have to be halted in those circumstances?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para103">There must, on the other hand, be real incentives for Iran to accept the need to suspend its programme and improve its human rights record. Acceptance of a purely peaceful nuclear programme and improved trade relations with the EU could be enticing parts of such an offer. Such incentives, however, would be enormously more attractive if the Iranian Government believed that they could lead to a constructive relationship with the United States as well. How prepared does the Minister believe the US might be to enter into such a relationship?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para104">We firmly support the Government&#039;s readiness to engage with the Iranian Government and we wish them well in one of the most challenging foreign policy arenas, but I hope that they will be prepared to take robust, peaceful action in the event of failure.
</p>



<a name="41019h01_time7"><h5>10.43 am</h5>


<p><a name="41019h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Denis MacShane) </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) for initiating the debate, because it allows me to set out the Government&#039;s view of the difficult problem of our relationship&#151;and that of our partners in Europe and other democratic partners&#151;with Iran.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para105">Hon. Members have made constructive speeches. My hon. Friend went to Iran with the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor), but from listening to their speeches it is apparent that they came back with dissimilar analyses of the situation there. That shows us the complexity of what we are dealing with.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 195WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para106">I shall deal with the specific points that hon. Members made as my speech develops. Some important questions were raised. The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), speaking for the Liberal Democrats, invited us to get much closer to our European partners. The Foreign Minister of Germany is to meet me and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary in exactly an hour. I assure the hon. Gentleman that Iran is top of the agenda.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para107">The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), speaking for the Conservative party, seemed to suggest that we should be much closer to the   United States. I do not dissent; it is the job of Government to find a way of bringing our European partners and our allies and partners in the United States closer together, not to choose to park ourselves in one camp in opposition to the other.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para108">It was good of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend to start by mentioning the individual cases of Ibrahim Khodabandeh and Jamil Bassam. We should never forget that we are talking about citizens of Iran who have elected to be in exile in this country and who now find themselves in prison in Iran. They are not British citizens and we have no legal or consular oversight of them. However, I share the view that there are too many people in prison in Iran for making political statements, and too many executions have taken place, including the awful one of the 16-year-old girl. Such things are not worthy of a democratic, civilised nation and everybody in the European Union would object to them. There was also the death of Zahra Kazemi, the Canadian photographer beaten to death in Iranian police custody last year. That was of great concern to us all, especially to me, as a former president of the National Union of Journalists, to our allies and friends in the Canadian Government and to journalists throughout the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para109">It is right that we should put individual cases on record. However, as has been pointed out, Iran is a great country with rather more than a millennium&#039;s worth of history and culture. In the region around Iran, we find some of the most important challenges that we face: first, how to make the world safer from global terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; secondly, how to fight   the drugs trade, illegal migration and other international crime; thirdly, how to bring about reform and sustainable development in societies undergoing rapid change; and fourthly, but not least, how to support the establishment of stable democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para110">Iran&#039;s choices about its future and its relations with neighbouring countries can affect the security and prosperity of peoples well beyond the middle east. If, as I hope, Turkey gets a start date for negotiations and joins the European Union, the EU will, in due course, have a frontier with Iran. That is why the British Government and the EU have sought engagement. I do not put an adjective in front of that noun but, as the Prime Minister said in Crawford three years ago, we believe that engagement is the right way forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para111">We welcome President Khatami&#039;s vision of a democratic Islamic civil society, based on the rule of law, and support those in Iran who wish to bring in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 196WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
reform. We co-operate successfully with Iran in a number of respects&#151;the fact that hon. Members are able to go to the country, to visit its prisons and to have a range of political discussions in Iran is a small sign of that; it was not possible in the past. We can all think of countries that do not correspond to our democratic norms and where such things are still not possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para112">We share the view of our EU partners that any development of relations with Iran, which we want to see, must be on the basis of Iranian willingness to address issues of political concern. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd) was right to say that we need a united European approach. We also need unity with the United States. I hope that, should problems with Iran develop in a way that we hope they will not, we will not experience again the divisions between the US and Europe that have occurred over Iraq. The two great regions of democracy in the world must march together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para113">Let me address one of the most pressing issues, which   many hon. Members mentioned&#151;Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. We do not question the right of any country to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, provided&#151;this is the essential condition&#151;that it complies fully with its obligations. Under the non-proliferation treaty, it is unacceptable for non-nuclear weapons states to seek to acquire nuclear weapons. In the middle east, such efforts could seriously destabilise international peace and security. The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East asked about a nuclear weapons-free middle east, and the United Kingdom Government have always supported UN resolutions calling for such an arrangement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para114">In the past two years, the International Atomic Energy Agency has documented serious failures by Iran over 18 years to meet its safeguards obligations and be fully transparent with the agency. That has led to widespread concern about whether the ambitions of Iran&#039;s nuclear programme are, as the Iranian authorities claim, entirely peaceful. That is not simply a British, German, French or American concern; it is shared by the entire international community, as we have clearly seen from the actions of the IAEA board of governors, whose last six resolutions on Iran have all been adopted by consensus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para115">The United Kingdom, France and Germany&#151;the so-called EU three&#151;have played a leading role in encouraging Iran to co-operate with the IAEA. Our efforts have been aimed at giving Iran an opportunity to reassure the international community that its nuclear intentions are indeed peaceful. When my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary visited Tehran with his German and French counterparts last October, the Iranian authorities made a solemn commitment that they would take the necessary steps. They promised to be fully transparent with the IAEA and to co-operate in   resolving the outstanding issues identified in the director general&#039;s reports. They also promised to sign, implement and ratify an additional protocol to the safeguard agreement, which would allow short-notice access by IAEA inspectors to a wider variety of nuclear sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para116">Furthermore, Iran promised solemnly to suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. This last point is crucial. Confidence cannot&#151;I repeat, cannot&#151;be restored unless Iran agrees to suspend its 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 197WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
fuel cycle activities, including all centrifuge work and uranium conversion. Such activities are not necessary for a civil nuclear power generation programme, but they would give Iran technologies to help it towards a military nuclear capability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para117">I should emphasise that the suspension request is specific to Iran because of its past lack of co-operation with the IAEA and the very real doubt that that has created about the real intentions behind its nuclear programme. We do not ask other countries to suspend their enrichment-related activities if there is no reason to doubt their peaceful intentions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para118">The commitments made by Iran last October were a step in the right direction, but as we said at the time, what matters is not declarations of Iran&#039;s willingness, but seeing those declarations turned into reality. Since last year, Iran has supplied the agency with further details of past nuclear activity. It has also signed, but made no attempt to ratify, the additional protocol. We accept that those are significant moves, but as successive IAEA resolutions have made clear, there is much further to go. Important questions remain unresolved, such as the extent of Iran&#039;s work on advanced centrifuges and the purposes of its work on plutonium separation.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew22"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> : My hon. Friend is right to say that Iran has committed itself to fulfilling certain obligations, but does he accept that there would be a real logic to offering it security guarantees, which would allow it to escape the logic of its nuclear programme?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. MacShane </b> : I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point, but Iran must live up to its specific legal obligations under the different treaties. In other words, it must decide and show the world whether all its work is exclusively for peaceful purposes. That is the question that the entire world wants answered, including President Putin of Russia, who, in a meeting with President Chirac and Chancellor Schr&#246;der a few weeks ago at the Sochi resort on the Black sea, said that Russia was determined that Iran should not become a nuclear weapons state.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para119">However, Iran has never suspended fuel cycle activities in a way acceptable to the board. Instead it has quibbled constantly about the scope of suspension and, in June, partially stepped back from its commitments. That is why the international community is more worried than ever. As the Foreign Secretary said in Brussels on 13 September:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;What Iran has to understand is that it cannot turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para120">Last month, the board reconsidered Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. It would be damaging if the IAEA board, having set out its requirements in successive resolutions, were now to accept less than full compliance. With our encouragement, it decided to give Iran a final chance. Iran now faces a clear choice: live up to its commitments and comply in full with the board&#039;s resolutions, including to put in place a full and lasting suspension, and thus reap the benefits of the international confidence that this would create, or spurn this chance to reassure the international community. If that happens, the board will need to discuss additional 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 198WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
measures, which will probably include referral to the UN Security Council, at its next meeting. Iran now needs to act decisively before the board meets again on 25 November. Naturally, the Government will keep the House fully informed as those efforts proceed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para121">The nuclear issue is not the only security question on which we are engaging with Iran. As the EU has made clear, action by Iran against terrorism is also a high priority. We particularly want Iran to play a full role&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. MacShane </b> : I must get some of these points on record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para122">We want Iran to play a full role in the international fight against al-Qaeda by sharing information on al-Qaeda members whom it is detaining. We continue to urge the Iranian authorities to ensure that groups engaged in terrorism and violence in Iraq, the Israel/Palestine region and elsewhere do not draw material or political support from inside Iran.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para123">I am dismayed by, and I refute, the inaccurate allegations made by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East about EU help to Palestine. It does not help his case to make such inaccurate remarks. I will write to him, and will make a copy of my letter available to the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para124">We recognise that Iran has legitimate interests in the future of Iraq and Afghanistan. It has played host to more than 2.5 million refugees from those countries. In Afghanistan, we have welcomed Iran&#039;s co-operation regarding the recent election and efforts to combat the drugs trade. Iran has played a part in restoring Iraq&#039;s economic and religious life, but its leaders have done little in public or private to support the Iraqi Interim Government and their efforts to provide security for the Iraqi people. We are deeply concerned by reports of links between the Iranian regime and armed groups that undermine the rule of law in Iraq.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para125">Iran must also address its human rights record. Like every elected Member of this House, I was deeply disappointed that many candidates, including a quarter of the sitting Deputies, were disqualified from standing in February&#039;s parliamentary elections, and was surprised to hear that little attention was paid to that. If some outside body announced that a quarter of the MPs standing for re-election in the House of Commons could not stand, there might be a row involving even the deeply conservative and religious authorities in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para126">We believe in the dialogue between the EU and Iran, but in recent months there have been disturbing new trends in areas such as freedom of expression, the behaviour of the courts and religious freedom. We cannot support the delisting of terrorist organisations outside Iran that have committed atrocities that are crimes against humanity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h01_para127">I hope that the whole House will send a message of    solidarity to people of the Baha&#039;i faith. It is a great, noble, tolerant and peace-loving religion, and its treatment at the hands of the Iranian authorities is an insult to human values anywhere in the world.

<a name="41019h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Child Support Agency</h3>

<a name="41019h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="41019h02_spnew0"><b> John Barrett  (Edinburgh, West)</b>  (LD): In my three and a half years as a Member of Parliament, many issues have featured regularly at my weekly surgery, but one that causes misery to many constituents, mostly young mothers and their children, is the problem of dealing with the Child Support Agency. That is why I am delighted to have the chance to raise a number of concerns today. If there are any that the Minister cannot answer this morning, I hope she will contact me when she has the answers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para0">The problems faced by my constituents are not new. I am sure that many of the issues that I wish to raise today will be familiar to the Minister, not only because of her work in the Department for Work and Pensions but because, like every other hon. Member, she will have listened to her constituents as I have listened to mine. They are usually young mothers, but sometimes fathers, trying to get by and to do their level best for their children&#151;the children of the many ex-partners who refuse to play a part in their children&#039;s maintenance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para1">We often hear of Fathers 4 Justice, in this place as well as outside, but, although they are not so vocal and do not indulge in stunts, many more mothers suffer in silence. They need someone to speak up for them. I hope that this debate will help to raise their profile in an altogether quieter and more measured way. The fact that they do not scream from rooftops, crane-tops or Buckingham palace does not mean that they do not suffer as much, and in many cases more, than those high-profile cases that we hear so much about. However, for as long as the CSA remains unchanged, hon. Members will continue to see problem cases in their surgeries&#151;and Ministers should expect to continue responding to debates such as this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para2">I am not one of those people who believes that we should approach the CSA in a party political way. Neither the Minister nor I were Members when the Child Support Act 1991 was enacted, but she will know that there was broad cross-party consensus on the creation of the CSA. I would like to see cross-party agreement on its abolition, but I accept that we do not yet seem to have reached that stage. The basic point is that the CSA is not working as well as it should, and for many people it has never worked well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para3">Only last week, the CSA was described in <i>The Independent</i> as being on the brink of collapse. Having already written off more than &#163;1 billion of arrears as uncollectable, the CSA still owes 500,000 parents a total of some &#163;720 million. There is now a backlog of 30,000 cases, with less than half the amount owed to the CSA this year being collected. To make matters worse, the new &#163;456 million computer system, designed to make the agency more efficient, is struggling to cope. With half the total number of CSA cases, that system is just not doing the job. That is totally unacceptable. This is a service involving children, in some cases very vulnerable children, which makes the situation deplorable.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 200WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para4">All hon. Members have their own CSA stories. The most basic problems with the agency can be summed up in a letter that I received from someone living in Corstorphine in my constituency. She wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I submitted an application to the Child Support Agency in June 2003, but despite several phone-calls to them, I have had absolutely no communication from them at all. When I phoned in, I was told that my case was being dealt with as a clerical case and that the best way to progress it was to lodge a complaint, which I did. I received a letter acknowledging receipt of the complaint and was told they would be in touch. I didn&#039;t hear anything further so at the beginning of December, I tried contacting them again for an update on my case. I spent three hours on the phone getting passed from person to person and not one of them was able to give me any information. I spoke to seven different people and each time, I had to explain the situation only to be told that I&#039;d been put through to the wrong department. I eventually got through to someone who said they would leave a message for the person dealing with my case and he would call me back the following day. I waited over a week and there was not contact so I tried him again and the same thing happened. I was told to phone one number then another and then another. I left another message to be called back and I&#039;m still waiting.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para5">It is disgraceful that people such as my constituent are    being left in limbo, with communications left unanswered and messages not responded to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para6">Far and away the most extraordinary CSA case I have come across is that of one of my constituents in Barnton&#151;a case that is still continuing four years after    the original application. In July 2000, my constituent gave the CSA all the necessary documents for a maintenance decision to be taken. After hearing nothing for several weeks she contacted the CSA again, only to be told that they had no documentation about her, and she should send the forms again. A few days later she received a letter from the CSA, returning the very documents that it had told her it had lost, and asking for more information. She phoned the Hastings office, to be told that her case was being dealt with in Falkirk. She then phoned the Falkirk office, to be told that her case was being dealt with in Hastings. Even the staff at the CSA admitted that their dealings with her case had been a bit of a shambles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para7">Eventually, my constituent&#039;s papers were found in the Hastings office. The CSA made a maintenance calculation, but no payments were ever made by her ex-husband to the CSA. Rather than pursuing the ex-partner for payment, the CSA simply added the missed amounts on to future payments. Of course, those payments were not made either. Then, in 2002, two years after the original application was made, the CSA finally got round to making a liability order for payment to the sheriff&#039;s office. It took another year for a public auction of my constituent&#039;s ex-partner&#039;s office goods to be organised. At that auction he handed over a cheque for &#163;1,000 to stop the sale and the auction was cancelled&#151;but what happened next? The cheque to the CSA bounced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para8">All that is rumbling on, and my constituent rightly queries the exact monthly amount of child maintenance awarded by the agency. She advised the CSA that her ex-husband had extra property from which he was receiving an income, and did additional work for which he received a salary. Those amounts were not included in the CSA&#039;s calculations. Yet the CSA chose to ignore that. It appears that it never carried out any investigations to verify the claims.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 201WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para9">On 23 July 2003 we requested a full about the CSA findings in my constituent&#039;s case, and were told that such information would be provided in 28 days. Despite constant chasers we did not receive that report until 31 December 2003&#151;161 days after the request, which is five times the promised time. While all that was going on, my constituent was not receiving any money. I   wrote again to the CSA on 28 June and did not receive   a response until, interestingly enough, I secured this Adjournment debate. None the less, four years and three months after the original application, my constituent has not received a penny in child support. Her case is one of the 25 per cent. of CSA cases&#151;a staggering one in four&#151;in which no payments have ever been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para10">The delays that my constituent has faced in getting her money are bad enough, but her case also highlights two further systemic problems with the CSA. First, there is a problem with the agency taking ex-partners&#039; declarations of income at face value. There has been a particular problem where the ex-partner is self-employed and it is difficult to verify profits and income independently. I came across another case involving an ex-husband who said that his income was &#163;100 a week, on which basis the CSA calculated maintenance. Yet anyone who looked closely at that man&#039;s lifestyle&#151;he had holidays and a new car, and had bought a new house&#151;would see that it could not be supported on &#163;100 a week. Any proper investigation by the CSA would have discovered that, but no investigation took place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para11">That leads to the second issue: the fact that lack of action by the agency forces the parents with care to become, effectively, private investigators. All too often the CSA leaves it up to parents with care to prove that the income of the non-resident parent is higher than declared, rather than forcing the non-resident parent to prove that their income is as low as they have declared. That simply cannot be right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para12">The report of the Work and Pensions Committee was pretty damning about the new computer system: &#163;456 million was spent, yet 75,000 cases have been lost or stuck in the system. The contrast is clear. Why are so many cases stuck? Is that an IT problem, a personnel problem or the fault of EDS, the company that supplies the data system? For every individual whose case is stuck, the problem is a major one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para13">The Committee concluded that CSA customers were receiving
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;an appalling level of service.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para14">Its findings are borne out by cases in Edinburgh, West, as I am sure they are in every constituency in the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para15">One of my constituents, Mrs. Wood, had been receiving regular payments until June this year, when the payments mysteriously stopped. On contacting the CSA she found that that had nothing to do with the money from her ex-partner, as maintenance was still being paid to the CSA. However, for some reason the computer had stopped forwarding payments to her account. Since then, not only has she never received the correct monthly payment, but she has received a new payment schedule that is totally inaccurate. I would like the Minister to go into some detail about whether that is the fault of the IT system. Experience with the CSA shows that it can be difficult enough getting correct payments from some 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 202WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
non-resident parents, but surely when the correct payments are made, such as in the case of Mrs. Wood, the CSA should forward those payments, on time and in full.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para16">I want to give the Minister as much time as possible to reply, but before I finish, I want to raise the wider issue of what to do with the CSA as an agency. The Minister will know of my party&#039;s long-standing policy of    abolishing the CSA and moving its assessment and    enforcement functions to the Inland Revenue. Considering the amount of cross-checking the CSA should do with the Inland Revenue, but does not always do, that would seem an entirely practical and sensible proposition. I know that the idea has even received support from some of the Minister&#039;s own Back Benchers. I still have not heard a reasonable argument from the Government as to why such a move should not happen. I accept that it would not remedy things overnight. However, it is a serious proposition that could provide the kind of joined-up government that the Minister and her colleagues always promise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para17">It may be easy to think of child maintenance and the CSA simply in terms of the transfer of money. However, we must never forget the purpose of that money is to protect the many children&#151;in some cases children who   remain in poverty&#151;who need and deserve that extra help. As a father, I can never understand parents walking away from their own children and their parental responsibilities. However, we live in the real world&#151;a world in which that absence of responsibility exists.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para18">Although for some people the CSA exists only as a formal means to transfer money, surely the agency&#039;s key task is to prevent parents who try to avoid their responsibilities from doing so. That is where the CSA is failing in its most basic of aims: the protection of children. Far too many children are simply not getting the money they need and deserve. Although that is often the fault of the absent parent, the Minister has to accept that in too many cases&#151;tens of thousands of them&#151;children are not getting the help they need because of the direct failure of the CSA to act quickly, effectively or at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para19">I accept that the new rules introduced last year are an improvement. However, introducing them is like giving someone a sticking plaster to deal with a broken leg. They have failed to deal with the underlying core problems of the CSA. Tinkering at the edges is not good enough; we need a complete overhaul of the entire system. Until we get that overhaul, I fear that Members of Parliament&#039;s postbags will continue to be filled with letters, and their surgeries filled with mothers, fathers and children who are being short-changed by the system. Those people deserve better.

<p><a name="41019h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  (Maria Eagle) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) on securing a debate on a subject that is clearly of great importance to the lives of so many families not in only his constituency but in the constituencies of every Member of the House. We all see such cases in our surgeries, one way or another, so we all have an interest in the matter.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
there yet&#151;I will say that up-front&#151;and I acknowledge the fact that there are ongoing problems. However, when we can get the new system to work properly and extend its coverage, it will be simpler, more transparent and easier for parents to understand. That should go some way towards making things easier for all parties to accept, and towards changing the staffing emphasis in the CSA from what it too often concentrated on in the past&#151;trying to collect information to make the complex calculation under the old scheme&#151;to compliance; that is, ensuring both that calculations are made and that money is flowing and is passed over.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para21">That is the aim of the new scheme. I will not say that it is perfect yet; it would be foolish to do so. However, it is worth keeping in mind the fact that as the new scheme starts working better it will ultimately ensure that money reaches children more quickly, which ought to   dissipate people&#039;s understandable frustrations. We already intervene in what is often a fraught situation between two parties&#151;they are not always warring parties, but it sometimes feels as if they are. That is a delicate position for staff in the agency, which is compounded by the problems that were always there with the old system and by the ongoing difficulties that we are having in making the new system work as well as it should.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para22">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that each week thousands of cases are cleared effectively on the new system. I am sorry that that has not happened for the first person he mentioned from his constituency, whose application was made in June 2003 and will therefore have been considered under the new system. I am disappointed to hear of that person&#039;s experience. I can say nothing further to the hon. Gentleman about that case, except that if he would like to give me more details outside the Chamber, I should be happy to look into it and try to find out what on earth is happening. From what he said, the situation does not seem to have been resolved yet. I would like to assist him in ensuring that it is resolved as soon as possible, and to pass on any information about what has gone wrong.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para23">Until the end of June, almost 120,000 new scheme maintenance calculations had been made and about 46,000 non-resident parents had started to pay maintenance using the agency&#039;s collection service. About 25,000 parents with care had started to get the child maintenance premium income disregard in their benefit. That means that, for the first time, those parents with care will see the benefit of any maintenance paid, at a time when they most need it. If they move into work, they can retain that premium.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para24">Because the new scheme is so much easier to understand, parents are more able to make their own arrangements without involving the agency, which, in a way, is the hidden benefit of the new scheme. Indeed, the interactive calculator on the agency&#039;s internet site had   more than 25,000 visits in September this year. One   assumes that those visits were probably by parents   working out between themselves what the liability would be. Obviously, that has something to recommend it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para25">The new child support scheme is starting to make a real contribution to supporting children. However, there are still problems, as is well known. The hon. Gentleman quoted from the Select Committee report, which 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
considered the issue closely, and hon. Members are well aware of the problems that we have had. I shall not pretend that my ministerial colleagues and I have not been disappointed with progress to deal with the problems so far, but we are going in the right direction. Progress is sometimes frustratingly slow, but we are moving forward. Clients and staff have told us that when the new scheme works, it works well, so there is something there that we can aim to improve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para26">People lead complex lives, and the scheme will not always seem fair to all parties who have to interact with it. That was true of the old system and it is true of the new one, but the job of agency staff is to assess the facts and properly apply the relevant law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para27">The second case that the hon. Gentleman raised&#151;that of his constituent from Barnton&#151;appears to involve an application made under the old system of child support. I am afraid that the parade of frustration that he related is indicative of a number of issues, primarily the difficulties that the old system caused for everybody. That case highlights the administrative problems of the old scheme, as well as the problem of having to deal with self-employed non-resident parents&#151;a point that the hon. Gentleman particularly emphasised&#151;which is acknowledged as a severe difficulty, particularly when those parents do not co-operate. Indeed, as he said, they sometimes do more than not co-operate: they deliberately try to frustrate the work of the agency. I do not understand why they would want to punish their children in that way, but many non-resident parents seem to want to do it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para28">We accept that there are particular concerns with self-employed non-resident parents. Theirs are often the most intractable cases in our postbags and surgeries, and make for some of the most difficult cases reported by the media. Recovery of money owed by self-employed people is notoriously difficult not only for the CSA but for a range of other agencies. Other revenue departments have similar difficulties in dealing with the self-employed. The situation is the same in other countries: the self-employed non-resident parent often presents the most intractable difficulty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para29">However, only about 6 per cent. of non-resident parents are self-employed. In old-scheme cases in 2003&#150;04, compliance for the self-employed non-resident parent was about 67 per cent., compared with an overall figure of 74 per cent. There is a difference, but it is not enormous. Neither figure is good enough when it comes to compliance&#151;both are still way too low. None the less, they demonstrate that many self-employed non-residents do co-operate. Members of Parliament, and my staff in the agency, obviously have to deal primarily with the ones who do not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para30">I shall say a little about what we are doing to try to increase our compliance work, because it is tremendously important. Achieving compliance is obviously an important part of the work of a large number of agency staff. I could not have said that before the new scheme was introduced, because most agency staff were occupied with trying to work out the calculations. No doubt the hon. Gentleman will know&#151;he will have heard Ministers in my position say this before&#151;that under the old scheme, up to 100 different pieces of information might have to be obtained before the calculation could even be made. That meant that about 90 per cent. of our staff&#039;s time was taken up trying to obtain the information, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 205WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
almost none was spent chasing compliance, even when the calculation had been done. I am glad to say that the new scheme makes a great difference to that ratio, because compliance is much more important than doing the calculation if the aim, which the hon. Gentleman made clear he agrees with, is to get money to the children who need it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para31">At all stages of a case, staff are taking action to ensure that non-resident parents accept their responsibility and comply with the maintenance calculation. The new scheme calculation makes that easier because it is much more transparent. It might sometimes be seen to provide rough justice, but everyone can work it out: the calculation is pretty easy to do. Even before that stage, staff are encouraging non-resident parents to make voluntary payments to the parent with care while they wait for a calculation, so that they can get into the habit of paying and do not start off with arrears.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para32">At times under the old system, by the time calculations were made the arrears seemed to be enormous and were often based on interim calculations that non-resident parents might have thought of as made in fantasyland. Moreover, parents often did not understand how the calculations had been made, which did not exactly promote compliance. The new scheme is a big step forward in that regard. We should, however, be realistic: some parents will always fail to pay, for whatever reason. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s second example perhaps made that point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para33">To deal with such cases, the agency is placing even greater emphasis on ensuring that money flows. Last year we launched a campaign called &quot;Children Can&#039;t Wait&quot;, which aims to ensure that staff take prompt and effective action at the first sign that payments are not being made. Several options are available if non-resident parents refuse to make arrangements to pay, either directly to the parent with care or through the agency. The threat of a sanction will often, but not always, result in the payment of maintenance, but the agency does not shy away from taking action if the threat does not result in maintenance being paid. If non-resident parents are employed, maintenance can be deducted from their wages, although that is obviously more difficult in the case of the self-employed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para34">This is a specialist area of work, and since March 2004 the agency has increased the number of staff working in it.In the year to March 2004 there was a 24 per cent. increase on the previous year in the number of cases referred to bailiffs, so we are starting to take more effective action. In cases in which the non-resident parent persists in wilful non-compliance, the court can take away driving licences or commit people to prison. The hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that although only four driving licences have been removed by the court, 28 people who were in court with that threat hanging over them decided that payment was the best way to deal with the issue. People who, right up to the door of the court, do not intend to pay, can be made to do so by threats such as the removal of driving licences. The figures for committal to prison are even more interesting: 15 people have been committed as a result of non-payment, but some 234 have had suspended committal orders. That means that they decided that it was preferable to pay. Improvements are taking place.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para35">The self-employed are a tougher nut to crack. We cannot attach their earnings because, as the hon. Gentleman made clear, it is difficult to work out what they are. However, they can receive liability orders. He might feel that the case that he raised has not been solved, but we are doing more to obtain money from self-employed non-resident parents who are not willing to pay. One has to apply to the courts for a liability order, and then the issue of what resources are available has to be proved. Such orders can deal only with arrears; they do not cover ongoing maintenance. Even if the non-resident parent pays once the order has been granted, he will not necessarily continue to do so. There can still be a problem of non-compliance afterwards if he is so inclined&#151;perhaps it is unfair to say &quot;he&quot;; that is not necessarily the case, although it usually is.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h02_spnew1"><b> John Barrett </b> : I thank the Minister for what she has said about enforcement. Will she detail what action can be taken quickly with regard to the non-resident parent when it is obvious that his lifestyle&#151;the person involved usually is a man&#151;cannot be sustained on the relatively minimal income that has been declared? Can the CSA move quickly so that the arrears, once assessed, do not build up to amounts as substantial as those that have applied in cases that have come to me?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h02_spnew2"><b> Maria Eagle </b> : Obviously, the agency has to be able to verify that there is a problem with the income. As the hon. Gentleman says, that sometimes seems obvious to onlookers. We ask for evidence of the non-resident parent&#039;s income. It can be difficult to obtain, but we have powers to share information with other Government agencies that might have cause to hold it, which helps a great deal. The fact that we are willing to take court action quickly can also help with compliance. In addition, the fact that more of our staff now deal with compliance makes it likely that we will be able to act more quickly than in the case that the hon. Gentleman described&#151;nobody would argue that that set a good example.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para36">Having read what was said by the Select Committee, the hon. Gentleman asked a couple of questions about computer problems. He asked whether cases got stuck because of IT problems or other administrative problems. The difficulty is generally an IT problem. Part of the recovery programme led by our computer suppliers EDS, of which he will have heard, is designed to prevent cases from getting stuck, and there has been some progress. Improvements are made with each release of the new code and the fixes for the problems that have caused the sticking in the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h02_para37">The number of cases that are stuck has dropped from some 120,000 to about 40,000. That is progress. I accept that that does not help an individual whose case is stuck, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that if we cannot fix the problem of a stuck case in an IT way, there are manual fixes that can get round that problem in particular cases. We deal with cases clerically to do that, but clearly that is not administratively efficient.

<p><a name="41019h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Laws </b> : I have the same problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para0">I am pleased to secure the debate, and I welcome the Minister and other hon. Members to their places. It is traditional in my party to leave certain pension issues to my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), who speaks so effectively on them for us in the House. Therefore, I do not want to raise the wide policy issues that seem to have opened up in recent weeks. Instead, I want to focus on the pensions debate as it relates to those of my constituents who have been affected by the problems that have arisen in private sector pension schemes over the past couple of years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para1">Without wanting to tread too much on the toes of the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), who will speak in another debate later, I want to mention the experiences of 87 members of the Turner and Newall pension scheme at Daido Industrial Bearings Europe Ltd. in Ilminster, most of whom are constituents. I also want to talk about the 108 members of the Varta Ltd. pension scheme in Crewkerne, who have also encountered some problems that have affected private sector pension schemes in recent years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para2">I am sure that those cases are the tip of the iceberg and that other schemes in my constituency have been affected by a variety of problems. Indeed, I have had representations from 67 people who work at Doncasters in Chard and who are members of Allied Signal&#039;s reserved membership final salary pension scheme. However, I shall not focus on that issue today, because it is being dealt with through the courts; we hope that there will be a settlement. Instead, I shall focus on the first two cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para3">Although I said that I wanted to leave many of the big-picture issues to my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon, it is clear that this is not just a constituency issue and that problems with private sector pension schemes have been experienced across the country over the past couple of years. Therefore, the Government not only face the challenge of achieving a fair settlement for individuals such as my constituents who have been affected by problems with their pensions. They also have a strong public policy interest in reinforcing the credibility of the private pensions industry and their own pension provision. If they do not do so, I fear that the worrying trend that we have seen over the past couple of years may develop further, with an increasingly widespread perception among members of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 208WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the public that pensions are not a good investment, that they are not safe and that people should put their money into the housing market instead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para4">A cursory review of the personal finance sections of newspapers is enough to show that the view that private pensions are no longer safe, reliable or a sound investment is not limited to the many individuals who already have difficulty finding the money to save. Such views go far wider and include groups that traditionally have regarded pensions as a safe and sound investment but that, after their experiences with pensions over the past three or four years and with property prices over the past decade or so, are shifting their asset portfolio in a way that could turn out to be extremely dangerous in years to come if there is a significant downturn in the housing market, and particularly if everyone in the current generation saves through the housing market and ends up having to sell at the same time to fund their retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para5">The reasons for the recent problems with private sector pension provision are well known, and several have impacted directly on my constituents in the T and N and Varta schemes. Briefly, they include the introduction of controls on pension fund surpluses from 1987, which encouraged employers to take contribution holidays. That issue is of particular relevance to my constituents in the T and N pension fund. Also, of course, the abolition of tax credits paid to pension funds, in the Chancellor&#039;s first Budget, has had an adverse impact on many private schemes. The introduction, from June 2001, of the new accounting standard, FRS 17, had a further impact. Obviously, the fall of the stock market since 2001 has had a major effect on the valuation of many private sector pension schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para6">One could add further factors to that list of major elements affecting private sector pension provision, not least of which perhaps is the fact that longevity is increasing. The consequences of that must be dealt with not only in the private sector but, increasingly, in the public sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para7">For those reasons, there have been significant problems in many private sector pension schemes&#151;the beginning of the end for many defined benefit schemes. The Government have responded to that&#151;in some cases, under quite a lot of pressure from other parties in the House&#151;by introducing their pension protection fund, starting in April 2005, and the financial assistance scheme, which, on my understanding, will be backward-looking from May 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para8">We accept that the Government have taken two desirable steps to help many of the people who are affected by the problems with private sector pension schemes. We also accept that there are many difficulties in framing the schemes in ways that will not create incentives for private sector employers to dump their pension liabilities on the public sector. Whichever party was in government would have to be conscious of the issues and concerns that the Minister described, in the recent Conservative Opposition-day debate on pensions, as the problem of moral hazard. It is understandable also that those constituents of ours who find that they are at risk of losing all, or almost all, their

pension are not interested in esoteric arguments about moral hazard, but want to know what action will be taken to assist them.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Nigel Waterson  (Eastbourne)</b>  (Con): I am following the hon. Gentleman&#039;s arguments closely. Does he agree that the individuals concerned cannot for the life of them see a rational distinction between those who are caught up in a solvent wind-up of a pension fund and those caught up in an insolvent wind-up? From their point of view, they are equally unable to control events. Does he think, as I do, that they should be treated the same?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Laws </b> : That is a real issue. I agree that the individuals concerned may not see the distinction that the Government and others want to draw. I believe that it is important, however, that the Government frame legislation in a way that does not open opportunities for the private sector to shift its liabilities to the public sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para9">The two pension schemes that I want to talk about are both affected by another problem in the Government&#039;s proposals: the well known problem of the gap between the two Government schemes. Some people will be protected in part by the financial assistance scheme, up to May 2004, and others may get protection beyond April 2005 through the pension protection fund.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para10">I bring to the attention of hon. Members today two cases involving the problem of pension schemes&#151;and affected constituents&#151;that fall into the gap in between. The wind-ups of the schemes in question are starting in the period between the operation of the financial assistance scheme and that of the pension protection fund. I want to press the Minister on what progress is being made on whether Government compensation will extend to people who fall into the gap. There is a strong sense among those of my constituents who are affected, but also in the mind of the average man in the street who is interested in such issues, that it would be ridiculous for one cohort of people to be trapped and, because of what happens in one year of the Labour Government&#039;s term of office, excluded from compensation. That is what would happen to the 87 members of the T and N pension scheme at Daido Industrial Bearings Europe Ltd.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para11">In the past couple of days and in today&#039;s press, there has been hopeful news about the T and N pension fund. It seems that the unions and others have done a good job   in trying to negotiate a better deal from those who are seeking to buy the company out of chapter 11 bankruptcy. Let us hope that the private sector will find a solution to the T and N problem, rather than the obligations for 40,000 individuals in the UK being transferred to the Government and the taxpayer.

<a name="41019h03_para12">I understand why the Minister has been reticent in respect of giving an undertaking on what will happen if there is no private sector solution to the T and N pension fund   problems. Understandably, he does not want to    encourage anything that would transfer those liabilities to the public sector, but I seek at least some encouragement that he understands the position of the   people who may fall in the gap between the Government&#039;s two schemes and that he is considering their situation sympathetically. I would also be grateful if he gave us more information about the timetable that he envisages for making decisions on how such people will be affected.

<p>
<a name="41019h03_para13">I note that the Government have already made some comments on the record in the past month, indicating that they are looking at people who fall between the schemes sympathetically. Baroness Hollis of Heigham said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We have not yet ruled out help in respect of schemes that start to wind up between May 2004 and the introduction of the PPF&#151;what I call the sandwich year.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 7 September 2004; Vol. 664, c. GC132.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para14">I raised with the Minister the issue of my constituents at Daido Industrial Bearings Europe Ltd. who are affected by the T and N pension scheme. He replied in a letter dated 20 September that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the details of the Financial Assistance Scheme have yet to be finalised and we have not yet ruled out help in respect of schemes which start to wind up between May this year and the introduction of the Pension Protection Fund. We will take final decisions on requirements for the Financial Assistance Scheme once further research and consultation has been concluded.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para15">Today, I want him to give not a cast-iron guarantee&#151;I know he will not do that&#151;but something a little more positive than &quot;not yet ruled out&quot; that shows that he understands that people caught in the gap between the schemes deserve proper protection from the Government. I would also like him to indicate how the research and consultation are proceeding and when we can expect a decision. I am sure that he understands that those who may be affected and who stand to lose a large amount of their provision for retirement are extremely worried about this issue and seek some guidance from the Government about how they intend to pursue it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para16">My constituents who are in the T and N pension fund understand that, beyond those two important points, there is a limit to the extent to which the Government can comment on the private negotiations taking place. However, when I contacted them about the debate, they asked me to raise several other issues with the Minister regarding their frustrations about how the problems in the T and N pension scheme arose. I hope that the Minister will give his views on those issues. First, in their minds, the main reason that the fund ran   into problems was the long pension holiday that it   had&#151;I believe that it was almost a decade. We understand why, in the 1980s, the Government decided that a restriction to avoid losing taxation was needed, but, with the large swings in financial markets, surely we want to ensure that we do not deter any companies or pension funds that want to run up reasonable surpluses as a cushion against the bad times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para17">The second point raised by my constituents at Daido was whether there should be a stronger obligation on the trustees of some pension funds to have an actuarial evaluation more regularly than every three years and to give clearer information to scheme members, so that they can understand some risks that are developing and how well funded their pension scheme is. I suspect that, for many individuals in this position, the problems that they end up with and the near collapse of their scheme often come as a complete surprise. They will not have appreciated some problems as they built up&#151;sometimes over the short term, but usually over a couple of years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para18">The third issue that constituents raised was whether there should be some special secure status for pension fund assets in the break-up of companies going into liquidation. One can obviously anticipate some 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 211WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
problems that might arise, but it is a legitimate issue to raise with the Government and I hope that the Minister touches on it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para19">The fourth and final point that the constituents raised, which is becoming increasingly relevant in the world of international ownership for private sector employers, was how the Government intend to protect UK workers in foreign-owned companies from the application of foreign pension laws. I will return to the   situation faced by T and N members at Daido. Essentially, we have a Japanese firm, decisions that are made in America about a US-based pension fund and an English firm. The way in which we co-operate with other countries to agree a common set of rules, regulations and procedures in relation to pension law could be important in such cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para20">I suspect that the Minister will not be as familiar with the second case as he is with the major issue of the T and N fund. It affects a large number of people in my constituency, and a much smaller number across the UK. It is the position of the 108 employees in the Varta   Ltd. pension and life assurance scheme who were   employed by Varta Ltd., a battery company in Crewkerne in my constituency. After the debate, I   will   send the Minister additional details about that particular case, so that he can respond. However, I   would like briefly to raise the Varta case, not least because I suspect that it demonstrates some problems that the Government are grappling with and some that will need to be grappled with, and some measures that businesses are taking to try to reduce the pension liabilities that would otherwise fall to them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para21">The Varta Ltd. pension and life assurance scheme was established as a final salary scheme in 1971, and was historically funded by contributions from both the company and employees. Varta Ltd. was a subsidiary of Varta AG, a German company, and Varta AG was in turn sold to DB Investor, a company substantially owned by Deutsche Bank, in 2000. There was a further change in October 2002, when Varta AG sold a retail supply business to a US company, Rayovac Corporation. At that time, the Varta Ltd. business had to be split to separate the two bits: the part that was being purchased by the US entity and the part that was not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para22">It was no secret prior to the Rayovac purchase that the pension scheme, like many others, was in deficit on the basis of the minimum funding requirement and US and UK accounting standards. The deficit was about &#163;2 million. Following the purchase of Varta Ltd. by Rayovac, the decision was made to close the Varta Ltd. site at Crewkerne and to transfer the business to the existing Rayovac operations in the United Kingdom. That took effect from 31 May 2003, at which time the employees and directors left the company.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para23">Rayovac has met its statutory debt obligation to the scheme, as required by law, and Varta Ltd., although still nominally the principal employer, is likely to be wound up. However, Rayovac has so far proved unwilling to discuss who will negotiate any further assistance to the scheme&#039;s 108 members.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 212WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para24">Varta Microbattery Ltd. continued to pay into the scheme after 31 May 2003, up to 31 December when its Inland Revenue approval expired. Consequently, as the last employer, the company became liable to make up any shortfall, which by that time had to be measured on a fully bought-out basis, as there were no contributing members left. When Varta Microbattery realised that that amount was &#163;4 million in total, which the company could not afford to pay, it used the legal loophole left last year by placing the company into administration in February 2004, making all its employees redundant. The business was then immediately re-opened as a branch office of Varta Microbattery GmbH, and the   company re-engaged those employees it wished to    retain. By that process, it is likely to avoid its responsibility to the members of the Varta Ltd. pension scheme, unless the trustees of the scheme succeed in claiming from the German parent company. In August 2004, Varta Ltd. triggered the winding-up of the scheme, with the consequence that deferred members can now expect only about 45 per cent. of the pension that they earned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para25">That presents the Minister with several different issues to address, as the Government will no doubt be concerned to ensure that the pension protection legislation is very carefully put together. I do not necessarily expect him to have grasped all the details in this short debate, so I hope that, by writing separately to him, he can guide us as to whether any measures could be taken to pursue some of those obligations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para26">Obviously, what concerns constituents of mine who are affected by this situation is that, although they have heard about the Government&#039;s widely trumpeted scheme to offer compensation to people who have lost out in private sector schemes such as these, they now find that they fall between the pension protection fund and the Government&#039;s compensation scheme up to May 2004. This is yet another case that shows that a large number of deserving individuals fall between the two Government schemes. I hope that the Government will think again about whether they can deal with the needs of those individuals, which would not happen under the proposed schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para27">The desperation and frustration felt by many of these people, who have not always been properly informed about problems with their pension schemes and whose parent companies, with responsibility for their pension scheme, are often international, are summed up at the end of a note sent to me by a constituent, Mr Bailey, who is still employed at Daido Industrial Bearings Europe Ltd. in Ilminster and is a member of the T and N pension fund:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Here at Ilminster we find ourselves to be a Japanese owned Company sited in England. Our pension is based in England but appears to be effectively controlled from America. We have employees who have been with the Company for anything up to forty years. Some, myself included, are within a few years of retirement. We were encouraged by all and sundry to join the Company scheme which was promoted as the way to a financially secure retirement. Through no fault of our own- we now find ourselves in a situation where, at best, a significant percentage of our pensions may well be lost. All this to support an ailing American Company that we no longer work for!&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para28">That is a good example of the frustration felt by people today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para29">We accept that many of these problems date back even further than the period of office of the Labour Government and that there are challenges for all parties. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 213WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We also accept that the problems in those two pension schemes cannot simply be put down to one or two of the Government&#039;s decisions. The ultimate solution to many problems will involve a change in the whole architecture of pensions policy. We hope that the indications from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the past few weeks are that the Government may be rethinking their existing complex pension scheme, which relies too much on means-tested benefits. While the Government are doing that long-term thinking, we hope that the Minister will offer more reassurance to individuals such as my constituents who are facing great losses in income in retirement. We hope that we can work with him over the next few months to give real comfort to people in that situation.
</p>



<a name="41019h03_time1"><h5>2.23 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I arrived at the debate with no intention other than to intervene on the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws). I want to say a few things, however, particularly about the administration process to which he referred, which will not surprise my hon. Friend the Minister.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para30">I thank the Minister for receiving a delegation from Amicus, the Transport and General Workers Union and the work force of Lister-Petter, a couple of whose members graphically described the problems that they face. I share Lister-Petter with the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb): some of his constituents are part of the same pension fund as my constituents. The only thing that has changed since I last saw them is that the outcome of the administration is known. Members of the pension fund will receive less than a penny in the pound. With the best will in the world, that outcome was the biggest kick in the teeth that one could imagine. The Minister will remember that one of the gentlemen worked for Lister-Petter for 37 or 38 years, yet the workers stand to get next to nothing from the administration process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para31">I pay due regard to the Minister&#039;s previous boss, my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). He, too, saw me and took up some issues with the Department of Trade and Industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para32">The Minister knows the arguments, and he knows what I shall be asking him to do. I know that he will reflect on what I say, but I accept that it will not be easy. The Lister-Petters of this world are prime examples of what can go wrong when companies get into difficulties and pension funds are sacrificed as a result. I know that he can say nothing about who will be included in the pension protection fund, but, if the Lister-Petter work force are not part of it, I do not know who will be. It is important to recognise that the state has a role as lender of last resort, but it should not be quite like that. Perhaps lessons can be learned and ideas taken forward to prevent a recurrence of such cases.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b>  (LD): The hon. Gentleman has been diligent in pursuing the interests of Lister-Petter pensioners. Does he share my concern that the Government have asked such schemes for information to help to construct the financial assistance scheme but have offered no help to meet the costs of supplying that information, and that the trustees can meet those costs from the pension fund, which will leave 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 214WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the workers with even less? Does he think that the Government should have met the cost of obtaining that information?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : The state should certainly have a role in arbitrating on how the process of administration or receivership is taken forward. I was about to say that secured creditors should not have it as easy as they seem to, and that unsecured creditors should not be sacrificed. However, when push comes to shove, often the reality is that little is left&#151;except, dare I say it, for the Exchequer. The state may have to take on such responsibilities. It is wrong to expect the workers to carry the entire burden. It is completely unfair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para33">I have used Lister-Petter as a case history, but it is a good example as it demonstrates what we need to learn from such a wrong set of circumstances. From the outset, however, my investigation of the Lister-Petter pension fund showed no evidence of maladministration. The company was unfortunate in as much as there was a stock market blip at exactly the wrong moment, and the problems that the company faced were mirrored by those that faced the pension fund. Although the pension fund needed outside support, the company should have been doing more. However, the state should have a role to play in trying at least to get a fairer settlement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para34">The main problem when it comes to the process of administration, let alone a full winding-up, is that the power that we invest in the administrator or receiver is so great that the pension fund is left at the bottom of the pile. The way in which the assets are settled leaves the pension fund as the most unsecured of creditors. It is bound to lose. As far as I can make out&#151;I will be careful in how I word this&#151;it pays the administrator very little to be fair to the pension fund, whereas for the banks and other prime creditors the administrator is, for all sorts of reasons, seen to be unduly helpful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para35">We face a closed circle. I have raised the issue on a number of occasions. I know that it is not the Minister&#039;s responsibility, but I will continue to bang on about it. The Department for Work and Pensions and the Department of Trade and Industry must between them tackle the secret garden of the administration process and, dare I say it, receivership. The process needs to be opened out. Too often, the pension fund loses out because it is unclear what decisions are taken on behalf of whom, except that in a number of cases we can see who loses out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para36">In the case of Lister-Petter, the pension fund was already in difficulties when, roughly a year ago, the company began to experience serious difficulties itself. The hon. Member for Northavon talked about the issue. I have had a lot to do with the case, but I do not want to labour the point about how much of my time the issue has taken up. More important are the repercussions in a company town such as Dursley, which was based around Lister-Petter .
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para37">At its height, the pension fund was about &#163;12 million in the red. By the time of the closure, that figure was reduced to less than &#163;10 million and was moving in the right direction. Again, there is a question about the administrator and, dare I say it, the independent trustee appointed by the administrator to consider the grounds on which a decision to close the pension fund might be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 215WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
taken. I accept that such legal and financial decisions must be taken, and one trusts that they are taken for all   the best reasons. In the case in question, there was no   real alternative in the view of the trustees of the pension fund.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para38">The killer is that, when a pension fund is, say, &#163;9 million in the red, the real cost of trying to keep it going is about three times that, because the money in the red must be annuitised. Again, the issue relates to the confidence of the market and what it expects. In due course, as the stock market improved, the pension could have come back. Why does that matter?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : Of course, there is an alternative to annuitisation, which is for the financial assistance scheme to take over the assets&#151;it does not have to cash them in and therefore buy a poor-value annuity. I do not know whether the Government have ruled that option out, but does the hon. Gentleman share my view that that should happen? The FAS should take over the assets, not force people to buy poor-value annuities.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I do not disagree at all. My point is that, when you look for a potential suitor&#151;it is the role of the administrator to try to keep a company as a going concern&#151;the pension fund is seen as a great dead weight. If an administrator can lose the pension fund, that is seen as something that makes the company more attractive. The administrator&#039;s motivation is therefore completely at odds with the continuation of the pension fund. The hon. Gentleman proposes a way to overcome that, which is something that the Minister might want to talk about. The danger is that you could end up with the state picking up a rather hefty bill, but something has to be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para39">The reason the issue is so important is that it concerns the prioritisation of the security of the assets when a company experiences difficulties.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. May I warn the hon. Gentleman that when he says &quot;you&quot; he means me? Normally, I am quite relaxed about that, but, as a former chairman of a pension fund, it could be embarrassing.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I apologise. I shall try to talk in the plural. In the situation that I described, everything is stacked against the pension fund that has to try to survive. As I have said&#151;we accept that it is not the responsibility of the Minister&#151;part of the solution is to persuade the DTI. I am looking for more of a level playing field, so that the pension fund is not seen to be the makeweight of any administration process. The people whom one would want to protect are those who are most unprotected. The sad thing in the case of Lister-Petter is that the people who have had the boot put in are those who stayed with the company through thick and thin and who may have foregone their pension because they preferred to stay as deferred pensioners. They have lost out completely.

<p><a name="41019h03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I shall conclude promptly. I know that the Minister will argue against the case that I have advanced&#151;this time in public&#151;that there is a danger that companies will take this as an opportunity to get rid of their company schemes and that those who could be in the game of taking them over would have every reason to object if they believed that such a move would leave them responsible for a punitive pensions fund.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para40">In these days of corporate social responsibility, there is no clearer way for a decent business to behave than to recognise that its pension fund is a critical measure not only of how effectively it does business, but of how it cares for its work force. At a time when the quality of a business is determined by the quality of its work force, we should pay far greater attention to fairness in pension funds. I hope that the Minister will give us good news. If nothing else, he should take our concerns back to the DTI and nail down the gross unfairness that we are debating.
</p>



<a name="41019h03_time4"><h5>2.51 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h03_spnew14"><b> Adam Price  (East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</b>  (PC): I congratulate the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on having secured the debate. He approached the issue in his typically forensic, measured and analytical way. I also congratulate him on the timing of the debate&#151;although, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) said, if one misses one pensions debate these days, there will always be another over the next week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para41">We have focused of late on the long-term pensions crisis, in the wake of the Turner review, so it is timely that this debate concerns not the ticking pensions time bomb but the crisis that is already with us. There have been some developments in recent months. The unions are suing the Government; the Lords are in Committee considering the Pensions Bill in a state of some   confusion about the Government&#039;s proposals; the   parliamentary ombudsman might be about to launch an inquiry, following complaints by 47 Members of Parliament&#151;including, I am led to believe, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions&#151;and there is even a criminal investigation by South Wales police. We cannot wait for all those inquiries to reach their conclusions. As we have heard from the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), the problem is ongoing for people in many constituencies. I shall accede to the Minister&#039;s request to keep my comments brief if he will agree to answer my questions, by return of post if not during the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para42">There is a link between the long-term debate and the   short-term crisis, and that is the issue of trust, as the hon. Member for Yeovil said. Public confidence in the pensions system has collapsed, largely because of   the myriad crises in occupational pension funds. In addressing the crisis, the Government have an opportunity to restore that confidence. I remember the debate in May when the Government announced the financial assistance scheme, to a chorus of halleluiahs from all over the House. Unfortunately, some of that good will, and the trust that was beginning to be restored by their acceptance of responsibility, has been frittered away by the Government in the subsequent 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 217WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
months. Presumably, that is why the union has taken the   action that it has, and why MPs have made an application to the ombudsman.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para43">One of the critical worries is the adequacy of the funds. Many independent commentators have come to the conclusion that there is not enough money to make adequate provision for those whose pensions have been stolen. Any figure that one cites is dwarfed by the &#163;5 million that the Chancellor still receives every year as a result of having removed the tax credit that pensions received on company dividends. Surely the Government can do more than they are doing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para44">As the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) said, in the context of the complaints and the concerns that have been raised about administrative fees, it is absurd that the Government are asking pension schemes&#151;which are suffering gaping holes in their provision and cannot pay some of their deferred pensioners&#151;to pick up the tab for filling in the Government&#039;s 11-page questionnaire. All that the Government have done is ask the administrators to keep charges to a minimum. No control has been put on that. The members of the schemes, who are the innocent parties, have to suffer for something that is the Government&#039;s responsibility. The Government decided to bring in the financial assistance scheme; surely they can see fit not to fritter away further the funds in the schemes. Some have already lost 10 or 15 per cent. of their available funds in fees. Surely the Government can do better than that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para45">The question of who will be covered has been raised. There is a lot of uncertainty. All that the Government tell us is that some people will be helped, somewhat, at some time. That is all we can say with any certainty. Surely we need to give some response to companies. People who belonged to schemes before April 1997&#151;10 per cent. of those identified in the Government&#039;s paper, which I think was released in June&#151;would not be covered. I cannot see any moral, legal or other argument for excluding those people, who are in exactly the same situation as the others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para46">The Government risk creating a new injustice and a new set of people who feel that they have been wronged first by their companies, then by successive Governments who&#151;unlike almost every other Government in the world&#151;did not put measures in place to protect them, and now by a financial assistance scheme that arbitrarily excludes them. The same applies to the so-called sandwich year of the company insolvency scheme for the 300 workers of the German paper company, Felix Schoeller. That company has turned its back on a &#163;12.5 million pension fund deficit, although its parent company made a reported profit of over &#163;100 million in the last year. How can the members of that scheme, who have done no wrong, be excluded?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para47">The company is to blame, and yes, the Government should be going after the company, but surely provision should be made for the members, and for those at Turner and Newall in Wales, and at the former Ferodo plant in Caernarfon, now Dynamex Friction. The workers there fought the longest-running industrial dispute in British history and now face the prospect, on top of that, of losing up to 70 per cent. of their pension fund. Surely the Government have to provide some support for those workers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para48">I would like the Minister to tell us whether there have been any changes to the timetable that he outlined in May, now that further work has to be done on the numbers until 12 November. Will that have any impact on the timetable? Will we still see the first payments in the spring? When will we get the affirmative procedure vote on the detailed regulations that we were promised, and will there be a debate as well as a vote?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para49">I agree with the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), whose idea of using unclaimed assets was taken up by the Opposition. I do not care where the money comes from so long as we find some for the people who, as the Minister acknowledges, believe that their pensions were stolen. Perhaps it is not such a bad idea that the South Wales police have launched an investigation. That money belonged to the scheme members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para50">The Government pride themselves on evidence-based policy making, but they announced an arbitrary figure before the work was done on eligible numbers. That does not make sense. They must revisit their cost assessment so that we can provide real security for all   those who are deserving and who have lost out, and   whom successive Governments have failed. The Government have an opportunity to restore confidence I hope they do not miss it.

<a name="41019h03_time5"><h5>3 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) not merely on securing this debate&#151;that seems an odd custom&#151;but on his wise choice to speak on behalf of his   constituents who have lost some of or all their occupational pension rights. I have struggled to come up with the right analogy, but the situation is rather like looking at a window pane in the winter when it starts to snow. Initially there is one flake of snow on the pane and then another until, suddenly, it is snowing heavily and the entire pane is covered. It is rather like that for hon. Members who become concerned about occupational pension schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para51">Most try not to know anything about such schemes, but we have all been dragged kicking and screaming into that arena, because in more and more constituencies more and more hon. Members who, for understandable reasons, have never looked into such matters are drawn in because constituents have lost their pensions. While listening to departmental questions we have the macabre sport of spotting new MPs raising for the first time issues that have been raised month after month as the problem continues to spread. My hon. Friend spoke up powerfully for his constituents who worked for Turner and Newall and Varta&#151;I am sure that I have bought its batteries in the past, but am not sure that I would have done if I had known what it has done. My hon. Friend raised some important issues, and I hope that the Minister will respond fully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para52">I shall touch on the four key points that my hon. Friend raised. He asked about pension contribution holidays. That may sound like a quaint throwback to some bygone era, but it would be interesting to know whether the Government have any plans to deal with pension fund surpluses if they re-emerge&#151;whether they remain of the view that surpluses should be capped or 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 219WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
whether there are plans for funds to build up healthy surpluses again, if the opportunity arises, to cushion funds against bad years and prevent a return to the rollercoaster.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para53">My hon. Friend referred to the role of trustees and asked whether, in his local case, they had kept the workers properly informed and whether there should have been more frequent valuations. We touched on those issues when discussing the Pensions Bill. The Government have put a new onus on trustees to understand pensions&#151;that is a novelty&#151;but I am not wholly convinced that they have put any onus on the trustees to ensure that scheme members are better informed. I hope that the Minister will respond on that point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para54">My hon. Friend also talked about the priority order of creditors when a company goes into receivership; the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) properly raised that important issue also. If the pension fund is at the bottom of the pile, many individuals lose out badly. One could understand why the banks, if they were at the bottom of the pile, might turn round and say that that increased their risk so they must charge more interest whenever they lend money to a company. Balances must be struck. I remember the priority order of creditors being raised in one of the endless stream of Green Papers that we have seen. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether the Government have rejected making any changes on that front.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para55">My hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil raised that most intractable set of issues raised by the question of what happens, in this increasingly global market, when a company that takes over another company is not based in the UK. It may be split off and there are liabilities hanging around from companies that no longer exist and so on. I hope that the Minister will do more than simply say that the matter is complicated. Can he offer us an assurance that any of our constituents who work for companies that are taken over by a foreign-owned parent company will enjoy the same pension rights protection that UK employees otherwise enjoy? Do British workers need to worry about their occupational pension rights if their company is taken over by an overseas employer? What will the impact be on their pension rights?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para56">I shall touch briefly on the financial assistance scheme and some detailed points that were made. We heard from my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Stroud about the sandwich year. The Minister&#039;s response to an intervention on the subject last week was that he could not really say what would happen; he was worried about moral hazard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para57">Will the Minister clarify what he meant? Is he worried that firms considering going into receivership might hasten to do so, knowing that the pension fund liability would be, to some extent, picked up? Does he think that that might be going on at the moment? Moral hazard has many dimensions. I wonder what bar there is on the Minister giving my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents&#151;as well as people from Lister-Petter and other companies&#151;some reassurance.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 220WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para58">We have had almost no information about how the financial assistance scheme will be run. The logic is that the financial assistance scheme would take over the assets of Lister-Petter, or whoever was involved, rather than converting them into poor-value annuities. Is that what will happen? Will the financial assistance scheme have assets acquired from the firms that have been wound up, topped up by the taxpayer? Who will run that? Will there be a new financial assistance board, or a quango or something similar? Surely the logical approach would be for the shadow pension protection fund to run it. It performs an almost identical function.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para59">It has been suggested to me, rather cynically&#151;obviously I reject the analysis&#151;that the Government have not said that the pension protection fund will run the financial assistance scheme because that might lead people to think that there was a connection between the two. I do not accept that cynical approach; I know the Minister to be a man of principle. I hope that he will reassure me that the taxpayers&#039; interests, and those of scheme members, will be best served by the PPF running the FAS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para60">Why will the FAS run for only 20 years? If I am 55 now, presumably I can expect to live another 25 or 30 years. What will happen when the money runs out? Why did the Government think that 20 lots of &#163;20 million was the right number? As the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) said, the Government are only now doing the research and asking the questions&#151;but they have already worked out the answer. Where is the evidence that the figure is adequate? We all know that it is not, and that the Government started with the answer and worked back to the question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para61">It was interesting to watch the Minister&#039;s facial expressions when the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr was asking why the Government do not bear the cost of obtaining the information. If I read those expressions correctly, a paraphrase of what he was saying from a sedentary position without moving his lips was, &quot;What do you   want? The Government are already putting in &#163;20 million and the members are benefiting from it, so they can lump it.&quot; I do not accept that analysis.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Pensions  (Malcolm Wicks) </b> : My experience of <i>Hansard</i> is that, although it is excellent in many ways, it is not good at facial expressions or irony.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. Before the hon. Gentleman resumes his seat, I assure hon. Members that the transcription of the debate is not even happening in this building, let alone taking account of facial expressions.

<p><a name="41019h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It has been suggested that it is regrettable that the written English language lacks a type-face known as ironic bold, which might have been appropriate just now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para62">The serious point is that the schemes in question, which already do not have enough money in them, have to bear a burden. The Minister gave a written answer on Thursday to a question from me about how many letters had been sent out&#151;he could not tell me&#151;and about the burden of the cost of supplying the information. He said that it would depend on

<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the extent to which those involved in administering the schemes are able to absorb any costs incurred&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para63">Why should they? They are profit-making organisations. Have the Government rung them up and said, &quot;Oh go on, don&#039;t charge us for this&quot;? What incentive do they have for not passing on the costs? Allied Steel and Wire was the classic case in which scheme administrators and independent trustees were charging &#163;100 to answer a phone call.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew18"><b> Adam Price </b> : Is not part of the problem the fact that there is no guarantee, once the cost has been borne, that the scheme will benefit? The letter that has been sent says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Neither the provision of the information, nor any subsequent contact from the DWP, is to be taken as an indication that a scheme or its members will be entitled to assistance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para64">The scheme bears the cost of providing the Government with the data, but there is no guarantee of any benefit.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : It would be particularly harsh to supply the information, thereby taking money out of the fund, and then find that the scheme was not covered in the first place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para65">In the written answer, the Minister continued:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Government is still seeking&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para68">Nudges, winks and encouragement. The cost to an individual scheme could be significant; the cost to the Government is negligible. Given that those workers&#151; those scheme members&#151;have suffered enough already, could the Government not have said, &quot;We will meet the costs of the extra information-gathering exercise&quot;? As the hon. Gentleman said, that exercise should feed into the scale of the financial assistance scheme, not the other way round.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para69">We could talk all day about those issues, but I hope that we receive some concrete answers from the Minister, first to the specific questions about pension scheme management that my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil quite properly raised, and secondly, about how and under whose auspices the financial assistance scheme will be run. There is no moral hazard in providing answers to those questions, and I hope that the Minister will do so as comprehensively as he can.
</p>



<a name="41019h03_time6"><h5>3.11 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Nigel Waterson  (Eastbourne)</b>  (Con): I will not take up the snowflake analogy of the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), although the Government are doing what the Americans call a &quot;snow job&quot; on pensioners and would-be pensioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para70">I congratulate the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) on securing the debate. As the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) pointed out, this is not exactly a rare opportunity to debate problems in pensions, but it is nice to have a period of calm 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 222WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
reflection in Westminster Hall after the frenetic activity last week, with a full day&#039;s debate, departmental questions and the Turner report to keep us busy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para71">It is worth stepping back from the frenetic discussions that we have weekly and sometimes two or three times a week about the purpose of Government policy. In a sentence, it should be to reinvest pensions with the confidence of different groups of the British public. People saving for their retirement in company schemes want some reassurance, which I guess is supposed to be the role of the pension protection fund. There is also the vast raft of young people who are simply not interested in pensions, whom the hon. Member for Yeovil touched on. They are turned off by the whole idea of pensions and must be encouraged to take an interest again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para72">The other part to reinvesting pensions with public confidence is to demonstrate to those groups that we are treating as fairly as possible those people who have already got into difficulties through no fault of their own&#151;the people at Turner and Newall in Ilminster and the constituents of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew). I add my warm welcome to the news that the Turner and Newall problem is apparently on its way to being solved, but I am sure that there are still some loose ends to tie up. I recently met a delegation from Derbyshire, where there is a high concentration of Turner and Newall employees, and they were extremely concerned about the future. However, it seems&#151;fingers crossed&#151;that a solution might have been found, so that the scheme can continue on a properly funded basis. That is excellent news.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para73">That brings us to what Baroness Hollis of Heigham has called the sandwich year, or, as it has been called more accurately, the gap year in help for people who have lost all or a large part of their pension rights. The financial assistance scheme was met with a chorus of welcome and approval from many quarters. We were sceptical and have become more sceptical, but many groups that have worked and lobbied hard were on the face of it pleased with the announcement. As more detail has oozed&#151;the only word that covers my point&#151;out about the likely parameters of and exclusions from the scheme, that enthusiasm has rapidly evaporated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para74">The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr said that the &#163;400 million figure was arbitrary. I do not believe that anyone could argue with that. I have yet to hear Ministers even try to explain where the figure came from, but one thing that everyone seems to agree about is that it is not nearly enough to deal with the potential problems, let alone the additional problems that may arise between now and the PPF&#039;s coming into effect, subject to an issue that I shall deal with in a moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para75">It is alarming that successive attempts by many right hon. and hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Northavon and me, to extract more detail from Ministers have met with almost complete stonewalling. As has been explained, the main reason put forward for    not vouchsafing the details is moral hazard. Perhaps one can understand that. The Turner and Newall situation was vast, potentially affecting some 40,000 people and involving a shortfall&#151;at least on paper&#151;of nearly &#163;900 million. That in itself was a reason for Ministers to be cautious. It is certainly the reason that Ministers have clung to in the recent past, but let us hope and expect that the good news is indeed good news, that Turner and Newall&#039;s problems will be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 223WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
manageable and that that particular problem will disappear from Ministers&#039; desks&#151;in which case, what other good reason is there for not giving us the details?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para76">As I pointed out in the debate last week, it is now five months since the FAS was announced&#151;in a bit of a flurry, I must say. I asked the Minister a series of questions. Sadly, he seemed unable to answer them then, so I shall repeat them now. I intend to keep repeating them in the hope that eventually he might give me the answers or even come up with the immortal words, &quot;I will write to the hon. Member.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para77">When does the Minister expect the first payment to be made? My suspicion is that it will be after spring next year, which is a date that may have some significance. Will victims of solvent wind-ups be included? Apparently, the answer is no. What is to happen about the Baroness&#039;s sandwich year? Is it really the case that a decision has been made that any wind-ups that start between May this year and April next year will not come within the FAS and, by definition, within the PPF? Will the payments be means-tested? Will they be taxed? Can the Minister report any progress in extracting voluntary contributions from industry, or the industry? Will he reconsider a bit more seriously our proposal to top up the &#163;400 million&#151;inevitably, it will have to be topped up&#151;by using unclaimed assets?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para78">It is clear that there could be a very large gap. In trying to recreate confidence in pensions, it is no good at all if Ministers are not prepared to be totally frank about such matters, particularly if a specific reason for not being so appears to have been removed from the scene.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para79">Although the action of the steel union caused some procedural difficulties with the ombudsman&#039;s inquiry, it   was not wholly unexpected. Apparently, the union looked closely at the FAS and what was on offer and was distinctly unimpressed. Some 200 cases have been referred by hon. Members to the ombudsman. I very much hope for and would urge an early decision by the ombudsman to make it clear that there will be an investigation of maladministration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para80">Let me touch briefly on one other issue. Again, it relates to confidence. It looks to the Pensions Bill, which this House will have the pleasure of receiving back from the other place probably just before we finish this Session, and the nature of the guarantee. I have made this point before, but it bears repeating. Hon. Members and Ministers must not oversell what is being offered in that Bill. The US model on which it is based, the Pensions Benefit Guaranty Corporation, gives a total guarantee that someone whose pension fund goes pear-shaped will get the amount to which they would have been entitled. However, we know from the detail in the Bill that that is not what is on offer in this country: the fund does not have Government backing; there is a cap on individual payments; there is only 90 per cent. for those who are still working when the problem arises; the Government are changing the rules on indexation; and, of course, as has not been lost on the newly appointed chairman of the PPF, there is a clear power to cut benefits if the funds are not available. In the interests of confidence, it is important either that some such things are changed&#151;who knows what may happen in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 224WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
debates in the House of Lords&#151;or that we are open and honest with people about the fact that the scheme is not a guarantee and is not a complete lifeboat.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para81">I return to the points made by the hon. Member for Yeovil. If any kind of confidence in the pension system is to be rebuilt, it is desperately important that we start to get clear details about the FAS, such as how it will be administered and by whom; how the payment of claims will be approached; how many pence in the pound people are likely to get; and when payments will start to come through. We also need answers to the other questions that I have raised again today. I promise the Minister that I will keep raising those questions until we get some answers.
</p>



<a name="41019h03_time7"><h5>3.21 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h03_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Pensions  (Malcolm Wicks) </b> : The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) introduced the debate in a measured and analytical way, and I thank him for setting the tone. I also enjoyed the challenges in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), and the contribution of the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price). As ever, the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) made a valuable contribution. Among Liberal Democrat pension snowflakes, he is primus inter pares. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) also made a challenging contribution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para82">I think we are all agreed that a crucial challenge for the Government, and Parliament, is to restore confidence and security in the pension system. Certain factors are largely out of our control, an obvious example being the huge decline in world share prices. Whenever it seems legitimate for the Government to intervene to introduce, or reintroduce, security and confidence, we must debate how to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para83">Although it is tempting to do so, this is not the occasion on which to re-debate the whole Pensions Bill. We have had opportunities to do that, and we will have further opportunities to do so, but I will try to touch on the more urgent issues that have been raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para84">We have all met workers who have been adversely affected by the collapse of their companies and the terrible realisation that their pension dreams seem to have been shattered. Although I resist the vogue to call every issue and challenge a crisis, there is a real crisis for those groups of workers, which needs to be addressed. Part of the answer lies with the Pensions Bill and the establishment of the pension protection fund, which will come into force in April 2005&#151;subject to the   will of Parliament. The fund will ensure that compensation will be available for members of UK-based schemes whose companies go bust, leaving pension schemes underfunded. More than 10 million scheme members will benefit from the security of the new fund.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para85">We also believe, as do more far-sighted business leaders, that business will benefit because the PPF will increase confidence in defined benefit schemes, and will increase their effectiveness as a recruitment and retention tool. The more successful we are in returning Britain to a land of full employment in which vacancies become the challenge rather than unemployment, the more people will ask serious questions about pension schemes at job interviews.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 225WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para86">If we learn the lessons from it properly, the Pensions Benefit Guaranty Corporation gives a reasonable guide to how we should establish the fund, although we have brought in flexibilities, in terms of the levy, that are not available to the US scheme. Questions of moral hazard mean that there will inevitably be some differences in treatment between groups and companies. We have taken the utmost care to minimise the effect of that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para87">By providing 90 per cent. compensation subject to PPF rules for members under the scheme&#039;s normal pension age, we will ensure that compensation remains meaningful, while incentivising key decision makers to keep their schemes outside the PPF. Regulations in force in advance of the PPF mean that the debt on a solvent employer whose scheme winds up underfunded is calculated on the basis that the scheme should be able to meet the full benefits that scheme members have accrued and expect to receive, as well as the full costs of winding-up. Trustees can use the regulations if their scheme started to wind up on or after 11 June 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para88">For schemes that start to wind up on or after 10 May this year, we have also amended the priority order to ensure that assets are shared more fairly between non-pensioner and pensioner scheme members. That has been achieved by moving pensioners&#039; future indexation down the priority order, after the accrued rights of non-pensioner members. That has a significant impact on the rights of non-pensioner scheme members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para89">Importantly, the new pensions regulator&#151;another feature of the Bill&#151;will build further security and confidence, providing an early warning system of possible problems in scheme administration, assisting in protecting members and helping to limit calls on the PPF. The regulator will build on the expertise and experience of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, but will be more flexible and more proactive. It will concentrate its efforts on schemes where it assesses that there is a high risk to members because of bad governance, poor administration or fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para90">We are making real and substantial reforms to protect scheme members for the future, but we acknowledge that the PPF will not help some members. We have not ignored them. Through the financial assistance scheme, we will offer help to people who have lost out on their final salary pension due to their scheme winding up underfunded. Our commitment&#151;at &#163;400 million of public money&#151;provides a sound basis, we would argue, for a worthwhile assistance scheme for those who face the most significant losses to their pension benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para91">The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr asked about the assistance scheme. Hon. Members will be aware that it is our duty to ensure that it is workable and affordable. It would be wrong for us rashly to announce details of the scheme without full and proper consideration. That would adversely affect those who have already been subjected to enough speculation and would be both unfair and misleading. We will not be pushed into making statements before the scheme has been fully formulated. It is a difficult and complex area of work, and we want to ensure that we get it right.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 226WH</b>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para92">Hon. Members, of course, have particular schemes on their minds that affect their constituents. I respect that, and there are some high-profile schemes. However, when I note that we have had to seek information from about 250 different company pension schemes, it might give hon. Members some idea of the scale of the challenge and the complexity of the task before us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para93">We can say that we are making progress. In May, I   gave a clear timetable for how the scheme would develop. We are sticking to that timetable. I understand why hon. Members ask, &quot;When will we hear?&quot; but I have set out the timetable and we are on track.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para94">As promised, a data report giving our initial estimate of people affected was laid before Parliament in June. We have been in discussion with stakeholders, trade unions, key representatives from business and the pensions industry, and scheme members affected. In addition, we have been advised by a group of pensions experts who have met us regularly over the summer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para95">The hon. Member for Northavon asked whether I   could give details about the nature of the scheme. I cannot yet. Our plan is to produce more details at the end of this year and to have the scheme in place by the spring, with payments being made as soon as possible thereafter. I have already stated those things, and that is the timetable to which we are working. By spring, we intend to have the legislative framework in place with a view to being able to make the payments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para96">I have been asked about the so-called gap year, and the hon. Member for Yeovil was particularly concerned about two schemes. Various people have mentioned Turner and Newall. As far as that situation is concerned, we understand that discussions are ongoing. It would be   wrong for me to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, or for us to assume that the scheme will wind up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para97">We are of course sympathetic to the Turner and Newall pension scheme members, who are left in great   uncertainty at present. I have met several hon. Members to discuss the scheme. We continue to monitor the situation closely and look forward to positive developments. Only last week, as has been noted, I was pleased to hear about further progress&#151;namely, the new offer from US investors, which is being considered by the administrator and trustees of the scheme. We hope that the company will meet its obligations to the employees and achieve a beneficial outcome for all parties concerned. However, the recent developments support our view that, until those discussions are complete, it would be wholly inappropriate for any of us to draw conclusions about the future of the schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para98">The hon. Member for Yeovil mentioned another scheme and promised to write to me about it. I will respond to that, which is the appropriate way to deal with a scheme that I am not knowledgeable about at this moment.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew21"><b> Mr. Laws </b> : Leaving aside the Turner and Newall scheme, does the Minister agree that it would be wholly unfair if a group of individuals fell between the two forms of compensation and protection that the

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government are putting in place and therefore received no compensation at all? How would he justify that to the affected individuals?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew22"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> : As I have noted, schemes winding up after 10 May 2004 will be helped by the changes to the priority order. However, I do not want to exaggerate the proportion of support that that brings; it is not the whole answer. We have said before that, for that year, we have not ruled out support from the financial assistance scheme, and of course we are sympathetic. We are closely monitoring the situation as it develops for that one-year period.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew23"><b> Mr. Webb </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h03_spnew24"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> : May I carry on?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para99">We need to take moral hazard seriously. For wholly British companies and companies that are foreign owned and that have a complexity of ownership because of globalisation, we must be careful that we do not say things too rashly that might encourage companies to dump their pension liabilities on the British taxpayer. They as companies should be responsible. That is what I mean by moral hazard in this situation. We must all be careful of how we speak about the issue to avoid such difficulty. There is also an implication not only for the financial assistance scheme but for the PPF as we approach the April period, when it might be difficult, or require some analysis, to determine whether the FAS or PPF might be liable for one scheme or another. There is complexity to the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h03_para100">I use the word &quot;sympathy&quot; but I realise that sympathy butters no scones. However, when we have talked about our sympathy, we have followed it up with action&#151;with the PPF and the FAS. I am concerned about, and sympathetic to, those who will fall in that year. I hope that the hon. Member for Yeovil understands my meaning.

<a name="41019h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Primary Schools (Stevenage)</h3>

<a name="41019h04_time0"><h5>3.33 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h04_spnew0"><b> Barbara Follett  (Stevenage)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have this opportunity to air a subject that is causing my constituents and me a great deal of distress and, if plans go through, is likely to cause us even more. I am here to ask the Minister to listen to our problem and to do all that he can to persuade Hertfordshire county council to rerun its recent review and consultation on primary provision in Stevenage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para0">I shall try to give the background to the problem, discuss Hertfordshire&#039;s solution and then say what we in Stevenage would like to be done. Historically, Stevenage has had a large number of surplus primary school places. That has been true for almost a decade, and at present there are 1,590 surplus places, or nine and a half forms of entry. This is both a problem and an opportunity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para1">I was glad when, this January, Hertfordshire county council decided to address the problem by holding a review of the surplus primary school places. I was even gladder when, in a speech to the school governors and head teachers concerned, the county council officials said that the review would be transparent and clear, and that they would publish the 11 criteria on which they had based their decisions. We heard nothing at all from January until late May, however, and only a strong rumour at the beginning of June that the county council would indeed publish its review, but that the review was delayed because of the postponement of the local elections until 10 June.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para2">I assumed, as did many head teachers, teachers and parents, that the review would be published in September and that the consultation would end around Christmas. Hon. Members may imagine my surprise when, on 21 June, we were sent the review and discovered that the consultation period was just under nine and three quarter weeks, and that it was due to start in the few hectic weeks before the schools closed for the summer holidays and end on 31 August. In other words, it was perfectly timed to fit two thirds of it into the school holidays.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para3">When consulting on the closure of six primary schools, people do not usually allow such a small window of opportunity or hold the consultation in the holidays. Not surprisingly, the parents, many of whom are here today, were deeply suspicious of the county council&#039;s motives. I do not know whether it was carelessness or whether it was contrived, but whatever it was, the timetable has been most inconvenient and difficult.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para4">The summer holidays are traditionally a time when we all forget about things such as politics, primary provision and schools, go away and sit on a beach or walk in the hills&#151;but local parents did not do that this summer. Instead, they spent their time organising. I   have in my hand a petition of 8,000 signatures of parents in Stevenage who are against the county council&#039;s proposals, and I shall present it to the House of Commons later this week. The parents also ensured that the county council received a record number of response forms; one county official told me that the council had received 100 per cent. more than usual. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 229WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
More than 3,000 response forms were returned to the county council, of which 97.3 per cent. were from people who were against the council&#039;s proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para5">What were the proposals that caused so much consternation? As I said, Stevenage has a long-standing problem with surplus primary school places, particularly in the southern end of the town, in which the population is ageing and where, because of housing inflexibilities, we have been unable to build the sort of housing that would allow older people to move out of their large houses into smaller ones. Numbers in the schools were therefore going down. The review dealt with two schools in the centre of Stevenage and four in the south of the town.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para6">One usually expects reviews to list the options considered, and the reasons why some are good and some bad. One also expects stakeholders to be given a choice. The people of central Stevenage were the lucky ones: they were given exactly one choice. They were told that one school in the centre of the town, either Pin Green or Bedwell, would have to close, and that was it. There was nothing else. No other solutions&#151;believe you me, there are many&#151;were considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para7">As I said, the people of central Stevenage turned out to be the lucky ones, because the review said quite baldly that in the south of Stevenage it could not possibly recommend anything else but the merger of four schools to create a primary school that is very large for Hertfordshire. Hertfordshire&#039;s 20 most successful schools have no more than 300 pupils, and its largest primary school has 560 pupils. The school proposed for the south of Stevenage would have to have 842 pupils, which is a lot. There are only about seven schools in the whole country that are that large&#151;I know that the Minister happens to have one of them in his own constituency. However, I would point out to him that there are special circumstances in Stevenage, involving a history of very low achievement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para8">Parents, local politicians and I found it deeply insulting that the review document was entitled, &quot;Raising Standards in Stevenage&quot;. Over the years&#151;certainly over the 10 years that I have been living in Stevenage&#151;standards have been very low. They are the lowest in Hertfordshire. When I moved to the town in 1995, I was shocked to find that only one third of children who left school at 11 to go to secondary school could read. Is it surprising that those children did not do well in their GCSEs, or that they did not go on to A-levels or university? Is it surprising that in 1995 there was 11 per cent. youth unemployment in the town? Much of it was caused by the fact that the youths were unemployable because they were illiterate. Remember: only one third of the children could read at the age of 11.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para9">Since 1997 that situation has been reversed and now about 80 per cent. of children who leave primary school can read at the age of 11 and are fit for secondary school. Standards have been raised, particularly in the primary area. However, until then almost nothing had been done, except by Stevenage borough council, which is very good. It is the only Labour-held district council in the east of England and it ran the Raise project, which helped to raise academic achievement, but which had to stop because Hertfordshire county council would not go on funding it. That is the commitment that the county 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 230WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
council has to raising achievement and that is why we were so insulted when it produced the review under that title. At least it could have spared us that insult.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para10">What has happened since then? The parents got their responses in and the county council held an education panel meeting at which it very narrowly voted through the proposals for the centre of Stevenage. It agreed to issue the statutory notices to close Pin Green school and decided in principle to proceed with the merger of the four schools in southern Stevenage, but it realised that it had not convinced the parents so it decided to have &quot;more discussions&quot; with them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para11">That is not what the parents want, or what I want. We want the consultation to be rerun, because we believe that it was deeply flawed. We have gone into the matter in great detail, using the council&#039;s own standards, which it helpfully published on its website. The introduction to the standards says that there is no point in consulting unless the county council is prepared to change its mind. It has demonstrated no such preparedness. In fact, in the face of 97.3 per cent. of the people being against the proposals, it has gone ahead with just a pause in the proceedings, not a rerun.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para12">We feel that that is undemocratic, and many of my constituents have lost faith in the whole process of democracy. They cannot understand how we are so powerless that we can secure only the tiny victory of a   stay of execution. I have letters from 241 parents asking me to refer the matter to the local government ombudsman, and I shall do so. If that fails, I shall submit the case for judicial review, because the council did not adhere to its own standards. One of those standards specifies a 12-week consultation when dealing with voluntary bodies such as parent-teacher associations and governing bodies. Only nine and a half weeks was allowed for consultation, but that was during the holidays, and yet another standard says that the holidays should have been taken into account. In this case, if the holidays were taken into account at all, that could only have been part of an attempt to railroad the closure through. I hope that that is not the case, but I fear that it might be.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para13">The element of consultation is giving people a choice&#151;[interruption] pardon me for sniffing, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I always get a cold when I have an Adjournment debate.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : I know exactly how the hon. Lady feels. I have one myself.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h04_spnew2"><b> Barbara Follett </b> : You have my sympathy, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para14">At no stage were people consulted on whether they wanted a school of the proposed size. At their January meeting, the heads and governors were told that the model for change throughout the town would be a two-form entry school. That could have worked quite well. I shall not bore the House with the many permutations that might have been satisfactory to parents and which would have prevented the logjam of traffic that we shall get if the new school uses the two ancient asbestos-ridden sets of buildings on the Long Meadow site. It is not proposed to provide new accommodation. Instead, we will have to use buildings erected in the 1950s and 1960s that have asbestos in them, and they will have to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 231WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
be bodged together into one big primary school. That is simply not on. There will also have to be mixed-age classes; again, that is simply not on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para15">Parents feel that this was sprung on them, and they were surprised. They were called to public meetings. I did not attend them, but parents have told me that they   were among the worst run meetings they have attended. They did not have the chance to speak. The meetings were totally chaotic. Parents were bombarded with statistics by county officers, who were plainly nervous&#151;and many of the statistics were wrong. The   officers included Graveley school, which is in north   Hertfordshire, not in Stevenage, in the list of schools; that raised the average achievement levels, which is simply sloppy. In some of their demographic projections&#151;probably because the county council is in collective denial about future developments&#151;officers ignored the additional housing that will probably be built to the west of Stevenage. They ignored the big demographic changes in the area that will see the ageing population shift from the south of the town.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para16">Officers also made it clear to parents at the consultation meeting that if they kept their children at Pin Green school, which was threatened with closure, they would not be guaranteed suitable places for their children in September 2005, nor would any attempt be made to put the children in schools with their siblings or friends. That was not quite coercion, but it was certainly powerful persuasion. Not unnaturally, the parents moved their children, which allowed one of the county council officials to say at the education panel meeting, &quot;Well, Pin Green school effectively closed itself.&quot; No, it did not. The county council slowly throttled it to death. They began the throttling process last year when they told the governors of Pin Green school not to appoint a head until the review had been completed. That marked it down as a finished school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para17">The parents and I are asking the county council for the consultation to be rerun on democratic lines&#151;for people to be consulted, for a consensus to be arrived at and eventually for us to be properly consulted on several proper options. That is even more important because the bodged review and consultation dealt not with the entire problem, which involves nine and a half forms of entry, but with only three and a half forms. That means that we shall soon need another review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para18">The Stevenage heads wrote to me and to county hall&#151;I have copied the letter to the Secretary of State&#151;expressing their total dismay at how the process was conducted. The county council knew of the problem. Instead of making it into a plus, and seeing it as a way to use the surplus places to raise achievement in a town that has historically had low achievement, it missed the opportunity. I am here today to ask my hon. Friend to try to persuade the council to do otherwise. Hertfordshire has ignored Stevenage for too long. About 1,000 children are involved and we want our parents to have a say in how their children are educated, now and in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : For the sake of clarity following the Division in the House, the way in which the Standing Order works means that this debate will now have to close by 4.3 pm.

<p><a name="41019h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Mr. Stephen Twigg) </b> : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para19">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett) on securing this debate and on her tireless work in campaigning on behalf of her constituency for higher educational standards. That is reflected in her work in securing this debate and in the petition that she said that she will present in the presence of a number of parents and governors from Stevenage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para20">My hon. Friend&#039;s commitment to raising standards in education matches the Government&#039;s commitment. As she said, the county council has stated in respect of its aims for the review that it wishes to raise achievement in Stevenage. I am well aware of the great interest and concern that people living in Stevenage have shown in respect of the review of primary school provision in the centre and south of the town. I appreciate the anxieties that are involved when school closures and reorganisations are considered. My hon. Friend made the important point that falling rolls can provide not only a problem, but an opportunity. That is a good starting point and I hope that today&#039;s debate will enable the strength of local feeling and parental concern about the issue to be placed firmly on the record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para21">I reassure my hon. Friend and her constituents that we believe that we have good arrangements in place for taking forward any significant changes that follow the review that Hertfordshire has undertaken. That is to ensure that the concerns of her constituents, which she    has expressed so clearly today, are given due consideration. I must make it clear from the outset that any decision on reorganising school provision as a result of such a review will not be taken by me or my ministerial colleagues. The decision will be made locally, as it would be anywhere else, by the local education authority. Such decisions were devolved to local level in September 1999, because they are best decided locally, where the full range of factors and issues can be considered in context. That view not only is held by the Government, but has widespread agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para22">Each local education authority is responsible for looking at the needs of its area and ensuring that there are sufficient school places. That responsibility involves the need to balance the supply of places, to ensure that schools serve the needs of their local communities and to provide good-quality education in a cost-effective way. Often, with population changes over the years, there will be an imbalance or a need for new provision. Local education authorities can propose changes. When the proposed changes are significant, as is the case in Stevenage, a number of stages must be gone through before the changes can be implemented. There are safeguards involved in that process to ensure that changes are made in an open, democratic way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para23">The first stage is consultation, with all interested parties being consulted before formal proposals are published. The local education authority has a duty to   allow adequate time and must provide sufficient information to those involved. The second stage is publication. If the outcome of consultation is a decision to proceed, a formal notice detailing proposals must be published widely, including in a local newspaper and at 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 233WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the main entrances of the schools that are named in the proposals. People usually have a minimum of six weeks in which to submit their representations in support of or against proposals. An LEA may make the final decision on proposals that it has published only if there have been no objections. In all other cases, the proposals must be passed to the local school organisation committee. If that committee cannot reach a unanimous decision, the proposals must be passed to the independent schools adjudicator for a final decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para24">On consultation, and on the concerns that have been raised by my hon. Friend in respect of Hertfordshire&#039;s handling of the review of primary provision in Stevenage, the Department does not specify precise arrangements, such as a timetable to be followed, or how options should be set out. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that LEAs have statutory responsibility for school place planning. Therefore, in the first instance, it is for them to consider options, taking into account specific local circumstances and their judgment as to the feasibility of a range of options.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para25">We allow maximum flexibility, so that consultation can be tailored to local needs. Nevertheless, our guidance on school organisation arrangements makes it clear that the formal consultation prior to any publication must set out what is proposed in such a way that those affected understand what is involved and how they can make their views known. Furthermore, if proposals are to be taken up following consultation, the school organisation committee must consider whether the consultation undertaken was adequate before accepting formal proposals for consideration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para26">Of course, the arrangements for the work of school organisation committees fall under the jurisdiction of the local government ombudsman, who can investigate complaints of maladministration. I note my hon. Friend&#039;s plans to refer this case to the ombudsman. Beyond the ombudsman, there is the option to go to court and to seek judicial review. My hon. Friend has placed on record the possibility that that route will be used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para27">I understand that, while Hertfordshire county council has decided to revisit options for the south of Stevenage, it has also been decided to proceed with plans for the centre, in particular to close Pin Green primary school and nursery. To proceed, the LEA will need to move to the second step of the process I described earlier&#151;to publish formal proposals. That will give all interested parties the opportunity to raise further, formal objections. If that happens, those will have to be considered by the local school organisation committee before a final decision to close the school can be made.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 234WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para28">It is important to understand that the school organisation committee operates independently of the LEA. It represents the main education stakeholders in   the area and consists of five or six groups, each having one vote on each proposal&#151;there is an LEA representative, one each from the Church of England and Roman Catholic dioceses and the learning and skills   council, and a schools group representing school governors and head teachers. In deciding on proposals, the school organisation committee takes into account their effect on educational standards, as well as their contribution to school improvement, and the need for places in the area and any financial implications, alongside the views of interested parties, including parents and the wider community, to which my hon. Friend has given voice today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para29">My hon. Friend has raised the issue of the possible outcome of the process in terms of the size of a planned new primary school. In our guidance, of which account must be taken, we make it clear that there should be no blanket assumption that a certain size of school is good or bad. She referred to an example in Enfield, in my constituency&#151;Wilbury school, which has 900 pupils. It is one of the largest schools in the country. Clearly, the school that is being considered in her constituency, with 842 pupils, would come into the same category. There is no firm evidence one way or the other as to whether bigger or smaller schools can be considered better. We have many examples of schools that do well and happen to be very large, and others, also doing well, that are very small. We believe that those matters are best decided locally by those who know the area best. That is clearly the issue of contention that will move forward following today&#039;s debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para30">We believe that decisions on changes to education provision in an area are best taken in that local area. Only then can everything be considered in its full context. We believe that the arrangements that have been made allow that and work well. I nevertheless appreciate the real concerns that my hon. Friend and her constituents have expressed about primary education in Stevenage, and, in particular, about the handing of consultation on the review. I am convinced that there are safeguards and that arrangements for the remainder of the process should ensure an outcome that will best serve the interests of everyone&#151;higher standards for the pupils of Stevenage, for which my hon. Friend argued powerfully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h04_para31">I thank my hon. Friend for placing the concerns of her constituents, and parents in particular, on the record. On behalf of the Department, I express the hope that a full process will be followed through, enabling everyone concerned with the education of children and young people in Stevenage to have their say, and have their say respected.

<a name="41019h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Pensions Scheme (Federal-Mogul)</h3>

<a name="41019h05_time0"><h5>4.1 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h05_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Alice Mahon  (Halifax)</b>  (Lab): I beg your indulgence, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I would like to allow one or two of my hon. Friends to intervene on my speech as there is huge interest in what has happened to our constituents in connection with the pension scheme in question. Since I asked for this debate on behalf of my constituents who work or have worked for Federal-Mogul on the Bradford site, there has been some hopeful news and a rescue package could be on the cards. Nevertheless, it is important to debate the issues and the lead-up to the crisis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para0">The Minister will be aware of the Federal-Mogul pension crisis faced by 40,000 people in the UK, but the situation at the Bradford plant is, I believe, unique: the workers are to be made redundant as well. The plant is closing and work is being transferred to plants in Poland and Turkey, no doubt to take advantage of lower wages.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew1"><b> Diana Organ  (Forest of Dean)</b>  (Lab): As my hon. Friend will be aware, the situation affecting her constituents in Bradford also affects my constituents in Lydney, where the closure of No. 1 foundry means job losses for 130 of 330 employees. I am sure that her concern, like mine, is for what happens to people who are made redundant now, in the midst of the corporate chaos over the pension scheme for deferred members.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew2"><b> Mrs. Mahon </b> : We certainly share the same concerns, and we both have to face workers who are in despair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para1">I stress that although the employees of Federal-Mogul deserve the sympathy, help and support of us all, and I include the Government in that, I am firmly of the view that Federal-Mogul must foot the bill for the pensions. It is an asset-rich company, and it now looks as if the administrator and its pension fund trustee may make an offer. We all hope that a happy resolution can be achieved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para2">The problem started when the former employees of Turner and Newall and their unions were told that no money was available to fund their pension scheme, because the parent company in the United States faced insolvency. There were worrying aspects to the lead-up to the situation, as the company had chosen to take 15 of the past 18 years as contribution holidays, with Federal-Mogul responsible for three of the past five years. They were allowed to do that because the law in this country is inadequate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para3">In a very good emergency resolution at the TUC conference on 14 September, the seriousness of the situation was recognised and Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union outlined the situation facing workers. I think it is worth quoting a little from that resolution, which was passed unanimously. It says:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Congress recognised that whilst American workers in the same company are protected by an insurance scheme, workers in the UK, until April . . . are not. Congress supports the joint unions in asking the Government to investigate and if necessary intervene to

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>bring about a successful resolution to the issue. Joint unions also believe that the inadequate insolvency law should be made stronger to protect workers and pensions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para4">That is what I want to talk about.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Marsha Singh  (Bradford, West)</b>  (Lab): My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) and the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), met the workers at Federal-Mogul in Bradford and were concerned about their dilemma and worries. Is it not time for the Government to act to protect workers&#039; rights and pension rights, not just for the Federal-Mogul workers but for workers throughout the UK?
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Mahon </b> : Hear, hear; I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. That is why, although there might be a rescue for that particular pension scheme and although I know that the Government are undertaking a pension review and considering all aspects of the matter, I urge them to concentrate on that particular idea.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para5">Since the TUC, events have moved on. All parties&#151;the joint trade unions, the independent trustee, the administrator and the company&#151;have been meeting to try to resolve the crisis. Hopes were raised when the company admitted that it had a moral and, indeed, a legal obligation to the workers. However, workers remained deeply concerned for many months because rumours persistently circulated that the company would not put in sufficient funds to honour the pensions commitment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para6">I have had a heartbreaking correspondence with constituents, particularly with someone whose retirement looked uncertain, and with a man who was 24 hours from being made redundant with his full pension rights, only to be told that he might have lost those rights. It was devastating, and when I met the workers&#151;I, too, met them, as did my hon. Friends the Members for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) and for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)&#151;some were in despair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para7">However, a news item that offers hope appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 14 October. The article, headlined &quot;Hopes Rise for T and N pension rescue&quot;, says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Hopes of a rescue for some or all of the pensions of the 40,000 former and current employees of T and N, the car parts company in administration, have been raised by an 11th hour offer by Carl Icahn, the US investor. Terms of the offer were received by T and N&#039;s administrator and its pension fund trustee last night.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para8">So, it looks as if an acceptable offer might be on the way. If that is the case, I am pleased.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew5"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson  (Coventry, North-West)</b>  (Lab): Is my hon. Friend aware that we have just come from a meeting where, I am pleased to say, the administrator and the trustee spoke robustly in defence of British interests, which are also before the court this week? Indeed, it seems that the clock will go right back to when chapter 11 was invoked and that despite all that has happened in between&#151;even redundancies now being discussed in the constituency of one of our 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 237WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
other   hon. Friends&#151;arrangements will be honoured in   full as though the receivership or chapter 11 had never happened. One question, involving &#163;80 million, is outstanding. In the context of what we face, that is a relatively small sum, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will join me in urging the American side to get over that last hurdle and fund the full amount.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Mahon </b> : Absolutely. There are things that need to be ironed out, but we have reason for hope. I agree with my hon. Friend that the amount left is small compared with the massive amount on the table. That offer is clearly welcome and we all hope for a positive conclusion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para9">However, I want to move on because it is clear that the Government action in making pension schemes more secure has been welcomed by us all. We were all incredibly relieved when the Government took action, albeit with private pension schemes, but more needs to be done. From talking to my constituents, it seems to me that Federal-Mogul could have walked away from its   responsibilities to those workers, despite the fact that it was clearly responsible. That is why I urge the Government to act. The workers, the unions and everyone involved have been magnificent in their fightback. They have been on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, and people with no experience of the media whatever have taken up the cudgels and fought. I know that my hon. Friend has formed a little group of Members here with interests in this matter and we have tried our best to highlight what would be a great injustice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para10">The Government must tighten the law to ensure that this does not happen again. Imagine people working for 20 or 30 years thinking that they have paid in to secure their future and looking forward to some kind of retirement&#151;pension schemes are deferred wages, when all is said and done; they are what we have earned&#151;only to be told, 24 hours from being made redundant or retiring, that their pension schemes are up for grabs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para11">I congratulate the Government, because the proposed pension protection fund legislation due to come into force in April 2005 represents possibly the first time that any Government have done anything like that in this country. That is to be welcomed because we are relieving a great many people from anxiety, but I would like to see the law made retrospective. I know that it is good that we shall have the fund, but I would like the Government to think again and make it retrospective, because there is a huge welter of misery out there among people who have been caught up in such cases. If the scheme had collapsed, another 40,000 workers would have been added to the 65,000 who are already seeking a share of the pension protection fund. That is why the pension protection fund should be made retrospective.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew7"><b> Mr. Terry Rooney  (Bradford, North)</b>  (Lab): The pension protection fund will be there only when schemes fail. The objective must be to stop schemes failing. Two lessons have come out of all the collapses of the past couple of years. One is that the minimum funding requirement calculation has been woefully inadequate, whether that is because of the legislation, the auditors or the actuaries. The other concerns the Treasury rule 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 238WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that   says where a scheme is more than 105 per cent. funded, the employer has to take a pension holiday. If that 105 per cent. is based on too low a valuation in the first place, a problem is created. Those factors need sorting out to prevent similar situations in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew8"><b> Mrs. Mahon </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening, because he is a bit of an expert on pensions and benefits, and we need that expertise. I am grateful that he spelt the matter out so clearly. The firm has also been responsible for other things, not least the very bad health of its employees due to asbestos, and so on.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew9"><b> Mr. Michael Clapham  (Barnsley, West and Penistone)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to hear that there may be a positive outcome to the pensions issue, but my hon. Friend will be aware that many pensioners are also victims of exposure to asbestos. They were facing a horrendous double whammy, but it now appears that all that needs to be sorted out is the compensation for exposure to asbestos. I am advised by the administrator that the people who have been exposed to asbestos by Turner and Newall may receive in compensation only a small proportion of the full value of their claims.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew10"><b> Mrs. Mahon </b> : That is tragic. I know that my hon. Friend has done years of work in this area. He deserves all our thanks for what he has done and how he has exposed such a dreadful abuse of workers.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew11"><b> Tom Levitt  (High Peak)</b>  (Lab): I hear what my hon. Friend says, and I am sympathetic to what she says about the pension protection fund, but does she agree that on this occasion it has been right not to look for ways for the Government to bail out the company, so as to ensure that it lives up to its responsibilities? The changes that we have seen during the past few days are clear evidence that that pressure has been working.
</p>




<p><a name="41019h05_spnew12"><b> Mrs. Mahon </b> : Oh yes, I made it absolutely clear at the start of the debate that the firm has the responsibility. It is an asset-rich company and can afford it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para12">It is good, for now, that the workers of Federal-Mogul have some kind of happy solution, but I urge the Minister to draw on that experience and feed it into the pensions review. We must ensure that our laws protect workers, so that they can have decent security in their retirement. They have worked hard for it and they deserve it.
</p>



<a name="41019h05_time1"><h5>4.16 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41019h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Work  (Jane Kennedy) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) on securing a debate on this important topic, which is of relevance to us all. Her generosity in allowing colleagues to comment was a model of how such short debates can be used, especially as people throughout the country are affected by the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para13">As my hon. Friend will appreciate, I am not the Minister for Pensions, so I shall tread carefully. He apologises for not being able to attend. However, he participated in an earlier debate and I shall draw my hon. Friend&#039;s attention to his comments a little later.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 239WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para14">Many hon. Members will have constituents who have been affected by the winding-up of underfunded pension schemes such as the one that we are considering. Most of my comments will be general because of the nature of the company&#039;s position. Indeed, legal proceedings have been started and detailed negotiations are continuing as   we speak. Many of us have met people who have   suffered such devastating losses. We agree that everything that can be done should be done to help to ensure that Turner and Newall workers do not find themselves in that position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para15">We are all aware of the difficult situation faced by members of pension schemes that wind up underfunded and without enough money to secure in full the benefits that people may have accrued over a working life. I empathise with all members of pension schemes who do not receive the benefits that they were expecting&#151;and with their families, who are also affected by such circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para16">The Government appreciate the concerns that many people have about their occupational pension schemes. That is why we have taken action in the Pensions Bill, to which my hon. Friend referred, to prevent people ever again having to suffer the injustice of paying into a pension fund for a lifetime only to find that their pension cannot be paid in full, or even at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para17">As I said, negotiations are still ongoing at Turner and Newall. We heard that a meeting upstairs between the chief executive of Federal-Mogul and representatives of the company and its employees will be listening carefully to what is said in this debate. The Minister for Pensions spoke in an earlier debate. Hon. Members and others listening to the debate may want to read the record of that debate to see what he said on the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para18">It would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, or for us to assume that the scheme will wind up. We are sympathetic to the position of members of the Turner and Newall pension scheme, who are left in great uncertainty at present, but we continue to monitor the situation closely and look forward to positive developments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para19">Only last week, I was pleased to read in the press about further progress&#151;namely, the new offer from US investors that is being considered by the administrator and trustees of the pension scheme. We hope that the company will meet its obligations to the employees and achieve a beneficial outcome for all parties. However, the recent developments support our view that it would be wholly inappropriate for any of us to draw conclusions about the future of the schemes until the discussions are complete.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para20">The Government have made it clear that we believe that a pension promised should be a pension honoured, and that members of final salary schemes should have confidence that the benefits that they have accrued will be paid when they fall due. That is why we have set out to bolster pension security and to protect people from the risks involved with saving in occupational pensions. We are all too aware of the impact of the wind-up of    underfunded schemes and the subsequent loss of confidence in saving for retirement. Our reforms set out 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 240WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to restore confidence, so that people can save for their retirement safe in the knowledge that their pension is protected and that they will not face poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para21">The pensions regulator introduced in the Pensions Bill will give better protection to members of work-based pension schemes and reduce the burdens of   compliance for well-run schemes. It will focus on protecting the benefits of pension scheme members and concentrate its efforts on schemes where it assesses that   there is a high risk of fraud, bad governance or poor administration. The proposals mean that pension scheme members&#039; benefits will be better protected by a regulator that has the flexibility and powers to take a targeted and proportionate approach to protecting the funds held in pension schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para22">The Pensions Bill will also establish the pension protection fund, to which my hon. Friend referred. The PPF will help final salary pension scheme members by providing meaningful compensation should their employer become insolvent and have to wind up the scheme underfunded. I suppose that all hon. Members should declare an interest at this point, as we are all members of such a scheme. The fund will significantly improve protection for pension scheme members and confidence in pensions in general. More than 13 million members of final salary pension schemes could benefit from the security and peace of mind afforded by the PPF.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para23">In May, the Government announced the introduction of the financial assistance scheme, which will offer help to people who lose out before the PPF is introduced. There is a great deal of interest in the scheme from people whose final salary pension has been affected because their pension scheme wound up underfunded and their employer was unable to make up the deficit. Details of the FAS, including who will be eligible and the assistance to be provided, are being developed in consultation with stakeholders such as pension scheme members, trustees, trade unions and key business representatives. We believe that the FAS will greatly increase people&#039;s confidence in pensions. It will benefit not only those directly affected but pension providers and the pension industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para24">It is not only those measures that will strengthen confidence. Regulations already in force mean that the debt on a solvent employer whose scheme winds up is calculated on the basis that the scheme should be able to meet the full benefits that scheme members have accrued and expect to receive, as well as the full costs of winding-up. Trustees can utilise the regulations if their scheme started to wind up on or after 11 June 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para25">In advance of the PPF, for schemes that start to wind up on or after 10 May 2004, we have amended the priority order to ensure that assets are shared more fairly between non-pensioners and pensioners. We have achieved that by moving pensioners&#039; future indexation down the priority order, after the accrued rights of non-pensioners. That has a significant impact on the rights of non-pensioner scheme members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para26">In conclusion, I again congratulate my hon. Friend on taking time today to debate the situation faced by employees of Turner and Newall. I am grateful that neither she nor any other hon. Friends asked any technical questions that I might have found a tad embarrassing. We will maintain this debate, both 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 241WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
through discussions in this Chamber and on the Floor of the House and through the open dialogue between the Government and my hon. Friends who represent pensioners from Turner and Newall. My hon. Friends are aware that the Government wish to keep that open dialogue very much in process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41019h05_para27">I am sorry that I cannot offer more specific assurances to employees that their pension will be protected, but I   am sure that hon. Members agree that it would be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>19 Oct 2004 : Column 242WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
wholly inappropriate for me to make any promises to scheme members at this stage. We hope that the situation is resolved soon with a positive outcome for all, so that employees can look forward to a secure retirement. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.
