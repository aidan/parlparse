surely a debate that we should be having not in this ante-Chamber, but
on the Floor of the House on a Government motion that sets out their
strategy. We have had a vote on the commencement of military action and
after three and a half years surely we should have a vote on whether it
is time to end it. In the next few weeks or months, Prime Minister
al-Maliki will put the question of an extension to the
coalition&#146;s mandate, which runs out on 31 December this year, to
a vote in the Iraqi National Assembly. Some Iraqi politicians argue for
a two-year extension and some for a year with an option for renewal.
The UN Security Council will be invited to support an extension to the
mandate. The Iraqi politicians will vote, diplomats will vote and it
seems only right and proper that the elected representatives of the
people whose fate is being decided should also be allowed to
vote.</p><p><a name="06102576000013"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew390"><a name="06102576000535">Sir

no time before Prorogation and that he hoped the Opposition would
choose foreign affairs as the subject for a debate on the

principal view is that the invasion was illegal and the fact that we
&#147;kicked in the door&#148;, to use General Dannatt&#146;s
phrase, robbed us of the moral legitimacy and the practical capacity to
rebuild the country we had destroyed. In those circumstances, the only
sensible option is to withdraw our troops and find other more
constructive ways of meeting our obligations to the Iraqi

There has been a debate in our party and a range of views was
expressed. As I said, it is an entirely honourable position to argue
that we should stay to clear up the mess we created, as long as the
occupation has any realistic or conceivable chance of success, but that
opportunity is long

Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab):</b> John Humphrys on the radio this
morning said that if British troops were to leave, there would almost
certainly be civil war and the country would split up into several
different parts. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the integrity of
Iraq is an important principle, or would he be happy to see the country
segregated?</p><p><a name="06102576000026"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew401"><a name="06102576000546">Adam
Price:</b> As the Foreign Secretary has said: it is ultimately
a matter for the people of Iraq, and they must have self-determination
in that. I will return to the issue of civil war, but I think that it
has already arrived. Sadly, that is the daily reality on the ground in
Iraq. On partition, it is in no one&#146;s interests to see a bloody
partition in Iraq. That is clear. In the constitution, a three-state
model is in effect already emerging. Unfortunately, the Shi&#146;a
political leadership has alienated the Sunni minority by unilaterally
announcing the creation of a super Shi&#146;ite region in the
south-east, so partition is already
happening.</p><p><a name="06102576000027"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew402"><a name="06102576000547">Mr.
Mike Weir (Angus) (SNP):</b> Does my hon. Friend also accept
that the Iraq Study Group seems to be moving towards discussing the
break-up of Iraq and the involvement of Turkey, Iran and Syria in its
affairs? That is in some ways very dangerous, especially for the
Kurdish region with its history between the Kurds and the Turks. Does
he agree that for political reasons the Americans are already moving
towards
that?</p><p><a name="06102576000028"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew403"><a name="06102576000548">Adam
Price:</b> There is a case for a regional security conference
involving the major powers in the region, but that would clearly also
be fraught with geo-political difficulty, not least for the US because
it would be forced to speak to the former members of the axis of evil.
Certainly, anything that can address border security along the western
and eastern borders is welcome. The southern and northern borders are
secure. The Saudis have built a 550-mile electric fence along the
border to the south. Sadly, that is not the case to the west and
east.</p><p><a name="06102576000029">My view is that
whether we stay or go, it is clear, unfortunately, that Iraq will
remain at war with itself for some time to come. The question is
whether extricating ourselves now would lead to further escalation of
the violence. None of us can say for sure what would happen, but if we
are no longer sure whether British servicemen and women putting their
lives at risk day in, day out, does more harm than good, we have to ask
ourselves seriously whether we should be there at
all.</p><br>

the war is no longer winnable in any meaningful sense of the word. Of
course, that is difficult for Bush and the Prime Minister, because it
means admitting that their policy has failed. That is why, to use Bob
Woodward&#146;s phrase, they have been in a &#147;state of
denial&#148;. Staying the course has been a policy based on
self-deception. The policy prescription has been based on paralysis and
an inability to face uncomfortable facts. The first thing that we need
in this discussion, therefore, is some honesty and humility from the
Government&#151;an admission that the policy to date has failed and
the strategy has been
disastrous.</p><p><a name="06102576000031">The
Government said that we were in Iraq to prevent civil war, but if what
is happening now is not civil war, I do not know what is. The number of
bodies processed in the central Baghdad morgue in May 2006 was double
that for May 2005, and the May figure has been surpassed by the figures
for July, August and September. The figure for October will probably be
even worse again. The number of daily strikes against Americans doubled
in the first six months of this year and has increased even further in
the months since. The latest information, for this month, is that the
average number of reported Iraqi deaths is 41 a day. However, the
United Nations says that, because of under-reporting, the actual number
is probably closer to 100 a
day.</p><p><a name="06102576000032">There are more
bombs, and the bombs are bigger and more sophisticated, killing more
people than ever. It is not just me saying that. According to a senior
US Department of Defence official quoted in <i>The New York
Times</i>:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_87"><a name="06102576000483"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
insurgency has more public support and is demonstrably more capable in
numbers of people active and in its ability to direct violence than at
any point in time.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000033">It
is no wonder that many Iraqis now say that life is worse for them than
it was under Saddam. We will listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s
words for an acknowledgement that the situation in Iraq is nothing less
than
terrible.</p><p><a name="06102576000034"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew404"><a name="06102576000549">Jon
Trickett (Hemsworth) (Lab):</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recall
that the reason for going to Iraq was not to remove a dictator, but
because weapons of mass destruction were going to be sent within 45
minutes and potentially would hit British interests in Cyprus or
wherever? Will he also reflect on the fact that the General Officer
Commanding suggested recently that the presence of British troops was a
factor causing the violence that is now taking place? That being the
case, does it not strengthen the argument for
withdrawal?</p><p><a name="06102576000035"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew405"><a name="06102576000550">Adam

that statement. The original delusion or deception, depending on
one&#146;s interpretation, that was at the heart of the
Government&#146;s war policy has followed through into self-delusion
and deception in their description of how the occupation has proceeded.
What we need now is clarity and honesty from the Government about how
terrible the situation
is.</p><p><a name="06102576000036">There have been so
many turning points. We have been given promises about the occupation.

relatively peaceful part of Maysan province, the Shi&#146;a people
there said to me, &#147;Things are fine and they will improve as long
as you, the allies, can guarantee security. If you can&#146;t, we
will face what amounts to a civil war.&#148; In a very good piece on
the radio this morning, which has been mentioned, John Humphrys said
exactly that. Security has not been guaranteed and the situation is
deteriorating. Without troops, how do people have
security?</p><p><a name="06102576000038"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew407"><a name="06102576000552">Adam
Price:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. However, it is in the
nature of military occupation that there is a time-limited window of
opportunity, beyond which, even if people were welcomed at first, the
relationship between occupier and occupied begins to sour. My reading
of General Dannatt&#146;s thesis is that we have gone beyond that
point, and at stage point the situation becomes
irredeemable.</p><p><a name="06102576000039">As I
said, General Dannatt is not alone in his view. The <i>Los Angeles
Times</i> reported in October last year that some US generals believed
that</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_88"><a name="06102576000484"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;US troops are
increasingly part of the problem...the presence of US forces was
fuelling the insurgency, fostering an undesirable dependency on
American troops among the nascent Iraqi armed forces and energizing
terrorists across the Middle East.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000040">The most recent demonstration of that has
been the massive two-month sweep in Baghdad, Operation Together
Forward, which even US General William Caldwell acknowledges to have
been a failure, with a 43 per cent. increase in attacks against the US
since midsummer. Where we retreat&#151;in Amarah or, for the
Americans, in Balad&#151;violence erupts, but where we return to the
streets, even worse violence erupts, because our presence provides the
insurgents with a target and a reason for increasing their
attacks.</p><p><a name="06102576000041">Polls from
the US State Department show decisively that a majority of Iraqis,
whether Sunni or Shi&#146;a, want US and coalition troops to leave
Iraq immediately; that they feel less safe as a result of the
occupation; and that they think the occupation is spurring, not
suppressing, sectarian strife. In short, if the decision were up to
ordinary Iraqis, the occupation would end. As we saw from the opinion
polls yesterday, if it were up to ordinary people in this country, the
occupation would end. For a war allegedly fought in the name of
democracy, the willingness of the Government to frustrate the will of
the people, whether in Iraq or in this country, is
breathtaking.</p><p><a name="06102576000042">We are
part of the problem. We are not the whole problem, because the Iraqi
security forces meant to replace us are, unfortunately, part of the
problem,

security forces, new reports from about 2004 onwards have suggested
that the US trained and supported Iraqi commando brigades&#151;the

squads by abducting and assassinating thousands of Iraqis in
extra-judicial killings.</p><p><a name="06102576000046">Earlier this month, we read
that the 8th Iraqi police unit was responsible for the kidnapping on 1
October of 26 Sunni food factory workers in the Amil quarter of
south-west Baghdad, of whom seven were shot dead. Ministry of Interior
vehicles were used in that kidnapping, and most of the men wore Iraqi
police uniforms. Minister Al-Bolani has suspended the police unit from
official duties and confined its members to base for the time being,
but instead of facing punishment, according to Adnan Thabit, the
director-general of the Iraqi police, they
are</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_89"><a name="06102576000485"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;going to be

was UK policy to train and recruit the militia into the security
forces. There was no infiltration: we invited them in. The evidence of
the Ministry of Defence to the Select Committee on Defence in 2004
was:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_90"><a name="06102576000486"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Coalition&#146;s policy is to encourage individual members, from the
Badr Corps in particular, to join the New Iraqi Army or another
official
organisation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000048">We know
that the United States trained the special forces within the Ministry
of Interior under the Salvador option, which was so called because they
were trained up by Colonel James Steele, commander of the US military
advisory group when the CIA trained the death squads in central
America. In light of that, how did the Minister come to tell the
Defence Committee last
year:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_91"><a name="06102576000487"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There is

one powerful minister to be used in the way in which Saddam Hussein
would have used his security
forces.&#148;?</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000049">How much of an
indication of that does he need? People have been found tortured in
secret Ministry of Interior jails, and half of the police in Sadr city
have pictures of Moqtada al-Sadr on their patrol cars. Almost every
time a Sunni gets abducted it is by people in uniform. Far from acting
as a brake on sectarian violence, the policies that we have pursued
have helped to ferment it. I will be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s response on that.</p><p><a name="06102576000050">The national reconciliation
conference has been cancelled four times, incredibly, by the Iraqi
Government. They have refused to ban militia in the security forces and

and their families, will the Minister give a categorical assurance that
any move to military rule in Iraq would result in the immediate and
unilateral evacuation of British troops, and that we will provide no
support&#151;tacit, express, direct or indirect&#151;for such a
move? Whatever happens in the next few months, there are no perfect or
peaceful solutions for the people of Iraq in the short term.
Iraq&#146;s future can be decided only by Iraqis.</p><p><a name="06102576000052">It is argued that withdrawal
from Iraq would be a propaganda victory for the terrorists, but our
intelligence and US intelligence suggests that the opposite is true,
and that our continued presence in Iraq is the biggest recruiting
sergeant for al-Qaeda throughout the entire world. It is important to
place on record that those of us who are calling for troop withdrawal
certainly are not saying that we should abandon the Iraqi people. The
war has had terrible consequences for them and we have responsibilities
as a result. We should make a commitment to make reparations for the
suffering that we have caused&#151;not just the invasion and the
occupation, but the 12 years of sanctions that devastated millions but
did nothing to harm the political elite, and all those years that we in
the UK and the US supported and armed Saddam while he committed his
worst atrocities. What we now need for Iraq is a Marshall plan, over
decades, to which we can contribute, along with some of the oil-rich
countries of the Gulf. We have an obligation to the Iraqi people, but
we cannot meet that obligation through a military strategy that cannot
succeed.</p><p><a name="06102576000053">I think that
it is fair to say that some kind of watershed has been reached in
discussions when the head of the armed forces and the leader writer of
<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> both call for the withdrawal of British
troops. The Government must now realise that their policy of the last
three and a half years is no longer sustainable. Stubbornly sticking to
a flawed strategy will simply cost more lives without bringing us any
closer to achieving our goals. It is time for us to leave.</p><p><a name="06102576000054">Of course, we have been here
before&#151;literally. I have a letter from a certain Colonel T. E.
Lawrence to <i>The Times</i> in July 1920. In his letter he says of the
Iraqis:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_92"><a name="06102576000488"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They
waited and welcomed the news of our mandate, because they thought it
meant...self-government for themselves. They are now losing hope
in our good intentions. A remedy? I can see a cure only in immediate
change of policy. The whole logic of the present thing looks wrong. Why
should Englishmen...have to be killed to make the Arab Government
in Mesopotamia, which is the considered intention of his
Majesty&#146;s Government?&#148;</p></ul><br>

happy to march against the imminent war, because I thought that the

I was also convinced that the timetable had more to do with the
presidential elections than the situation on the ground. But, like a
lot of people, I refuse to be frozen in time.</p><p><a name="06102576000058">Back then, I was the president
of Unison and a member of the TUC general council. We took the
strategic decision to help to build a trade union movement in Iraq, and
we invested members&#146; money in doing that. We organised training
sessions for shop stewards from Iraq in the UK, then in Jordan, and
ultimately in Kurdistan. We gave solidarity and financial support,
helped to build their organisations and brought trade union
representatives to the United Kingdom. Indeed, representatives have
visited the Durham miners gala and spoken at schools in my constituency
to explain what is really happening.</p><p><a name="06102576000059">Before Saddam, there was a
good, strong union base in Iraq. When Saddam came to power, he did his
best to wipe out trade unions. Now that he has gone, there are 250,000
active trade unionists in Iraq. I am not happy that we went to war, but
I am happy that a trade union movement exists in Iraq, and that would
not have happened without our intervention. Whether we like it or not,
our intervention is seen as a positive by many working people in Iraq,
but they are concerned about some of the things that are going on
there, particularly with decree 8750, which the Government brought in
last year. The decree says that the relevant Government
committee</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_93"><a name="06102576000489"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;must take

function, operate and organise.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000060">That is absolutely out of order, and the
decree has been condemned by the International Labour Organisation, the
British Government and the TUC. If we can prevent the Iraqi Government
from insisting that it is implemented, that might give people faith in
our Government and bring some honour to Ministers.</p><p><a name="06102576000061">The people I have been dealing
with are not the political elites, but real people&#151;the people
who were hurt most by the war and by Saddam Hussein, who spent 20 years
trying to wipe them off the face off the earth. Some 180,000 people
were killed in Kurdistan, and 4,500 villages were wiped off the face of
the earth. The people I spoke to asked not whether it was right or
wrong for us to go to war in 2003, but where we were in 1985 when we
would could have stopped such things happening. Historians will
certainly reflect on that question.</p><br>

clear that our intervention was positive and that we were giving them a
chance to rebuild their country and their infrastructure and to develop
an industrial base from which to grow. Although they ultimately want us
out of their country, we were told by a group of 22 trade unionists
from Baghdad and Basra that it was not safe for us to leave yet, and
that was the view of most of the people we met, who included trade
unionists, workers and representatives of local and regional government
in Kurdistan. Yesterday, I checked with the international

that the Iraqi military is not up to the job. It is under-skilled,

Price) on securing
it.</p><p><a name="06102576000070">I shall be brief
because others want to speak, but we should just consider the Lancet
report, which came out last week or the week before and which indicated
that 650,000 people have died in Iraq since the invasion in 2003. The
death rate is accelerating as a result of insurgencies and all the
problems associated with the disruption of normal civilian life. There
is no prospect of it falling while British and American forces remain
there and, in the words of General Dannatt, become part of the problem,
not part of the
solution.</p><p><a name="06102576000071">This
morning, Radio 4&#146;s &#147;Today&#148; programme came from
Basra, but the most interesting thing was that those working on the
programme had to fly in by helicopter at night because it was not safe
to fly during the day. Similarly, the British diplomats who have been
assigned to work there have never been out of the security zone in the
months that they have been there. Government officials in Baghdad have
never been outside the green zone in the months, if not years, that
they have been there, and the situation is getting
worse.</p><p><a name="06102576000072">The Prime
Minister tells us that we will stay until the job is done, but how does
he define &#147;job done&#148;? How long will that be? I believe
that the military would like to pull out, and General Dannatt is
probably saying what a lot of military people are thinking. Having
hitched ourselves to a US bandwagon in 2003, however, the problem is
that we are stuck with the policies that the US chooses to follow in
Iraq.</p><p><a name="06102576000073">Some people say
that we are stuck in the time warp of 2003, but it is worth recalling
what happened that year and before. Britain and the US substantially
supported Saddam Hussein during the 1970s and 1980s. He bought large
numbers of arms from British, American and other companies and made
himself very powerful on the basis of that. The war between Iran and
Iraq was devastating for both countries, and it probably suited
political leaders in both countries to have a war with each other at
that time. We then had Saddam Hussein&#146;s bizarre invasion of
Kuwait, the 1991 Gulf war and the years of sanctions, with all the
problems that they created. As the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and
Dinefwr said, those sanctions did little to damage the elite, but a
great deal to damage the lives of ordinary people.</p><p><a name="06102576000074">Bizarrely, George Bush then
announced that the axis of evil included Iraq and that the country was
the centre of terrorist activity, but there was no evidence whatever
for that. Yes, Saddam Hussein was a brutal leader and a bad person, and
it is absolutely true that Iraq was not a nice place, but it was not
the centre of terrorist activity that George Bush claimed it
was.</p><p><a name="06102576000075">Then, there were
the totally erroneous claims about weapons of mass destruction, on the
basis of which troops were committed and a war took place. Iraq has now
become a magnet for every kind of terrorist in the region and it will
continue to be one as long as British and American forces remain
there.</p><p><a name="06102576000076">Weapons of mass
destruction did not exist in Iraq. When the history books are written,
they will show that January 2003 was one of the key turning points.

doing in January 2003 preventing the weapons inspectors from returning
to Iraq to prove finally whether there were weapons of mass destruction
there. The die was cast with George Bush&#146;s decision to go to war
in Iraq, which I believe was taken in April 2002. We are apparently
incapable of saying no to the United States on anything, so we had to
go into that
war.</p><p><a name="06102576000077">Where do we go
from here? Politically, there have been elections in Iraq, and Saddam
Hussein is no longer president. As someone who never supported him or
apologised in any way for his actions, I am glad that he is no longer
the president and that there has been some change in that
respect&#151;nobody who opposed the war supported dictatorship.
However, we have to ask what British and American forces are doing now,
other than making the situation worse, costing us a great deal and
politically damaging not only George Bush&#151;I am not particularly
bothered about that&#151;but the Labour party and the political
process in this
country.</p><p><a name="06102576000078">The 1
million-plus people who marched against the war in February 2003
probably represent about 10 per cent. of all those who voted Labour in
the previous general election. That is a very large figure. Opinion
polls then were against the war, and now they are stronger than ever
against it. Every Member of the House knows that the war is unpopular
with all sections of our community. The occupying forces also know full
well that the presence of British and American troops in Iraq is
unpopular.</p><p><a name="06102576000079">We must,
therefore, take some hard decisions. Are we going to stay there,
spending more money and losing more lives, with more civilians dying,
more insurgents coming in and more destruction going on, with the
country probably being broken up into warring zones, or are we going to
take the political decision that the policy has not been successful and
that it is necessary to leave Iraq as soon as practicable? I think that
the results of the US elections in a few weeks will force the American
political and military establishment to that conclusion. I would have
thought that we were capable of thinking this through ourselves, and
deciding that it is indeed time to get out of
Iraq.</p><p><a name="06102576000080">The public do
not support the present situation; the military in this country are
unhappy about it. The war was illegal in the first place and our
continued presence in Iraq will not bring about peace or justice. It
will just bring about an ever-worsening situation. I honestly believe
that it is time to leave

objective of everyone taking part in the debate is the same: to achieve
a satisfactory withdrawal of British forces as soon as practicable.
That is the question that we have to address. My only concern is that
much of the Government&#146;s rhetoric of &#147;until the job is
done&#148; implies that we shall be in Iraq for a very long time.
Regrettably, in our current position we face a series of ugly choices,
and we shall not be able to achieve the withdrawal in circumstances
that we control.</p><p><a name="06102576000084">The
&#147;until the job is done&#148; approach is the wrong one now,
and the nearest historical parallel would appear to be pre-partition
India. The Labour Government faced a difficult decision, given the
escalating violence between the various communities in India, and
indeed they brought forward the date of partition to try to deal with
it as quickly as possible, recognising that the situation over which
they were presiding was rapidly going out of the control of the British
authorities in India. That is a rather similar position to the one in
which we find ourselves today.</p><p><a name="06102576000085">I listened to the Secretary of
State for Defence describing the operations that British troops are
carrying out in Basra, and it sounded like a repeat of the record I
heard in 2004. We were sweeping through Basra to try to create new
security arrangements, block by block. We were attending to the
training of the police. We were doing great work on the infrastructure
and key services such as water and
schools.</p><p><a name="06102576000086">I went to
Basra with the Select Committee on Defence in May 2004 and we were
shown all those things happening. We were shown the Iraqi police
undergoing riot training and the rest, but one had simply to scratch
beneath the surface and talk not to the Iraqi police commander, who
knew the rhetoric to use in addressing visiting foreign politicians,
but to some of his subordinates in the more junior ranks to get a
different perspective on what they thought they were
about.</p><p><a name="06102576000087">The request
from those people was simply, &#147;Give us the weapons that you have
all got here and push off, then we will be able to deal with it. We
need heavy machine guns and armour, then we will be able to do our job
properly.&#148; We have taught the senior policemen the rhetoric, but
two and a half years later we have seen that the police, as we heard
from the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr, are utterly
infiltrated by the various warring
factions.</p><p><a name="06102576000088">We face an
extremely ugly dilemma about how we get out. The fact is that the
effect we are having in trying to train the police and build up the
security infrastructure, which are thoroughly laudable, is being set
against the other factors entailing the collapse of the security
situation in front of us. I fear that throughout the past two and a
half years at least, we have been losing the
battle.</p><p><a name="06102576000089">The factors
that we have been trying to reinforce have been losing out, as is
evidenced by the appalling number of casualties resulting from the
collapse of security. Of course, it looks, therefore, as if a situation
resembling that in Algeria or Lebanon will come about. The difficulty

fighting police and soldiers have fought other security forces, and
there have been similar tribal and religious divisions, as well as the
division between the three main communities.</p><p><a name="06102576000092">The chaos is enormously
complex, but it is chaos created by us&#151;not just as an
international force, but as a Parliament. If we look through the
terrible decisions taken by Parliament over the years, this is the
worst. Some such decisions were taken by Governments&#151;for
example, over Suez and the Boer war&#151;but the decision on Iraq was
taken by us, in this House,
uniquely.</p><p><a name="06102576000093">It was a
decision within which 139 Labour MPs courageously voted against the
three-line Whip, to their great credit. Fifty other Labour MPs who
opposed the war, and had also signed early-day motions and various
other proposals, were persuaded&#151;bullied, I am
afraid&#151;bamboozled or deluded into believing that to vote with
the Government would be a good thing. Many of them bitterly regret the
fact that the Labour Whips persuaded them, and if those 50 had joined
the 139 we should not have joined Bush&#146;s war in Iraq. The issue

mistake. We should in no way be complacent about attitudes to such
things. I recall fondly an answer that I received from Mr.
William Waldegrave to a parliamentary question that I tabled five
months before the first Iraq war, asking the Conservative Government to
beef up the International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of Saddam

the development of nuclear weapons. We had a shared deception at the
time.</p><p><a name="06102576000095">I make this
brief contribution because I share the view of other hon. Members that,
having created the mess, we have an obligation to sort it out. I have
seen the recent developments, the most telling of which was perhaps an
incident where a convoy containing military personnel took a wrong
turning down a side road. No one had any idea that there was someone
coming or that anything was planned. The convoy reached a dead end and
turned round, and was then spontaneously attacked on the short return
journey up the street. The attack resulted in deaths.</p><p><a name="06102576000096">That incident shows that the
main purpose in life of the troops in their stockades is to defend
themselves. If they go out on patrol, they become targets. As has been
rightly said by military people and others, their presence exacerbates
the dangers. What do we do in that situation? There is no clear answer
or simple decision that we can take. We need to debate the matter, and
the most useful thing we can do is set a
timetable.</p><p><a name="06102576000097"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew419"><a name="06102576000564">John
Barrett:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the
other reasons why we must move to the next stage is the reconstruction
of Iraq? One subject that has not been touched on today is its water
and electricity supply, and health and education services. They cannot
be reconstructed until this phase ends.</p><p><a name="06102576000098"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew420"><a name="06102576000565">Paul
Flynn:</b> That is true. Whichever way one looks at the
situation in Iraq&#151;as far as the provision of electricity and
water is concerned, and the way that all the misery there is
going&#151;in so many ways things are worse than they were under
Saddam Hussein. We all wanted him to go, but let us consider even the
rate of deaths. <i>The Lancet</i> report suggests 600,000 deaths, and
we know about the 119 British deaths. Did those people die in vain? We
do not want to ask that question, but what on earth can we say that
their courage and the sacrifice of their lives were about? The same
applies in respect of 2,500
Americans.</p><p><a name="06102576000099">Every other
indication&#151;for example, the way that the middle classes moved
out to Syria and Jordan&#151;shows the same thing: the country is in
a dreadful state and we must take responsibility for it. What a shame
that we cannot do so as a Parliament. We do not have the confidence to
have our own inquiry into our reasons for going to war. We will be told
that we have had four inquiries, two of which were done by Committees
that were cheerleaders for the war anyway. The other two examined very
small aspects of the conflict, so we have not had a full
inquiry.</p><p><a name="06102576000100">Can we really
trust world leaders who were complicit in the war, and who originated
it, to take decisions that need to be taken, free of any pressure to
justify their actions? We need changes before those decisions can be
taken. As has been said, once again our brave soldier lions are
suffering because of the decisions of the ministerial
donkeys.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025h0001.htmordayhd_34"><a name="06102576000510">10.23

is always a very eloquent speaker&#151;I wish that were not the
case.</p><p><a name="06102576000102">I agree in
substantial measure with many of the things that have been said today.
I want all British troops to be home as soon as possible. The hon.
Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) asked when is
&#147;possible&#148; and whether we should we use the language of
when the &#147;job is done&#148;. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Newport, West (Paul Flynn) asked, what does such language mean? We must
judge when the tipping point is at which it is possible for us to
withdraw without creating further problems for the people of Iraq and
for our own troops in the process of withdrawal.</p><p><a name="06102576000103">That is a difficult point to
judge. It is difficult to judge in the Balkans, where we have been
trying to ensure that before we withdraw all our remaining troops, many
of whom are feeling desultory doing their current work in Bosnia, the
security services in that country will be able to deliver security in a
non-partisan way for everyone. We face this process every time we are
involved in activity beyond our borders.</p><p><a name="06102576000104">The first key to the tipping
point is a sense of profound responsibility for the people of Iraq. We
went to Iraq, but at what point do we feel that our withdrawal aids
their greater security and their opportunity of enhanced public
services&#151;health, education, water supply, electricity and the
rest. I merely point out to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John
Barrett), who mentioned water and electricity supplies, that if British
and American troops were not protecting them, people would not have any
access to water or
electricity.</p><p><a name="06102576000105">We can
also judge the tipping point by assessing at what point the indigenous
security forces can cope. It seems to me, for all the reasons that the
hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr advanced, that now is not
that time. They do not have the ability to deal either with corruption
within their own forces or, in a non-partisan way, with all that
peoples of the country. Consequently, it would be difficult for anyone
with a logical mind to argue that the time has yet
come.</p><p><a name="06102576000106"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew422"><a name="06102576000567">Mr.

Bryant:</b> I would give way to the hon. Gentleman, but there
are very few minutes left and it is important that we hear from the
Front-Bench spokespeople at decent length.</p><p><a name="06102576000108">A material point was raised by
several hon. Members: at what point does our continuing stay either
exacerbate violence or prevent local security forces from taking full
responsibility. This is still the question that we face in the Balkans:
does our continuing presence in Bosnia mean that local security forces
never fully take responsibility for the work in which they need to
engage? That is the most difficult point to judge.</p><p><a name="06102576000109">Other things that are important
to remember have not been mentioned today. We are in Iraq under a new
United Nations mandate. It is important that in any further
considerations of what British troops should do and what our British
responsibilities should be, we

just mean the Americans; it means others in the United Nations who have
provided a substantial mandate for us to remain in Iraq.</p><p><a name="06102576000110">Iraq now has a democratic
Government, who, for all their problems and difficulties, have been in
existence for just 156 days and have made it clear that they want us to
remain. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr said that the
shortest period of time that Iraqi politicians are arguing for our
continued stay is one year beyond this December, so it seems difficult
to argue for an immediate withdrawal on the basis of democracy in Iraq.
Indeed, few Iraqi politicians are calling for any form of immediate
withdrawal. That is why we must seriously consider whether that is a
proper course of action for us.</p><p><a name="06102576000111">The question of the integrity
of Iraq is far more difficult than the hon. Gentleman would suggest. He
seemed quite relaxed about whether partition took place in Iraq. The
interference of other countries if there were partition would not lead
to greater security in the region, greater benefits for any of the
individual
countries&#151;</p><p><a name="06102576000112"><b><a name="61025h0001.htm_spnew424"><a name="06102576000569">Mr.

only two more minutes so I shall not give way.</p><p><a name="06102576000114">The hon. Member for Reigate
referred to the partition of India as the relevant analogy. In a sense,
he gave away the game on this. Many would argue that partition was not
the right process at that point, and bringing it forward in the way
that we did was inappropriate. Sir Stafford Cripps made many
mistakes.</p><p><a name="06102576000115">The hon.
Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr also referred to the question
of the process in Parliament. I agree that we should have a substantive
debate in Parliament. I am critical of the fact that the vast majority
of our debates on every issue under the sun happen on the Adjournment
of the House, without any proper resolution. However, there is an
Opposition day next Tuesday. If the Opposition believe that this is the
single most important substantive issue that we should be debating,
they could bring it forward then, and there would be a vote.</p><p><a name="06102576000116">Mistakes have been
made&#151;that may seem to be the understatement of the
year&#151;one of the most profound of which was our enforcing the
collapse of the Ba&#146;athist security forces in Iraq. I understand
that it was an area where we lost the argument with our other
international allies, which is profoundly to be regretted. I also
believe that, as I said at the time, George Bush&#146;s axis-of-evil
speech and the way in which he linked the three countries together was
a profound mistake&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for
Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) was not here for the whole of
this debate, but I am glad that he has now joined
us.</p><p><a name="06102576000117">Immediate
withdrawal, regardless of the views of the United Nations, regardless
of the views of the democratic Government of Iraq, regardless of the
almost certain civil war and partition that would ensue, and regardless
of the harm to the reputation of our armed forces, would be the height
of irresponsibility.

an eloquent and knowledgeable speech, as has been recognised. There
have been other excellent contributions and I am pleased to respond to
this excellent debate on behalf of the Liberal
Democrats.</p><p><a name="06102576000119">It is a sad
day when the mighty forces of Welsh nationalism instigate a debate on a
subject as important as Iraq before the Government do so. It has been
two and a half years since we had a debate in the House and it is
important that the Minister, following this debate, tells the Prime
Minister that we need a substantive debate in the House. During those
two and a half years, tens of thousands of people have died and the
country is on the edge of civil war, yet the Government have not come
forward with a
debate.</p><p><a name="06102576000120">I shall set
out the Liberal Democrats&#146; belief that the UK needs a new
strategy and its own Baker-style inquiry. If the US can have an
inquiry, why cannot we have one? One would have thought from listening
to the Leader of the Opposition at last week&#146;s Prime
Minister&#146;s questions that the Conservatives had opposed the war
all along and questioned the Government closely every step of the way.
They did not, and it was good to have an admission from the hon. Member
for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) that he is now questioning the
Government on their thinking on
Iraq.</p><p><a name="06102576000121">The Liberal
Democrats opposed the war in Iraq. We believed that it was illegal, in
defiance of the United Nations, and based on a flawed prospectus and a
fabricated threat. It should never have happened. Forty thousand
civilians&#151;some say hundreds of thousands&#151;and almost 3,000
coalition troops are dead. There has been increasing violence and
hardship with an increased terrorist threat and huge resentment
throughout the middle east and the rest of the world about the west and
its involvement in Iraq.</p><p><a name="06102576000122">We adopted a constructive
approach. Now that we have invaded Iraq, we have a moral and strategic
obligation to stabilise and reconstruct it. That that may not be Plaid
Cymru&#146;s position, but it is important to accept that moral
obligation now that we have invaded the country. We support the troops
in their actions and as we approach Remembrance Sunday it is important
to remember the sacrifices that they and their families have made in
Iraq. The commitment is
huge.</p><p><a name="06102576000123">Why do we need a
new strategy? The country is on the edge of civil war and sectarian
violence has intensified. If it is allowed to become a failed state,
the effects could be devastating. Iran, whose nuclear issue is next
door, Palestine, Lebanon and Islamic extremism are all problems that
are interconnected with Iraq and we should not ignore them. A new
strategy is imperative and this may be the last chance. What should
that strategy include? It should deal with the concerns of ordinary
people on the ground, personal safety, security, jobs and essential
services. If it fails or is rejected, it will be impossible to justify
the continuing presence of troops in
Iraq.</p><br>

among Government ranks. The Foreign Secretary said that we could be out
within a year, but the Secretary of State for Defence said no. The
Foreign Secretary said that Iraq could be partitioned into three, but
then changed her mind and said that the war might be judged to have
been a disaster. The Prime Minister said that we should hold our nerve.
The Minister should clear up that confusion this morning. Imagine what
that confusion among Ministers must be doing to the troops on the
ground.</p><p><a name="06102576000125">I mentioned
the James Baker inquiry by the former US Secretary of State. The US is
reviewing its policy in Iraq. Why is this country not to have a review?
Are we again waiting for the United States to take the lead? We should
take charge of our own
policy.</p><p><a name="06102576000126">General Sir
Richard Dannatt gave us a clear wake-up call with evidence from the
Army. He said that we should get out soon because our presence
exacerbates the security problems. Apparently, the Prime Minister
agrees. He said that he agrees, but is he following that advice? I have
not heard whether that is the
case.</p><p><a name="06102576000127">On the new
strategy, Sir Richard presented a last and fleeting chance for a
change, but the US and the UK still seem to be in denial. To continue
without change is not an option. A Baker-style inquiry is required in
this country, but we must internationalise the situation with the
United Nations taking a central role and we must accept that the
military are only one part of the solution. There must be a much
broader strategy.</p><p><a name="06102576000128">What
is the solution? We must engage more constructively with Iraq&#146;s
neighbours who can be usefully used to talk to insurgent groups, to
maintain security of the border and to provide economic stability. We
must professionalise the security forces, which is a huge challenge.
The United Nations must be involved in a UN-led disarmament,
demobilisation and reintegration strategy. We must have an end to
systematic and indefinite detentions by the US and Iraq because they
are having a huge effect on Iraqi opinion on the ground. The
reconstruction must be legitimised. In various opinion polls, the
Iraqis say that the UN must take the lead role. We need a phased
transfer and withdrawal of our
troops.</p><p><a name="06102576000129">This is the
last chance for a change in strategy. If it is rejected or fails, it
will be impossible to justify our continued presence. We need a
UK-style Baker inquiry in this country and we must internationalise the
effort. The military are only part of the strategy; we must seize the
opportunity for change for the benefit of our troops and
Iraq.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025h0001.htmordayhd_36"><a name="06102576000512">10.39

people in this country is that the Prime Minister just waits to be told
what to do. It is a damaging perception, and it is important that the
work taking place in Washington is mirrored by a careful reassessment
in Whitehall, which we should then be able to debate fully in the
House. Ministers should explain what work they are doing, and give
Members the opportunity to question them, so that we can fully debate
it.</p><p><a name="06102576000134">My commitment is
that even if the Government do not find time to debate the matter in
the next two weeks, the Conservative party as the official Opposition
will ensure that during the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, we debate
international affairs, giving us the opportunity to debate this matter
among others. It is important that Parliament has a chance to debate
it. The Government should make time in their time for the House to do
so.</p><p><a name="06102576000135">The Minister will
want to have as much time as possible to answer the questions that he
has been asked. First, however, several Members have alluded to our job
in Iraq. There has been some confusion about it, even this week.
General Sir Richard Dannatt said that the Government&#146;s aim of
creating a liberal democracy was &#147;naïve&#148; and would
not be achieved. He said:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_96"><a name="06102576000492"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I don&#146;t think we
are going to do that. I think we should aim for a lower
ambition.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000136">The Prime
Minister immediately said that he agreed with everything that Sir
Richard had said.</p><p><a name="06102576000137">However, just this week, the
argument put to the Prime Minister&#146;s official spokesman was that
the job in 2004 included leaving Iraq as a peaceful, prosperous,
unitary state, and a &#147;beacon of democracy&#148; to the whole
middle east. He confirmed that that was still the aim of British
Government policy. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm
which of those two interpretations is correct. They do not seem the
same.</p><br>

same time as the Prime Minister&#146;s official spokesman was saying
that, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs was
acknowledging the difficulties that we have faced in Iraq, and, as
several Members have already said, that Iraq could break up into three
parts. She said that it was up to the Iraqis themselves to decide,
adding:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_97"><a name="06102576000493"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;They
have had enough of people from outside handing down arbitrary
boundaries and arbitrary
decisions.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000139">It
would be helpful if the Minister explained whether the Government were
neutral about the question of Iraq continuing as a unitary state or
breaking up. A break-up into three states would have the most profound
effect on Turkey and that country&#146;s problems with its Kurdish
minority. A NATO ally might be plunged into a difficult conflict, and
that would be dangerous. As the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)
said, the Government cannot be entirely neutral about the matter. A
break-up would affect the stability of the middle east.</p><p><a name="06102576000140">The second area worth touching
on is whether the Government think Iraqi police and security forces
will be able to take responsibility for security. The Minister for the
Middle East seems confident that in about a year&#146;s time, Iraqi
forces will be able to take over. He told the
BBC:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_98"><a name="06102576000494"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I would
have thought that certainly in a year or so there will be adequately
trained Iraqi soldiers and security forces&#151;police men and women
and so on&#151;in order to do the
job.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000141">Press reports from
United States forces suggest that in their assessment, the forces on
the ground are not in as good a shape as that. It would be helpful to
have an update from the Minister about our assessment of the progress
that the Iraqi security forces have made.</p><p><a name="06102576000142">In the Government&#146;s
response to the report on UK operations by the Select Committee on
Defence, they
said:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_99"><a name="06102576000495"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
nature of some explosive devices being used, against British troops and
elsewhere in Iraq, suggest the involvement of Iranian elements,
including through Lebanese Hezbollah.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000143">We have heard only leaks from
the Iraq study group, and we do not know what it will conclude, but it
has put forward the idea that one US option is to ask Iraq&#146;s
neighbours, Iran and Syria, to become involved in the country. Given
that the British Government accept that elements in Iran have supplied
explosives that have killed British troops, it would be helpful to know
whether the Minister felt that involving Iran and Syria in stabilising
Iraq would work.</p><p><a name="06102576000144">Many
people think that Iran is already far too involved in Iraq, and that it
fuels Shi&#146;a violence. I am not sure that getting Iran and Syria
more involved in Iraq is necessarily helpful. It would be interesting
to know the Government&#146;s view, because decisions may come from
the US in fairly short order.</p><p><a name="06102576000145">Given the unnecessary comments
from the Liberal Democrats, it is worth noting that their leader, when
he was their foreign affairs spokesman, supported the action taken
against Saddam Hussein and, indeed, acknowledged in the House the
likelihood that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. The Liberal
Democrats need to be careful when putting forward their points. Their
comments were unnecessary. Looking to the future is more helpful than
looking to the past, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.

Operation Sinbad is trying to make Basra better and a lot of British
soldiers are doing a really good job. In that regard, their presence is
helping but there are other parts where our mere presence does
exacerbate and violence
results.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000163">That is a
statement of fact. He also
said:</p><a name="61025h0001.htmbrev_101"><a name="06102576000497"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;But that
is not a reason for us to leave. I am on record publicly saying
we&#146;re standing shoulder to shoulder with the Americans. I am on
the record from a speech three weeks ago saying that I&#146;m
planning force packages in Iraq through 2007 in to 2008. I&#146;m a
soldier&#151;we don&#146;t do surrender, we don&#146;t pull down

the capability of the Iraqi security forces and progressively
transferring responsibility to the Iraqi civilian authorities. That is
a fact that cannot be denied. More than 312,000 members of the Iraqi
security forces have been trained and equipped. I shall give a personal
experience. In the United Kingdom, at our battle school in Brecon, we
have delivered for our own people a high level of training and
leadership. We have done that for Iraqi officers as well. I addressed a
graduation parade there earlier this year and heard that Iraqi students
have exceeded our initial expectations. Those officers return to Iraq
as instructors of the highest calibre, able to train thousands more of
a new generation of Iraqi soldiers. It is easy to say that, but I must
always put it to the test: is what we are doing having an effect? One
of the instructor sergeants said to me, &#147;Those
officers, with a bit more training, would be as good as the officers
coming out of Sandhurst.&#148; That was a soldier judging a soldier.
Those who have experience know the quality of our instructor

conflict.</p><p><a name="06102576000166">The strategy
of handing over responsibility for security to the Iraqis as and when
their capability and capacity allow it is working. In the UK&#146;s
area of responsibility, the provinces of Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar have
already satisfied the necessary conditions to allow their handover to
Iraqi civilian control. Over the weekend, in the town of Al Amarah in
the Maysan province, it was the Iraqi authorities that responded to
unrest and Iraqi security forces that restored calm. Multinational
forces were ready to provide assistance if required, but in the event
they were not needed. I ask the critics of what is happening on the
ground to consider why I argue that that is success and why they
believe it is a measure of
failure.</p><p><a name="06102576000167">We can take
encouragement from the conduct of the Iraqi security forces. Their
reaction to and control of the situation that I have mentioned and
others is a testament to their training and dedication and clearly
demonstrates their increasing capabilities. However, we cannot achieve
success by military means alone. The political and economic process
must deliver results, and that is where the Iraqi Government have a
central role. Prime Minister Maliki has undertaken to secure Baghdad,
eliminate illegal armed groups, and promote national reconciliation and
the rule of law. Does any hon. Member doubt his intent to do that? Is
he not the democratically elected Prime Minister? Is it not right that
we should seek to help him achieve those objectives? Stemming the
violence in Baghdad is proving to be tremendously difficult, which
underlines the importance of making political progress on matters such
as reconciliation to draw Iraqi communities away from violence and into
the political process. It is in everyone&#146;s interest for the
Iraqi Government to succeed, and it is crucial that we continue to
support them.</p><p><a name="06102576000168">My hon.
Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) said, if I heard him
correctly, that Iraqis are worse off now than they were under Saddam.
What utter nonsense. He talked about Ministerial donkeys;
&#147;political pygmies&#148; is the phrase that comes to mind when
I hear such comments. Access to water is now better than pre-conflict,
with 4 million more people having access to it. Sewage and waste water
treatment plants are operating again, whereas prior to the conflict
none of them were. Health care spending is up to more than 30 times its
pre-war level, and through extensive disease control programmes there
has been a decline in the prevalence of polio, measles, mumps, rubella
and malaria. The UK has pledged more than &#163;544 million for
reconstruction in the period 2003 to 2006, and more than &#163;536
million has been disbursed to
date.</p><p><a name="06102576000169">The hon. Member
for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr mentioned the Marshall plan. To put in
place such a plan and to be able to spend money on reconstruction
requires security. He said, &#147;Give us a Marshall plan,&#148;

my memory. He was an old Jew in his 90s who had lived under three
dictators, one of whom was Saddam Hussein. He tried to explain why
dictatorships had to be removed but was howled down by those who would
call themselves the anti-war coalition, which some would call the

Green (Ashford) (Con):</b> I am grateful for the chance to air
this important issue, which I suspect will lower the temperature of the
Chamber slightly. The issue affects people not only in my constituency,
but throughout Kent and beyond. I shall not take up my full allocation
of time, because my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) also wishes to put his
points to the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06102576000181">The
background to this debate is Eurostar&#146;s decision to cut services
from Ashford International station when the new Ebbsfleet station opens
in autumn 2007. Eurostar is proposing to reduce the services from
Ashford to Paris to peak-hour services and, more importantly, to end
all services to Brussels. I want to concentrate on the Brussels
services. The new service proposals for Paris and other destinations in
France will be adequate to maintain proper links. However, ending the
Brussels services will be a blow to the development of Ashford, which
is an important part of the Government&#146;s sustainable communities
programme, and to plans for development and regeneration throughout
Kent and other parts of the wider south-east of
England.</p><p><a name="06102576000182">Before I put
my substantive arguments to the Minister, I should like to emphasise
the widespread damage that Eurostar&#146;s decision would cause.
Since the campaign to reverse the decision was started by hon. Members,
Kent county council, Ashford borough council and others who want to
preserve the services to Ashford, we have been particularly grateful
for the support of the South East England Development Agency. SEEDA is
clearly as anxious to see development and regeneration at Ebbsfleet, as
part of the Thames gateway project, as it is at Ashford. The agency has
made the point that we need a balance of services from the two Kent
stations on the international link if we are to achieve properly
balanced regeneration throughout Kent. Indeed, starting services at one
Kent station but then stopping them a few years later&#151;that is
Eurostar&#146;s current proposal for Ashford&#151;casts doubt on
the desirability of the entire area as a destination for new
international companies to set up their businesses. That would be
hugely damaging.</p><p><a name="06102576000183">I am
struck by the size of the area from which I have received complaints
and support for my complaints on the issue, which have come not only
from Ashford and the Folkestone area, as one would expect. Big howls of
protest have come from Hastings, the regeneration of which is
predicated partly on the improvement of rail links to and from Ashford.
I have also received strong letters of support from as far afield as
Eastbourne. That shows how wide the catchment area that will be
affected if the proposals go through is.</p><p><a name="06102576000184">Ministers might reasonably ask
why they should care. Why should the issue be a matter for them? Is the
proposal not a straightforward commercial decision by a private
company? I urge the Minister to become involved in persuading Eurostar
to reverse its decision, because the proposal will explicitly damage
the implementation of a number of Government policies, covering
regeneration, the environment and transport.

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 440WH</b><br>I am, for once on these Benches, seeking to help
the Government to ensure the success of some of their policies. That is
the spirit in which I hope the Minister will take my
remarks.</p><p><a name="06102576000185">It is also
important for Ministers and others to remember who provided the track
on which Eurostar runs its trains. The total cost of the channel tunnel
rail link was &#163;5.2 billion, of which &#163;1.8 billion was
provided by the taxpayer through the Department for Transport.
Eurostar&#146;s business depends on that massive subsidy, so it does
have wider responsibilities than simply its commercial
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06102576000186">My
first point is about regeneration. Eurostar&#146;s decision to end
services from Ashford to Brussels is damaging to Ashford&#146;s
ability to attract new jobs. Under the sustainable communities
programme, the Government propose that 31,000 new houses be built in
Ashford and, vitally, that 28,000 new houses should be provided there.
Without those jobs Ashford is likely to become a dormitory town, which
would fly in the face of the Government&#146;s ambitions to create a
sustainable community. Domestic high-speed services will ensure
Ashford&#146;s continuing attraction as a place to live and commute
from, but the Government&#146;s ambitions are higher. They want
Ashford to be attractive to inward investors as well. Indeed, Ashford
borough council and the Ashford futures board have been working hard at
that. The direct link to Brussels is important for that and will become
more so in the
future.</p><p><a name="06102576000187">There is also
an important issue of propriety. I am sure that the Minister will be
fully aware of the 38th report by the Select Committee on Public
Accounts, which was published on 27 March and dealt with the channel
tunnel rail link. One of the Committee&#146;s conclusions was that
the economic case for the link remained
marginal:</p><a name="61025h0002.htmbrev_102"><a name="06102576000498"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On
passenger traffic alone the Link is not justified, so regeneration
benefits are required to make the project value for
money.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000188">That is an
important consideration for Ministers to bear in
mind.</p><p><a name="06102576000189">Apart from the
money that is spent directly on the link, tens of million of pounds of
national taxpayers&#146; money have been spent on the wider
development of Ashford, including the road links and various
infrastructure projects, such as the new leisure centre that is being
built. There are also plans for a &#163;46 million learning campus.
The Minister might be aware that the entire town centre is being
regenerated as a new shopping area, while other new shopping areas have
been built just outside the town centre. Much of that regeneration has
used public money, making it a matter of genuinely national interest
and the responsibility of the Government, who can therefore
legitimately ask Eurostar to think
again.</p><p><a name="06102576000190">Secondly, the
decision is an attack on the Government&#146;s environmental agenda,
because it flies in the face of any policy of getting people off the
road and into public transport. Ebbsfleet is Britain&#146;s biggest
park and ride project, with a 7,000-plus space car park. All the people
from Kent and Sussex who use Ashford to go to Brussels will be asked to
drive to Ebbsfleet to get there. That is environmental madness, as well
as appearing mad to those coming from areas such as

drive much further away from the continent to catch a train back
there.</p><p><a name="06102576000191">The policy is
also particularly damaging, given the exact time at which Eurostar is
planning to encourage thousands of new cars to clog up the roads around
Ebbsfleet. We all know that cars are particularly polluting when they
are stationary or driving slowly. Let me share with the Minister the
road works schedule around Ebbsfleet for autumn 2007, just when all
those new passengers are meant to arrive to start using the new
station. Construction on the A2 and A282 Dartford improvement started
in September 2006, with completion expected in spring 2008, covering
the period. Construction of phase two of the A2 Bean to Cobham project
also started in September 2006, with completion expected in spring
2008. The biggest project of all is between junctions 1B and 3 of the
M25, which is scheduled to start in spring 2007 and be completed in
autumn 2008.</p><p><a name="06102576000192">So at
the exact time when Eurostar plans to switch all that traffic to the
roads around Ebbsfleet, those roads will be full of roadworks. Clearly,
that is madness. Eurostar has based its decision purely on a survey
that it carried out, which said that two thirds of passengers would
prefer to use Ebbsfleet. That ignores the real world, in which people
will be stuck in traffic jams; that in itself is reason to ask the
company to think
again.</p><p><a name="06102576000193">The third way
in which the decision is damaging to the Government&#146;s plans
relates directly to transport policy. Ashford is much better served by
domestic rail links than Ebbsfleet and has clearer roads. If the
Minister wants&#151;I am sure that he does&#151;a properly
integrated domestic and international rail network and to encourage the
use of trains, he will not want services to be withdrawn from Ashford.
Complaints from Hastings have been strong; it is a town that has
desperately needed regeneration and desperately needs better transport
links. People there have seen transport links through Ashford&#151;a
hub not only for east Kent, but for further around&#151;as essential
for regeneration. I hope that the Minister listens to the
representations that I am sure he gets from the hon. Member for
Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster), a member of his own
party.</p><p><a name="06102576000194">My final point
on transport is that if the services are withdrawn, they are much less
likely to be reinstated and people will question the long-term future
of international services from Ashford. Again, that will cast doubt
over the use of rail services as a proper driver for regeneration
throughout east Kent. The decision will have serious transport
implications.</p><p><a name="06102576000195">I hope
that the Minister will be able to give a positive message to people all
over the south-east and say that he will join the coalition of those
urging Eurostar to reconsider its short-sighted
decision&#151;short-sighted because Ashford&#146;s population is
projected to grow to 141,000 by 2021. In commercial terms, it seems
absurd for Eurostar to turn its back on that growing market.</p><p><a name="06102576000196">Eurostar benefits from the
billions of pounds of taxpayers&#146; money poured into the channel
tunnel rail link; it should act as an enlightened partner with the
bodies that are trying to develop Ashford in a

Government plans to develop Ashford. Eurostar has a licensed monopoly

Michael Howard (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con):</b> I am most
grateful to my constituency neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for
Ashford (Damian Green), for allowing me to add a few words from the
perspective of my constituency of Folkestone and Hythe to the excellent
case that he has made. My hon. Friend spoke of regeneration plans for
Ashford; regeneration plans for Folkestone are more ambitious now than
at any time in the 23 years during which I have had the privilege of
representing my constituency.
</p><p><a name="06102576000198">That is primarily due
to the immensely public-spirited efforts of a local entrepreneur,
Mr. Roger de Haan, who is masterminding the most inspiring
schemes for the development of Folkestone. We want the Government to
play their part. We see a tremendous future for the area, but the
subject of our debate&#151;the existence of good transport links to
the continent&#151;is very important for Folkestone, as for
Ashford.</p><p><a name="06102576000199">Indeed, my
constituents would have to travel significantly further to get to
Ebbsfleet than would the constituents of my hon. Friend. On the face of
it, it looks as if Eurostar&#146;s decision is a big problem for
Ashford because the international railway station is there. In fact,
the decision would affect my constituents to an even greater extent, so
the points that my hon. Friend made from his perspective apply to at
least as great an extent to those, such as my constituents, who live
even further away from Ebbsfleet.</p><p><a name="06102576000200">I shall make just one more
point before I sit down, to allow the Minister his full time to answer
this short debate. Eurostar seeks to base its case for its proposed
changes on a survey that it has carried out. My hon. Friend, the local
authorities for the area and I have consistently asked for the relevant
information so that Kent county council can conduct its own analysis to
test whether the premise on which Eurostar based its proposals is
sound. My most recent understanding is that we have had some, but not
all of the information that we need. I hope that in replying to the
debate, the Minister will deal with that point. He should use his good
offices to persuade Eurostar to let us have as soon as possible the
information that we need to test and assess its
case.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025h0002.htmordayhd_40"><a name="06102576000516">11.15

much importance Ashford attaches to its international links, so I am
pleased to have the opportunity to explain the development of the
channel tunnel rail link, the operation of Eurostar International
services and how the Department for Transport is working to ensure that
the transport infrastructure is in place for Ashford to fulfil its
potential as a growth area.</p><p><a name="06102576000203">I should begin by making it
clear that despite our arm&#146;s length relationship with
Eurostar&#151;which is, after all, a private company&#151;the
Government have kept a watching brief on consultations during the
timetable changes. We have noted with interest the statement from the
leader of Ashford borough council and chair of Ashford&#146;s future
delivery board, Councillor Paul Clokie. He said:</p><a name="61025h0002.htmbrev_103"><a name="06102576000499"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are of course
disappointed at the decision to reduce the number of international
train services from Ashford by
Eurostar.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000204">However, he
went on to add:</p><a name="61025h0002.htmbrev_104"><a name="06102576000205"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ashford remains one of
the few places in England from where Paris and Brussels can be reached
via a high-speed rail link within just two hours. The new proposed
timetable includes early morning and evening trains which will meet the
demands of many existing and new business and leisure
passengers.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000206">I do not
want to dwell for too long on the borough council&#146;s views,
but&#151;</p><p><a name="06102576000207"><b><a name="61025h0002.htm_spnew453"><a name="06102576000598">Damian
Green:</b> In the rest of that quote, Councillor Clokie said
that the Paris services, as I have just said, were disappointing but
satisfactory. He then explicitly went on to say that it was not
acceptable for the Brussels services to be removed. If the Minister is
trying to pray what Councillor Clokie said in aid and say that it is
reasonable for the Brussels services to be removed, he will be
misrepresenting Councillor
Clokie.</p><p><a name="06102576000208"><b><a name="61025h0002.htm_spnew454"><a name="06102576000599">Mr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention because I do not want to imply that Councillor Clokie
supports the timetable changes. I simply want to make the point that
there is a view in Ashford&#151;and Kent as a wider area&#151;that
the timetable changes will not deal the fatal blow to the local economy
that campaigners probably
suggest.</p><p><a name="06102576000209">It is worth
highlighting another point made by the council. It sees the provision
of the new high-speed domestic service as just as important to
Ashford&#146;s economic growth as the international links; that is an
incredibly important point. The council anticipates that the high-speed
link will provide additional demand for Eurostar services from Ashford
in the future.</p><p><a name="06102576000210">I
absolutely accept that neither the hon. Member for Ashford nor the
right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe would ever try
to talk down their own constituencies. I preface my comments with that,
because I know that they do not want to do that. However, there is
always a danger that, when Members talk in the House about the economic
damage that could be done by one policy or another, they might be seen
to be talking down the potential for economic growth in their
areas.</p><p><a name="06102576000211">The hon.

and a town whose centre has, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, a lot
of regeneration potential will be undiminished. It would be risky for
us to suggest that Ashford&#146;s economic prospects were anything
other than rosy, even with the change in the Eurostar
timetable.</p><p><a name="06102576000212">I want to
move on to Eurostar and its operations. It is important to be clear
that the Government have no formal powers over Eurostar&#146;s
operational decisions and that the company is at liberty to set its own
timetables. It does not operate in the same way as a conventional UK
train operating company running on the national rail network. However,
it does have an obligation to operate a sound commercial
business.</p><p><a name="06102576000213">I would like
to go through the process that Eurostar has undertaken in deciding to
reduce the number of international trains stopping at Ashford. I will
cover it in three parts: the consultations that the company has
undertaken, the proposed service changes for Ashford and Ebbsfleet, and
my understanding of the business rationale for reducing Ashford
services. I hope that that will address the points raised by the right
hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe about the passenger
survey.</p><p><a name="06102576000214">Richard Brown,
the chief executive of Eurostar, told my Department that he has
personally met with representatives from local authorities including
Ashford borough council and Kent county council, and local MPs
including the hon. Member for Ashford, to explain the business
rationale behind the changes at Ashford. Eurostar also advised London
TravelWatch and Passenger Focus of the proposed changes. It spoke to
the Government office for the south-east, which is part of the
Department of Communities and Local Government, and Locate in Kent, the
inward investment agency. I do not think it can be said that Eurostar
failed to consult.</p><p><a name="06102576000215">Nor
can Eurostar be accused of ignoring the views that were put to it.
Following consultation with Kent county council, it agreed to introduce
an additional stop at Lille on the daily service to Disneyland to
provide Ashford with a connection to Brussels, and following
consultation with Ashford borough council, it also agreed to revise the
timing of the first departure to Paris, to suit local people
better.</p><p><a name="06102576000216">Eurostar is
continuing its dialogue with Kent county council, which is the
statutory transport authority, and sharing and explaining the research
and analysis undertaken to develop future stopping patterns. It is
perhaps worth mentioning that Eurostar remains committed to Ashford in
another respect: it will retain its contact centre in the town, which
provides employment for some 300 people. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman will welcome
that.</p><p><a name="06102576000217">From the date of
the opening of Ebbsfleet station next autumn, Eurostar will have 16 or
17 trains each day from London to Paris, and 10 to Brussels. Seven of
the Paris trains and five of the Brussels trains will stop at
Ebbsfleet. The opening of Ebbsfleet has led Eurostar to revise its
overall stopping pattern to reflect the expected future demand at the
two stations in Kent. As a consequence, Ashford will retain three of
the current six trains a day to Paris, as well as a weekly service to
Avignon in the summer and to the French Alps in the

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 445WH</b><br>winter. With those destinations, 83 per cent. of
the current demand at Ashford will continue to be served by direct
services.</p><p><a name="06102576000218">As I
mentioned earlier, the daily Disney train&#151;I do not know whether
that is its formal title&#151;will in future also stop at Lille to
provide a TGV connection to Brussels. I accept that there may be a
residual demand for a direct service between Ashford and Brussels that
will not be met by those alternative arrangements. However, the truth
is that Eurostar have assessed the demand as being too small to be
commercially viable. It has said that trains to Paris will be timed to
suit both business and leisure travellers, and it has adjusted the
departure times following consultation with Ashford borough
council.</p><p><a name="06102576000219">Before I go
any further, let me say for the record that the hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right to raise these matters on behalf of his constituents.
He is doing exactly what a good constituency MP should do, and I hope
that in the rest of my contribution I will be able to offer him some
reassurance that the Government take the matter
seriously.</p><p><a name="06102576000220">Timetables
are valid for one-year periods, so there is an annual opportunity to
review stopping patterns and to alter them in the light of changing
demand. Eurostar is committed to working with the local authorities,
with the objective of helping to grow demand and, in turn, the number
of services at Ashford in the longer
term.</p><p><a name="06102576000221">This point is
worth emphasising. Current plans for Ashford reflect the current
position, but Eurostar has the flexibility to revise the timetable to
suit future changes in demand. Therefore, the comments made by the
right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe about timetables
being set in stone and the difficulty in changing a service pattern
once it is established are not valid. There will be an opportunity to
review passenger numbers and the success of the new service over the
next few years. It is not in Eurostar&#146;s commercial interests to
ignore genuine demand where it exists, and it is clear that additional
stops at Ashford could be reintroduced in the future if passenger
demand warranted
them.</p><p><a name="06102576000222">I offer some
further advice to the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. and learned
Gentleman. Because of the apparent reluctance of Eurostar to provide
the methodology and the full details of its customer service survey,
there is a suggestion that perhaps it is hiding something, but I
emphasise that Eurostar has no vested interest in reducing passenger
numbers. It is a commercial company, as I said, and it is important for
it to maximise its market. If it genuinely believed that maintaining
the current service pattern would increase its profits and passenger
numbers, it would do so. It is not credible to suggest that the company
is moving to Ebbsfleet in order to reduce passenger
numbers.</p><p><a name="06102576000223"><b><a name="61025h0002.htm_spnew455"><a name="06102576000600">Mr.

Harris:</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes a valid
point, and I am glad that he clarified the position. However, as I
said, there will be an opportunity to review timetables and service
patterns after the new service begins next
year.</p><p><a name="06102576000225">Since its
opening in 1996, Ashford International station has provided a valuable
alternative to passengers who want to use Eurostar but want to avoid
travelling into central London to join the train. The reason for
reducing the number of trains stopping at Ashford is, of course, the
opening of a second station in Kent at Ebbsfleet, which is
strategically located close to the A2 and M25&#151;perhaps too close,
as the hon. Member for Ashford would
claim.</p><p><a name="06102576000226">Eurostar
carried out detailed research over 18 months which shows that Ebbsfleet
serves a much larger catchment area than Ashford. Indeed,
Ebbsfleet&#146;s catchment area is enormous, with 10 million
potential travellers. It extends around the M25 and will open up new
markets for Eurostar. By contrast, the catchment area for Ashford is
geographically large, but the level of patronage on Eurostar is quite
low. Eurostar&#146;s research has shown that up to two thirds of the
passengers who currently travel to Ashford will find Ebbsfleet equally
or more convenient, and Ebbsfleet will be served by international
trains to Paris, Brussels and
Lille.</p><p><a name="06102576000227">Eurostar
believes that, following the opening of Ebbsfleet, the residual number
of passengers wishing to travel from Ashford to Brussels will be fewer
than 20 per train, which is too few commercially to justify a direct
service. Indeed, there is a serious threat that stopping Eurostar
services at Ashford as well as Ebbsfleet would extend journey times to
the extent that more passengers would be lost than gained. The current
journey time between London and Paris will be cut by 20 minutes when
the new channel tunnel rail link opens. To have two stops, one at
Ebbsfleet and one at Ashford, would almost take away that
advantage.</p><p><a name="06102576000228"><b><a name="61025h0002.htm_spnew457"><a name="06102576000602">Damian
Green:</b> The Minister has been very generous in giving way.
I heard what he is saying almost word for word from the mouth of
Eurostar&#146;s chief executive at the meeting that we had with the
company. The point that was made then is that trains do not need to
stop at both places. They can alternate, with some stopping at Ashford
and some at Ebbsfleet. That would address the time
issue.</p><p><a name="06102576000229"><b><a name="61025h0002.htm_spnew458"><a name="06102576000603">Mr.
Harris:</b> That is a valid point, and, as I said before,
there will be an opportunity to address such issues once the timetable
is up and running. However, based on passenger numbers and the
information that is available to the Department and to the hon.
Gentleman, it is difficult to justify the existing timetable if
Eurostar&#146;s commercial obligations are taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06102576000230">It is also
worth noting that more than 500,000 people a week visit Bluewater
shopping centre, which is close to Ebbsfleet. By contrast, Ebbsfleet
itself will be used by fewer than 25,000 passengers per week. Locally,

Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley) (Lab):</b> I thank you for
facilitating this debate, Mrs. Dean, and I thank the
Minister for attending to respond to it. The subject is important.
Manufacturing is still one of the mainstays of the UK economy, and we
ought not to lose sight of that. No matter how many people want to talk
manufacturing down, we are in the Chamber to talk it up. I am sure that
we will have a good response from my right hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06102576000234">UK manufacturing has faced
turbulent periods, which is why the debate is extremely timely. We have
had bad news, we have had good news and we have had indifferent news.
It is the good, the bad and the ugly of the UK car and component
manufacturing industry that we want to discuss. We need to ensure that
the debate is a serious one. It is about the future of car component
manufacturing in this country. It is not a forum for scoring political
points, but a means of raising the genuine concerns of Members of
Parliament. Amicus, the Transport and General Workers Union and other
unions have been involved and they have the same worries about the
future of manufacturing in the UK. We need to get the message across,
and that is what we will try to do.</p><p><a name="06102576000235">There is no doubt that the UK
manufacturing sector is changing fast, with many worrying signals as
well as reasons to be optimistic, which I shall come to. If we look
back to 1996, the Ford Motor Company was producing cars in the UK, as
were Rover Group and General Motors. The Vauxhall brand was dominant.
Those were the major players. Rover Group, which was once the fourth
largest car manufacturer, is now gone. Ford no longer builds a
Ford-badged car here. Of course, GM also lost one of its assembly
plants. We have seen a real difference since
1996.</p><p><a name="06102576000236"><b><a name="61025h0003.htm_spnew460"><a name="06102576000605">Mr.

to have opened Ford&#146;s bank statement this week. It has
struggled, and the debate is about the premier brands of the automotive

of it coming good. It is a tragedy that Aston Martin was put up for

have continued within those premier brands. I hope that Ford will
reconsider because Jaguar has a future. As my hon. Friend the Member

that the police are not using Jaguars. Why do they have to use other

news has not been good&#151;far from it&#151;with 900 job losses at
Ellesmere Port and the decision to close Peugeot at Ryton, with the
loss of 2,300 jobs. It is not just about the jobs that have been
lost&#151;far from it&#151;but about the back-up effect on the
component sector and the loss of hidden jobs. We can see the direct
impact of a car plant closing, but we cannot see the impact on the
supply chain, which could be as much as four or five times worse. We
cannot really measure it.</p><p><a name="06102576000243">Every time there is bad news we
have to look not only to the headline figure but to the hidden figure
and the component sector, because it is just as important as car
production. We must remember that the likes of Rover and Jaguar get a
lot of their components from the UK. We know that other manufacturers
are basically an assembly plant, and we need to persuade them to invest
more in components from the UK. That is part of the problem that we
must address.</p><p><a name="06102576000244">It is
not good news for the people of Coventry. The first bad news came from
Jaguar, although I know that it only moved up the road. Then they found
out that Peugeot had misled everyone. It had been offered a Government
loan in the form of a &#163;15 million grant, but it turned its back
on Coventry at the last minute. That is the kind of tragedy that I
despise the most. I admire the French for putting France and French
industry first, and we are seeing a shake out, but I hope that we will
do the same.</p><p><a name="06102576000245">Let us
not buy Peugeot and Citroen products. Maybe they will then consider how
important the UK market is. They have a large share of the UK

absolutely appalling. Peugeot should stand by the loyal workers that
made Ryton one of its profitable sites. It was not losing money, but
just needed more investment and a new model to come down the line.
Peugeot has misled the people of Coventry, the regional development
agency and the Government. Such car producers are the unacceptable face
of manufacturing.</p><p><a name="06102576000246">I
hope that we will start to learn a little more from the French and
start to back the British car industry. As has been pointed out, the
Government must set the example. We must ensure that we do not lose any
more car plants and we must see continuing growth. Unfortunately, this
week we heard similar news about TVR in the north-west, not far from my
constituency. TVR produces its famous cars in Blackpool, but a Russian
entrepreneur came over and demonstrated the danger of foreign investors
buying out British companies. They do not have the same affinity. He
might say that he was slightly misled when he bought the company, but
TVR has always produced in Blackpool. Now it seems easier to move
production to Europe. It is a worry.</p><p><a name="06102576000247">The 260 jobs that Blackpool
could lose are quality skilled jobs in the north-west and that is a
tragedy. It is also tragedy for the components sector, because it has a
knock-on effect. It is a great worry. As Kevin Morley, the BBC
automotive industry analyst, stated:</p><a name="61025h0003.htmbrev_105"><a name="06102576000500"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If you cannot make
cars, then you do not do manufacturing, and yet we have the finest
automotive engineers in the world here in
Britain.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000248">We build some
of the best racing cars, the best technology comes out of the UK and we
have the best research and development. We must see that transferred
into production. Production must be the backbone of the industry, and
we must get manufacturing back and up to where it ought to
be&#151;leading the rest of Europe. We want to see the investment of
the 1980s and 1990s continue in this new millennium. We must look at
that and ensure that we are the best place to do business.</p><p><a name="06102576000249">I know that global forces can
dictate the actions of multinational companies, but the Government
can still take action to support and promote UK manufacturing.
As I said, they should lead by example, show their patriotism to the
country&#146;s hard-working people by backing British manufacturing
and ensure that all Government cars are built in the UK.</p><p><a name="06102576000250">That principle should be
extended to chief constables. We should remind them where the money
that pays for our police force comes from. Do they think it comes from
Japan, or even Germany or Korea? No, they get it from the British
public. The least that chief constables could do is to start buying
British. They buy Astras, but not the bigger cars. When did we last see
them use a Jaguar, to name just one model? When did we last see a
Transit? Most of the larger vehicles are Mercedes. Much more can be
done, not only with cars but with the light commercial vehicle sector
as well. It is time for chief constables to start leading by example.
It is not good to see so many BMWs and
Mercedes.</p><p><a name="06102576000251">The Highways
Agency buys a few Discoverys&#151;we see them travelling up and down
the motorways&#151;but what other vehicles does it use? Mitsubishi
has no plant here, and Nissan four-wheel drive vehicles are not built

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 451WH</b><br>here. Why is the Highways Agency not buying the
best four-wheel drive vehicles that are built in the midlands? It is
absurd that it runs four different types of vehicle. It makes no sense.
Bearing in mind the scale on which it buys vehicles, it would be better
to buy from one supplier, and it should be British. We need to take
that message back to organisations such as the Highways Agency and the
police.</p><p><a name="06102576000252">What about
the ambulance service, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton,
North-East (Mr. Crausby) mentioned? Why are ambulances made
by Renault or Mercedes? The home of the Transit is at Southampton. We
should be using Transits or LDV vans from Birmingham. It is the same
with the fire brigade. Why should brigades buy Scania and Volvo? What
is wrong with them buying DAF trucks built at Leyland?</p><p><a name="06102576000253">A lot of good vehicles are made
in Britain, but we have to persuade Departments and agencies to start
backing British manufacturing. Let us show our mettle. Let us copy the
French, the Italians and the Germans. Let us use the same playing field
instead of the unfair playing field that causes such unfair
competition. People wonder why it is not happening and why Ministers do
not use British-built cars. It is a shame, and I am sure that it is
something that the Minister will put right. As I say, we must reverse
that trend.</p><p><a name="06102576000254">It is an
easy option for multinational companies, including car producers, to
turn their backs on the UK when the economy is not running well.
Whenever General Motors or Peugeot want a better financial result, what
do they do? They turn their backs on the UK and close their plants
here. Why? Because it is easier to do that. It is so much cheaper to
make someone redundant in the UK than it is in France, Italy or
Germany. We should not have to pay that price.
</p><p><a name="06102576000255">We need an equal
playing field, so that British workers have the same rights as those in
other EU countries. It is appalling that it is cheaper, easier and
quicker to sack someone here. People say, &#147;Is the plant
profitable? Yes, but it&#146;s cheaper to get rid of the workers. We
don&#146;t have to wait 12 months&#148;&#151; or however long it
takes in Germany. People can be made redundant virtually overnight in
this country, and that is unacceptable. It needs to be changed. We must
ensure that people are not made redundant simply because it is easier.
Companies must be made to realise that our workers have the same
rights. I hope that the Minister will do something about that. It is
important that we take up the challenge.</p><p><a name="06102576000256">Ensuring that we have a safer
manufacturing industry and component sector and strengthening
employment rights is the first challenge. The second is dealing with
what happens when car companies begin to look at the books. The Select
Committee on Trade and Industry found that people in the UK feel
disadvantaged when it comes to energy costs. The problem is that our
energy companies are failing us because energy more expensive here than
it is for our competitors abroad.</p><p><a name="06102576000257">That disadvantage is the result
of the failure of energy companies to invest in storage facilities. If
only we had had the storage facilities the other week, when it was not
possible to give gas away, we could have back-filled them with gas,
which would have guaranteed cheaper energy. We could have energy at a

recognise that energy is a problem.</p><p><a name="06102576000258">We need the Government to play
a part. If companies fail to invest, I hope that the Government will
either force them to invest or invest for them and then charge them.
That is how we can get a better and more stable economy for our
manufacturing industry. It is about a level playing field. However we
might look at it, we have to prevent people from taking the easy
option. Those are the key factors. The cost difference in heavy energy
use of between 20 and 30 per cent. is another key factor. I hope the
Minister takes that on board. Addressing that problem would help to
reduce prices and ensure that we are more competitive. The Government
need to take the lead on those challenges. We have to support UK
industry and ensure that all workers have the same rights.</p><p><a name="06102576000259">The Warwick agreement is a lot
of fine words, with which we all agree, but we know that it has failed.
Although it has been successful in some areas, in others it has let us
down. The fact is that Government procurement was meant to support UK
industry. We have seen examples of when that procurement should have
happened but did not, as with textiles, which moved to China. We would
not have broken any laws had we done that&#151;far from it. Those
goods should have been manufactured here. Instead, the Government
contracts ended up in Chinese factories. It is not
acceptable.</p><p><a name="06102576000260">Procurement can make a real
difference. We must ensure that the Warwick agreement is held up as a
good example of best practice in supporting UK industry and
manufacturing. We have to get behind it, because it could make a
difference, especially to the midlands and the north, which have been
struggling. The agreement can help, because Government procurement
leads by example, and there is a lot of money to be spent. We need to
ensure that it is spent here, in support of UK jobs. I hope that we
start to get that right.</p><p><a name="06102576000261">As I said, there are many
troubles in UK manufacturing, but there are also many positives. It is
interesting to note that Honda is adding another shift, with further
expansion&#151;that is good news&#151;as are Toyota and Nissan, and
the Mini is bringing engine production back to the UK. There are many
success stories, and we have to build on that success, but it does not
always support the UK component industry. We have to persuade companies
not only that the UK is good for manufacturing but that it is good for
supplying components. That is what needs to be pushed. We have to make
the car industry realise how important the component industry is to the
UK and that it is a quality product that can be delivered on
time.</p><p><a name="06102576000262">We have some of
the most skilled, able and dedicated workers in the world. We should
not to lose sight of that. It is said that people can retrain, but why
should they? Why should we lose a shift at Ellesmere Port? They are
skilled people. We should ensure that GM understands that future
Government procurement will be based on who builds here. That is what
we have to get across.</p><p><a name="06102576000263">Our facilities are the among
the best in the world. We have the best technology, some of the best

of good news and congratulate the whole Cowley work force on the
outstanding achievements of the BMW Group in producing the Mini. Like
other long-standing centres of vehicle production, Cowley has had its
ups and downs. Some of the downs were nearly fatal. The plant teetered
on the brink of closure in the 1980s and had a succession of different
owners&#151;not an unfamiliar story in the car industry&#151;from
the British Motor Corporation to British Leyland, and from Austin Rover
to British Aerospace, Rover and the BMW Group. While there were some
real achievements during that time, there were also a lot of false
dawns and a lot of managerial industrial relations failures. It was not
a particularly happy or secure period for the work force or the local
community.</p><p><a name="06102576000275">Today, six
years after the BMW Group took full control of the plant in its own
right, it is a very different story&#151;indeed, it is a success
story. The key ingredients of that are long-term investment;
partnership with the trade unions and the work force; a brilliant
product that is very carefully researched, designed and marketed; and
production to the highest quality standards, which can be achieved only
with investment in plant and equipment, and in the skills and
commitment of the work force.</p><p><a name="06102576000276">The key statistics include more
than &#163;380 million invested in upgrading and expanding the Cowley
production facilities. The work force, down to 1,500 in 2000, stand at
4,500, with another 200 recently taken on for the new generation of the
Mini&#151;launched by the my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. The
work force skills mix has been enriched as part of BMW&#146;s
commitment to long-term skills planning and the Cowley plant has an
apprenticeship scheme with more than 115 apprentices between the ages
of 16 and 21. They are undertaking a three to four-year apprenticeship
with the opportunity to gain a degree while

resulted from the BMW Group&#146;s skill in bringing to fruition what
would be a tough challenge in any industry: the reinvention and
complete reconstruction of an iconic brand, through the commitment of
the Cowley work force to making a success of it. Going back to the
roots of that, there were some far-sighted and brave decisions by shop
stewards to make a success of partnership. They fought for their
members&#146; interests while recognising that there had to be a
successful plant for their members to have an interest in.</p><p><a name="06102576000281">There are other important
lessons and hopeful signs for other areas of the automotive industry.
Indeed, certain developments confound some of the conventional wisdom
on global manufacturing. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley
mentioned the importance of components, and rightly so. When Mini
production started at Cowley, the proportion of components that were UK
produced was 40 per cent. It is now up to 60 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06102576000282">BMW Group has
established a manufacturing triangle with Cowley as the production
centre, body pressings in Swindon and engine manufacture at Hams Hall.
Those engines were previously manufactured at Curitiba in Brazil. It is
interesting to note that the BMW Group explained that it repatriated
engine manufacture for the flexibility of just-in-time production, and
because it is more efficient and cost-effective to have the engines
made 70 miles up the road in a state-of-the-art engine plant than for
them to be made several thousand miles away.</p><p><a name="06102576000283">That is a positive story, and I
am confident there are a lot more chapters to go. It is an example of
how Britain can compete successfully with the best in global
manufacturing. The key is to have a business committed in the long-term
to working in a framework of economic stability and that designs its
models carefully for what customers want and are prepared to pay. It
should invest in the long-term and have a skilled and flexible work
force equally committed to quality. BMW Group in the UK is an
outstanding example of British-German partnership, but most importantly
everyone at Cowley is proud to be part of a British manufacturing
success story. That should be
celebrated.</p><p><a name="06102576000284">The last
time my right hon. Friend the Minister visited my constituency, she
went to a disabled workshop and bought a very good garden bench. The
next time she visits, she must come to the Cowley car plant and buy a
Mini.</p><br>

Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) on securing this important
debate and on the manner in which he introduced it. As the Chairman of
the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, I am privileged to have him
as a member of my Committee&#151;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]
</i>I will not say that it is a dubious privilege.</p><p><a name="06102576000286">The Select Committee is coming
to the end of an inquiry on the reasons for success and failure in the
automotive sector, although we had hoped to have produced the report by
now. In that respect, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Northfield (Richard Burden) for the excellent evidence that he gave us,
which came out of concern about the Rover group. However, the inquiry
is being held up because we are waiting for further evidence from
Advantage West Midlands, although I hope that we will finalise the
report when it
arrives.</p><p><a name="06102576000287">We are also
considering the broader issues facing manufacturing industry, and we
have touched on many of those outlined by the hon. Member for Chorley.
In particular, we are looking at public procurement, which has big
ramifications not only for the car industry, but for many other parts
of British manufacturing.</p><p><a name="06102576000288">I want to echo the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comment that energy costs have recently emerged as a
major issue for UK manufacturers. The Committee has received evidence
on that issue, and he is right to highlight it. We cannot afford to be
complacent. However, I also want to challenge him a little on his
definition of Britishness. I had the privilege of being a special
adviser in the Department in the
mid-1980s.</p><p><a name="06102576000289"><b><a name="61025h0003.htm_spnew471"><a name="06102576000616">Mr.

Luff:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that it is my fault, but he
should wait to hear what I am going to say. The Secretary of State at
the time&#151;now Lord Young of Graffham&#151;had a clear
industrial strategy and sought to attract to the UK all the
internationally mobile major car investment going. He played a big part
in getting Toyota, Nissan and Honda here, and they have had precisely
the effect that we hoped
for.</p><p><a name="06102576000291">In that respect,
I was powerfully struck by something that I was told anecdotally by a
constituent who made car components before the Japanese companies
arrived. He said that the big motor manufacturers procured their
components from companies on the basis of who bought them the best
lunch. It was not the quality of the component, but what was on their
plate that dictated who got the contract. The Japanese had no truck
with that, and I am sure that they have played a major part in driving
up standards in the UK component industry, much of which, I am glad to
say, is located in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06102576000292">I am
afraid that I also disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#151;I suspect
that we will have a debate on this in the Select Committee&#151;about
his point that people in this country are easy to sack. People here
might be easy to sack, but it is also easy to establish a business
here, which is one reason for Nissan, Toyota

Gentleman&#151;perhaps I should call him my hon. Friend, for these

say that buying British means buying from any company that is committed
to the UK. For someone who does not want a Mini, buying a BMW 1, 2 or 3

Burden (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</b> I echo other hon.
Members in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley
(Mr. Hoyle) on securing the debate. Much of what he said
struck a chord with me, and that was particularly true of his comments
on the responsibility of public authorities to have some regard to the
effect of their decisions on British manufacturing.</p><p><a name="06102576000295">As my hon. Friend
said&#151;the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff) also
referred to this, and I thank him for his comments&#151;I had the
privilege of representing Longbridge when MG Rover was in operation
there. The causes of MG Rover&#146;s ultimate demise are complex, and
today is not the time to go into them, but I say to my right hon.
Friend the Minister that we hope it will not be too much longer before
the official investigation into MG Rover reports, because people in the
area want to see the results. I know that the matter is not entirely in
her control, but I hope that she will pass the message
on.</p><p><a name="06102576000296">There was constant
concern among workers and members of the community about the fact that
vehicles manufactured at Longbridge, such as the MG ZT and the Rover
75, were not being used by police forces, although I do not say that
that was the cause of the company&#146;s demise. My hon. Friend the
Member for Chorley is right, however, that the same point can also be
made about Jaguars and some other
vehicles.</p><p><a name="06102576000297">Given the
situation facing Peugeot, memories of the 6,000 people who lost their
jobs at MG Rover last year have come back to all of us in the west
midlands. Again, it would be wrong to go into the issue in detail, and
there is not enough time to do so today, but I urge all hon. Members
and the Minister, who was present for some of our earlier debates, to
look again at the important words of my hon. Friend the Member for
Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) and other Coventry Members,
who have spoken in recent Adjournment debates about the disgraceful way
that Peugeot has behaved over the Ryton plant.</p><p><a name="06102576000298">I am pleased to say that the
vast majority of former Longbridge employees have now got other jobs.
That is good news, but it is important that we set it in perspective: a
substantial minority still do not have jobs, and those who do are often
on much lower pay rates. It is therefore important that we do not
abandon those people.</p><br>

Government set up has achieved a great deal, and I pay credit to it and
its successor body. However, it is important that that work goes on.
Not all the money that the Government allocated to the issue has been
spent. If the needs are still there, it is important that the money is
still there. Indeed, I shall be speaking to my right hon. Friend the
Minister in just a couple of hours about some of the issues involved.
However, I make this appeal to her: we should not be over-concerned
about whether money is allocated in one financial year rather than
another. The really important thing is what the money is needed for and
what use it should be put
to.</p><p><a name="06102576000300">As regards the
future for Longbridge, the Chinese firm Nanjing Automobile Corporation
has guaranteed that it will be producing MG sports cars at the plant
from next year. That is good news, and I wish the company the best of
luck. However, although the announcement that Nanjing will locate its
European headquarters at Longbridge is welcome, we need to think about
what else needs to happen, because the future of Longbridge and, in
many ways, the British car industry can be about much more. Part of
that future should involve looking at where our strengths have been,
still are and will be in
future.</p><p><a name="06102576000301">My hon. Friend
the Member for Chorley referred to performance engineering, and motor
sports technology is also relevant in many ways. Just two weeks ago,
the final round of the British touring car championship took place at
Silverstone. The car that won was a Honda, and the firm running it was
a performance wheel manufacturer called Rimstock, which is based in
West Bromwich. Interestingly, two teams in that performance series were
running on bioethanol and one was running MGs. There is huge potential
for synergies in the performance engineering and environmental
technology fields. I hope that Longbridge can be part of that and that
the Government can take an active role in promoting such
ventures.</p><p><a name="06102576000302">Such things
can also happen in other parts of the motor industry. Just down the
road in the west midlands, at Fen End in Warwickshire, the performance
engineering firm Prodrive has just secured final confirmation that it
has received planning permission, so a Formula 1 car produced in
Warwickshire will be on the grid from
2008.</p><p><a name="06102576000303">Tata and
Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation&#151;erstwhile partners of
MG Rover&#151;also have committed to new design centres.
Nanjing&#146;s supplier Stadco is moving to the Longbridge plant to
build bodies. JCB in Staffordshire is collaborating with Ricardo
Consulting Engineers to produce state-of-the-art diesel engines. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)
rightly paid tribute to the work of BMW at Cowley and, significantly,
to the production of the new generation of engines at Hams
Hall.</p><p><a name="06102576000304">There are
therefore several different examples of where we are succeeding in new
areas and with traditional, iconic brands. My hon. Friend the Member
for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon) referred to Ford, Land
Rover and Jaguar. Equally, London Taxi International has just teamed up
with a Chinese partner, which will, I hope, see their production
increase tenfold in the midlands.</p><br>

manufacturing plants, and we cannot duck the challenges of
globalisation, but if we stay ahead of the game and play to our
strengths, there can be a bright future not only for manufacturing,
but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East rightly said,
for the components industry. I pay tribute to programmes such as
Accelerate, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. It has
been encouraging components suppliers to improve processes and to get
ahead of the game, and they have been very successful in so doing. Such
programmes were important in ensuring that the loss of MG Rover last
year was not half as serious as it would have been had it happened in
2000.</p><p><a name="06102576000306">There are one or
two things that the Government need to think about, and I want to
describe a couple for the Minister. First, if I am right about the kind
of future that I am sketching out for the motor industry, we need to
think about the supportive mechanisms and attitudes that are needed to
back that up. The planning system has a role. It is right that we
involve local people in planning decisions and that we look to protect
the environment, but there should be a framework of trying to make
things happen, rather than always getting in the way of things
happening. That is very much the view of people living in and around
Longbridge.</p><p><a name="06102576000307">These
days, we all celebrate motor sport and performance engineering, which I
have mentioned today. However, we need to think about whether all
Departments of State, parts of local government and different agencies
are working together to make those as effective as possible, and
whether we are using the expertise of our performance engineers as
effectively as we can to meet the environmental challenge. As I say,
the synergies are there. The Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership, for
example, has done some great work, but are we really doing all we can
to be world beaters in the business of alternative fuels? Could we do
more on biofuels or, for the long-term future, on hydrogen
power?</p><p><a name="06102576000308">We need to
consider those issues, as well as planning policies. We need to examine
whether our industrial policies link with our environmental policies.
Equally, we should consider whether they both link with our transport
policies and whether we are using the transport innovation fund, for
example, as creatively as we can to obtain the spin-off industrial and
technological benefits, as well as the transport benefits.
</p><p><a name="06102576000309">We have a proud
manufacturing history. In Longbridge, we know that the tenacity and
skills of the work force and the vision of people such as Herbert
Austin built the 20th century for Austin in Longbridge. The tenacity
and skills of the work force there, and those of the motor industry,
can now also build a future. It will be a different future, but I think
it can be a bright
one.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025h0003.htmordayhd_46"><a name="06102576000522">3.12

Mark Todd (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> South Derbyshire is
arguably the heart of UK manufacturing. Nearly a third of the work
force there are employed in manufacturing, which is more than double
the average for a UK constituency, and it is home to a wide variety of
companies. I shall concentrate on one of those.

have Futaba, which makes car parts for Toyota and other car
manufacturers. We make steel frames and aircraft parts, and innovative
electric power systems for high-performance vehicles. The area is a
centre of expertise, hard work and innovation, with committed workers
who know what they are doing and owners who are committed to the future
of their businesses.</p><p><a name="06102576000312">I
want to focus on Toyota, which is also based in my constituency. It is,
I think, the most successful car company in the world, and 4,200 people
are employed at Burnaston, out of the 4,800 in the UK. That is based on
an investment over the past 14 years of nearly &#163;2 billion. The
plant makes two lines: the Avensis, which I drive&#151;I do not
suppose that I could get away with driving much else, as I live a mile
and a half from the plant that makes them&#151;and the Corolla. They
are vehicles that I commend in public purchasing terms, and certainly
commend to other Members of Parliament. Sometimes when one wanders into
the Members&#146; car park, the number of British-made cars sitting
down there is
noticeable.</p><p><a name="06102576000313">Annual
production of vehicles at the plant is coming up for 285,000, because a
major investment has facilitated further expansion of annual production
for this year, and it is used as a source of advice on manufacturing
and process quality. The Toyota production system is taught to many
people, including those from the public sector who come to learn about
how processes can be organised and how teams can work together to
produce high-quality
output.</p><p><a name="06102576000314">Eighty-five
per cent. of the Burnaston production is exported, including a
proportion that goes to Japan. In 2005, Burnaston produced its 2
millionth vehicle, and it makes a net contribution of &#163;400
million a year to our balance of payments&#151;which is not to be
sneezed at. A point that has not yet been picked up in the debate is
the fact that such major manufacturing investments make an important
contribution to UK plc&#146;s trading status as a
nation.</p><p><a name="06102576000315">Burnaston is
now also a training facility for Toyota employees across Europe. I am
pleased that my constituency has been chosen as the base for people
learning how to produce in the Toyota way. It also has an enviable
reputation as a general car manufacturer: we have already heard about
the Toyota Prius, which is a vehicle with a dual power system that is
often used in the ministerial fleet. My right hon. Friend the Minister
may go around in one&#151;I do not
know.</p><p><a name="06102576000316">The plant, which
I commend as a place to visit, if the Minister has the pleasure of
visiting South Derbyshire&#151;I am sure that Toyota would welcome
that too&#151;also has a strong focus on the reuse of materials.
Anything that can be reused is put aside for recycling or repurposing.
It is a model employer and manufacturer, and, when we consider the
global statistics, a manufacturer that is winning the race worldwide,
not just in
Britain.</p><p><a name="06102576000317">All that is
very positive, and it is my core message: we can succeed in making cars
in the UK. Toyota proves that. However, what do such companies need? My

(Mr. Smith) rightly mentioned the importance of a stable
economy. Toyota always makes that point: it wants a clear environment
in which it can invest in the future, knowing that something desperate
will not happen in six months that dramatically changes the mechanism
of its business. That includes relative stability of exchange rates. It
is a major trading force, as I have emphasised, and it is important
that the Government have made admirable progress there. While we have
not joined the euro, in the past two years we have, nevertheless, had
relative stability in exchange rates with the euro, which has helped
companies such as Toyota to predict costs in the relevant
area.</p><p><a name="06102576000318">Energy costs
have been touched on and I shall not discuss them again, but a critical
area is logistics. South Derbyshire is right in the middle of the UK.

her comments on what progress might be made, because Toyota is an
enthusiastic supporter of the
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06102576000319">My last
point is that we need a regulatory framework that is sympathetic to
manufacturing activity and takes account of the competitive environment

Everyone has worked together to recognise the sector and played their
part.</p><p><a name="06102576000323">The Nissan plant
produces nearly a third of a million Micra, Almera and Primera models
each year. It now accounts for one in five of all cars produced in the
UK. Nissan works closely with the university of Sunderland and with
local colleges. A two-year foundation degree&#151;the first&#151;in
lean manufacturing has just been launched in the north-east, with more
than 40 students enrolling. Sunderland has also been selected to take
forward production of a new sport utility vehicle range, with
&#163;500 million of investment and the creation of a further 400
jobs.</p><p><a name="06102576000324">The plant is
highly technically advanced. A total of 435 functioning robots provide
for nearly 80 per cent. automation of the assembly process at the
plant. About 75 per cent. of production is exported, with markets in 45
countries, including Nissan&#146;s home nation of Japan. Nissan
contributes about &#163;500 million to the local economy each year,
with 240 suppliers in the region. Nissan&#146;s total investment
exceeds &#163;2 billion, with about 5,000 people employed at the
plant.</p><p><a name="06102576000325">Nissan has also
been the agency for creating a large supply base in the region with
significant suppliers, including Hashimoto, Magna Kansei, Calsonic
Kansei, TRW Automotive and Johnson Controls. Much of that work is
concentrated around Sunderland, and the city continues to build on its
worldwide reputation as a centre for car manufacturing. The sector

Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab):</b> My experience of
the motor manufacturing industry goes back more than 30 years. In those
days, I regularly used to visit the Standard Triumph factory in Speke,
which has long since closed for what are now obvious reasons. It was a
depressing, noisy place, with bad human resources practices, and the
products were not of the highest quality. There was no vision for the
future and no ambition at the time. Sadly, that reflected the period in
which we were
living.</p><p><a name="06102576000328">The Government
have changed the emphasis quite considerably, but we need more vision
now. I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Northfield (Richard Burden) on that. We need a vision that encompasses
a strategic future that engages the hydrogen fuel cell industry.
Otherwise, it will end up in Germany. We need a vision that engages
bioethanol products. I saw the same race on television. Knowing my hon.
Friend&#146;s love of the sport, I am sure that he was there. We need
to engage the performance industry as
well.</p><p><a name="06102576000329">I agree with the
comments about public procurement. The strategy on public procurement
is important because it sends a powerful message. The fact that many

police forces drove the vehicle and there was not significant public
procurement of the vehicle, the company would perhaps focus elsewhere.
I shall return to that
issue.</p><p><a name="06102576000330">We have to
recognise that we are now dealing with global vehicles, which are
designed by giant corporations seeking to meet market needs across the
world. My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr.
Smith) is fantastically lucky that his area is hitting the world market
from the very good factory there. We need to recognise, though, that
many vehicles are manufactured in a large number of countries and we
have to ensure that, if we are in this for the long term, the strategic
changes that we engage in make sense in relation to the needs of those
big corporations.</p><p><a name="06102576000331">My
hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) mentioned
energy, which is a huge issue. In relation to the Vauxhall bid, we are
working closely with the company not only on engaging with our friends
in the Treasury about energy prices in this country, but on finding
innovative solutions, working with energy suppliers in the area that
might be able to make provision directly into the grid. Such innovation
is highly
desirable.</p><p><a name="06102576000332">We have
also been working on estate management and ensuring that the estate is
fit for purpose, because it was designed in a different era of vehicle
manufacturing, when it was quite common to have long rambling
production lines that did not make a great deal of sense in terms of
integration, because that was not the way in which production worked. A
huge amount of work is taking place on that. My right hon. Friend the
Minister may have seen, in a paper that I sent to my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week, that we have achieved a deal
on the rates for the building, putting them in line with the rates that
apply to Gliwice in Poland and thus removing one of the obstacles that
would mean that we lost out on the
bid.</p><p><a name="06102576000333">A huge amount of
work is taking place on training with the Northwest Development Agency.
This is enormously important. If we are going to take a vehicle such as
the Astra platform, the next model, forward over the projected 15
years, we must have the most highly trained work force to be able to
compete with sister plants elsewhere in
Europe.</p><p><a name="06102576000334">My hon. Friend
the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) touched on the
transport infrastructure. It is utterly absurd that a railway siding
goes through the Vauxhall factory, yet not one single component travels
on railways. I shall not make a party political point, but the reason
for that goes back to the failure of Railtrack, which simply was not
interested in the business. Therefore, Vauxhall has invested in fleets
of lorries, and its actions, together with those of all the other
manufacturers in my area, cause the clogging of the M6. If anyone wants
to find a quick solution to traffic-flow problems on the M6, they
should invest in rail freight, which would help Vauxhall, Shell and all
the other big players in my
area.</p><p><a name="06102576000335">That type of
cross-cutting Government thinking is needed and we need to send out a
powerful message. I hope that the Minister, in her reply, will do just
that. We need to send to potential investors and, in my case,
particularly to General Motors a powerful message that says that we are
serious about ensuring that we

Burt (Solihull) (LD):</b> I, too, congratulate the hon. Member
for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) on securing today&#146;s important
debate. I come from Solihull, the home of Ford and Land Rover.
Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is delighted that the Freelander rolled
off the production line at Halewood today, but that has been to the
cost of Solihull and 1,200 jobs there. Having said that, because its
hugely successful products contribute enormously to British exports, I
think that Land Rover should be congratulated, as should the other
excellent car production companies that have been mentioned today, such
as Honda, Toyota, Nissan and BMW
Mini.</p><p><a name="06102576000338">The west
midlands has more jobs in car manufacturing than any other region in
Britain: 78,000 jobs. Unfortunately, when Labour came to power it had
95,000. The figure for the drop in car manufacturing from last year to
this, which was released yesterday, is 15 per cent., but I am sure that
the sad tales of Rover and Peugeot have contributed to that. I am
hopeful that there might be something of an upturn next year. If there
is not, it will not be for want of effort on behalf of the excellent
companies that I have
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06102576000339">I want to
discuss car component manufacturers, on whom there are enormous
pressures. It is important that they are located close to car
manufacturers wherever possible because of the pressures of
just-in-time technology, which is hugely valuable, but there are
problems with the transport infrastructure, and it becomes increasingly
problematic when components do not get to their destination within the
required time. </p><p><a name="06102576000340">We are
moving away, particularly in the west midlands, from low added-value
components and the metal-bashing era to using much more technically
challenging, high-spec systems that involve computer-aided design and
electronics. That is a good move because it brings a great deal more
added value in the cars that we manage to export, which is good for our
balance of payments. However, we are a net importer of vehicles to the
tune of 1 million vehicles a year at a cost of almost &#163;6 billion
to the UK economy. Clearly, the more vehicles we manufacture here for
export, the better it will be for prosperity in the country
generally.</p><p><a name="06102576000341">As we are
being technically challenged all the time, particularly with car
components, it is important to keep research and development ahead of
that in China, India and the rest of Europe. We therefore need skills
and investment to create an environment that overseas car manufacturers
will welcome.</p><p><a name="06102576000342">There
seems to be a global problem in car manufacturing with surplus
capacity. Strong unions

of manufacturing cause profit pressures, and the tight margins to which
manufacturers have to work will filter down the supply chain through
price-downs, where suppliers on each tier demand price cuts from the
suppliers below. That phenomenon, and the investment that is required
in research and development and new technology, mean that many car
component companies are highly geared. There is a constant need to
upgrade manufacturing plant and tooling, and they are less able to
withstand the shocks of lack of demand or changes to do with economic
pressures and interest rates, so Government help to a create stable
environment is
important.</p><p><a name="06102576000343">However, it
is not all gloom and doom. The British success stories that we have
discussed are hugely welcome. Foreign manufacturers come to this
country because of flexible jobs. While jobs are very important, the
route to more success is more partnership working between unions and
manufacturers rather than there being a protectionist approach to
British jobs.</p><p><a name="06102576000344">The

this country, yet there are many Renault vehicles on the road. I
totally agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should encourage a better
awareness of where vehicles are made and the link between buying
vehicles that have been made in Britain and the prosperity of Britain.
We do not laud that enough. The game is definitely worth the candle,
but we need skilled people and R and D support. The transport
infrastructure is also important.</p><p><a name="06102576000347">I echo the comments of the hon.

Minister will be able to tell us when the MG report will be
published.</p><p><a name="06102576000350">The
manufacture of cars and their components in this country is an industry
of long significance, and will continue to be of great economic and
technological importance. As we have heard, the industry accounts for
10 per cent. of manufacturing in the UK&#151;&#163;45
billion if we put that into real money&#151;and supports roughly
800,000 jobs. I understand that our exports are worth about &#163;20
billion.</p><p><a name="06102576000351">Despite some
well-reported problems, car production has remained remarkably
steadfast in recent years, and is, roughly speaking, about 1.6 million
vehicles. Several hon. Members alluded to the fact that those figures
do not show the change in the industry&#146;s structure over that
decade. During the period, there has, on the one hand, been the demise
of familiar British names, such as TVR, and, on the other hand, their
replacement by leading overseas players in the industry. It has gone
from being a British car-making industry to being a car-making business
in Britain.</p><p><a name="06102576000352">On the
debit side, MG Rover recently went into administration and Peugeot made
the announcement about its facilities at Ryton and Vauxhall has sought
to cut production of its Astra model with the loss of 900 jobs. No one
in the Chamber, or among our constituents, welcomes the demise of those
enterprises, nor does anyone underestimate the distress that it causes
to hundreds, if not thousands, of workers. The hon. Member for
Birmingham, Northfield highlighted that extremely well. We should also
not forget the many small and medium-sized enterprises in the supply
chain, the component chain, who often do not hit the headlines. They
are often ignored by the national media when this kind of event takes
place.</p><p><a name="06102576000353">On the credit
side, we should not ignore the good news, which the hon.
Member for Chorley mentioned. In Sunderland, Nissan has invested
another &#163;125 million to enable it to build its fifth model in
the UK. In Swindon, Honda has invested up to &#163;1.3
billion so far and is just about to open the new logistics operation. I
am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, and is pleased about, the fact
that Leyland Trucks has turned its plant in Lancashire into the most
productive commercial vehicle plant in Europe. I believe that it turns
out about 15,000 units a year. All of those stories are to be welcomed.
They show that the UK is still able to attract international
investment, but it can do so only if we are able to offer the right
combination of skills and markets.</p><p><a name="06102576000354">The Select Committee is
considering the fact the UK still faces considerable competitive
challenges. In the short time available, I want to focus on three
areas: skills; investment; and regulation, which several hon. Members
have mentioned. Car and component manufacture needs both basic and
specialist engineering skills to compete. Sadly, this country is not
keeping up with our competitors on both counts. A recent survey by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Ltd highlighted that 83 per
cent. of its members found that low employee skills are holding their
businesses back.</p><p><a name="06102576000355">The
independent Leitch review of skills confirms the problem. It was
commissioned by the Treasury, and its interim report found that one

qualification. Worse still, it shows that the result of the
Government&#146;s current plans for skills would leave 4 million
adults without the basic literary skills expected of 11-year-olds and
12 million adults without their numeric skills. Why are the Government
planning for such low attainment? How does the Minister expect the
industry to cope with staff who have such inadequate skills?</p><p><a name="06102576000356">On graduate engineering skills,
a CBI report has shown that since the mid-1990s the number of students
obtaining a first degree in engineering and technology has fallen by 11
per cent. That has serious implications for motor engineering and car
making. Given that, why does the Minister believe there has been such
as sharp decline? As a former Minister with responsibility for higher
education, which of the Government&#146;s policies in particular does
she think are failing?</p><p><a name="06102576000357">On business investment, the
Government have set themselves a target to increase the UK investment
in research and development to 2.5 per cent. It is a laudable ambition,
given that it is fair to say that we have had a historic habit of
lagging behind France, Germany and America. Therefore, it is
disappointing to report that the most recent figures shows that
research and development investment has remained static as a proportion
of gross domestic product; it has gone nowhere in nine years. The
Chancellor is proud of his research and development tax credits, yet
the Government&#146;s own evidence shows that they have failed to
help the Government to reach that target. We are exactly where we were
nine years ago. Why do they think that the investment has not
increased? What does the Minister think is wrong with the research and
development tax credits? Can she say today that she is still absolutely
confident that the Government will meet their
target?</p><p><a name="06102576000358">Several hon.
Members have alluded to the fact that the burden of regulations is one
thing that has increased. A recent survey by the Engineering Employers
Federation showed that 62 per cent. of its members cite regulation as
having a negative effect on the ability of this country to be a place
to which people want to come to invest and do business. They are right.
The annual level of regulations has risen since 1997 by more than 50
per cent. It is now the equivalent of having 15 new regulations every
working day. Does the Minister recognise how the burden impacts on car
manufacturers? Does she accept the figure from the Federation of Small
Businesses that the average small business spends 28 hours a month
simply complying with Government paperwork? If she does accept that
those figures are correct, what steps does she intend to take, as the
Minister with responsibility for small businesses?</p><p><a name="06102576000359">Equally, conflicting regulatory
objectives can create serious confusion. Let us consider recent EU
initiatives about health and safety, and environmental protection. On
the one hand, the EU has initiated regulations to reduce tailpipe
fumes, which affect our health. However, these Euro V regulations
involve installing particulate filters, which increase the weight of
the car. The result is an increase in carbon emissions, which directly
contradicts another EU policy that seeks to tackle climate change. For
car makers, that conflict between policies is immensely frustrating and
confusing. Which policy comes first for them? As the

there has been not only a massive increase in the work force from 1,500
to 4,500, but a welcome increase in apprenticeships&#151;many hon.
Members talked about training. It is interesting that cars are built in
Oxford, but sold with a flag. Car manufacturing is an important export
industry and whether that is in south Derbyshire, where Toyota&#146;s
vehicle manufacturing is based, or Oxford, East, we should not lose
sight of the fact that we export cars because that is hugely
important.</p><p><a name="06102576000369">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire talked about Toyota, which I
recently had the pleasure of visiting in Japan. I am incredibly
impressed by it and particularly by its investment in new fuels and its
consideration of safety. It is much more grounded in what I think will
be the future that customers want from their cars than are some other
car manufacturers with an American base who are in trouble.</p><p><a name="06102576000370">There was a positive story to
tell about all car manufacturers in this country, including Nissan and

good-news story. Nissan has the wonderful feature of being

Ford&#146;s most productive plant and I am proud that in Dagenham,
the constituency next to mine, we are producing so many engines, many
of which are also
exported.</p><p><a name="06102576000372">The supply
chain is strong with 2,600 companies employing 130,000 people. The
just-in-time location for supply chain products to feed into the
manufacturing process is extremely important and one of the messages
that I received from Toyota when I was in Japan was that we need to
work together to improve the performance of supply-chain companies so
that they can produce within cost, to quality and on time to meet
demand. It is important to put some effort into that as we move
forward. The supply chain is crucial and it is good to see that BMW is
increasing&#151;</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025h0003.htmordayhd_52"><a name="06102576000528">3.54

Hodge:</b> I hope that I can do my hon. Friends
justice.</p><p><a name="06102576000378">I shall say one more thing
about United Kingdom car manufacturing: its productivity went up by 44
per cent. between 2000 and 2004, the years for which I have figures.
That is why in Oxford, East, South Derbyshire, and Middlesbrough, South
and East Cleveland there is such successful manufacturing
capacity.</p><p><a name="06102576000379">I want to
deal quickly with the issues that have been raised, and then with the
vision that my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller) described. Procurement is a difficult issue, as he
knows, but a lot of purchasing takes place: the Post Office purchases
Transits and Vivaros, Royal Mail purchases from LDV, and Toyota
provides a lot of cars for the Post Office. The Government car fleet
could do better&#151;I accept that&#151;but we must ensure value
for money. Britain does well because we have an open market, and we are
producing so many cars because we are competitive. That is good for the
British car industry in the long term because it makes it sustainable
and helps us to
export.</p><p><a name="06102576000380">The importance
of a stable economic environment was mentioned by my right hon. Friend
the Member for Oxford, East, my hon. Friend the Member for
Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland and the hon. Member for
Solihull (Lorely Burt). The matter is key, and I say to my hon. Friend
the Member for Chorley that there are many myths about employment
rights in the UK. A Department of Trade and Industry survey found that
five of 15 EU countries have collective redundancies that are
implemented more quickly than those in the UK. In Denmark and Greece
there are shorter periods of notice and lower severance payments for
blue-collar than for white-collar workers, and in France, with which we
are often compared, there is an insider-outsider problem. Those who are
in work have their jobs protected, but it is much more difficult to
take people on. That has led to a 25 per cent. unemployment
rate.</p><p><a name="06102576000381">Hon. Members
mentioned the shrinking number of jobs in the car industry, but that is
not peculiar to the UK. Volkswagen, for example, is to cut 20,000 jobs
at six West German plants. Energy costs are a consideration, and until
2005 ours were comparable with those in continental Europe or, in many
cases, slightly lower. Things went wrong in the winter of 2005, when
there was an increase in demand and in energy prices internationally
because of the decline of North sea gas production. By about mid-2006
we were competitive again, and new infrastructure, such as the new gas
pipeline from Norway that the Prime Minister recently opened, will help
us to equalise the situation.</p><p><a name="06102576000382">We must do what we can in the
energy sector. Hence the Carbon Trust, which we set up to provide
direct advice to industrial companies; hence the enhanced capital
allowances scheme, which means that companies can claim 100 per cent.
first-year allowances; and hence the climate change programme, which a
number of hon. Members mentioned.</p><br>

logistics are key. We are discussing them with Toyota and a feasibility
study is being undertaken with the regional development agencies. We
are conscious of the issues affecting Vauxhall, and I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston on having done an
enormous amount of work on them. We must try to unlock the problems
faced; it is crazy that we cannot use the railway lines to support our
car industry and that we have to rely on road transport. I think we
would all accept
that.</p><p><a name="06102576000384">I end by
mentioning what we are doing for the car industry, a subject that the
hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) raised. I
shall not reply to him in detail, but he said that there are 4 million
adults with no skills. When we came into government there were 7
million. We have nearly halved the figure. There was no research and
development tax credits system, and R and D investment was on the down.
I shall talk to him in another arena about small businesses, but some
regulation is good. For example, we all support opening up the right of
older workers to have a place in
work.</p><p><a name="06102576000385">The car industry
is central to the manufacturing base of the UK, and we are strong in
it. We all need to talk it up, not down, and ensure that we put the
right investment in the right places. The automotive innovation and
growth team report was published under my predecessors, and we are
going ahead with that work. A huge amount of work is going into
building skills. We have the automotive academy, which I visited on a
recent visit to the west midlands and which is doing good work, and we
are building centres of excellence and investing in the examination of
new fuel technologies. We have a technology programme of almost
&#163;400 million, and one of the innovations coming from it is the
low-carbon vehicle partnership. There is InnovITS, which brings people
together on telematics. We must focus on the supply chain, and we have
put money into that. Companies must work with their peers to improve
productivity and their management of the supply chain. All those
elements make for a good, healthy car industry. That is what we
want&#151;an industry that produces for UK residents but also for
export. That is how to build a prosperous UK with a growth in
jobs.</p><br>

Waltho (Stourbridge) (Lab):</b> I am delighted to be able to
discuss this important issue and pleased that the Minister is here to
respond. Although the title of the debate refers directly to Midland
Metro and its possible future routing through the black country, hon.
Members should recognise that the context of that extension is not
solely one of transport. It is set within a wider sub-regional
framework now known as &#147;Black Country
Study&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102576000387">I
shall take a little time to set the scene, Mrs.
Dean&#151;a rhyme there. Very nice. I must outline the importance of
&#147;Black Country Study&#148;, which sets the context for the
crucial Midland Metro extension and how it will support the key aims
identified. The study began three years ago when the region&#146;s
political and business leaders recognised the need to consider radical
change in the sub-region to counter the decline of the past 30
years.</p><p><a name="06102576000388">The process got
under way when a 30-year future vision was agreed with partners, which
provides the driving force for change. There is now a sub-regional
study for the black country to outline the priorities for the
regeneration of its physical, environmental, social and economic
fabric. The West Midlands regional assembly, as the regional planning
body, has accepted the study as a supporting document for the draft
regional spatial strategy phase 1 revision, submitted to the Government
on 31 May. Hon. Members will know that regional spatial strategies
guide major transport, land use and regeneration decisions, in this
case until 2021.</p><p><a name="06102576000389">Across the black country there
are important challenges, some of which have been ignored by successive
Governments. An example of the fundamental challenges in Stourbridge
and in most of our part of the west midlands is provided by the large
number of people who leave the region&#146;s villages, towns, cities
and boroughs, including Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton.
There is a high number of low-skilled workers, which means an
over-reliance on basic, manually-based
jobs.</p><p><a name="06102576000390">The black
country&#146;s ability to retain people with higher skills and
attract new highly skilled workers is severely restricted, and only
limited measures are in place to protect and enhance the environment to
create a safe, attractive and healthy place to live and work. I am
delighted to say that &#147;Black Country Study&#148; seeks to
address those
matters.</p><p><a name="06102576000391">I came into
politics to help to improve the quality of life of local people, and as
a Labour Member I am proud to serve my community while a proposal such
as the study is being considered. There must be an urban renaissance in
our region, and a key constituent part of that can be delivered through
major investment projects such as the proposed extension of Midland
Metro. I was recently astounded to learn that of the 2 million
trips, not including walking and cycling, that are made every day in
the black country, 83 per cent. are by car and only 17 per cent. by
public
transport.</p><p><a name="06102576000392">Although
the population is forecast to decline in the next 30 years, transport
models show that there will

daily. Of the new trips, the trend is for more to be made by car and
fewer by public transport. Clearly, that is unsustainable, particularly
considering the planned expansion in employment, population and
housing.</p><p><a name="06102576000393">Public
transport overall is declining in the black country, but rail use is
increasing in line with national trends outside London. Bus operators
in the west midlands have reported more than 30 locations where delays
on the road network are unacceptable and seriously affect reliability.
For instance, many bridges in the black country still have limited head
room or cannot carry the largest heavy goods vehicles. That restricts
our freight operations and hampers the development of some
areas.</p><p><a name="06102576000394">The majority
of public transport trips are made by bus. The quality, performance and
perception of those services mean that they often fail to provide a
truly acceptable alternative to car use. Those who cannot afford a car
or who cannot drive may suffer from social exclusion, because
employment and leisure opportunities are no longer contained within
traditional town centres. Car ownership in the black country is lower
than the national average, with between 25 and 37 per cent. of
households still not having access to a
car.</p><p><a name="06102576000395">Each local
transport plan area has been required by the Government to assess the
accessibility of key services in that area, including access to work,
education, health care and fresh food. Although accessibility to such
services in the black country is good, there are a number of gaps in
the commercial network. For instance, there is a particular problem
with evening services that enable residents to reach educational and
recreational opportunities and, as I have stated, with new areas of
employment that are no longer always located in town or city
centres.</p><p><a name="06102576000396">There is a
solution to those problems&#151;Midland Metro. The first line of the
proposed network of light rail routes opened in 1999. It is a light
rail tram system that runs from Birmingham to Wolverhampton, via West
Bromwich and Wednesbury. The service provides a reliable and convenient
transport link between two cities, over a distance of 21 km. The system
is owned and promoted by the public transport body Centro&#151;the
passenger transport executive for the west midlands&#151;and operated
through a concession by Travel Midlands
Metro.</p><p><a name="06102576000397">In the first
year of operation, 17 per cent. of users gave up their car journeys in
favour of using the metro, and that figure has steadily increased to 37
per cent. Light rail has consistently achieved a 20 per cent. modal
shift from car to tram. We in the region would like the Government to
demonstrate a commitment to the metro as the most appropriate mode of
transport along main routes where demand is high, and to help us to
address road congestion, which is estimated to cost about &#163;2.2
billion a year.</p><p><a name="06102576000398">The
proposed phase 1 extensions to Midland Metro that we are discussing
form part of a two-pronged proposal. The first prong is the extension
from the existing terminus of line 1 through the heart of Birmingham
city centre to Edgbaston, while the other runs from Wednesbury to
Brierley Hill. Both routes,

project, fall into the high-value-for-money category in the Department
for Transport guidelines and are in a state of readiness for the
tendering process in 2007, which would lead to a start on site in
2008-09. However, this requires Government commitment to
funding.</p><p><a name="06102576000399">Although the
metro is a top priority in the region, by political agreement
regionally it was not prioritised for the regional funding allocations.
It was recognised that the metro&#146;s funding would be sourced
through the transport innovation fund, with the expectation that
funding through the TIF would be available to ensure that the project
could be delivered at the earliest opportunity. I understand that
discussions on that are taking place with officials in the
Department.</p><p><a name="06102576000400">It would
cost &#163;384 million to build the route. Contributions of more than
25 per cent. have already been secured from local sources, including
private sector developers. Of that 25 per cent., Westfield, the owners
of the Merry Hill shopping centre, has committed &#163;36.5 million,
which is one of the largest private sector contributions of its kind
for a light rail
scheme.</p><p><a name="06102576000401">That is good
news, not only for my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but for my constituents and the wider
black country. Delivery of that key piece of infrastructure will mean
that wealth creation can be stimulated and that the black country
economy can start to thrive and address years of decline. The clear
evidence from the existing Midland Metro routes suggests that further
investment to expand the network would yield a similar positive impact,
which I am sure the Government are keen to promote. Midland Metro is a
key part of the overall strategy and a vital part of the public
transport strategy.</p><p><a name="06102576000402">I
would like to examine the impact on the strategic centres of extending
Midland Metro from Wednesbury to Brierley Hill, as proposed in
&#147;Black Country Study&#148;, which will be crucial when the
Government make their decision on funding streams linked to whether the
proposal proceeds. The centre access packages proposed for Brierley
Hill, Walsall, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton have common elements,
including a focus on measures to change people&#146;s opportunities
to access strategic centres, while interventions to help them to make
sustainable travel choices underline the
strategy.</p><p><a name="06102576000403">As well as
that element, there is a focus on public transport, with priority being
placed on the development of Midland Metro and linking together each of
the four strategic centres, providing access to those centres for
households in the proposed housing
corridors.</p><p><a name="06102576000404">The route
of the Midland Metro extension connects some of the most deprived wards
in the area, in terms of economic and social conditions and access to
quality facilities and modern job opportunities. Those wards lie in the
south black country and west Birmingham regeneration zone, which was
set up as one of the delivery vehicles for the west midlands economic
strategy.</p><p><a name="06102576000405">The
fundamental uplift in public transport resulting from the Midland Metro
extension would not only greatly enhance the indigenous attractions of

transform accessibility and the lives of residents in those wards by
giving access to expanding modern job opportunities, as well as the
retail, leisure and community facilities at Brierley Hill and Merry
Hill, via Dudley town
centre.</p><p><a name="06102576000406">Similarly, the
extension would facilitate transport to other major centres and their
economic opportunities, in particular Wolverhampton and Birmingham, via
the existing line
1.</p><p><a name="06102576000407">About 2,000 of my
constituents rely on employment opportunities around the Merry Hill
site, and it is estimated that an additional 4,000 jobs would be
generated by the metro extensions. Imagine what that could do for the
life chances of the wider black country. A further benefit for my
constituents and the area of Brierley Hill, in which the Merry Hill
shopping centre is located, is the planned metro stops that will assist
the well-developed plans to integrate Brierley Hill high street, the
Waterfront and Merry
Hill.</p><p><a name="06102576000408">The Midland
Metro extension will underpin the regeneration process in other key
locations along the route, including Golds Hill and Dudley town centre.
In the latter case, important town centre schemes are coming
forward&#151;notably the regeneration proposals for the area of
Dudley zoo and castle&#151;that have an important role in the
strategy for Dudley, focusing on enhancing its tourism and leisure
facilities. The realisation of the Midland Metro extension would
therefore be immensely supportive of those local
initiatives.</p><p><a name="06102576000409">The
proposed metro route meets Government guidance on major transport
schemes by fitting in with the region&#146;s objectives for local
transport schemes and offers value-for-money investment for the whole
region, not just the black country. Centro has developed a strategy for
implementation of the route that will ensure that projects stay within
budget and can be delivered within the agreed timetable. Private sector
funding demonstrates that commercial confidence in the scheme
exists.</p><p><a name="06102576000410">Midland Metro,
as outlined to the Chamber, is an integral component for improving the
black country and is a critical element of &#147;Black Country
Study&#148;, for which hon. and right hon. Members have demonstrated
their support via early-day motion 2249. As mentioned previously,
&#147;Black Country Study&#148; is the urban renaissance strategy
for the black country. It sets out why the black country needs to
change, what needs to be done, where that change is going to take place
and how it will be brought about. The delivery of the Midland Metro
extension underpins the emphasis of the whole study and is vital to its
success.</p><p><a name="06102576000411">I ask the
Minister to work with us in the black country and the west midlands to
help to deliver the scheme for our region. To fail at this point could

the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) on securing this debate. I am
grateful for the opportunity to hear first hand her views on the
proposed extension of the Midland Metro from Wednesbury to Brierley
Hill, an issue on which she has been an energetic and effective
campaigner on behalf of her constituents. This debate is an appropriate
opportunity to reaffirm the Government&#146;s position on tramways
and light rail schemes in general. I shall then respond specifically to
my hon. Friend&#146;s
comments.</p><p><a name="06102576000414">Light rail
can bring considerable benefits. It can deliver quicker, more reliable
journeys, taking passengers directly into the heart of a city, avoiding
traffic congestion and greatly improving accessibility. We have always
recognised that trams can be very effective in attracting people away
from their cars and we will continue to support light rail schemes when
they are the best solution for local circumstances&#151;usually
corridors with high traffic and passenger flows.
</p><p><a name="06102576000415">Our support for light
rail schemes in the right circumstances was demonstrated by the
announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Transport in July that the Department was conditionally approving a
scheme to extend the Manchester Metrolink system. Just this morning, my
right hon. Friend gave initial approval to extend the Nottingham
express transit system.</p><p><a name="06102576000416">However, we will not support
light rail schemes regardless of cost. On most corridors, a well
designed and promoted bus-based system is likely to provide a more
cost-effective solution. When light rail schemes, including extensions
to existing systems, are promoted, they will need to be developed as
part of an integrated approach to tackling an area&#146;s problems.
The Government will expect proposals for light rail schemes to be fully
integrated with other forms of transport&#151;for example, through
integrated ticketing, bus quality partnerships or quality contracts,
the provision of park and ride facilities, and complimentary parking
policies. Proposals will also need to be supported by commitments to
complementary measures to deliver the benefits of increased public
transport usage and reduced congestion. The Government will continue to
work closely with individual promoters and the light rail industry to
seek to ensure that such benefits can be realised and that the costs of
tram systems are minimised and properly controlled.</p><p><a name="06102576000417">That brings
me&#151;seamlessly, I hope&#151;to the comments made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Stourbridge. I would like to congratulate the
regional assembly and the Black Country Consortium on delivering
&#147;Black Country Study&#148;, which my hon. Friend mentioned. As
my hon. Friend said, transforming the black country is crucial to the
success of the regional spatial strategy and to the west midlands as a
whole, and the work will help to ensure delivery. I also place on
record our recognition of the massive personal contribution made by a
small number of individuals to the study and to the future of the black
country.</p><p><a name="06102576000418">The draft
revision of the spatial strategy specifically highlights the need for
urban regeneration of the black country and recognises the need for an
integrated public transport network to serve Brierley Hill, as well as
Merry Hill in Dudley, a new strategic centre. Such a

alternatives also will need to be considered in parallel. Public
consultation on the draft revision to the spatial strategy has ended,
and it will now be examined by an independent panel, to be appointed by
the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in January
next year. We also need to remember the work jointly carried out by all
the authorities in the west midlands to examine congestion and how they
might tackle it. As my hon. Friend correctly pointed out, the
authorities are considering making a bid to the transport innovation
fund, to which I shall return later.
</p><p><a name="06102576000420">At this point, it is
worth recapping a little of the metro&#146;s history. Midland Metro
line 1, between Birmingham Snow Hill and Wolverhampton, opened in 1999
and has provided much-needed transport links to deprived communities
and helped to regenerate those areas. Line 1 also helps to reduce
congestion; 14 per cent. of metro passengers previously made
the journey by car, so the line has removed 600,000 car trips per year
from local roads.</p><p><a name="06102576000421">However, line 1 suffered some
initial teething troubles. It attracted criticism from the National
Audit Office for its initially poor service and failure to meet its
frequency and reliability targets. Although those have since improved
and the line now regularly delivers a high quality of service and
reliability, we need to ensure that lessons are learned and taken
account of in respect of the proposed extensions.</p><p><a name="06102576000422">In December 2000, the
Government granted initial approval for two proposed extensions to
Midland Metro. In addition to the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill
extension, a second extension would provide a city centre link between
Birmingham Snow Hill and Five Ways, terminating at Edgbaston shopping
centre.</p><p><a name="06102576000423">When approval
was granted in 2000, it was estimated that the scheme would cost
&#163;165.5 million in 1999 prices; estimates for the Wednesbury to
Brierley Hill extension and the city centre line were &#163;114.1
million and &#163;51.4 million respectively. Our approval letter said
that full approval of the project would depend on whether an updated
economic appraisal confirmed that the scheme represented good value for
money, and on satisfactory funding arrangements being agreed.</p><p><a name="06102576000424">Since approval was given, we
have improved our approval process. Full approval is now given only
after a promoter has obtained final prices from bidders. The actual
costs of a scheme are therefore known before we give the promoters the
go-ahead to start construction. We hope that that will help us avoid a
repeat of recent experiences of light rail schemes when full approval
had to be revoked due to significant cost increases.</p><p><a name="06102576000425">At the point at which full
approval was given in the past, we have introduced a new approval
stage: conditional approval. That is applied for once the necessary
legal powers&#151;under Transport and Works Act 1992 orders or other
planning permissions&#151;are in place. When granted, that will be
the Department&#146;s commitment to provide funding, subject to the
costs not increasing after procurement and the scope of the scheme
remaining the same.</p><br>

Midland Metro extensions are now at. The promoters require conditional
approval before they start their procurement process. However, since
our initial approval was granted, the source of potential funding for
the scheme has changed, as my hon. Friend mentioned. In January this
year, the west midlands regional bodies provided advice to the
Government on the regional funding allocation for the west midlands.
They said:</p><a name="61025h0004.htmbrev_108"><a name="06102576000503"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Expansion of the
Midland Metro is a top priority for the Region. However, the cost of
the Phase 1 extensions would utilise virtually all the Transport RFA
for a period of years and this is not realistic. This project is
therefore assumed to be funded through the Transport Innovation Fund
(TIF) with no funding from RFA.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000427">In February this year, my
officials had a number of meetings with the promoters to discuss their
proposals for the Midland Metro extensions and the implication of
funding the extensions through the transport innovation fund.</p><p><a name="06102576000428">TIF funding for schemes
intended to help address congestion will be awarded on a competitive
basis, as set out in our guidance published in January 2006. In
considering bids for TIF funding, we will look at how the full package
stacks up. That means that we would need to consider the proposed
Midland Metro extensions in the context of the full TIF package to be
developed by the west midlands
authorities.</p><p><a name="06102576000429"><b><a name="61025h0004.htm_spnew489"><a name="06102576000634">Mr.
Khalid Mahmood (Birmingham, Perry Barr) (Lab):</b> I agree
with my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) that
there is a need for some of the regional areas to be connected up, and
perhaps the metro is the answer. The Minister is right to point out the
real urban issues in connecting urban lines. Such issues have not been
thought out in my constituency, and a huge escalation in price has
meant that the projects will never take off. It would be very wise for
the local authorities and transport authorities to establish how they
can provide an effective bus service to ensure that my constituents are
able to use services into the city centre and to areas that connect
those communities
together.</p><p><a name="06102576000430"><b><a name="61025h0004.htm_spnew490"><a name="06102576000635">Mr.

not led down the road of commenting on the likelihood or otherwise of
that particular TIF funding application. However, I accept that he has
strong views on the issue, on which he has campaigned vociferously for
a number of years.</p><p><a name="06102576000431">In
light of the fact that we will consider the Midland Metro extension in
the context of the full TIF package, my officials wrote to the
promoters in March to explain that we could not give the scheme any
form of financial approval separately from, and in advance of,
receiving and considering the TIF bid in 2007. The promoters told us
that they nevertheless still wished to send the Department their
outline business case for the extensions as soon as it was ready, and
they did that in July this year.</p><p><a name="06102576000432">We agreed that, as far as we
were able, we would undertake an appraisal of the scheme. However,
although we can explore the assumptions and calculations underlying the
bid, we are not able to provide a definitive assessment of the value
for money

need to be considered alongside the other measures that form part of
the west midlands TIF bid.</p><p><a name="06102576000433">The outline business case
estimates that the extensions will cost some &#163;383 million, as my
hon. Friend said. However, the promoters made that estimate based on
receiving conditional approval in 2006, which of course will now not
happen. The earliest that conditional approval could be granted in
accordance with the anticipated TIF timeline is late next year or early
2008. Based on an approval date of January 2008, the promoters estimate
that the total cost would be some &#163;409
million.</p><p><a name="06102576000434">My officials
have been working closely with the promoters since receiving their
outline business case and will continue to assess the case as far as
possible. However, as I said before, given the source of funding
available, it can be approved only if the west midlands
authorities&#146; TIF bid is also
approved.</p><p><a name="06102576000435">It might be
helpful if I said a bit more about the transport innovation fund
itself. It represents a new approach to achieving the key objectives of
tackling congestion and improving productivity. We have announced that
up to &#163;200 million a year, and possibly more in subsequent
years, will be made available to tackle congestion. We are inviting
authorities to bid for resources and to develop packages of measures
that will tackle congestion effectively though a combination of demand
management and encouraging modal
shift.</p><p><a name="06102576000436">The TIF starts
in 2008, but &#163;18 million has been made available in advance for
local authorities to develop demand management proposals, and the west
midlands has been awarded &#163;2.6 million of that sum. We welcomed
the recent publication of the first phase of the work, and my
Department is following it up with the authorities. Subject to ongoing
work, we expect a full business case in July next year. We look forward
to receiving it and to working with the west midlands in carrying out a
full assessment of the
bid.</p><br>

Mulholland (Leeds, North-West) (LD):</b> I am very pleased to
have an opportunity to raise this important issue in the House. The
subject matter could hardly be of greater import or significance, and
my purpose is to put the facts of the case on record. This remarkable
tale of injustice continues, despite the fact that it has been more
than 18 years since Mirza Tahir Hussain first visited Pakistan and the
nightmare began.</p><p><a name="06102576000438">I
learned of the case when my constituent Amjad Hussain contacted me
earlier this year. Of course, as his MP, I offered to do what I could
to assist, but it was only when I was told the facts of the case that I
realised that I was dealing with an extraordinary miscarriage of
justice, one that all of us involved in the campaign have pledged to
resolve.</p><p><a name="06102576000439">Let me share
with hon. Members the background of the case. Mirza Tahir Hussain was
just 18 years old when he visited Pakistan for the first time in
December 1988 to establish links with his family. On the very day of
his arrival, while proceeding to meet his family, he was involved in an
incident in the Punjab province. He accepted a ride in a taxi and was
driven to a remote area, and in that place there was an incident that
resulted in the death of the taxi driver from a gunshot
wound.</p><p><a name="06102576000440">It is not
disputed that the gun involved belonged to the taxi driver, nor that
Mr. Hussain drove immediately to the nearest police station
to report the incident. In his account of the incident, he states that
the taxi driver physically assaulted him and attempted to sexually
assault him. In the scuffle that followed, he acted to defend himself,
and the taxi driver&#146;s gun was
discharged.</p><p><a name="06102576000441">Mirza
Tahir Hussain was tried and convicted of murder in 1989 and sentenced
to death, but he has been acquitted twice by the Lahore High Court,
which identified discrepancies in the case. The first acquittal was
shortly after his original conviction, and the second was in 1996
following his reconviction and re-sentencing in
1994.</p><p><a name="06102576000442">However, the
prosecution and the deceased&#146;s family challenged the 1996
acquittal, arguing that some of the offences that Mirza Tahir allegedly
committed were crimes that came within the jurisdiction of Islamic law.
Specifically, it was claimed that Mirza Tahir was guilty of the crime
of highway robbery, or hararbah&#151;highway robbery after
dusk&#151;because he was found to be in possession of the
taxi.</p><p><a name="06102576000443">As a result, the
entire case was referred to the Federal Sharia Court in 1998, where it
was reheard. There, although Mirza Tahir was found innocent of the
crime of hararbah, he was again sentenced to death. That verdict was
reached despite the fact that one of the three judges dissented
strongly and robustly, suggesting that Mirza Tahir should be acquitted
and allowed to return to his family. Indeed, the judge submitted a
substantive verdict. It was almost 59 pages in length, and it outlined
numerous and far-reaching legal flaws in the case, which I shall
discuss in a few
moments.</p><p><a name="06102576000444">Let me make
it clear that my intention is not in any way to criticise or attack the
Pakistani Government or

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 481WH</b><br>judicial system. It is for the Government and
the citizens of Pakistan to come up with their own laws and systems of
justice. The point in this case is simply that due process according to
the tenets of Pakistani law and the Pakistani constitution was not
followed. Several fundamental legal issues at the centre of the case
have never been addressed or
resolved.</p><p><a name="06102576000445">First, when
Mirza Tahir Hussain was first convicted, the principle of the
presumption of innocence was not followed. There was no eye-witness
testimony, no credible motive was established and the only evidence
presented was weak and obtained through intense interrogation.
Furthermore, Mirza Tahir and the deceased were not known to each other
in any way, there were no prior incidences of malice or dispute and
Mirza Tahir had no previous convictions. He was also at considerable
disadvantage in bringing forth independent corroborative evidence in
support of his version of events. He was a young man, alone at the
hands of police who dealt with him in a way that we would not wish our
suspects to be treated, and at times he had limited or no access to
legal
representation.</p><p><a name="06102576000446">Indeed,
attempts were made by the police and the prosecution to fabricate
evidence against Mirza Tahir, to portray him as a habitual offender and
even fictitiously to implicate him in a case of which he was
subsequently acquitted. That case took place before he had even arrived
in the
country.</p><p><a name="06102576000447">However, the
fundamental flaws in the legal process are far from limited to the
initial conviction. They have persisted throughout the entire process.
The fundamental principle of double jeopardy was also not followed. As
I said, Mirza Tahir was found innocent of the crime of hararbah but
guilty of the death of the taxi driver, which is why he was again
sentenced to death, despite of the fact that the international
principle of double jeopardy states that a defendant should not be
tried twice for the same crime. That principle is enshrined in the
constitution of
Pakistan.</p><p><a name="06102576000448">The judgment
presented by the dissenting sharia judge, Mr. Justice Abdul
Waheed Siddique, also revealed that the Federal Sharia Court had no
power, as a result of the terms of the original conviction, to enhance
the sentence from life to death. Furthermore, the tenets of Islamic law
clearly state that the death penalty should be imposed only if a
minimum of two credible eye-witness accounts or a confession are
submitted to the court. Neither was submitted in this
case.</p><p><a name="06102576000449">In his
statement, Justice Siddique refers explicitly to the falsification of
evidence by the police as &#147;shameless&#148;. He also states
that the investigating agency was guilty of introducing false
witnesses. He pointed out that the medical evidence presented at the
trial was in direct contradiction of the account given by prosecutors.
At the trial, the prosecution claimed that the deceased was shot, and
that his body was dragged from the driver&#146;s seat and thrown 15
feet away from the road. However, there was no trail of blood, or any
evidence of dragging on the body of the deceased.</p><p><a name="06102576000450">In the words of Justice
Siddique, the entire judgment was based on surmise and conjecture.
According to him, any one of the points outlined above were enough to
have Mirza Tahir&#146;s entire sentence quashed, let alone

that he raised and the fact that the High Court in Lahore has twice
acquitted Mirza Tahir have never been resoundingly addressed by the
Supreme Court in Pakistan, yet Mirza Tahir Hussain remains in prison
under penalty of
death.</p><p><a name="06102576000451">We recognise
that there are miscarriages of justice in every legal system in the
world, and the United Kingdom is no exception. We are all aware of the
cases of the Guildford Four, who were released in 1989 after spending
15 years in prison. Their convictions were crushed by the court of
appeal after serious flaws were found in the original police
investigation. The Birmingham Six were release in 1991 after 16 years
in prison. Of course, we are all aware of the infamous case of Derek
Bentley, the last man hanged in Britain. He was hanged on 28 January
1953 for allegedly murdering a policeman, and it took 46 years for his
conviction to be overturned by the court of appeal. We hope and pray
that in this case Mirza Tahir&#146;s conviction will be overturned
before it is too late.</p><p><a name="06102576000452">It is of course for the
Pakistani authorities to come up with a solution to the case. One
solution that has been mooted is that under the provisions of Islamic
law, if a blood money settlement can be found between the two families,
the accused can be pardoned and released. However, the negotiations
broke down some time ago and the family of the deceased have
categorically stated that they will not accept any form of reparations
and have been vocal in calling for Mirza Tahir&#146;s execution to go
ahead.</p><p><a name="06102576000453">In my opinion,
blood money is not a solution that will bring justice in this case. As
the conviction is so clearly unsafe, there is no criminal. If there is
no crime, there is no victim and if there is no victim, there cannot be
reasonable negotiations with a so-called victim&#146;s family. There
are many of us who believe that Mirza Tahir was the victim of crime,
not the perpetrator, all those years ago in 1988. There is strong
circumstantial evidence that he was attacked in a most terrifying way,
so for his to be facing the death penalty at all is
appalling.</p><p><a name="06102576000454">One thing
is certain. He has certainly been a victim, the victim of an unsafe
conviction that has caused him to be in prison for his entire adult
life&#151;half the time he has spent on this earth. I remember how
struck I was when Amjad told me how old his beloved brother is. He is
36 years old; I was struck because I am the same age. I think back to
when I was 18. I had just left school, I had a place at university, and
I remember celebrating my 18th birthday with my family in Ireland. Now,
18 years on, I been elected to Parliament, I have married and had a
daughter. I now have family of my own.</p><p><a name="06102576000455">Mirza Tahir Hussain has been
denied all those things&#151;the chance to go to university, to get a
job, to find a career and to marry and have a family. That is a huge
price to pay for even a guilty man, but a nightmare beyond
comprehension for someone who has never been satisfactorily convicted
and who many people do not believe actually committed the
crime.</p><p><a name="06102576000456">It is for
Pakistan to come up with solutions, but they should not involve blood
money negotiations when the whole point is that the conviction is
unsafe and that Mirza Tahir Hussain was never proven in a court of law
to have committed any crime. Nor should he and his family be put
through the anguish of yet another

it is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine the rollercoaster of
emotion and despair that the family go through in what has become a
cycle of new dates of execution and stays of execution. That simply
amounts to mental torture for Mirza Tahir Hussain and his family. Alas,
Mirza Tahir&#146;s father died when the distressing case was ongoing.
Amjad has expressed his mother&#146;s pain, as she wonders whether
she will ever see her son again.</p><p><a name="06102576000457">President Musharraf has a
critical role to play and I believe that it is quite clear, despite the
ambiguity which has arisen over recent weeks, that he has the power and
authority to prevent the execution. Article 45 of the Pakistani
constitution clearly
states:</p><a name="61025h0005.htmbrev_109"><a name="06102576000458"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
President shall have power to grant pardon, reprieve and respite, and
to remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal
or other authority&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000459">That
is any sentence in any court. In the words of the Foreign Minister of
Pakistan, Mr. Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, in an interview in
March of this year:</p><a name="61025h0005.htmbrev_110"><a name="06102576000504"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
powers of the President under Article 45 of the Constitution to pardon
a convict are absolute&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06102576000460">Mr. Kasuri is far from alone
in expressing that view. Law Ministers, senior counsels and eminent
jurists from across Pakistan have confirmed that the President has the
power to commute Mirza Tahir&#146;s sentence. Figures as widespread
and diverse as Dr. Khalid Ranjha, the chairman of the Senate Standing
Committee on Law, Justice and Human Rights and Parliamentary Affairs
and former High Court justice; Senator S. M. Zafar, former law Minister
and advocate of the Supreme Court in Pakistan; Senator Mohammed Khosa,
member of the senate committee and Supreme Court advocate; Ms Afshan
Ghanzafer, assistant advocate-general; Dr. Ilyas Zafar, Supreme Court
advocate; and Nasir Aslam Zahid, former Supreme Court justice, have all
confirmed that President Musharraf has both the power and authority to
commute Mirza&#146;s death sentence.</p><p><a name="06102576000461">In 1988, there was also the
case of Parminder Singh Saini, an Indian citizen who was pardoned by
the then president, Mohammed Rafiq Tarar, who used his powers under
article 45 first to commute the penalty to life imprisonment and then
to issue a full pardon. The list goes
on.</p><p><a name="06102576000462">We all know how
important it is to have a strong relationship between the UK and
Pakistan, not least for the sizeable Pakistani communities in the UK
and for our shared history and strong cultural ties. I and my
neighbouring MPs are proud to represent a notable Pakistani Kashmiri
community in Leeds, a community that I know is interested in the case
and is following its progress. When the terrible news of the earthquake
in Pakistan, Kashmir and India reached Leeds, the way in which the city
responded was notable. I was pleased to take part in several
fundraising events as local people pulled together, including people
who had lost members of their families and their homes on that terrible
day. I was also delighted at the way in which the many other
communities of our diverse city
responded.</p><p><a name="06102576000463">So it is

way in which Mirza Tahir&#146;s brother Amjad has led the campaign
for his brother&#146;s reprieve. Even when the outlook has looked at

and strength that he has shown throughout the extremely long and

and continues to be an inspiration to us all in the campaign.</p><p><a name="06102576000466">I know that the British

Hussain&#146;s plight extremely seriously and that they will continue
to act in an appropriate manner to attempt to secure his reprieve and
release. How and when he will be spared and when he will be returned to
Leeds is for the Pakistani Government to decide. I am aware that that
will not be an easy process and it is important to give some time and
space to the Pakistani authorities to consider it. The campaign led by
Amjad and the family will of course go on until those authorities
finally act to spare Mirza Tahir&#146;s life, free him and let him at
last return home to his family in Leeds, where he
belongs.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61025h0005.htmordayhd_57"><a name="06102576000533">5

Minister for the Middle East (Dr. Kim Howells):</b> I am glad
that the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland) has
secured a debate on the case of Mirza Tahir Hussain, who languishes on
death row in Pakistan. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman; he has
worked long and hard on behalf of his constituent. Today, we heard an
eloquent and poignant case made for the commutation of Mr.
Hussain&#146;s death sentence.</p><p><a name="06102576000468">The Government continue to be
extremely concerned about Mr. Hussain&#146;s plight, and I
welcome the opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s position and
to explain some of the actions that we have taken in our efforts to
prevent Mr. Hussain&#146;s
execution.</p><p><a name="06102576000469">Before
concentrating on the specifics of the case, I want to emphasise the
United Kingdom&#146;s principled opposition to the death penalty in
all circumstances. The Minister for Trade, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), who has
responsibility for human rights, stated on world day against the death
penalty on 10 October that the

<notus-date day="25" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>25 Oct 2006 : Column 485WH</b><br>United Kingdom calls upon all states to abolish
the death penalty for all crimes&#151;and forever.</p><p><a name="06102576000470">We welcome the fact that two
further countries, Mexico and the Philippines, have joined the growing
list of abolitionist states; and we recognise the progress that has
been made in several other countries towards abolishing the death
penalty. However, we regret that several countries continue to use it.
As the hon. Gentleman said, the UK has ratified protocol 13 of the
European convention on human rights, which prevents the use of the
death penalty in any and all circumstances, including in times of war.
Together with our EU partners, we continue to work towards universal
opposition. The UK has established a reputation as an advocate for that
cause, and the Government of Pakistan are well aware of our
stance.</p><p><a name="06102576000471">Our prime
concern is to avoid the execution of British nationals. Our policy
extends to all categories of British nationals, including dual
nationals in the country of their second nationality&#151;people to
whom we do not automatically provide consular assistance. We now
express our opposition to the death penalty and its use on a British
national at whatever stage and level is judged appropriate, from the
moment when the imposition of a death sentence on a British national
becomes a possibility. That change in policy was announced by Foreign
and Commonwealth Minister Brian Wilson to the House on 27 February
2001. Our previous policy was to make such representations only when
the judicial process had been
exhausted.</p><p><a name="06102576000472">The hon.
Gentleman spoke about the background of Mr. Hussain&#146;s
case. Mirza Tahir Hussain was born in Pakistan but grew up in Leeds. He
was arrested in December 1988, at the age of 18; and we have heard the
details of the dreadful incident that resulted in calamity for him and
his family. Mr. Hussain has been on death row for half of
his life. The death sentence was at one stage lifted by a civil appeals
court, then reinstated by the religious sharia court. Those
factors&#151;Mr. Hussain&#146;s young age when the
offence was committed, the length of time he has served on death row,
and the agony for both Mr. Hussain and his family of the
death penalty being lifted and then reinstated&#151;provide a strong
humanitarian argument for the commutation of Mr.
Hussain&#146;s sentence.</p><p><a name="06102576000473">All appeals have now been
dismissed, and the formal legal process is exhausted. The
reconciliation process with the victim&#146;s family, available under
sharia law, in which senior Pakistani figures were engaged, seems to
have failed. We welcome the fact that President Musharraf has granted
three stays of execution to Mr. Hussain; the latest, granted
on 19 October, will expire on 31 December. An execution date has yet to
be set.</p><p><a name="06102576000474">Numerous
representations have been made by Her Majesty&#146;s Government on
behalf of Mr. Hussain at the highest level. The Prime
Minister raised the case with President Musharraf during their meeting
on 28 September, having previously written to him on 9 August,
requesting that he look favourably on Mr. Hussain&#146;s
case. The Foreign Secretary discussed the matter with the Pakistani
Foreign Minister at the United Nations general assembly in New York on
19 September, having previously written to President

Mr. Hussain&#146;s sentence to an appropriate term of
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06102576000475">Other
Ministerial representations have been made on Mr.
Hussain&#146;s behalf. I have been engaged on the case for some time,
and raised it with Shaukat Aziz, the Pakistani Prime Minister during my
visit to Pakistan in September; with Kamal Shah, the Secretary of the
Ministry of the Interior; with Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar, the Minister of
State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and with Lieutenant-General
Aurakzai, the governor of the north-west frontier province, who
described to me in some detail his attempts to get the family to agree
to some form of financial
settlement.</p><p><a name="06102576000476">In the
same month, the Home Secretary raised Mr. Hussain&#146;s
case with the Pakistani Interior Minister during a meeting in London. I
also raised the case with the Pakistani High Commissioner, Dr. Maleeha
Lodhi, on 25 July. The Secretary of State for International
Development, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Hilary
Benn), in his role as a Leeds constituency MP for some of
Mr. Hussain&#146;s family, has been personally involved in
the case; he, too, wrote to President Musharraf in May. The
Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas), and the Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham
(Mr. Timms), raised the case with the Pakistani Prime
Minister earlier this month. Those are just some of the most recent
ministerial level representations. There have been many more.</p><p><a name="06102576000477">Numerous representations on
Mr. Hussain&#146;s behalf have also been made at senior
official level. Mr. Hussain&#146;s case is a priority for
FCO officials in Pakistan and in London, and I thank them for their
sustained efforts. I thank especially our High Commissioner to
Islamabad, Mark Lyall Grant, who has been closely involved in
Mr. Hussain&#146;s case. He and his team have made
frequent representations at senior official level, some made while I
was there, and they have had intensive contacts with the
President&#146;s office and others. They will continue their efforts
with the Pakistani authorities, as we all will, in order to achieve our
goal of securing Mr. Hussain&#146;s reprieve.</p><p><a name="06102576000478">Mr. Hussain&#146;s
welfare is of paramount concern to us, and consular staff continue to
visit him weekly at the prison. On that note, it is worth spending a
moment focusing on Mr. Hussain&#146;s family. No one can
imagine how difficult and distressing the past 17 years must have been
for them. Tahir's brother, Amjad, has been campaigning tirelessly on
his brother's behalf, and I join the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West
in admiring his courage and determination. Our staff, both in London
and at the British High Commission in Pakistan, have maintained
frequent contact with Mr. Hussain&#146;s family, and will
continue to liaise closely with them and to offer them all the support
that we can.</p><p><a name="06102576000479">As I
said, our strong wish is to see Mr. Hussain&#146;s
sentence commuted. However, I stress, as did the hon. Gentleman, that
the British Government cannot interfere in the judicial systems of
other countries, just as we would not expect others to interfere in the
British judicial system. The decision whether or not to

is therefore a sovereign decision for Pakistan. We know that the
Pakistani authorities are considering the many representations that
they have received about the case. We are grateful for the extensions
that have been granted, and we sincerely hope that Pakistan will
consider a merciful commutation&#151;not because Tahir Hussain has
British nationality, but because it would be a just and merciful
decision. We all sincerely hope for a decision that is favourable to
Tahir. However, I stress that we have not and will not seek to threaten
the Government of Pakistan over the issue in any way. As I have said,
it is a decision that must be made by the sovereign state of Pakistan,
following the rules of its judicial system. We would not expect the

reassure the hon. Gentleman and Tahir&#146;s family that we have been
doing all that we properly can for Mr. Hussain and his
family. We will continue to do so and I hope fervently that
Mr. Hussain will not be
