<a name="time_0">
<a name="51116h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51116h01_spnew0"><b> Jo Swinson  (East Dunbartonshire)</b>  (LD): I am pleased to introduce the debate on this important topic. It is particularly timely, given the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting scheduled for next month in Hong Kong.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">I am sure hon. Members will agree that the international issues of poverty, aid, debt relief and trade justice captured the public&#039;s imagination in 2005. The high-profile Make Poverty History campaign has rightly been successful in catapulting the issues up the political agenda. In February, 22,000 people flocked to Trafalgar square to hear Nelson Mandela give an inspiring address, urging world leaders to use 2005 to make poverty history. The campaign focused on three objectives: more and better aid, debt relief and trade justice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">In July, I marched in Edinburgh with almost 250,000 people, including some hon. Members in the Chamber. Just days before, the G8 leaders met at Gleneagles. That summit brought positive news on the first two objectives. On debt relief, the deal agreed means that every year $1 billion will be saved by the 18 countries eligible for debt relief. Many non-governmental organisations and campaigners have complained that that does not go far enough, as it represents only 10 per cent. of the debt that needs to be cancelled. I agree with that, but it is a welcome start and should be applauded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">The additional $50 billion in aid a year is also a great achievement, and I am glad to hear the Prime Minister talk of moving towards spending 0.7 per cent. of gross national income on aid. The United Kingdom should be proud of leading the way among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries on the percentage of GNI that it spends on aid, but we must remember that the commitment is 35 years old. Call me impatient, but I think that that is too slow. I was interested to hear the Prime Minister, in his speech on Monday, pledge to treble aid for trade. I hope that the Minister will clarify the effect of that on the UK reaching the 0.7 per cent. target.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">The third objective of the Make Poverty History campaign was trade justice. More than 250 Members of Parliament have signed up to early-day motion 679 on making poverty history through trade justice. More than 8,000 members of the public lobbied more than 300 MPs at the trade justice lobby on 2 November. I am sure that many hon. Members were lobbied by constituents. Two days ago, in his speech on global trade, the Prime Minister set out his support for cutting trade barriers while implementing measures to help developing countries benefit from trade at their own pace. It is clear that the subject is regarded as highly important.

<br>

<p>
<a name="51116h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">It is also worth noting the particular interest of young people in these issues. Whether it was at the July march, the April vigils or the lobby a couple of weeks ago, one thing that struck me was the number of young faces in the crowd. That is just as well. One of my constituents, Sahir Hamid, was lucky enough to attend the World Youth Congress, which was held in Scotland in the summer. A statistic that came out of that is quite shocking. It emerged that 51 per cent. of the world&#039;s population is under 25. Given that statistic, it is just as well that young people are interested in the issues because we shall certainly not solve them without the active engagement of young people around the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">I want to focus my comments and questions on the difficulties faced by developing countries with the current trade system, including trade barriers and the prospect of forced market liberalisation. I also want to highlight the problems with the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. I shall then turn to some possible solutions, with reference to steps at the local and global level, including the forthcoming WTO talks in Hong Kong and beyond.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">On the problems with trade barriers, production support and export subsidies by the developed world can have a devastating effect on developing countries. This is particularly apparent in the agriculture industry. When EU production is subsidised and there are additional subsidies on exports, farmers in developing countries cannot compete. Rich countries spend $279 billion a year on farm support, which is three times more than they spend on aid. It is well acknowledged that a key sticking point, which makes it difficult to envisage a positive outcome to next month&#039;s WTO negotiations, is the EU&#039;s intransigence on protectionist agricultural policies. We know that France, in particular, is opposed to any concessions on that. What discussions have the Minister, the Prime Minister and others in government had with President Chirac on the reform of the common agricultural policy? What tangible outcomes came from the discussions?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">It is not just about agriculture. Tariffs on other industries, such as textiles, also harm developing countries. For example, in 2001, Bangladesh&#039;s exports generated $331 million in tariff revenue for the US Treasury. In that year, the net US aid to Bangladesh was just $87 million. The EU spends &#8364;4 million each year subsidising milk powder to Jamaica. The impact of dumping our excess milk powder on Jamaica has been a sharp drop in Jamaican milk production of 35 per cent. in the past two years. That makes it difficult for countries to continue to run their own agriculture industries and to produce their own food, which would obviously be a more sustainable way forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">In the EU, the average cow now receives $2.2 a day in support, which is more than the daily income of the half the world&#039;s population. It is absolutely crazy. The EU is exporting sugar and beef at respectively 44 and 47 per cent. of their internal cost of production. No wonder sugar producers and cattle farmers in developing countries are losing out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">Global trade has the potential to lift millions of people out of poverty, but liberalising markets too soon can stifle fledgling industries in developing countries. Christian Aid estimates that trade liberalisation has cost sub-Saharan Africa $272 billion over the past 20 years, which would be enough to pay off the region&#039;s debt and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 237WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
pay to vaccinate and educate every child in the region. Developing countries must be allowed the space to set their own timetable for liberalisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">Let us consider the example of rice. In 1995, the International Monetary Fund forced the Haitian Government to cut their rice tariffs from 35 per cent. to 3 per cent. As a result, imports increased by 150 per cent. in nine years, and today three out of every four plates of rice in Haiti are produced in the US. The impact of that is that local farmers&#039; livelihoods have been devastated and rice-growing areas now have the highest levels of malnutrition and poverty. At the same time, profits for Riceland Foods Inc. of Arkansas, the world&#039;s biggest rice mill, rose by $123 million from 2002 to 2003, thanks in large part to a 50 per cent. increase in its exports, many of them to Haiti. We can see the inequality of the system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51116h01_spnew1"><b> Annette Brooke  (Mid-Dorset and North Poole)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate at such an appropriate time. That is important. She has made many valuable points, but will she comment on economic partnership agreements? Does she share my worry that in their current form they are causing a great deal of concern? Most people would like the UK Government to take strong action, using their presidency of the EU to encourage other member states to rethink their approach on those agreements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51116h01_spnew2"><b> Jo Swinson </b> : I share many of my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns about the economic partnership agreements. Trade with developing countries is obviously not governed only by multilateral agreements. The free-trade deals that are negotiated between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries often require countries to liberalise their markets substantially to benefit from trading with the EU. The Government recently said that they have supported the request by the ACP countries to have more time to proceed with liberalisation. However, I agree that the conditionality should be removed from the agreements. Developing countries should be free to choose if, and when, to liberalise. Will the Minister remark on that, in particular the UK&#039;s position on economic partnership agreements? Will he also supply a list of the active partnerships?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">After the introduction of TRIPS in 1995, patent rights had to be guaranteed protection by WTO member countries. Many of those countries wanted to use the formulas from patented drugs to treat their citizens who were suffering from a variety of diseases, from HIV/AIDS to malaria and tuberculosis. However, many pharmaceutical companies were seen to be putting profits before people. The WTO, after much discussion, agreed that TRIPS
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para12"><a name="stpa_12">The reality is different, however, because the only way for many countries to get around TRIPS is to manufacture the drugs in their own country so that they can provide for their population. That does not always run smoothly and not all countries are able to do it. The pharmaceuticals do not always agree that generic drug producers are complying with TRIPS.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 238WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">I am sure hon. Members remember that in 2001 39 major pharmaceutical companies tried to prosecute the South African Government for passing a law that allowed easy production and importation of generic drugs. There was immense pressure against that from the South African Government, the European Parliament and 300,000 people throughout the world from more than 130 countries who signed a petition. That public international pressure forced the pharmaceuticals to back down.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">One company, GlaxoSmithKline, even granted a voluntary licence to a South African generics producer, allowing it to share the rights to GlaxoSmithKline&#039;s drugs, as long as 30 per cent. of the net sales went to an NGO fighting HIV and AIDS in South Africa. That continues to this day, and in many ways it was a positive result. However, let us remember that globally only 15 per cent. of the estimated 6.5 million people who need such treatment were receiving it this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para15"><a name="stpa_15">Given the public health challenges facing many developing countries, from not just HIV and AIDS but malaria, TB, and&#151;most likely at some point&#151;a bird flu pandemic, it is clear that a review of TRIPS is urgently required. Protection must be in place to exempt things that have an impact on the millennium development goals and global disease control. The example of TRIPS demonstrates how the current provisions have proved inadequate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para16"><a name="stpa_16">Global issues require global solutions, but individuals can and do change their behaviour, doing their bit to make trade fairer with developing countries. The Fairtrade Foundation, in accrediting products that are fairly traded, has played a role in enabling consumers to make informed choices. The fact that sales of Fairtrade products have almost doubled during the past two years to more than &#163;140 million shows the rising demand from consumers who take those issues into account when making their buying decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para17"><a name="stpa_17">In my constituency, many keen campaigners have got together to take action at a local level. Setting up a steering group, they are working with local businesses and employers to try to become to first fair trade zone in Scotland. I should be delighted if the Minister would agree to meet me and a group of my constituents who are working hard to promote fairer trade with developing countries, so that we can discuss those issues. Perhaps during his remarks he will say whether he is willing to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para18"><a name="stpa_18">I should like to share a story from my constituency which sums up many of the problems. There is a local gift and tea shop called the Coach House, which is run on a not-for-profit basis to fund charitable projects at home and abroad. Some 20 years ago, a lady called Angela Gomes came from Bangladesh to the Coach House. She represented 4,000 destitute women who made beautiful embroidery. When she was offered a grant for her organisation, she said, &quot;I don&#039;t want handouts. I want you to sell our women&#039;s products. That&#039;s what gives them their dignity.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para19"><a name="stpa_19">Angela Gomes was spot on. The women she represented did not have much and they were destitute, but by being able to ply their trade and have it sold abroad, it helped to lift them out of poverty and they had dignity. That is why, of the three aims of the Make Poverty History campaign, trade justice is the most 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 239WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
important. Trade really can help to lift people out of poverty, and it presents a great opportunity for developing countries. However, the balance needs to be evened up between the rich and powerful developed world and the developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para20"><a name="stpa_20">The talks next month in Hong Kong are vital, as are the discussions that follow in 2006 to secure the details for the Doha round in time to take advantage of the US fast-track agreement. We have all read reports of the recent difficulties with the pre-negotiations. Will the Minister say a little about the Government&#039;s view of the procedures of the WTO, its institutional set-up and how effective it is in producing outcomes from talks that favour poorer countries, given the experience of previous rounds in Cancun and Seattle?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para21"><a name="stpa_21">In conclusion, the UK should be in a strong position to influence events with its presidency of the EU and when the Trade Commissioner is not only a UK nominee to the Commission but, as is well documented, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister. We should be able to use that influence to get a good outcome from Hong Kong. What discussions have the Minister, the Prime Minister and others in government had with Commissioner Mandelson regarding the Doha round in Hong Kong next month? How does he view the potential outcomes and what does he believe can realistically be achieved at those talks?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para22"><a name="stpa_22">A fantastic opportunity to make progress on poverty and trade justice has been presented in 2005. I hope that it will not be remembered as a missed opportunity. This week the Prime Minister encouraged many with his comments on trade in developing countries. I hope that he, the Minister and all those involved in the WTO negotiations will remember the words of Nelson Mandela earlier this year when he called on world leaders to recognise that the world is hungry for action, not words.

<a name="51116h01_time1"><h5>9.47 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51116h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) on securing the debate and on her excellent introduction to it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">My first interest in international development started 21 years ago when I had the privilege to be, in a very minor capacity, a voluntary aid worker in Honduras in central America, which was then and still is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere. My concern about trade and development has burned brightly ever since.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">Trade justice campaigners are right to call on the EU to reduce its trade barriers against developing countries&#151;they remain far too high&#151;but the EU should still encourage poor countries to open their markets as it will also bring those countries gains. There is a wonderful opportunity, as the hon. Lady said, for this country to play a major role at the forthcoming WTO talks in encouraging the EU to lead the world in improving trade relations with developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para25"><a name="stpa_25">However, it is important to remember that reducing trade barriers across the board will do more for poor countries than granting them trade preferences, which, in many respects, might do more harm than good. That is the subject of my humble contribution. I take as a large part of my text the excellent work by Open Europe, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 240WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
which is a think tank specialising in, and encouraging, reform in the EU and in its trading relationships with the rest of the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">An idea advocated by many in the trade justice lobby is that the developed world should introduce more trade preferences. However, there may be huge dangers in going down than route rather than encouraging a general reduction in trade barriers. The goods that are the most heavily taxed by the EU tend to be goods that developed countries have a comparative advantage in producing, not least of which are agricultural produce and textiles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">In a well meaning attempt to offset that disparity, the EU maintains a system of trade preferences, but the system has not been effective. In fact, the net effect is that the EU&#039;s applied tariff rate remains higher for exports from poor countries than for those from rich ones. To give some statistics, countries with a gross domestic product per capita of under &#163;5,000 a year face, on average, an EU tariff of 5 per cent. Countries with a GDP per capita of between &#163;5,000 and &#163;15,000 a year face an average tariff of just under 3 per cent. Countries with a GDP per capita of more than &#163;15,000 a year face a tariff of just over 1.5 per cent. Some of the developing nations that are the poorest in the world face the steepest applied tariffs from the EU. For example, Bolivia and Ecuador face an applied tariff of more than 26 per cent. and Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland face a tariff of 21 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">Another problem is that the trade preference arrangements in place are extremely patchy. Full tariff-free access is supposedly granted to 49 countries on the UN&#039;s list of less developed countries. However, that list does not cover some of the world&#039;s poorest countries and excludes large poor countries, such as Kenya, India, Pakistan and Nigeria.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">Much of the benefit of the system for developing countries is lost because of complex rules of origin. Although in theory a country might be able to export its products to the EU duty-free, such preferential access is available only to goods that contain no parts, materials or ingredients from other countries. One study found that although 84 per cent. of goods from Albania are supposed to be able to enter the EU duty-free, in practice only 2 per cent. do. It is worth remembering that Albania is a country on the continent of Europe and is still, sadly, a developing nation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">A study by the World Bank in 2005 found that the overall value of EU preferences to sub-Saharan African countries amounted to just 4 per cent. of the value of those countries&#039; exports to the EU. It also noted that the majority of supposed beneficiaries of US, EU and Japanese preferences have experienced little or no impact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">The complex system of trade preferences discourages developing countries from reducing trade barriers that might help their development in the round. Without preferences, exporters in developing countries have an incentive to counteract the protectionist tendencies of domestic producers. Preferences are particularly damaging when they are specific to certain industries. For example, the EU&#039;s preferential access arrangements for bananas and sugar from Caribbean producers encourages those countries to invest heavily in volatile, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 241WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
primary industries, which narrows their production base. That leaves those countries more vulnerable to economic shocks in those sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">That system of trade preferences distorts the correct investment decisions that those countries should be making because they act as an artificial incentive to invest in industries in which the recipient countries, with the best will in the world, are not internationally competitive. That is now having a very damaging effect as preferences are gradually eroded as global tariffs fall, albeit too slowly, as part of the WTO process. For example, the effect on Guyana in south America of the first round of reductions in the EU sugar preferences is likely to be the equivalent the UK losing its entire financial services overnight. Some research suggests that preferences may have had a negative effect, for many of the reasons that I have mentioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para33"><a name="stpa_33">All of us want to encourage developing countries to prosper. We have huge sympathy with our constituents who support the Trade Justice Movement. Many of us are extremely sympathetic to those who lobbied us recently, as the hon. Lady said. However, with a cool head, it is important to say that while there is a wonderful opportunity in the next WTO round for the EU to play a leading role to encourage the world to continue to reduce trade barriers, the EU should concentrate on reducing its trade barriers across the board because that will do far more good for poor countries around the world than granting them imperial trade preferences that may do more harm than good in the long run.

Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) on securing the debate, which is obviously a product of the fair trade lobbying event that took place recently. It is good that lobbyists who come here determined to achieve something can have some influence. The Minister also gets an opportunity to set out the Government&#039;s stall before the WTO round. The debate is important in that context.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para34"><a name="stpa_34">I profoundly disagree with the last point made by the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone). He talked about doing more harm than good. He should look at the recent United Nations human development report for 2005, which indicates just how horrific the disparity of wealth and power is in the world and how the living standards of the poorest in the poorest countries in the world are steadily falling. Those countries that have been exposed to free markets for the first time have also suffered losses in public services and falling life expectancy. We must think seriously about what we are doing to this planet.

<a name="51116h01_para35"><a name="stpa_35">Like other Members, I have substantial numbers of people in my constituency who are involved with development and world trade issues, mainly surrounding the churches, the mosque and various faith communities. However, since I have the privilege of representing a constituency that is very multicultural, there are also people from all parts of the world. So, when we have WTO-type discussions, they are very real. People who have been farmers in Africa, Asia or Latin America talk about their own experience. That makes the debate lively and interesting.

<p>
<a name="51116h01_para36"><a name="stpa_36">When the lobby group from my area arrived at Parliament recently, I said, &quot;Look, you don&#039;t need to convince me of the arguments. We all know each other quite well. But if I was the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, what would you say to me?&quot; This interesting debate took place in the rain on the south bank so it was quite brief, but several points were made and it is my duty to put them to the House. First, people were alarmed at the levels of poverty that exist around the world. Secondly, they were alarmed at the degree of power politics involved in the world trade debate and in world trade negotiations. Thirdly, they wanted the European Union&#151;because it is the European Union that leads the negotiations&#151;to recognise that Europe and north America must give up a great deal in order to do something about world poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para37"><a name="stpa_37">It is not good enough for the world&#039;s leaders to embrace Nelson Mandela in Trafalgar square or anywhere else or to go round wearing wristbands, saying &#039;Eliminate poverty now&#039;, if at the same time they are not prepared to make the tough trade and aid decisions that are required if we are to do something about eliminating poverty in the poorest parts of the world. Strong political action is required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para38"><a name="stpa_38">In common with other hon. Members, I have had the opportunity of visiting and, a long time ago, working in poorer countries of the world. One quickly sees what the whole problem is. There is little industrial development happening in most of sub-Saharan Africa, simply because there is not a local market that can purchase the goods on sale; exporting goods is virtually impossible, because the trade barriers of western Europe and north America make that completely hopeless. At the same time, the countries concerned are encouraged to invest in local industry and agriculture, if they can. I remember well visiting some new agricultural enterprises in Angola, although planting the goods in the first place was hardly worth the prices they were receiving. Producing maize anywhere in southern Africa is frankly a total waste of time while the American Administration is paying their friends in the mid-west to produce vast quantities of maize that are then given away in order to destroy local economies all over sub-Saharan Africa. The same is repeated with milk powder and around the world, as the hon. Members for Kettering and for East Dunbartonshire pointed out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para39"><a name="stpa_39">We have to be realistic. There has to be an end to the food dumping strategy. That is really what brought about the fate of the Cancun talks, because Europe and north America were not prepared, in sufficient strength, to give up their food dumping policies and, because of that, the talks broke down. I was not particularly sorry, because the alternative was something worse. I guess that most of the poorest countries felt the same.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">As we move towards the talks that are going to take place in Hong Kong, there is interesting power-play politics going on. The European Union is attempting to get a united position and the United States, having set its face completely against ending any farm subsidies, then announces that they might be prepared to consider some reduction at some point in the future. Everyone starts running around and jumping for joy, as though there has been a complete change of heart. I do not believe that there has been any change of heart in the US Administration whatsoever. An awful lot more than an

<a name="51116h01_para41"><a name="stpa_41">I hope that when we go to the talks in Hong Kong we are prepared to recognise that the current situation cannot go on if we are serious about conquering poverty in the poorest countries in the world. An end to the food dumping policy is required, but also an opening up of markets to the poorest countries and producers in the world. To some extent that flows against the received wisdom, which the International Monetary Fund and others have been lecturing poor countries about for a long time. Whole lectures have been about the need for free trade. We are not quite sure what they mean by free trade, because they never get to the definition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para42"><a name="stpa_42">I look at things this way: every industrial country in the world, bar none&#151;ours included, obviously&#151;has developed industries, agriculture or whatever the main product behind some degree of tariff wall. That is how every single country has developed. They have been successful. For example, most of India&#039;s post-independence industrial development was behind a tariff wall; pre-independence, protection was from the colonial tariff wall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para43"><a name="stpa_43">However, for the poorest countries in the world, we say, &quot;Sorry, no tariffs for you.&quot; They must, in return for being allowed to export some agricultural&#151;unfinished or unprocessed&#151;goods to the west, open their markets up to western goods and policies. That is not just in the manufacturing and sales field, but, crucially&#151;something I was pleased that the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire mentioned&#151;with regard to the agreement on trade and services. The way such trade deals are worked out effectively forces the privatisation of public services in many of the poorest countries, which then provide a huge market for western water companies, telecom companies and so on to take over and run those services. We must be serious in what we are trying to achieve. I hope that we come out of the Hong Kong agreement with an end to dumping policies, an end to the pressure for the privatisation of services and an acceptance that if the poorest countries are to lift themselves out of poverty they must be given some protection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">There is a negotiating issue in that the world is too simply lumped into groups of developing and developed countries. The matter is not as simple as that. Some developing counties are very poor, principally in sub-Saharan Africa and central America, but others are not as poor and may seek to benefit greatly. There must be a better definition of the situation in those countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para45"><a name="stpa_45">The Minister needs time to reply and I know that other hon. Members want to speak. My final general point concerns working conditions and the conditions of women in the world&#039;s poorest countries. The International Labour Organisation is worthy and deserves greater attention, greater support and greater power in the world. The working conditions experienced by garment workers in Bangladesh and most industrial workers in China, Indonesia and many other countries are appalling. The goods they produce, particularly in China, are sold on the high streets of this country, Europe and north America at prices at which we could not even produce them, let alone make a profit. The working conditions in those countries and particularly child labour&#151;it is still rife in many parts of the world 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 244WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and a blot on the world&#039;s conscience&#151;should be dealt with and included in trade rounds. It is unlikely that any of the Governments of the poorest countries in the world will raise issues of working conditions or child labour because they either benefit from them or feel embarrassed by them. It is also unlikely that many of the richest countries will do so because international companies that invest in the garment industry in Bangladesh, China and other places benefit from those appalling working conditions. We must look towards minimum working conditions and labour standards and, above all, the right to join and to organise trade unions. The treatment of women and their lack of education in those countries is serious.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para46"><a name="stpa_46">I know that the Department for International Development shares most of those views and in their development models seek poverty-reduction programmes and improvement in the status of women and the education of children in those countries. However, we have a long way to go. The UN human development report for 2005 came out a couple of months ago and referred to child mortality rates and changing life expectancy. In the highest income countries between 1980 and 2003&#151;a little under 25 years&#151;life expectancy rose from around 73 to 80. In sub-Saharan Africa it rose a little after 1980 but has now dropped to around 45. That is the average for sub-Saharan Africa, but in many countries it is much lower and falling fast. The only other area of the world where life expectancy has not risen is Russia and eastern Europe, the countries that were formerly part of the COMECON&#151;the Council for Mutual Economic Co-operation. There, the imposition of free-market economics, privatisation and, frankly, robbery of the public sector has damaged health and education services beyond all recognition. One hopes that the next time a human development report comes round that situation will be reversed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para47"><a name="stpa_47">Above all, one hopes that the situation will be reversed in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it will not be reversed, and the millennium development goals will not be met, unless there is real change in the attitude of the richest countries in the world. That means a preparedness to stop food-dumping policies and to allow developing countries to export goods freely to western Europe and north America, if that is what they wish to do. Also, we need to allow poorer countries to maintain a degree of tariff protection so that they are not dumped on in terms of manufactured or farm goods; that way, they could develop their own economies in exactly the way that western Europe and north America have done in the past. These are crucial issues. It is not enough to say, &quot;We wish to eliminate poverty and make poverty history&quot;; we have to be prepared to do something about it.

for the future; it shows that we will continue making progress and that people will not forget. There is a real understanding of why some countries are still poor, why people are suffering so greatly, and of the fact that we have the opportunity to change things.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">We have a great duty to deliver something in the next round of talks. I shall refer to representations that we may have all received in different forms. The first is from the mass lobby. It was encouraging to see so many people here, some of whom had travelled so far, and so many young people. We were all asked to write and ask what changes to the EU&#039;s negotiation position the Government were calling for at the World Trade Organisation meeting. We would like to hear some answers on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">I have received more particular representations asking what we, as a nation, will do during our presidency of the EU to come to an early agreement on a date by which rich countries will have ceased to give export subsidies, to dump products on the developing world and to distort world trade in such a bizarre and almost obscene way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para51"><a name="stpa_51">At the WTO conference, attention will be turned to the manufacturing and industrial sectors. Christian Aid submits that concessions on the export subsidies of rich countries are likely to be used as a carrot to induce poor countries to agree to further harmful trade agreements on manufacturing. We have to be clear on that type of thing. We have to give without demanding quite so much in return; we will all benefit as world trade grows. We have to make what might be seen as short-term sacrifices for the greater good. I understand that the EU wants to debate issues such as rules on investment, whereas the poorest countries feel that they have already achieved the exclusion of some of those items from WTO negotiations. The very worst thing would be if we were perceived to take steps backwards at the talks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">I have already mentioned economic partnership agreements, an issue that causes me great concern. A strand of that&#151;the issue of bilateral agreements&#151;has been reflected in everybody&#039;s contributions. The concern is raised because although the Government are saying the right things, we are not at all clear that our Commissioner in Europe is taking forward our view. There are comments in the press that Commissioner Peter Mandelson openly dismisses the huge opposition to EPAs, which is a great concern. I should be grateful if the Minister addressed that in a little more detail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">There are so many reasons why we should be concerned about economic partnership agreements. Are we making grossly unfair demands? There is a lot of evidence that we are seeing EU goods flooding markets and, in return, putting so much pressure on the local economy. Are we forcing new issues through the back door through such agreements? Are we undermining regional integration? That is a serious point, because there is a balance between the very poor countries that already have some agreements with the EU and a certain amount of openness, and they could suffer. There is a conflict with some ACP countries: is their priority trade with Europe, or trade within a regional area? That is difficult to work through. The underlying point is that it 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 246WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is unfair. It is, as many people say, like playing football on a steep slope, and we know who is unfortunate enough to have the uphill struggle.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">I should like to round off my remarks with some of the facts with which we were all presented, but which need to be put on the record. We all know that African people cannot afford delay, and we cannot afford not to get it right. If Africa increased its share of world trade by just 1 per cent., it would get $90 billion, which is three times more than it gets today in aid  and debt relief combined. Hon. Members have already said that that is why trade is so important in our way forward. Unless we get the deal at the WTO, the scandal of unfair trade will continue unabated. Rich countries spend $279 billion on farm support, which is three times more than they spend on aid. The figures are alarming, but we have it at our fingertips to speak and take action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">How can we live with our conscience when we think about the EU dumping sugar and beef at less than half the production cost and how that is affecting the developing world?

Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) on not only securing this important, timely debate, but setting out clearly and strongly a case for the United Kingdom, with its European partners and in the wider world, to take a lead   in the vital negotiations in Hong Kong from 13 December.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">Like my hon. Friend, I was in Edinburgh in early July, marching with hundreds of thousands of others in support of the Make Poverty History campaign. It was telling that not only were many hundreds of thousands of people marching there and elsewhere, but people were attending concerts in various parts of the country and around the world. There were also all those who wished to be at those events but could not attend, and those who wore the wristbands, all of which demonstrated mass popular support for a campaign that reached a crescendo at that time. There were significant expectations on the Government, with its presidency of the G8, to push for a strong, clear outcome in the G8 negotiations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para57"><a name="stpa_57">Clearly, a crucial cornerstone of the announcement&#151;the communiqu&#233;&#151;that came out of the Gleneagles summit was the expectation of a positive outcome for the World Trade Organisation negotiations at the end of the year. My hon. Friend rightly emphasised and welcomed the announcements and promises made on the aid and debt relief packages, although I am sure that they were slower and more modest than a lot of us would have wanted. However, as she demonstrated, they represent only a cup of help in comparison with the tidal wave of impact that trade has on developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">Trade is clearly the cornerstone. Until we get the trading relationship right, we need to do all we can, through aid programmes and support, to enable developing countries to build up their infrastructures and develop health, education and other programmes&#151;literally, to save lives now&#151;so that those countries have the capacity to develop economically.

development will provide the sustainable economic background against which those countries can establish a future that will genuinely make poverty history.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">Emphasis on such issues goes back to the beginning of the Doha round in 2001, when there was a recognition among western countries that the Uruguay round, which finished in 1993, resulted in a deal that was clearly pro-western in outcome. It is worth reminding ourselves that the primary purpose underlying the Doha development round&#151;this is understood among the 148 countries engaged in the negotiations&#151;is to achieve a deal that will make a major contribution to the development of underdeveloped countries, in particular the G33&#151;the poorest countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">In a thoughtful contribution, the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) set out an argument that mentioned research from Open Europe which I have not had the benefit of seeing. I look forward to doing so. It lobs a challenging device into what are sometimes easy, intellectually non-challenging campaigns on trade justice. I should be interested to hear what the Minister knows of the evidence that argues that the best way to develop developing countries is to liberalise at a much more accelerated rate than is proposed either by the campaigners or even by many countries engaged in the negotiations. That is a challenging proposal and, frankly, those who want sustainable development of developing countries and genuinely to make poverty history should not close their eyes to those who take a more libertarian view.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">Westminster Hall is a debating Chamber in which we can consider ideas that we may not be able to consider in the usual cut and thrust and party political point scoring of the main Chamber. There may be some merit in elements of the points raised by the hon. Member for Kettering, and it is important that we do not close our eyes to that. In an ideal world, if all things were equal, there would be no tariff barriers but complete liberalisation of markets, and economies would prosper in those circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">However, as the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) made clear&#151;his contribution stood in contrast to the contribution of the hon. Member for Kettering&#151;we live in an unequal world. That is the reality. Many of the agreements that are being negotiated or reviewed, such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade, are not always favourable to developing countries. There is a great deal of evidence that liberalising services and opening up opportunities to privatise basic service markets, such as water provision, in developing countries have not always resulted in a satisfactory or happy outcome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para63"><a name="stpa_63">I have raised the privatisation of water services in Tanzania and Sierra Leone with the Minister, and lessons need to be learned.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51116h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas) </b> : The hon. Gentleman rightly refers to occasions when liberalisation has not delivered the benefits that some suggested it would. However, does he acknowledge that there are many cases in many developing countries where liberalisation has had a positive impact? The key is to help the developing country to make judgments for itself about opening barriers and opening up sectors, so 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 248WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that it can do so in ways that serve its own interests. Liberalisation per se has not led to the end of the world as we know it. It has brought many benefits, but we need to learn the lessons from the times when it has not worked.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51116h01_spnew7"><b> Andrew George </b> : I am glad that the Minister expresses that point in that way. There are problems to do with access to services in developing countries, and people have not always benefited in the way that they expected. However, that does not mean that we should not recognise that there are opportunities for investment which will genuinely improve services in developing countries. The key question is whether inward investment to such countries improves services or whether, as some have argued, it results in exploitation and a dysfunctional outcome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para64"><a name="stpa_64">There are clear examples of that. The non-agricultural market access negotiations&#151;NAMAN&#151;is a case in point. The hon. Member for Kettering offered some interesting statistics&#151;for example, on comparative tariff barriers as a proportion of per capita gross domestic product. If the figures can be proven to be robust and the Government accept them, they will challenge the assumption that developing countries should have preferential access to western markets. Also, implicit in the Minister&#039;s intervention were questions to do with whether protection of markets in developing countries attracts new investors. Will such protected markets encourage investors because they know that it gives them some advantage, or will it discourage them?

<a name="51116h01_para65"><a name="stpa_65">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) mentioned bilateral agreements, and in particular economic partnership agreements, which are currently being reviewed in the European Union.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para66"><a name="stpa_66">It is clear from the Prime Minister&#039;s speech on Monday night that he sees the west, particularly Europe, as the major stumbling block to a successful WTO outcome. As the Government who currently hold the presidency, one must question whether they will achieve the satisfactory outcome on the talks which we all want. The UK Government and the Prime Minister, who said that he will throw everything he has got at it, have apparent passion for the issue. What things in particular will he throw? What negotiations has he had to unblock the current European Union position?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para67"><a name="stpa_67">If the talks fail, we will return to bilateral agreements between rich western nations and developing countries, as the capacity and the authority of the rules-based trading system, which is what the WTO represents, will be undermined because of the failure of the talks.

made after a meeting on Monday. Does the Minister believe that the primary area of focus, where the biggest move needs to be made, is on an agreement on agriculture and the common agricultural policy in the EU? Alternatively, does he agree that the apparent intransigence of developing countries and the question of their preparedness to open up their own markets and to reduce tariff barriers by up to 75 per cent. on industrial markets need addressing to lift the logjam with regard to the future of the talks?

The expectation is that the Hong Kong discussions will be seen merely as pre-negotiation talks.

If we fail in Hong Kong, the timer will still be running on the negotiators and the negotiations. I would appreciate hearing the Minister&#039;s comments on what is likely to happen after the Hong Kong talks in December, which people widely expect to fail.

I think that she said at one point&#151;I am paraphrasing&#151;that we should give a lot, but expect little in return. It is not as simple as that. If that were the case, Brazil, one of the G20 developing nations, would totally dominate the production of sugar and many agricultural products, primarily because it has two facets that do not exist in many other countries&#151;an almost infinite supply of cheap lamb and very poor labour rules and regulations. That makes it impossible for other countries to compete.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 251WH</b>

Sugar is the best example. If we allowed Brazil to swamp the market in sugar and other agricultural products, the most damaged countries would be the developing nations that are trying to obtain access for their products&#151;sugar and others&#151;in the developed world. Therefore, it is a complex set of negotiations.

Members have spoken about. However, and here I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Member for Islington, North, history is littered with protectionist folly. We do not have free trade in the world at present; we have protectionist blocs, and matching protectionist blocs with further protectionist blocs is not the answer. The evidence shows that, in every decade, countries that pursued a freer trade agenda grew faster than those that pursued protectionist agendas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para82"><a name="stpa_82">There are good examples in history of attempts at protectionism, where countries and regions have tried to hide infant industries behind significant tariff barriers. The best example is Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s and India in the 1970s. Those attempts did not work, because they protected inefficient industries that could gain access only on a domestic market and could not compete internationally. Particularly when those tariff barriers were removed, more efficient industries from outside came in and destroyed them. The Indian heavy steel industry is perhaps the most recent example.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para83"><a name="stpa_83">We accept the necessity for a transition period and we must be careful about moving too fast to the total removal of tariff barriers. We understand the importance of tariffs to many developing countries: they not only enable them to facilitate infant industry promotion, but act as a revenue generator for their exchequers. The statistics show that if all sub-Saharan Africa&#039;s tariffs were removed, the income to the countries&#039; exchequers would be reduced by 10 per cent.

overnight, causing severe difficulties to their Governments and to the improved accountability that we all wish to see in African nations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para84"><a name="stpa_84">However, it is not just the poor and developing countries that are set to benefit from an ambitious conclusion to the Doha round. Non-agricultural access could generate &#8364;20 billion for Europe alone. Economic development, wealth creation, and pan-African as well as international trade, offer the best hope for long-term, sustainable solutions to poverty and suffering in Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para85"><a name="stpa_85">If I were asked to pick out one point from the remarks of the hon. Gentleman with which I wholeheartedly agree, it would be his assessment that what is required in African countries is an improvement in infrastructure to enable people to get their goods to market&#151;not just to the ports, but to internal markets. I visited Mozambique earlier this year, and I had discussions with its lead trade negotiator. I asked her this question: if I could take one message back to the British Parliament, what would she want it to be? She waved away with her hand the importance of the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong, and said, &quot;We need more assistance to develop our internal infrastructure so that Mozambicans can trade with Mozambicans. After we have got to that stage, we can start to worry about exporting our products.&quot; Not enough focus has been given to that point today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para86"><a name="stpa_86">I have a few questions to ask the Minister, before I sit down and allow him to respond. Some of them have been put before; I think the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) touched on one of them. It is clear&#151;not just from reading the press, but from discussions with those who are in the know about the WTO negotiations, and from a recent edition of &quot;Newsnight&quot; that focused on the Trade Commissioner&#039;s negotiating skills, or lack of them&#151;that it is by no means certain that an agreement will be reached. Some countries are manoeuvring into a position to start bilateral trade talks, on the basis that the WTO discussions in Hong Kong will fail. Will the Minister confirm whether the British Government are doing that, or are they still tirelessly working to ensure a successful EU presidency and a successful conclusion to the WTO talks in Hong Kong? Do the Government have a plan 2, if, as looks likely, the WTO talks do not progress in the way we all hope?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para87"><a name="stpa_87">Finally, will the Minister confirm whether the Prime Minister is prepared to sacrifice the EU budget rebate in order to persuade the French to back down on their trade&#151;and, in particular, their agricultural&#151;subsidies? They are continuing to hold out for them, and those subsidies are seen as one of the main blocking points of the Hong Kong negotiations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para88"><a name="stpa_88">I, along with all Members, hope that the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong are a success. However, I have doubts about whether they will be. The issues under discussion are extremely complex. The generalised system of preferences needs to be addressed, as do the rules of origin. The EPAs have not worked, and they need to be looked at. People prefer to use the Cotonou preferences, but under the Cotonou preferences trade between Africa and the EU over the past 30 years has decreased, not increased.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para89"><a name="stpa_89">There needs to be a significant reappraisal of the whole international trading framework, but it is important that the WTO stays together, and that we

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
have an international trading framework. We do not want to go back to the situation where countries make bilateral arrangements that are purely in their own selfish interests rather than in those of developing countries, and which do not alleviate poverty.

May I begin by echoing the comments of other contributors by congratulating the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) on securing the debate and on the manner in which she made her case?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para90"><a name="stpa_90">I agree that this has been good year for development. The hon. Lady was right to highlight the $55 billion debt relief deal that has been secured. It will initially benefit 18 countries and will potentially benefit as many as 38. She might also have wanted to highlight the almost $18 billion Paris Club debt relief deal that has been secured for Nigeria. That will free up an extra $1 billion a year in that country, specifically for poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para91"><a name="stpa_91">The hon. Lady rightly highlighted the progress that has been made on development assistance, and $50   billion extra in development assistance will be secured by 2010, half of which will be for Africa. That is hugely important in its own right. She could also have highlighted the threefold increase in UK aid since 1997, as well as the historic commitment to achieve the 0.7 per cent. goal by 2013. She and other hon. Members will know that if we can persuade other countries to launch the international finance facility, we hope to achieve that target earlier than 2013. Similarly, good progress has been made this year on securing further funding for the fight against HIV/AIDS and the other poverty diseases&#151;TB and malaria, in particular. The commitment on universal access was just one of the highlights of the millennium review summit, as heralded by the G8 process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para92"><a name="stpa_92">The hon. Lady asked a range of questions, which I shall attempt to answer. However, let me first welcome her praise for the work of the Fairtrade Foundation and the many different organisations working up and down the UK to promote fair trade goods. In particular, I highlight the Co-op group, which has led the way in selling fairly traded goods in its stores. I would be happy to meet her and a delegation from her constituency to discuss fair trade issues in the way that she wants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para93"><a name="stpa_93">Looking ahead to the substance of the WTO meeting, the hon. Lady asked about the Government&#039;s view of the process to date. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), one of the House&#039;s long-term doughty campaigners on the issue, rightly highlighted the failure of the Cancun talks. However, I agree with his analysis that one of the positive outcomes of those talks was the way in which developing countries organised themselves for the first time as a strong bloc to make sure that their voice was heard, perhaps also for the first time, in a sustained way in the WTO process. Frustrating as it was that we did not get a good outcome at Cancun, the fact that the voice of developing countries was so strong was hugely significant.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para94"><a name="stpa_94">The fact that the WTO is a multilateral rules-based trading system is something to cherish. Regional and bilateral deals cannot, by definition, offer as much negotiating power to developing countries. Such countries, which continue to come together and organise in the various blocs around the various issues&#151;they are doing so for the WTO talks&#151;would not be seen in anything like the same way in regional and bilateral deals. Therefore the deadline, to which the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire and the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) rightly alluded, on the waiver of the President of the United States is hugely important, and progress needs to be made before that waiver comes to an end.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para95"><a name="stpa_95">We remain committed to the World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong. We will continue to seek an ambitious outcome for the round and recognise the importance of the Hong Kong ministerial talks in that process as a galvanising meeting to secure the progress that we want. We have been encouraged by the American and the subsequent European Union offers. Clearly, there is still a long way to go before we can be confident that agreement will be reached. However, as the Prime Minister made clear as recently as Monday, we remain determined to do all we can to continue to promote the securing of agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para96"><a name="stpa_96">A pro-development outcome from the Doha development round would result in improved participation by developing countries in the world trading system, particularly through substantially increased market access, the dismantling of trade distorting subsidies by industrialised countries and an end to export subsidies. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) asked specifically about when we wanted export subsidies to come to an end. The UK has made clear our support for an end date of 2010 for EU export subsidies, and we continue to argue that line with our EU partners. Perhaps understandably, at one level, our EU partners want to see other developed nations committing to end their export subsidies and want the WTO negotiations to be the vehicle by which end dates are agreed. Nevertheless, we are clear that we want 2010 to be the end date and are continuing to push European and other countries to continue to move towards that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para97"><a name="stpa_97">A development-friendly result from the Doha development round would ensure that poor countries are given the flexibility to plan, decide and sequence trade reforms as part of wider poverty reduction and development strategies. Fundamental to our work to date has been the focus on the issues that matter most to developing countries. As the House is aware, and as the Tanzanian ambassador to Brussels made clear to me when I met him recently, since developing countries rely so heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods, any WTO deal that does not deliver on agriculture is simply not relevant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para98"><a name="stpa_98">As I said, we need to maintain our levels of ambition, particularly in the face of the pessimism that is out there. The fact that some European member states have expressed concerns about how far Commissioner Mandelson has gone in the negotiations implies that there is a serious offer on the table from the European Union. We want to see further progress in the talks, particularly in relation to the concerns of poorer countries about, for example, special products in

<br>&nbsp;<br>
agriculture and a special safeguard mechanism. We want all developed countries to follow the European Union lead and offer immediate duty and quota-free access to their markets to the least developed countries. We want to agree on an approach to cutting tariffs on industrial products to allow developing countries the space&#151;I return to the point alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, in particular&#151;to decide the pace and sequencing of their own reform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para99"><a name="stpa_99">The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) rightly highlighted the problems relating to rules of origin and the need for further progress. He may be aware that the G8, both at Gleneagles and previously at Sea Island, made a commitment to continue a process of reform of the rules of origin. We are certainly arguing for the reform of rules of origin in the European Union, which has been consulting on the issues. We will continue to push for that, for all the reasons to which he rightly alluded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para100"><a name="stpa_100">The hon. Gentleman also touched on the important issue of sugar. It is hugely important that we push through sugar reform, but is also hugely important that we give real and sustained assistance to a number of key sugar-producing countries, particularly those in the Caribbean, with which we have a strong historical relationship. We have been working closely in the Caribbean with a number of those developing countries and have helped them to prepare action plans so that they can take advantage of the assistance that will be on offer from the European Union to move their industries forward in the way that they want.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para101"><a name="stpa_101">I agree with the support that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) gave to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North about infrastructure. A Minister from Zambia highlighted two key transport routes in and across Zambia that need development assistance. He rightly noted&#151;other hon. Members alluded to this&#151;the importance to the least developed countries of sorting out some of those problems first, although there are also other issues relating to making trade more effective and opening up opportunities. That relates to the reasons why my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced &#163;100 million for aid for trade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para102"><a name="stpa_102">I recognise that I have not had the opportunity to answer every question that hon. Members put to me, not least the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole about economic partnership agreements. I shall write to her on that subject and copy it to other hon. Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h01_para103"><a name="stpa_103">There has been a series of discussions across all levels of the Government with European partners, including discussions between my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and the President of France. We continue to make the case for reform of the common agricultural policy. When something takes up 40 per cent. of the budget but helps the interests of only 5 per cent., further reform is clearly needed.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51116h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jeremy Hunt  (South-West Surrey)</b>  (Con): It has been said that the definition of a politician is someone who says when there is light at the end of the tunnel, &quot;Let&#039;s go out and build some more tunnel.&quot; On this occasion, I only wish that that were the case, because my constituency desperately needs a tunnel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para0"><a name="stpa_104">The arguments that I will put today have been put many times before, not least by my predecessor as the Member of Parliament for South-West Surrey. As the Minister is new to the Department, I would like to take the liberty of briefly going through the arguments again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para1"><a name="stpa_105">The A3 links London and Portsmouth. Portsmouth is the second biggest passenger port in the country, carrying 800,000 vehicles and 3 million passengers per annum, and is a key gateway to the continent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51116h02_spnew1"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry  (Portsmouth, North)</b>  (Lab): I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and allowing me, as the Member for Portsmouth, North, to make a point. On freight, at the moment we are not allowed to increase the container size on our railways, so it is likely that more freight will have to be carried by road. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if Portsmouth is to continue to develop freight business at the port, a decent road from London down to Portsmouth is even more important?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51116h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hunt </b> : The hon. Lady makes an important point. Portsmouth carries more than 1 million tonnes of freight per annum and is the fourth largest local economy in the south-east of England. However, of those top four economies, it is the only one without a motorway connection to London and the only one that requires the use of a single carriageway on the main trunk route to London. In fact, Hindhead has the only single carriageway on that network between Portsmouth and Scotland. In addition, Portsmouth is the only one of the four in which the main arterial route to Heathrow and Gatwick is blocked, right in the middle, by traffic lights. The Minister will appreciate the severity of the bottleneck created for my constituents. The queues to get through the traffic lights at Hindhead are utterly horrendous.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51116h02_spnew3"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry </b> : We are trying to build a venue for conferences in my constituency, but we are being told that conference organisers will not send delegates through that bottleneck, particularly at the peak times, so we are losing out on conference traffic. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is yet another reason to pursue the matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51116h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hunt </b> : The hon. Lady again makes an important point&#151;the implications of not having a tunnel stretch way beyond my constituency. Her city is trying hard to catch up with the affluence that is common to the rest of the south-east, but in which Portsmouth has so far been unable to share. She will know that the city is one of the 50 most deprived areas in the UK; that it ranks just 31st in the south-east in average weekly earnings; and that there are 25,000 people of working age in the city without a job.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 257WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para2"><a name="stpa_106">There is not just the economic cost to Portsmouth; there is also a massive environmental cost to the region. The Devil&#039;s Punch Bowl at Hindhead is an area of outstanding natural beauty, of national and international importance, and of special landscape value.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para3"><a name="stpa_107">Let me tell the Minister some of the benefits of a tunnel, as identified by his own Department. There would be a positive economic cost-benefit ratio of 2.8 through reduced journey times. A tunnel would meet the policy objectives to
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;provide an efficient and effective road system and reduce congestion&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para4"><a name="stpa_108">and to &quot;conserve and enhance biodiversity&quot;, and there would be a substantial reduction in the number of accidents&#151;estimated at 40 fewer accidents a year. One accident nearly every week would be avoided.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para5"><a name="stpa_109">A tunnel would have a large beneficial impact on driver stress and would create a reduction in noise levels in Hindhead and the surrounding areas, providing substantial benefits to the historic landscape of Hindhead common and an opportunity for townscape enhancement, including visitor gateways to the common and the Devil&#039;s Punch Bowl. Most importantly, more pedestrian and cyclist trips would be encouraged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para6"><a name="stpa_110">The final argument that needs to be addressed is whether the tunnel is of regional or national significance. It apparently fails to meet three of the four criteria necessary to define it as of national significance, but it does so for the chicken-and-egg reason that those criteria cannot be met as long as there is a bottleneck. The volume of traffic flows&#151;fewer than 60,000 vehicles a day&#151;the low proportion of freight traffic and the route&#039;s lack of inclusion in the trans-European route network are all because of the bottleneck. If the bottleneck were removed it would become the route of national significance that its function as the connecting road between London and Portsmouth demands.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para7"><a name="stpa_111">I conclude by telling the Minister of the terrible price that my constituency pays because it happens to sit right in the middle of that transport disaster zone. The village of Hindhead, home to only 3,000 people, is sheared in half by the A3. If one is on the wrong side, it is quicker to go to nearby Haslemere for one&#039;s shopping than to use the local shops. A huge amount of pollution is generated throughout the day by cars idling, slowing down, revving up and starting at the Hindhead lights. Rat-running is destroying the local villages, and there is a huge problem with planning blight. The lights sit on the main road between Haslemere and Farnham. They are two important towns in the area, but connections between them are massively hampered by the difficulties of travel over the junction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para8"><a name="stpa_112">What I have said is fully supported and endorsed by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hampshire (Mr. Arbuthnot). He is not present today, but he speaks with great passion about the issues faced by his constituents, particularly in Grayshott, the town next door.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para9"><a name="stpa_113">I hope that I have demonstrated to the Minister the seriousness of the situation. In his reply, will he address some of the concerns throughout the region about the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 258WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
procedures used to decide the fate of the tunnel? For example, why has the inspector&#039;s report on the public inquiry, which was completed in January, still not been published? Despite my arguments today, why has the scheme been downgraded from supposedly of national significance to only of regional significance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51116h02_spnew5"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry </b> : On the point about national significance and regional significance, I was reading in the national newspapers this morning about the national Olympics in 2012 and the massive boost to tourism that it will bring. My constituents hope that we will benefit from the huge tourism potential of our naval heritage. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that unless we deal with the bottleneck at Hindhead my area certainly will not reap the benefits of the national Olympics, because people will not want to come through it? I return to the business argument. In the previous Hampshire economic partnership business transport survey, in which 730 businesses took part, 37 per cent. of those that responded made Hindhead their major priority for road investment. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that adds weight to his argument?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51116h02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Hunt </b> : I absolutely agree with the hon. Lady. The Olympics is a huge opportunity not just for London but for the whole country, and particularly for areas such as her constituency that need regeneration. We should grasp that opportunity for Portsmouth. We must however recognise the threat in my constituency of the extra traffic created by the Olympics making a bad situation into a traffic nightmare. The forthcoming Olympics is a strong reason why the issue must be progressed and not delayed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para10"><a name="stpa_114">Why, nearly a year after the conclusion of the public inquiry, do local people still know nothing about whether funding will be made available for the project? Given the strength of cross-party support for it, about which the Minister has heard this morning; given the huge damage that delays inflict on the environment, the lives of my constituents and the prospects for Portsmouth&#039;s regeneration; and given the opportunity cost to the country&#039;s economic infrastructure caused by not proceeding with the project, will the Minister at least agree to facilitate a meeting with the Secretary of State, as requested by the hon. Lady, to resolve this transport crisis with the greatest possible urgency?

<p>
<a name="51116h02_para11"><a name="stpa_115">I think that we can start by accepting that there is some common ground. The stretch of road that we are talking about undoubtedly suffers from bad congestion, journey-time unreliability and a poor accident record, and I guess that we can also accept the social and economic importance of improving it. The points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) on freight, the opportunity cost of not proceeding with conferencing development and the benefits of the Olympics were well made. There is no question but that that stretch of road needs to be upgraded&#151;we accept the fact&#151;and there would be important social and economic benefits from doing so.

<p>
<a name="51116h02_para12"><a name="stpa_116">If a cost-effective, affordable and easy-to-provide solution were obvious, and if the environment were not a factor, I have no doubt that the road would be being built as we speak. Indeed, it would probably have been built many years ago. Unfortunately, however, the environment is an important factor and a cheap solution is not available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para13"><a name="stpa_117">The landscape, as both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend know, is of high quality. It is part of the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty and owned by the National Trust on behalf of the nation. The Devil&#039;s Punch Bowl is a lowland heath site of special scientific interest and is part of the special protection area. It is not just any part of the country that we can drive a dual carriageway through, which is why a tunnel scheme was identified as a potential way to deal with the problem. Unfortunately, however, tunnels are very expensive and we have to take that on board.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para14"><a name="stpa_118">Environmental constraints have meant that we have spent 20 years searching for a solution to the problem. The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to offer me a history lesson on the development of the project, but he skipped over the fact that although the tunnel was identified as the correct solution in 1993, the scheme was stopped in 1995 by the Government of whom his predecessor was a member, because it was regarded as unaffordable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para15"><a name="stpa_119">Following our review of the trunk road programme in 1998, we considered the feasibility of a toll tunnel to make the scheme affordable, but we decided not to pursue that option because of the likely diversion of traffic on to less suitable routes. So, in March 2001 the present tunnel scheme was put into the targeted programme of improvements as a conventionally funded project.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para16"><a name="stpa_120">Draft legal orders and an environmental statement were published in October 2003 and a local public inquiry sat for 29 days between 7 September 2004 and 15    February 2005. Although the hon. Gentleman implied that the public inquiry was finished nearly a year ago, the end of the public sitting is not when such an inquiry finishes. It finishes when the inspector delivers his report, which did not happen until close to the end of August this year. Before a public inquiry statement is put in the public domain, it is normal for the Secretary of State to make his or her views known.

<a name="51116h02_para17"><a name="stpa_121">Because this project is of such great importance, there is not just one Secretary of State who has to take a position on the inspector&#039;s report, but three: the Secretary of State for Transport, the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;because of his planning duties&#151;and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. All three Secretaries of State have to take a position before we can proceed further, and they are in the process, with their officials, of working through the inspector&#039;s report. Hopefully, they will come to a position as soon as possible and we will put that in the public domain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51116h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hunt </b> : Is the Minister able to give me any indication of when he expects the three Secretaries of State to come to their conclusion about the inspector&#039;s report? I am grateful to him for mentioning that the

<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 260WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
inspector&#039;s report was concluded at the end of August, because I did not know that until today. Does he know what the timetable is likely to be?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51116h02_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I cannot give the hon. Gentleman precise details, but I can certainly say that we will conclude the examination as expeditiously as possible. That will not be a very long time away, but it certainly will not be a matter of days; it is a complicated process. It involves us not only studying the inspector&#039;s report but looking at the scheme itself to make sure that the Highways Agency is content with the scheme, the construction and its methods, the costing and all other such issues. Normally, we would make the announcement on whether the scheme was to go ahead and publish the inspector&#039;s report at the same time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para18"><a name="stpa_122">The hon. Gentleman mentioned that the scheme is being treated as a regional scheme. The decision was taken to divide schemes into those of national and of regional importance. One reason for that is that we believe in devolution; we believe that it is important that local people should help us to prioritise transport projects. There is a finite amount of money available for transport projects, so we decided that we would ask the regions to help us to identify which were the most important schemes that needed to go ahead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para19"><a name="stpa_123">How were we to do that? Well, initially the regions just gave us a big shopping list of billions of pounds-worth of transport projects, as if we would spend the entire transport budget in one region. That clearly was not going to work, so we decided to give indicative allocations of funding to each region and to encourage them to give us prioritisations, according to that funding envelope, in order to get realistic advice about the way forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para20"><a name="stpa_124">One or two schemes were separated out as not appropriate for regional prioritisation. The scheme that we are discussing was left with the region so that it could give us regional advice on it. That advice is expected from the region early in January, and then a series of decisions will be made about which schemes we take forward. It is then that I would normally expect the inspector&#039;s report to be put in the public domain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51116h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hunt </b> : Does the Minister accept that because of the significant costs of the scheme, to which he alluded earlier, there is a real risk that if it is re-designated as a regional rather than a national scheme, it will simply not go ahead? That is because the sums of money involved would eat up the entire budget for regional schemes for about two and a half years. Does he accept the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North, and me that the regeneration of our inner cities and the connection of major cities to the capital using proper trunk road networks is of national significance?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51116h02_spnew10"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I certainly accept that we are talking about a large sum of money, and that it will make serious inroads into the regional budget. However, that does not excuse the region from its duty of giving us an indication of what priority it gives the scheme. To be fair to the region, it has initially suggested that it thinks that the scheme has very high priority. However, in making that decision, it seems to be a bit unclear about where the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 261WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
money would come from. We are clarifying that with the region and are making sure that it understands how the funding works before it finalises its prioritisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para21"><a name="stpa_125">Assuming that the scheme remains an important part of the region&#039;s priorities, and assuming that we decide&#151;on the basis of the inspector&#039;s report and other information&#151;that we want to go ahead with it, it remains in the Highways Agency&#039;s targeted programme of improvements as a scheme for construction after 2007&#150;08. However, I repeat the caveat that that is subject to the funding being available, and to the inspector&#039;s report not identifying a show-stopper. That may be a disappointing time scale for the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend; I have no doubt that they would rather that the diggers were there as we speak, but unfortunately that is the timetable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para22"><a name="stpa_126">There is probably not a great deal that I can add to the debate. I think that I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions. The simple fact of the matter is that the importance of the scheme is recognised. There is no question about that. I understand why my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman are pressing so hard to move it forward. I would be doing the same if I were in their position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51116h02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hunt </b> : I hope that I am not about to ask the Minister something that he was about to come to. The concern that the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North and I have is that, although this Chamber is a good forum in which to raise the issue, we need to go into more detail. Given the importance of the matter to our constituents, we are keen to have a meeting with the Secretary of State to go through the issues. Will the Minister agree to facilitate such a meeting so that we can express in more detail the concerns that we have expressed today?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51116h02_spnew12"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I was indeed about to come to that. It is not for me to offer meetings with the Secretary of State and it would not normally be for the Secretary of State to have a meeting on this matter. I am the roads Minister and the advice to the Secretary of State will come through me. I can offer to have a meeting with the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend to discuss the details. However, before deciding on the timing of such a meeting, we need to ensure that we are following appropriate protocol, because I am in the process of reviewing the inspector&#039;s report and making decisions on the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para23"><a name="stpa_127">I would not want to do anything that got us into legal conflict, but, in principle, I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend to go through the issues. However, I assure him that the issues are well understood. The project has been hatching for 20 years so I suspect that there is little that he or my hon. Friend can tell the Department about the scheme, its complexities and importance that we have not come across. If it will help them, however, I am happy to have a meeting with them to discuss it.
</p>

isa particularly good time for him to meet me and the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North so that we can express the concerns of our constituents and he can consider them before making his decision? If we waited until after he had made his decision on the independent inquiry, the meeting would be just a reporting process and we would be unable to make any impact in representing our constituents&#039; views.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51116h02_spnew14"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I certainly accept that we should have that meeting before making the decision&#151;there is no question about that. The issue in my mind is whether it would be helpful to have the meeting in advance of receiving the regional priorities. It might be a good idea for the south-east region to confirm its priorities and to have the meeting when we know the lay of the land. I suspect that we would then be in a better position to talk about the practicalities of how the matter moves forward. I suspect that if we have a meeting now, which I am happy to have if the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend want that&#151;I would never deny a meeting to a colleague&#151;I will be told what I already know and what I have been told today: that this is an important scheme to the hon. Gentleman and his constituents. I know that, so would a meeting to tell me that help? On the other hand, when we have the regional priorities and know the fundamental position&#151;I hope that by then we will also have had confirmation of the final cost of the scheme&#151;we might be better able to have a more useful meeting. However, if the hon. Gentleman wants a meeting in advance of that, I am happy to try to put that into the diary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para24"><a name="stpa_128">I encourage the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend to pick up the pace of their lobbying with the region. The regional prioritisation of the scheme will be key to the speed at which it moves ahead. I encourage the hon. Gentleman to talk to the regional assembly, the regional development agency and so on to stress the importance of the scheme and ensure that it is ranked highly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51116h02_spnew15"><b> Sarah McCarthy-Fry </b> : My hon. Friend mentions the assembly and the South East England Development Agency. Which body makes the decision on the prioritisation: SERA or SEEDA?

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51116h02_spnew16"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : It is SERA that makes the final decision on prioritisation. Indeed, had I not been in this debate today, I would have been addressing its plenary session,    explaining the importance of regional prioritisation and perhaps even the importance of this road. Unfortunately, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#039;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), who was due to attend the debate on my behalf, has slipped a disc and has been immobilised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h02_para25"><a name="stpa_129">It is for the assembly to provide regional advice and it is showing a considerable amount of wisdom in the way that it is carrying out prioritisation&#151;it is showing other regions how to do so. Nevertheless, if the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend were to make their views known to the assembly, that would be very helpful. Perhaps the appropriate time for us to have a meeting is when we have that regional prioritisation.

<a name="time_10">
<a name="51116h03_time0"><h5>2.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51116h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Eric Illsley  (Barnsley, Central)</b>  (Lab): It is a pleasure to introduce this debate on the accreditation of security companies. I was joined in applying for it by my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) and for Selby (Mr. Grogan). I sincerely hope that they will contribute to what should be an interesting discussion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para0"><a name="stpa_131">We are debating matters arising out of the Private Security Industry Act 2001. In a debate earlier this year, I raised the issue of door supervisors, a category of security personnel who come within the legislation. Problems around the registration of a category of security operative that is generally known as wheel clampers have also been well documented. Unfortunately, the Act does not appear to be working too well. We are already hearing anecdotal evidence that door supervisors are circumventing the requirements of the Act by becoming bar staff and taking on a dual role, or by disappearing into the black economy, and wheel clampers are achieving registration and now doing legally what they did somewhat clandestinely in the past, but with a little stamp on the side of the van stating that they are &quot;Government approved&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para1"><a name="stpa_132">We are now dealing with the licensing of security guards, for which the deadline is March 2006. It appears that we are already running into the same problems that were highlighted previously in respect of the licensing of security company operatives. Perhaps the difference in this case is that the security guarding companies about which we are speaking are a little more serious&#151;for want of a better word, a little more important&#151;than those in the liquor industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para2"><a name="stpa_133">I know that the representations made by the liquor industry were not taken too seriously by the Government, but there is probably a little more urgency and seriousness involved in this case, given that we are talking about some of the major security companies in our country. The classic example is Group 4 Securicor. Such companies transport huge quantities of cash and valuables. They guard certain establishments, including Government establishments, and, in some respects, they are involved in the private prison industry. This sector of the industry is involved in big Government contracts, so the Government cannot dismiss it in the same way that they did with the liquor industry. When I say that, I do not refer to my hon. Friend the Minister, who was not responsible for this issue the last time we debated it and, in particular, when we debated it in relation to liquor licensing. However, I hope that he will take on board the seriousness of the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para3"><a name="stpa_134">I shall not go into the Act itself. It has been on the statute book for some years. It sets out the licensing requirements for various categories of security companies: door supervisors, vehicle immobilisers, security guards, key holders, close protection operatives, cash and valuables in transit operatives, CCTV personnel and private investigators. I wish to focus on security guards in this debate. As I said, the deadline for licensing is March. If I quote a few statistics, hon. Members may get an idea of the problems that have been encountered with the licensing of other categories.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 265WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para4"><a name="stpa_135">Licences have been legally required for door supervisors since April this year, at the latest&#151;there were various cut-off dates throughout 2004. Only 34,778 licences have been granted as of 9 November, against an industry estimate of 100,000 door supervisors required. That figure was contested, but even a lower industry estimate of, say, between 60,000 and 80,000, is still well above the number licensed. It is estimated that the industry will require thousands of doorkeepers, many of whom have yet to apply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para5"><a name="stpa_136">The Security Industry Authority set up by the 2001 Act is clearly having difficulties in getting the security industry to comply with the Act. The issuing of licences has been slow and to some extent over-bureaucratic. In an industry in which checks on individual personnel must be completed in a short time&#151;perhaps a couple of weeks&#151;licensing is now taking much longer. More and more individuals are passing the deadlines without being able to obtain their licences, so in many cases they are simply not allowed to work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para6"><a name="stpa_137">I recall that, shortly after the debate earlier this year on door supervisors, a number of police forces throughout the country clamped down over a weekend on the number of unlicensed door supervisors. Many establishments in the liquor licensing trade were closed down if door supervisors were found to be operating without licences. Therefore, there is the dynamic that the police will enforce the legislation. When the industry has a staff turnover of at least 30 per cent. per annum, it is easy to see the difficulties that we face.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para7"><a name="stpa_138">The SIA now acknowledges that the licensing process currently takes six to 20 weeks. In April it was reluctant to admit that it faced delays, but even its website now states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;If you or your staff are travelling abroad in the next three months please do not submit your passport in case of processing delays.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para8"><a name="stpa_139">That is an acknowledgment by the SIA that licensing can take up to three months. With an estimated 50 per cent. of guards and key holders yet to be licensed, the SIA is looking at at least a 12-month delay, so it would seem impossible that the requirement for 50,000 personnel to hold licences will be met by the March deadline. Therefore, a number of law-abiding companies and blue-chip companies&#151;if we want to call them that&#151;that are attempting to comply with the Act will be penalised, and the industry will fall further and further into disarray.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para9"><a name="stpa_140">The problems of delays have already been highlighted. A security company contacted me last week with another example of a Home Office nationality document that was refused as proof of identity. There are many examples of applications being returned because the form has been incorrectly filled in, so the whole process has to begin from the beginning. Group 4 Security told me yesterday that it has about 25 full-time staff working purely on licence applications. That company has taken on the expense and the job of dealing with licences for its staff, but not every company is likely to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para10"><a name="stpa_141">Where do we move from here? What is the answer? How does the industry get round these delays? It would appear that the SIA has now decided to look to an 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 266WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
approved contractor scheme to try to alleviate its problems. Under the Act, the authority can formulate an approved contractor scheme. Indeed, the Act requires the SIA to establish a voluntary system of inspection of security services providers, under which those that satisfactorily meet the agreed standards may be registered as approved and may advertise themselves as such. That is all well and good.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para11"><a name="stpa_142">The key word in that phrase is &quot;voluntary&quot;. The system is intended to be voluntary and details of the approved contractor scheme are listed on the Home Office website under the partial regulatory impact assessment with details of the approved contractor scheme on the SIA&#039;s website. The partial regulatory impact assessment states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;The Act does not specify the exact nature of the approved scheme nor how it should operate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para12"><a name="stpa_143">The foreword to the document states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;The attached document &#039;Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment 25th August 2005: Implementing the Private Security Industry Act 2001 . . . &#039; provides the opportunity for interested groups and individuals to examine and choose from one of the range of options contained in the document. The Home Office hopes that recipients will take this opportunity to respond with their views.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para13"><a name="stpa_144">The consultation period for those who are interested to respond with their views ends tomorrow. Despite that, the SIA has already decided on and implemented an approved contractor scheme. The SIA website refers to that scheme and the criteria involved in complying with it, how to obtain the brochure and how to make an application to be part of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para14"><a name="stpa_145">With the closing date for the consultation being tomorrow, 17 November, one would have expected a wait before implementing the approved contractor scheme. Yet we seem to be well down the road. One would have expected the consultation period to end before considering the options. There are four options: doing nothing, a scheme with no standards set, a scheme using existing industry standards and a scheme with new standards. Today, we are discussing option 4, which is on the SIA website, and the way in which it was decided to pursue the issue by bringing in a completely new set of standards in a completely new scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para15"><a name="stpa_146">It seems that the industry and particularly the SIA are acting as though the scheme has already been set up. The SIA website states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;The objective of other SIA&#039;s Approved Contractor scheme is to raise performance standards and to assist the private security industry . . . The scheme is voluntary and was developed in consultation with representatives from across the industry.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para16"><a name="stpa_147">It goes on to say more about how the scheme was set up, the extensive market research, the process involving interviews with managers and so on. It gives the impression that an approved contractor scheme is already in existence, has already been consulted on, has already been put out to the industry for comment and that the major players in the industry have had their opportunity to contribute. However, one of the bodies that is responsible for standards in the security industry and perhaps the one that sets the highest standards&#151;the National Security Inspectorate&#151;has not been consulted or been part of the consultation by the SIA, which did not consider it to be a relevant organisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para17"><a name="stpa_148">I understand that eight assessment bodies, which include the NSI, have been set up under option 4 and that some days ago staff were selected and sent for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 267WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
training for that approved contractor scheme. It seems that, to all intents and purposes, the consultation process ended a considerable time ago and the SIA is going for option 4 as the standard for the industry. Why has that occurred? Why was the NSI not consulted and why has the SIA, despite the fact that the consultation process is still ongoing, decided on that option? When we examine matters in detail, we see that the answer is simple.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para18"><a name="stpa_149">The SIA needs an approved contractor scheme in place by March 2006 because of the delays that it is experiencing in issuing the licences. An approved contractor scheme will allow for fast-tracking so that the top 20 companies in the industry, which are probably also approved by the National Security Inspectorate, will be fast-tracked on to the scheme and allowed to employ unlicensed staff. Staff will be able to be deployed by the companies before their licence is supplied. Obviously, the NSI has been excluded from the consultation because its standards are too high. We will not be able to have a fast-track scheme in March 2006 that does not allow companies on to it quickly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para19"><a name="stpa_150">The NSI standards will be too high. The SIA needs a scheme in place quickly to get around the delays in the licensing process to allow companies to have the leeway of employing staff who have not yet been given their licence. As a result, we will have a compulsory scheme. It will no longer be voluntary because every company will need to be part of it so that it can be fast-tracked to obtain the accreditation to allow it the exemption in respect of unlicensed staff. The chances are that we shall see an approved contractor scheme with lower standards than those that already exist in the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para20"><a name="stpa_151">It is incredible that the consultation period has been ignored. Everything seems to be up and running before the period has ended. The SIA seems to be wedded to option 4 to the point at which it has excluded consideration of any other available option. It has ignored the NSI, the accreditation body with the highest standards and attributes of any accreditation organisation in the security industry. The consultation process has become something of a sham. Option 4 has to be the one on which the SIA embarks to minimise the problems of the delayed licences.Has my hon. Friend the Minister given approval to the SIA to go ahead with option 4? Has the Secretary of State given approval for the approved contractor scheme to be the option chosen in advance of the consultation period?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para21"><a name="stpa_152">Other options are available under the regulatory impact assessment. My colleagues might refer to them in the debate. One of them is the option to do nothing. Throughout the process, it seems that the National Security Inspectorate has been sidelined by the SIA to the point at which the SIA has suggested that the &quot;do nothing&quot; option is not available to it. The SIA stated that a decision to implement option 1 would mean
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;that the SIA would be failing in its statutory duties under the Act to implement a scheme and this would be open to challenge and possibly judicial review.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para22"><a name="stpa_153">That is stretching the limits of logic a little, in that the SIA is always open to challenge and/or judicial review. However, no such challenge could stand up if the Secretary of State were acting within his powers. How can someone be liable to judicial review&#151;to challenge&#151;for implementing an option that is contained in the Home Office consultation document? How can the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 268WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Secretary of State be subject to judicial review for implementing an option that he placed as part of that consultation? It seems rather strange that the SIA has taken that attitude&#151;unless it has done so to try to ensure that its approved contractor scheme is the one that is chosen, instead of the NSI scheme or any other scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para23"><a name="stpa_154">I will now run through some of the consequences of option 4. If the industry goes along that route, the approved contractor scheme will not be voluntary. Because of the licensing delays and the need for every company to get as many people as possible operative by March 2006, every company will have to be part of that scheme; they will want to be part of it to ensure that they can enjoy the exemptions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para24"><a name="stpa_155">For companies that train their security guards, there will be a short period of training, but they will simply not be able to have security guards standing round for between four and 20 weeks doing nothing until they get a licence. That will be a cost to companies that they cannot incur, especially bearing in mind the 30 per cent. turnover of staff in the industry. Companies will need to have their operatives deployed as soon as possible, so they will need to have approved contractor status to enable them to take advantage of the exemption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para25"><a name="stpa_156">That means that from March 2006, unlicensed guards will be working throughout the security industry. That defeats the whole object of the Act. The idea was to have regulation and improving standards, but we appear to be going the other way. Rather than address the cause of the delays, we seem to be moving the goalposts in order to try to defray the effects of what is now happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para26"><a name="stpa_157">I am reminded of the response that I received when I raised the issue of door supervisors. No assistance was forthcoming when we asked for an extension of the time available for door supervisors to be licensed. However, it now seems that the SIA is willing to bring in the approved contractor scheme and to allow unlicensed operatives to work. There appears to be a bit of hypocrisy there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para27"><a name="stpa_158">Before anybody challenges me on the unlicensed operatives, let me state that the impact assessment says that 15 per cent. of operatives can be unlicensed, provided that 85 per cent. of them are licensed. If there were a four-month licensing period in any one year, that would mean that a security company could take advantage of three tranches of 15 per cent. throughout the 12-month period; in other words, 45 per cent. of the operatives working for it could be unlicensed. If the SIA got the licensing period down to two months, there could then be up to 90 per cent. unlicensed operatives working throughout any 12-month period. Therefore, it appears that we are allowing the level of standards to go the wrong way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para28"><a name="stpa_159">Because of the way that the approved contractor scheme allowing the exemptions is progressing, we will lower the standards in the security industry. In order to get this type of accreditation quickly, the standards will have to fall; they will have to be lower to enable companies to fast-track themselves on to the scheme. If the SIA were to consider the other options&#151;for example, the option of doing nothing and retaining the existing standards, or of using an existing body to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 269WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
accredit the industry&#151;those standards would remain at the current high level; they could, of course, also be improved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para29"><a name="stpa_160">At present, given the way that things are going, the approved contractor scheme is likely to lower standards. As there has been negotiation with parts of the industry&#151;not all of it&#151;over the past few months, it appears to me that the SIA has happily agreed with the industry that that is the way forward. The SIA will get round the problems of delays by allowing companies to employ unlicensed security guards from March, as a consequence of the lower standards of the approved contractor scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para30"><a name="stpa_161">One of the issues that has been raised with me is that extracts of speeches have appeared on the SIA website relating to improving companies&#039; profitability, although I understand that they have now been removed. As far as I am aware, there is no mention in the 2001 Act of any requirement on the SIA to promote profitability or to improve the functioning of the companies, other than to regulate them and to license them. One must question in exactly what direction the SIA is travelling in relation to this approved contractor scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para31"><a name="stpa_162">It is also worth pointing out that many companies have spent a hell of a lot of money on accreditation, in particular the accreditation with the NSI. Many companies have spent a lot of money getting their employees licences; Group 4 Securicor representatives told me yesterday that it is paying for all its operatives and it is questioning who will pick up the cost. It looks like the customers will pick up any costs arising from the problems in the licensing regime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para32"><a name="stpa_163">It is clear that the 2001 Act has caused huge implementation problems for every sector. It was designed to reassure the public and to improve standards in the security industry, but it is failing yet again. An approved contractor scheme is being forced on the industry unnecessarily, in an attempt to get around the delays in licensing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para33"><a name="stpa_164">I make a plea to the Minister to re-examine these issues, in particular the attitude and the actions of the SIA, because we are in danger of seeing the industry introduce a scheme that will enable it to avoid criticism over its delays and incompetence in the licensing regime, and allow unlicensed operatives to work from 2006. As far as I am concerned, that is defeating the spirit and intention of the 2001 Act.

<p>
<a name="51116h03_para34"><a name="stpa_165">I have a long interest in security. I campaigned for 25    years, unsuccessfully, to get away from self-regulation. It was a pathetic industry that had enormous turnover&#151;100 per cent. a year and sometimes more&#151;of personnel, appallingly low standards and very low profits. Profits are important for companies&#151;to get the investment and pay the salaries. It was an industry with hardly any training. Most of the guarding companies provided no training whatsoever. Even the better companies, who belonged to the British Security Industry Association provided two days&#039; training&#151;usually pathetic&#151;and one day&#039;s on-the-job training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para35"><a name="stpa_166">I worked very hard to try to persuade the previous Government to introduce licensing. They rejected it. When this Government came to office, they introduced legislation&#151;and the 2001 Act is on the statute book. The Security Industry Authority has, I think, now been in operation for 18 months. It could have decided to rattle through in six months the licensing in an industry that has about 400,000 people. It decided to be patient. Let us remember what the passport office did when it tried to move too quickly. There was chaos. The SIA is moving slowly but carefully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para36"><a name="stpa_167">Of course, there are problems and people are whingeing. Perhaps the people who take a long time to have their forms returned and validated have not filled them in properly. What percentage of forms sent in by people seeking a licence had that form dealt with? The answer is that 30 per cent. of all forms submitted are returned to the person signing them to ask for the information that was requested. Am I pleased with the scheme&#151;which my hon. Friend is apparently pleased to see return&#151;where nothing is to be done, with a self-regulatory body in charge of the inspectorate? No. The party that we represent fought for a long time to change it, and to return to it would be going backwards at a rapid pace.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para37"><a name="stpa_168">The industry is in the process of being regulated. I can answer my hon. Friend&#039;s question as to why it is concerned about profit. Every Bill I have introduced&#151;all five of them&#151;has said that the regulatory authority should not just be a gatekeeper, admitting people or rejecting them. The industry is fragmented and its members are constantly at war with each other, which is not satisfactory. Having a neutral organisation&#151;the SIA&#151;trying to bring a degree of coherence is wholly desirable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para38"><a name="stpa_169">I hold a number of honorary positions in the security industry, none of which are paid, but I declare them. I hold a position in the Joint Security Industry Council, for which I am not getting paid; that is representative. Even the dog handlers have me as a patron. I do not want any jokes about being barking mad, because I have used them already.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para39"><a name="stpa_170">I have good feel for the security industry. I have written two books and 172 articles and have spoken in hundreds of meetings, trying to set up an organisation that eventually became the Security Industry Authority. One of the happiest days of my life was when the Private Security Industry Act 2001 came about. Was it perfect? Like hell it was not perfect, but it was rushed through before the election and was the only legislation that was feasible. I was told, &quot;It&#039;s either this or nothing at all.&quot; The Act is so bad it is almost good, in that it allows the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 271WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
SIA to regulate through subordinate legislation. Is this global industry&#151;growing to $120 billion in the world&#151;doing its job? It certainly is here.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para40"><a name="stpa_171">I believe that the industry is improving enormously. We are getting away from many of the faults, which have now been eradicated. Is the SIA perfect? No, it is not. The people who opposed regulation in the first place are still whingeing. They did not like it then and they will take any opportunity to criticise the SIA if it acts against their interests. The SIA has done reasonably well. So far, it has had a catalytic effect on the private security industry. I shall mention my criticism in a moment, but it has done a good job.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para41"><a name="stpa_172">Some ask why the regulatory authority exists when there is self-regulated delivery. Whose self-regulation today is delivering? Did it ever deliver? It certainly is not delivering now. I do not want to go back to that period of statutory self-regulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para42"><a name="stpa_173">I am told that the model for training and accreditation has already been decided. It is up to the Minister to tell us whether he has made a decision already. I doubt whether he has. Many organisations&#151;a vast number&#151;offer training. I was told that there are not enough trainers, but there are 6,500 of them, and 2,000 training providers. That is no shortage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para43"><a name="stpa_174">I am told, &quot;It is too difficult to licence people.&quot; However, 140,000 people, some 60,000 of whom are private security guards, have been licensed and trained already. Yes, there were problems with door supervisors, but that was in a trial run  in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight and, as I said earlier, a lot of people did not complete the forms correctly. Lessons have been learned from that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para44"><a name="stpa_175">The idea that the approved contractors scheme will somehow result in a lower standard is a fantasy. My hon. Friend makes the following argument: &quot;All right, let the person&#039;s friends run their section of the security industry. Let&#039;s have a regulatory scheme with no standards at all.&quot; No, I do not want that; I want a proper, approved contractor scheme. If anyone reads the brochure that has been put out, it will tell them exactly what is intended. There is an attempt to raise management standards. The licensing is for the personnel. The approved contractor scheme will try to raise the quality, the process and the commercial relationships, to improve the management, the financial management, the quality of people and the quality of leadership and to develop corporate responsibility. If that is going backwards, my sense of direction is completely unacceptable and intolerable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para45"><a name="stpa_176">The scheme will be good. My criticism is that management training will not be compulsory; it should be. If the guy in the infantry has to go through a training programme&#151;and four days is not enough&#151;why should management in a whole myriad of organisations not be obliged to get a degree or qualification?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para46"><a name="stpa_177">The approved contractor scheme will supplement licensing. It is very good, and the idea of reneging on a commitment to introduce it is totally erroneous. My impression is that a number of companies will now bid to be, in essence, the approver of the various schemes across a wide range of activities. I believe in competition; it is better to have one organisation losing its ability to control perhaps 70 per cent. of the market and to allow in others who will operate to a scheme laid 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
down by the SIA. At the moment, the NSI is market leader, with 70 per cent. of the business, I am told. If the Minister approves the scheme, others will be competing. I would have thought and hoped that most people would be prepared to see a system under which others enter the market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para47"><a name="stpa_178">The industry is becoming more professional. Thousands of men and women now have qualifications when previously they had none. I had estimated that there were 100,000 door supervisors, but the figure was much lower, and I shall say why: because thousands of door supervisors knew full well that they would never pass a criminal records check, so they disappeared from the scene. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central said that he had anecdotal evidence; if he is able to provide more than that and say which bars or restaurants employ unlicensed door supervisors, he should please pass the details on to the local police, who have the responsibility for prosecuting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para48"><a name="stpa_179">I move on to my last point. The industry is accused of taking too long to license; I think that 80 per cent. of all licence applications are dealt with in six weeks. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I listened patiently to my hon. Friend; perhaps he will listen to me for a few more seconds. I wish that the period was shorter than six weeks, but we are not talking about 18, 20 or 30 weeks. If we are, it will perhaps be because the relevant guy lives in Botswana, and it will take some time to find out whether there is a regulatory authority in that country to get the information back over. That is the reason.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para49"><a name="stpa_180">Of course, the approved contractor scheme&#039;s fast-tracking is going to be criticised. However, my hon. Friend says that the process takes too long. Under the new scheme, if the approved contractor is seen as honest, ethical and meeting all the standards, somebody who applies&#151;no contractor should employ a security guard if it has not gone through its own system of vetting&#151;and gets past the system will be allowed to enter work, and the licence will follow. So the contractor decides whether it wants the employee quickly or at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para50"><a name="stpa_181">I hope that the Minister will answer some of the questions. I have my criticisms of the SIA but, on balance, it is doing a good job. It is being undermined by people who are trying to do it in for their own commercial reasons. I really hope that, in his response, the Minister will say that, in the 18 to 20 months that it has been functioning, the SIA has done pretty well. When mistakes have been made, they can be remedied, but any idea of loosening its control or of taking away its right to enable a number of companies to operate in the role of supervisor, and of leaving the present arrangements in place would not be adequate. Those with many interests in private security would wonder whether that was the right decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para51"><a name="stpa_182">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give the SIA support. It deserves it. In two or three years, the industry will become unrecognisable from the pathetic industry that it was prior to the legislation, and that will be due to the SIA.

education, and his depth of knowledge and that of the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) is certainly something with which I cannot compete.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para52"><a name="stpa_183">I shall focus briefly on my brief experience of door supervisors in my constituency. I might be charged with being a whinger but, as the right hon. Member for Walsall, South said, worries have been expressed about the working of the system as it is constituted, and that needs to be dealt with by the Minister in his discussions with the SIA. There are widespread concerns about the working of the SIA, in particular its interface and record in dealing with those who seek accreditation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para53"><a name="stpa_184">A month ago, I accompanied my local police force in Aberystwyth on night patrol. As we visited the pubs and clubs in the town, it quickly became apparent that the system does not always work as effectively as it should. There is the worry that a body that is funded publicly to the tune of &#163;25 million and which charges up to &#163;590 for administration per application is not coping with the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para54"><a name="stpa_185">I wish to cite a brief example provided by a constituent. Mr. Aled Davies of Aberystwyth assures me that his worries are widespread. His business has a capacity that requires a maximum of nine door supervisors, an extensive pool of people all of whom require training and accreditation. Above all else, he needs a prompt and efficient system that deals with applications within six weeks at least. Sadly, he told me of delays of six months. Few of us would deny that the current system is better than what existed before, as the right hon. Member for Walsall, South said, but individual failings need to be addressed. My constituent reported some delays of more than a year. However, I accept the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the huge number of forms that are inaccurately completed and the time that it takes to remedy the mistakes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para55"><a name="stpa_186">Aberystwyth is a university town. The income of many students is supplemented by such work, but by the time that many of the applications are processed, they have already left town. Mr. Davies also cited examples of lost application forms and the failure to reach relevant officials by telephone. He is a responsible business man who wishes to comply with the spirit and detail of the law, but he has been in the responsible position of turning away business because he lacked sufficient accredited employees as a result of the system not working.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para56"><a name="stpa_187">I do not wish to enter the debate of whether the figure is 90,000 or 120,000, but there is a huge backlog of applications and that needs to be dealt with at the first opportunity. Earlier this year, there was a truce between the police and the SIA in that there were to be no prosecutions in certain areas, such as Ceredigion and London, as long as the bouncers could prove that they had applied for a licence. That short-term approach makes a mockery of the system. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the extent of the application backlog. We have heard conflicting figures. Can he explain what procedures are in place to measure the performance of the SIA? It is clear from the widespread support that the 2001 Act had at the time that the SIA is a laudable organisation in its intent, but serious matters need to be addressed.

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51116h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. John Grogan  (Selby)</b>  (Lab): It is a pleasure to take part in this debate, which has been a little more spirited and lively than I expected when I sat down this afternoon. I congratulate the three hon. Members who have taken part so far, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing it. I shall try to carry on the Yorkshire flavour that he brought to the debate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) spoke with a great deal of authority and experience, and I learned quite a few things. I did not know about his connection with a dog-handling authority. I shall go away and contemplate that. Equally, the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) brought a great deal of local experience to the debate. That is what I want to follow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para57"><a name="stpa_188">I speak as chair of the all-party parliamentary beer group. It is a tough job, but someone has to do it. We held a seminar on this subject in the dying days of the previous Parliament. I do not have the vast experience of some of my colleagues in this matter, and that was my first association with the issue. Over the months, I have kept in touch with the pub and club industry about the implementation of the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para58"><a name="stpa_189">I start from the standpoint that this industry needed regulating. The 2001 Act was a substantial advance, and clearly many hon. Members more experienced than me have devoted a great deal of time to it. However, it is right to consider how the Act is working in practice. The approved contractor scheme cannot come a day too soon for many pubs and clubs. There are three reasons why we now need to increase the number of door supervisors who can legally work in pubs and clubs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para59"><a name="stpa_190">First, we are coming up to Christmas. Even though we will probably not need door supervisors at the all-party beer group&#039;s Christmas party, parties up and down the land will need them, and the demand for door supervisors will be high. Secondly, next week, following yesterday&#039;s vote in the House, the Licensing Act 2003 will come into force. That will increase the amount of time that pubs and clubs are open, so there will be an increased demand for door supervisors. Thirdly, the industry wants to co-operate with the Government&#039;s alcohol misuse enforcement campaign and, again, door supervisors are an important part of that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para60"><a name="stpa_191">It is a matter of some concern that, in recent months, the number of people who have applied for door supervisor&#039;s accreditation has slowed up considerably since accreditation became mandatory. Many people applied in the run-up to the cut-off date, but the number has now slowed to a trickle. For many of those who were door supervisors, the economics of having to find &#163;450 for the application and the accreditation, when they will not work for six weeks or whatever it may be, may mean that they have to look for alternative work and do not go into the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para61"><a name="stpa_192">The approved contractor scheme is therefore vital in increasing the supply of door supervisors to the industry in this critical phase. Clearly some people are arguing for option 4 and completely new standards. In terms of option 3, some British standards&#151;BS7960 is one&#151;are widely respected in the industry. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South that a monopoly is not desirable in these circumstances&#151;there 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 275WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
should be a number of competing providers&#151;but we do not necessarily need to reinvent the wheel. I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Minister to scrutinise the options carefully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para62"><a name="stpa_193">There is even a possibility that, at some stage following the Hampton review, the SIA will be merged with the Health and Safety Executive. Where to go from here is a finely balanced judgment. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to look carefully at some of the existing standards and to consider whether he can build on them instead of scrapping them and going for option 4. We need the approved contractor scheme in place quickly, not least to ensure that the pub and club industry is completely in compliance but also that it has a supply of door supervisors to allow it to comply but still provide a service for the nation.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51116h03_spnew6"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b>  (Lab): I wish to make just a few points, and will try not to repeat what has already been said by other hon. Members. I largely support what my hon. Friends the Members for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) and for Selby (Mr. Grogan) said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para63"><a name="stpa_194">I wish to reiterate the reason why many of us worked for and supported the legislation that set up the SIA and that introduced regulation for all parts of the security and leisure industry. My particular interest since I was first elected in 1997 has been the issue of door supervisors. I am particularly interested in it because it is a matter of public safety, in particular the safety of young people, as they tend to make up the majority who frequent pubs, clubs and large-scale pop industry events. In common with many hon. Members, I had heard all sorts of horror stories from constituents&#151;or, more often, from constituents&#039; parents&#151;who had fallen foul of door supervisors who were either overtly criminal and violent, or who involved themselves in the drug trade and simply used their door supervising role to sell drugs. In the context of pop concerts, which have an extremely young clientele, there was the added problem of supervisors who were suspected of sexual offences. They used their position at concerts to put young people at considerable risk. Therefore, I am absolutely behind the SIA and the legislation as vital methods of protecting public safety.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para64"><a name="stpa_195">I have some concerns, however, about how the SIA is operating. First, I do not think it good practice to consult on something but put a decision into effect before the consultation has ended. It makes a mockery of consultation, and that has a much wider impact than the issue that we are discussing. People will say, &quot;It just proves that the Government consult only when they have already made up their minds.&quot; People run everything into &quot;the Government&quot;. It is extremely bad practice to consult and then to anticipate the result of the consultation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para65"><a name="stpa_196">Secondly, I am concerned that the approved contractor scheme is giving firms a licence, in essence, to subvert the will of Parliament. That is a hard thing to say, but I believe that is what it is. In passing the legislation, Parliament wanted there to be no unlicensed door supervisors, wheel clampers and so on. Not 85 per cent. but 100 per cent. were to be licensed. Whatever the safeguards involved in including in the approved 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 276WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
contractor scheme only companies that have signed up to it and that have passed certain standards, the scheme allows companies to operate legally with unlicensed operators. I do not believe that that is acceptable, and I do not understand why it is allowed. It seems to be completely against the spirit of what Parliament intended and is subverting the democratic and parliamentary will. One can argue about what 15 per cent. means, but, because of the fast turnover in the industry, 15 per cent. can mean a lot more than 15 per cent. over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para66"><a name="stpa_197">The third issue is the nature of the standards in the approved contractor scheme. There is merit in a graduated scheme; that is, a threshold and then grades above that clearly require a higher standard of some firms than of others. Presumably, such grades would give firms a competitive advantage over firms that have achieved the legal standard, but not the two-star or one-star standards above it. I am concerned that the approved contractors scheme far from maintains and improves standards in the delivery of security services, as was said in the written answer received from the Minister yesterday, on 15 November.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para67"><a name="stpa_198">Imposing a single threshold, which is lower than many of the standards already operating in the industry, although requiring every company to reach a minimum standard, will not give any encouragement whatsoever to firms to do any better than that minimum standard. That will not lead to an improvement in overall standards, merely a raising of the standards of the poorest firms.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51116h03_spnew7"><b> Lynne Featherstone  (Hornsey and Wood Green)</b>  (LD): The debate has been tremendously interesting, particularly for someone like me, who does not have huge experience of the security industry. However, I have huge experience of what my constituents face locally. We welcomed the Private Security Industry Act 2001 as a way of regulating an industry&#151;whether door supervisors, wheel clampers, for which I have forgotten the technical term, and now the security industry itself&#151;that was upsetting a great number of people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para68"><a name="stpa_199">Clearly, with the relaxation of the licensing laws, there is going to be a greater need for door supervisors. I have listened to the debate, and I would stand up for the public. Trust has been put in the Government to ensure that an industry that had a tremendously bad reputation, and was dangerous, would come under regulation. I am less than happy to hear that there is a way of circumventing the rules put in place for the public&#039;s protection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para69"><a name="stpa_200">I liken the situation to what happened when I was a member of the London assembly, where I was chair of transport and the Mayor of London licensed unregulated minicabs. The attempt to regulate is not dissimilar. There is an owner, an individual or driver and&#151;for the taxi trade&#151;the vehicle itself. Frankly, any circumvention or shortening of a process that will deliver safety to the public should not be encouraged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para70"><a name="stpa_201">On wheel clampers, I have terrible examples of their effect on the public. One of my constituents was clamped and, as is not unusual, was extremely upset. However, the vehicle immobiliser&#151;that is the term&#151;called her a great number of names. She rang me in tears. I cannot

&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 277WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
attribute what happened next directly to the clamper, but the police were involved and, three weeks later, she killed herself. That is a tremendously tragic case. An industry that was so cavalier is required to have much higher standards, and what the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) said about door supervisors applies to the security trade. Standards must be raised to avoid such tragic events&#151;that case was clearly at one end of the scale. I would be extremely disheartened if an approved contractors scheme allowed the industry to circumnavigate the intention of the original legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para71"><a name="stpa_202">The SIA has a tremendous problems and is clearly not coping with the load, although I do not have the information as to whether that is because it is being badly run or being inappropriately resourced. Private security companies have now become an important part of the industry, so the licensing scheme is important and the public needs confidence in the industry. If the licensing process falls into disrepute, we are back where we started and no gain has been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para72"><a name="stpa_203">What is happening with the licensing of doorkeepers is not comforting. We are only part of the way through the process and are having to delay or make agreements with the police, such that, so long as one has applied, one is let off being prosecuted, because the licence is on the way. &quot;I&#039;ve applied for my licence, officer.&quot; The SIA set out to license something like 85,000 door supervisors, but only 40,000 have been put through.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para73"><a name="stpa_204">In the end, some criticism has to be levelled at the Government for not analysing what would be necessary or the time scales that would be involved to maintain the standards that the public are relying on coming out of the legislation. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that resourcing will be increased to enable more licensing and that no standards will be dropped during the licensing so that the public can be reassured that the legislation enacted will serve them as they expect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51116h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bruce George </b> : The process of licensing has not been discredited. Of course there are people who have had problems, but will the hon.

I feel that people have been got at by the use of wrong information. The system is working reasonably well and I hope that when she explores the matter further she will realise that the system has not been discredited and that standards are not falling. I speak as someone who has spent 25 years observing the process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para74"><a name="stpa_205">It has been an extremely interesting debate. I begin by thanking the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) for securing the debate and allowing us all to air views that will be helpful to the industry, whether we agree with what is going on at the moment or not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para75"><a name="stpa_206">My own exposure to the matter came initially while serving under the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) on the Defence Committee some four years ago when that Committee for reasons best known to posterity&#151;and the right hon. Gentleman himself&#151;was chosen to carry out the investigation of 11 September 2001 and, for want of a better phrase, the homeland security measures that the Government might choose to put in place to defend the nation in the event of such an incident happening again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para76"><a name="stpa_207">I had always regarded the community of people in question as those who look after pubs, clubs and other establishments and still see them as such in my community. I began to realise that these ladies and gentlemen could have a much more serious, far-reaching effect, were they to be properly regulated and brought into the wider police family. It is a move that I could wax eloquent about, but I will not for the simple reason that much more needs to be done about the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para77"><a name="stpa_208">Although I, as a Tory, feel strongly that government should be small rather than large and believe in all the principles of competition, I understand that the industry needs some regulation. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain whether that regulation is working correctly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para78"><a name="stpa_209">I thought that the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) gave some very interesting insights into her personal experience, which, with respect, she said was not deep experience; I suspect it was more visceral. It shed a light on the situation of those who are on the receiving end and it was an interesting juxtaposition to the experience of the right hon. Member for Walsall, South, who is clearly deeply knowledgeable on the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para79"><a name="stpa_210">Similarly, the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) made some extremely good points&#151;without wishing to sound patronising&#151;particularly about doorkeepers who, without regulation in the past, had not given the police assistance but serious problems. The views on the industry of the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) blew the froth off the whole subject; he took more or less the same view as the hon. Members for Milton Keynes, South-West and for Barnsley, Central.
</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para82"><a name="stpa_213">The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central was just saying that the distance between himself and the right hon. Member for Walsall, South was not that great. I have no doubt that, both physically and emotionally, the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman are close to one another. However, anyone who knows the right hon. Member for Walsall, South knows that he always speaks passionately and makes his case with great perspicacity. No doubt because of his association with the guard dog association, his bark is worse than his bite on many occasions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para83"><a name="stpa_214">I will ask the Minister some specific questions, so that I can spare everyone else the ghastly puns. Schedule 1 of the Private Security Industry Act requires the authority to consist of members appointed by the Secretary of State. Will the Minister say who those members are and publish a list? Will he say whether they include among their number anybody who is, or has been, working in the private security industry? Similarly, the same schedule allows the authority to establish committees and sub-committees. It was understood that the authority intended to set up steering committees for each licensing category, using professionals in that sector to advise on best practice for licensing. Will he say who is on the committees and sub-committees and publish their names? Along similar lines, it has been suggested that the SIA policy on employment is not to employ anyone from the private security industry. Will he say whether that is correct?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para84"><a name="stpa_215">To go a little further than the hon. Member for Selby, it seems that a significant number of British standards&#151;for example, BS7499 for guarding and BS7858 for screening&#151;already cover the private security industry. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 280WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Those are used to identify competence, good practice and other aspects of the SIA&#039;s requirement for licensing and the approved contractor scheme. As that is the case, would it not have saved the SIA considerable time to have adopted the experienced British Standards Institution committees to support its role rather than trying to reinvent the wheel?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para85"><a name="stpa_216">Will the Minister confirm that the SIA will not assign or contract out any of its rights or duties to an organisation that operates or invokes its own proprietary scheme? Further to that, as a probing question, where is the evidence that it is necessary to legitimise the areas that the SIA now plans to go in to and regulate? Does the Minister agree that although the SIA was established to regulate those parts of the security industry that needed regulation&#151;wheel clampers, door supervisors, security guards and so on&#151;by regulating private investigators and security consultants it will go into areas where there is a lack of any evidence to suggest that they need regulating? If the Minister agrees, will he expand on that point?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para86"><a name="stpa_217">Does not the way in which the SIA now operates suggest that it has forgotten the approach to regulation supported by the Better Regulation Task Force? Is it not now creating unnecessary hurdles and obstacles, particularly for small security companies? Perhaps that is against the whole idea we are trying to achieve with the regulation that we agree is necessary. However, it must not hamper small firms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para87"><a name="stpa_218">The SIA has been promoting its approved contractor scheme for more than a year. The scheme is still under consultation. Many small and medium-sized security companies have decided that they wish to be assessed against existing British standards and the quality standard ISO 9001. That is option 3 under the approved contractor scheme consultation, as we have heard from several hon. Members this afternoon, and accords with the UK Accreditation Service benchmarks established by the National Security Inspectorate. However, the SIA has made its preference known for option 4. I will not go any further, but I am sure that the Minister will have a view on this important subject. I wonder also about the SIA having unilaterally abolished the only external strategic oversight body, the stakeholders&#039; advisory group, two years ago and that it has not been replaced. What plans do the Government have to oversee the SIA in the future?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para88"><a name="stpa_219">A small but important point is whether SIA statistics are up to date. Is it giving out statistics that might make it seem more favourable than the facts in case? Lastly, were the senior executive members of the new sector skills council appointed through the normal process for the appointment of people to public bodies? If they were not, does the Minister not think that, given the importance of such posts, they should be?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para89"><a name="stpa_220">I am grateful for the opportunity to summarise and take the points that we have heard today. It has been extremely useful, particularly the differing views expressed by the right hon. Member for Walsall, South and the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central.

Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) that it has proved to be more lively than any of us anticipated, and rightly so. It is an important issue and there is a lot of experience in the Chamber today. We have been provided with an opportunity to review the performance of the Security Industry Authority and to update the House on the consultation that is ongoing, until tomorrow, on the proposals for an approved contractor scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para91"><a name="stpa_222">The context for our discussions is the Private Security Industry Act 2001. My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George) has long experience of such matters, as do my hon. Friends the Members for Barnsley, Central, for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) and for Selby. I am a relative newcomer to such issues, as is the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams), and we are learning all the time. It is good that Members have been able to contribute their experience to this important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para92"><a name="stpa_223">As private security has increasingly come into contact with the public and as the volume of the private security industry has increased, we have had to ensure that criminal elements are not part of it and that decent standards are maintained. I freely admit to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central that that has entailed some additional costs for the industry, but they are costs that will give added value to those companies and make them more competitive and, we hope, provide a better service. I say to him in all seriousness that if he has evidence of or anecdotes about the flouting of any of the regulations, he should bring them forward and we would have them examined urgently and in great detail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para93"><a name="stpa_224">It is important that the laws, rules and regulations are properly enforced. I regard that as an important responsibility for me, coming into this role, as is improving standards in a way that is not over-burdensome to the industry, but that engenders greater public confidence. Both those things are important. Given that the SIA has been open for business only since March 2004, a great deal has been achieved in a sector that was almost wholly unregulated in many respects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para94"><a name="stpa_225">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central expressed concern about the rate of applications and licensing decisions. He asked for progress. Just last week the SIA announced that it had issued its 50,000th licence. Given that it started its business in March 2004, that is quite an achievement. I have been watching the performance of the SIA carefully over recent months and I am pleased to say that it has improved. More than 85 per cent. of licence applications are now processed within the target of six weeks, and there is currently no backlog. It is dealing with about 7,000 cases, few of which exceed the six-week period. I acknowledge that there have been difficulties, but I am pleased to say that progress has been made and that performance is improving.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para95"><a name="stpa_226">Thanks to various improvements that have been made to the application process by the SIA, the number of incomplete applications received is beginning to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 282WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
decline. That was a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South. The SIA has improved the advice, the booklets and the information available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para96"><a name="stpa_227">Incredibly perhaps, to many hon. Members, the failure rate of applications initially was some 50 per cent.&#151;one in every two applications was incomplete. That number has now been reduced to some 36 per cent., which, again, hon. Members might regard as high, but I put it to them that the Passport Agency, which is working far better these days, has a failure rate of applications of 33 per cent. Clearly, there is much that all public agencies can do to ensure that more information is available and that people process applications as accurately as possible. There have been improvements and that should be recognised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para97"><a name="stpa_228">The number of door supervisors licensed over the past year and a half is 34,000 of a total of 40,000. Obviously, some are therefore not licensed. They will increasingly come under the scrutiny of local authorities and the police, who will seek to find out who those people are and where they are. There are prosecutions and there will be prosecutions. It is quite timely perhaps that under the Licensing Act 2003, which comes into operation next week, it can be made a condition of the licence that door supervisors operate on the premises concerned, and they will need to be properly accredited by the SIA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para98"><a name="stpa_229">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central is quite right to say that the security guarding sector, which employs more than 120,000 people, is by far the largest of all the six sectors that are required to be licensed under the 2003 Act. Given such large numbers, it is vital that the licensing of security guards is carried out in a phased manner, to ensure that no complications with the processing of applications are caused by any late surge just before the legal requirement date of 20   March 2006. The SIA was obviously in discussion with the industry and reached agreement with it that applications would be spread as evenly as possible over a 14-month period, targeting about 8,000 applications a month. That number could easily be managed within the SIA&#039;s own procedures and within the resources of the Criminal Records Bureau. The Home Office and the SIA are dependent on the industry&#039;s co-operation for a successful and effective roll out of licensing for the security guarding sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para99"><a name="stpa_230">The good news is that a growing number of companies are meeting and, indeed, exceeding the targets for licence applications that they agreed with the SIA. I am very encouraged by that, and it means that future pressures on the licensing system are being reduced. I appreciate the efforts of those companies meeting their targets, and I am impressed by their dedication and commitment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para100"><a name="stpa_231">Unfortunately, however, other companies are not yet meeting their targets for submitting licence applications, and that has the potential to lead to a shortfall in the applications received. It means that the processing capabilities of the SIA and the Criminal Records Bureau may be being under-utilised. We run a great risk of processing insufficient numbers of licence applications and, therefore, restricting the number of operatives who will be licensed from 20 March next year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para101"><a name="stpa_232">I am about to send a letter to all private companies in the sector urging them, particularly those that have not yet done so, to encourage their staff to submit their

<br>&nbsp;<br>
applications as soon as possible or to utilise the SIA&#039;s bulk applications process. The SIA is working with the Home Office to develop plans to deal with a late surge in the number of applications, if one occurs. However, it will be difficult for the SIA&#039;s systems to handle a last-minute flood of applications in the last couple of months before the March 2006 deadline. It is therefore vital that as many applications as possible are received by the SIA before the end of this month.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para102"><a name="stpa_233">My officials and I have been working closely with the SIA to ensure that the process is as smooth as possible, and that the message goes out loud and clear that people need to get their applications in now&#151;or certainly in the next few weeks&#151;and not leave it until February and March of next year. I make it absolutely clear that there is no intention to change the date from 20 March next year. From that date, it will be a criminal offence for any security guard, supplied on a contract for services, to work without a licence. It will also be a criminal offence for directors and managers of guarding companies to supply unlicensed operatives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para103"><a name="stpa_234">The SIA licensing scheme is a valuable system of regulation that protects the public, and it is improving standards throughout the industry. It is important that the industry continues to work closely with the SIA to implement an effective regulatory system that meets those aims.

<p>
<a name="51116h03_para104"><a name="stpa_235">All hon. Members who have contributed to the debate spoke about the approved contractor scheme consultation taking place. The partial regulatory impact assessment is out for consultation. Hon. Members know that it was published on 25 August, and the consultation period ends tomorrow. There have been 1,000 requests for copies of the consultation document, and already 100 submissions have been made. We expect that others will arrive before the deadline tomorrow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h03_para105"><a name="stpa_236">The powers to create an approved contractor scheme were contained in the original legislation&#151;in sections 15 to 18 of the Act. There are four options in relation to the consultation, and I shall come on to them. I want to emphasise an important point: the approved contractor scheme is not a carte blanche for companies to take on indefinitely people who are not suitably qualified and accredited. The scheme allows an approved company to employ staff while their application for a licence is being processed. However, those staff must have completed the training and submitted an application. If the application were subsequently turned down by the SIA, they would no longer be able to operate in the industry. In other words, in an industry in which there is rapid change and where credible companies are undertaking suitable training, those companies are able to employ those staff for the first few weeks, but if the staff do not come up to scratch they will lose their job.

Hon. Members have several times asked whether a decision has been made. I assure them that no decision has yet been made about which of the options will be followed. How do I know?

However, those are the same assessing bodies that would be likely to be involved in implementing option 3. It is necessary for the SIA to be prepared to implement any of the options that I may decide on. Preparations by the SIA are not a problem. Of course, we would want any option to be implemented as quickly as possible but no decision has been made, and the decision is a ministerial one, not one for the SIA.

<p>
<a name="51116h03_para108"><a name="stpa_239">The SIA has a duty, under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, to establish and maintain an approved contractor scheme. The scheme would also help the SIA to carry out its functions under the Act, including maintaining and improving standards in the provision of security services. An important objective of the approved contractor schemes is to enable security firms to operate more efficiently, by providing a mechanism for them to deploy staff who have already done the appropriate training and applied for a licence, but not yet received it. Without that mechanism, firms cannot deploy staff until they have physically received their licence, which will typically take six weeks from the receipt of the completed application.

<p>
<a name="51116h03_para110"><a name="stpa_241">In drawing up the consultation, we have been keen to involve the Better Regulation Executive and the Better Regulation Task Force. We want always to create a balance between self-regulation and regulation that is promoted and asserted by Government. It is important to do so, and to take advice and guidance from the various bodies. The consultation draws to an end tomorrow, as hon. Members have pointed out, and before I make a final decision I shall give urgent consideration to the representations that have been made.

Members who contributed to the debate. He mentioned the extended police family, and we are keen to support that. The private industry&#151;like all citizens&#151;plays a part in that; we all have a responsibility to make sure that our communities are safe.

<p>
<a name="51116h03_para112"><a name="stpa_243">I have mentioned the balance that is needed between self-regulation and self-responsibility, and regulation imposed from above and properly monitored.

<a name="time_20">
<a name="51116h04_time0"><h5>4.25 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51116h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Eric Joyce  (Falkirk)</b>  (Lab): Discussions about Government spending priorities are usually, rightly, rich in ideology. Resource allocations have to be properly matched to intended outcomes, and determining what those outcomes should be is the stuff of politics. However, I approached the subject of the cost to schools of advertising job vacancies not through the prism of ideology or party politics but from the perspective of good old-fashioned cost-effectiveness. Schools pay many times more than is necessary in order to advertise the jobs that they have available. I am convinced that the adoption of a number of simple measures, none of which would require legislation, would enable schools to save millions of pounds every year&#151;tens of thousands of pounds each. My aim today is to show that savings could be made and services to schools improved by greater use of the internet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para0"><a name="stpa_245">A few months ago, I attended the <i>New Statesman</i> new media awards. The debate was full of exciting, young and some not so young internet entrepreneurs who had found truly creative ways of delivering services&#151;some traditional, some new&#151;through the new media. It was a great event to attend, because the excitement generated by finding new solutions to old problems was palpable. The event was a real credit to the <i>New Statesman</i>. One of the main prizes was won not by the private sector but by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and that was marvellous.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para1"><a name="stpa_246">As I watched the prizes being presented, I was reminded of an Adjournment debate that I had secured in Westminster Hall four years ago, not long after arriving in the House. Then, I could not understand why <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> managed to continue to base its price to schools on a newspaper format when it was clear that there was ample scope for the job advertisements that sustained it to move to a cheaper and much more versatile internet platform. Then I was told by the Minister that the Government would be reluctant to interfere unnecessarily in the market but that perhaps in due course&#151;this is a quick summary&#151;the market would come to a better solution in its own way. I wonder whether that is still the Government&#039;s position. I am not sure, but in due course I shall find out. Things are changing so fast, both on the internet and in the market in general, that what was not practicable four years ago may well be feasible now. So I decided to have a second run at the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para2"><a name="stpa_247">The commercial viability of newspapers across the UK is based on advertising and sometimes, in particular, the &quot;jobs vacant&quot; column. Many of the jobs on offer are funded by the public purse, in central or local government or some agency or other. It follows that it is public money that keeps the wolf from the door of many excellent publishing ventures. There is nothing wrong with that in principle, as hiring decisions are among the most important that any manager will take, whether he is in the public, voluntary or private sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para3"><a name="stpa_248">In recent years there has nevertheless been a steady move away from conventional job advertisements in newspapers, as managers and budget holders take advantage of new websites that cater for their needs and that are much cheaper than their newsprint alternative. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 287WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
That is not a reflection of the quality of the newspapers and journals that are losing out, and it is certainly true that there is still value in advertising in newspapers in particular situations. For example, those who are likely to take up lower end jobs in a local authority may be less   mobile and more local, and perhaps less likely to do   their administration on the internet. In such circumstances, it remains prudent to advertise in a local newspaper. However, as a generality, the more internet-literate the population becomes, the more people shop and buy cinema tickets on the internet and the more jobs can be advertised effectively too. The winners from the trend are the advertisers and the jobseekers; the losers are the newspapers and journals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para4"><a name="stpa_249">Even as I wrote this speech, I and other Members received an e-mail from Thomson directories about e-marketing, which seemed relevant. The growth of job advertisements on the internet is reflected in the advertising that we now see on television for recruiters such as monster.co.uk, and there are rumours that some of the larger corporations, such as Microsoft or Yahoo, might develop software that searches the internet for job vacancies advertised on specific sites. Those things may well be in the pipeline, but for the moment the question for any job advertiser is whether the internet options on offer are fit for his purposes. For example, regardless of the technological offers on parade, if the target population does not on the whole use the internet, managers will be wasting their time and money. To some extent, therefore, although developing technologies will drive change, as ever, human behaviour will still play the most fundamental part in their design and their constraint.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para5"><a name="stpa_250">Some public sector organisations are further down the internet road than others. The NHS has set up its own website, www.jobsnhs.co.uk, aimed at saving NHS   employers the cost of advertising in local and   national press. The website does not seem as effective or successful as it might be, as it advertises relatively few jobs. Interestingly, other websites have rather more. However, some websites, including www.nhsjobs.co.uk&#151;I suspect that it got the name before the NHS official website did, and that is why the latter uses the reverse&#151;is quite successful; it has a thousand or so jobs on it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para6"><a name="stpa_251">Nurses in particular and other specialisms are moving away from conventional publications such as <i>Nursing Times </i>and across to the internet. They are confident that the jobs that they are looking for will be advertised there, so the advertiser has confidence that the readers will be there, too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para7"><a name="stpa_252">The websites have led to a significant reduction in the advertising income for traditional sources. Recently, for example, the owners of <i>Nursing Times</i>, Emap, announced that it anticipated a 40 per cent. reduction in advertising income for that one publication alone. It is a relatively small part of the Emap empire, but, as I understand it, it is a very high-margin publication. Nurses are computer-literate and need a quick and easy means of looking and applying for jobs. NHS employers have confidence that advertisements will be read by the target population. These jobs have migrated in the true sense, meaning that no cost is being expended elsewhere in another newspaper publication. That is a crucial detail that I will come back to.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 288WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para8"><a name="stpa_253">The NHS is, of course, the largest employer in the world, and because it is so diverse, there are specialisms. Specialisms can migrate bit by bit in bite-sized chunks or packets, as it were. That makes migration to the internet rather easier in that field than in education, which is my    primary concern. Education is much more homogenous, so packeting&#151;chunks moving across to the internet bit by bit&#151;will not really work. The nation&#039;s teachers want to use the same source, and so do the nation&#039;s schools and local authorities. That makes migrating those adverts to the internet very challenging, because it would have to be done in very short order. We would need to move everyone across; it would be like switching the side of the road that one drives on, or going over to broadband.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para9"><a name="stpa_254">I should like to describe how schools recruit, and in particular mention the role of <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i>. Most or all of us here will know this, but I want to put it on record in <i>Hansard</i>: for more than half a century the <i>TES</i> has dominated the market in advertising teaching vacancies. It has done that by taking advantage of being part of <i>The Times </i>empire, and by having access to the whole distribution network. Historically, it was the only paper to advertise to teachers nationally, once teachers travelled more outside their local area. It was the place to look for jobs nationally. Increasingly, people looked away from local papers and to the national <i>TES</i> for jobs, as they were prepared to move anywhere in the country for a promotion or a different type of job.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para10"><a name="stpa_255">Today, pretty much all teachers looking for a job look in the <i>TES</i>, and all schools and local authorities looking to fill jobs advertise there. Staffrooms subscribe to a special dog-eared version, which is passed around as a kind of recreational activity. The journalism in it is perfectly fine; indeed, it can be extremely good. However, a teacher in a staffroom looking at the <i>TES&#151;</i>I do not think that I am being cynical&#151;is more likely to be looking at the job vacancies, and fantasising about what might be, than reading through the learned pieces written by journalists. That is my instinct, and my claim is probably provable through empirical observation, but I could be getting out of line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para11"><a name="stpa_256">The market has proved virtually impossible to penetrate. <i>The Guardian</i> education supplement has tried raids on the higher education segment, which the sister paper of the <i>TES</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Times Higher Educational Supplement</i>, covers, but essentially if someone is looking for a job or looking to advertise one they still have to pay the <i>TES</i>. Of course, there are many niche recruiting websites, such as eteach.com and Teachers Plus to name but two, but their primary function is dealing with supply teachers, although they would rather do a lot more. The full-time vacancies on those websites tend to be advertised also in the <i>TES</i>, so those jobs cannot truly be said to have migrated, because there is still a cost being paid to the <i>TES</i>.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para12"><a name="stpa_257">There are almost 30,000 schools in the UK, and well over 20,000 of those are in England. To make a stab at a typical example of the advertising cost per school, during 2004 a large secondary school of which I am aware filled 18 vacancies through the <i>TES</i> at a combined cost of &#163;30,000. The cost for primary schools is rather less. Inner-city schools and those with diverse populations&#151;those with more issues, shall we say&#151;will often be more expensive, because they have a higher staff 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 289WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
turnover. In addition, the advertising cost does not simply last for one week. Schools generally advertise for two weeks and often have to re-advertise. Advertising for promoted positions costs more, and so forth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para13"><a name="stpa_258">An easy way to measure the success of the <i>TES</i> is to pick it up at the end of a period when teachers are getting close to the contractual cut-off point and see the thousands of jobs that are advertised. Although I cannot give the particular month, I vividly recall a banner headline in the <i>TES</i> saying that there were 9,000 jobs advertised in that publication. Each page is worth around &#163;5,000 in advertising income and there are hundreds of pages on such a day, which means that there is in excess of &#163;1 million-worth of advertising&#151;possibly getting towards &#163;2 million&#151;in a single publication. Of course, we are talking about the huge, thick issues and it is not like that all year round. I understand that the income from schools could be above &#163;50 million, but I should be happy to hear the actual figure from the <i>TES</i>.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para14"><a name="stpa_259">The expense for schools is considerable, but manageable, and historically it has been a necessity. However, there is now a workable alternative to the status quo. The historical fit-for-purpose reputation of the <i>TES</i> has made its position pretty bomb proof, largely because of the homogenous nature of the teaching profession. It is not sustainable for schools to advertise anywhere else, which means that if a migration to another publication or format were to happen, it would have to happen in very short order so that the same synthesis of the needs of advertiser and jobseeker would continue. No other publication can enter this ground at the moment, because the <i>TES</i> is universally trusted as the place where jobs will be advertised. That is true; it is a fact. It is open to question how any other newspaper-based publication could improve on that, because the cost would have to be about the same. It is more troubling, however, that whereas other sectors are migrating to the internet to make huge savings and provide a better service, there is a logjam in education&#151;for the same reason: any switch to one of a number of excellent internet providers would have to take place in very short order. The problem of a big, homogenous profession persists, and it is fundamental.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para15"><a name="stpa_260">As each school in England advertises separately, co-ordinating a fast move to the internet would be hard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51116h04_spnew1"><b> Mary Creagh  (Wakefield)</b>  (Lab): Is my hon. Friend aware of work by several councils and local education authorities, such as Wakefield council, which has an overview and scrutiny committee that is considering how the LEA can support schools procurement? Does he agree that LEAs have a role, and that as well as the big bang theory that he is advocating&#151;a single switchover&#151;useful work could be done by local education authorities or regional procurement consortiums to start moving the process forward? We need to travel in both directions if we are to get to the goal that he is suggesting.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51116h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Joyce </b> : That is a useful point. It sounds like Wakefield council has got its act together. I am a big fan of the big bang, but there will probably be another solution in due course, with a combination of different initiatives.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 290WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para16"><a name="stpa_261">There is one piece of evidence of the fact that teachers would rather use the internet than a big, thick newspaper: most of them go to the <i>TES</i> website. However, the trouble is that although they use that site, the schools still have to pay the price for advertising in the newspaper, so there is no saving.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para17"><a name="stpa_262">The TES may argue that it is a high-quality newspaper that happens to do advertising. That is fine if people are paying &#163;1.30 for it, but the extension of that argument is to see the &#163;20,000 or &#163;30,000 spent by schools as a kind of subscription, which I guess most heads would rather not pay&#151;so that argument does not stand up. I accept that with the demise of the <i>TES</i> we would lose a valued publication for teachers, but the market would fill that gap with another publication on the internet, or <i>The Guardian</i> or <i>The Times</i> would expand their education coverage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para18"><a name="stpa_263">I believe that we can clear the logjam, and I shall briefly explain how I think we can do it. The first step is to acknowledge that an internet-only solution would save tens of millions of pounds and provide a higher quality service. I have not heard any colleagues in this place dissenting from that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para19"><a name="stpa_264">The second step is to agree that that solution is possible. I suggest that the evidence is clear. The overwhelming majority of people accessing eteach.com and tes.co.uk are looking for jobs. The eteach website allows everything to be completed online, but the <i>TES</i> website does not. The <i>TES</i> website merely pastes advertisements on the internet for people to read and print out, but the eteach website has gone several steps further and allows everything to be done online. Applicants can save money on postage and some people estimate that schools could save &#163;5 million on postage if everyone applied online through sites such as eteach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para20"><a name="stpa_265">The <i>TES</i> has been slow to adapt because it has not had to. Money has been pouring in and it has been a bit lazy. News International recently sold the <i>TES&#151;</i>its first divestment in the UK&#151;and there is a sniff of a change in the way in which the markets are working. It was sold for &#163;230 million, which is a little less than some people expected, to Exponent, which is funded by venture capital. I wish it well, but at the moment the fundamental position seems to be that the money that the <i>TES</i> generates for TSL Education&#039;s new parent company comes from a market dysfunction. No one else can break in because we cannot move all schools across at the same time. There are only two solutions: a harder solution and a softer one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para21"><a name="stpa_266">The harder solution would be for the Government to top-slice a certain amount of money from the schools budget, create a website and give more back to schools by way of savings. That would be difficult to sustain in terms of taking powers back from schools. My instinct&#151;my political antennae are out&#151;is that that would not be feasible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para22"><a name="stpa_267">The softer solution, which my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) suggested, is for the Government to help to facilitate a number of mechanisms to put us in a position where we can switch people over through good practice in councils, getting head teachers prepared, as we are preparing people for broadband, and, as eteach has done, encouraging the Secondary Heads Association to do the same in respect of head teachers. Over a period of perhaps a year or two

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51116h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Maria Eagle) </b> : What a pleasure it is to be here, albeit slightly late with the next debate straining to get in. It is good to be here in front of you, Mrs. Dean, for the first time and I am sure that you will keep us in good order, not that my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce) has to be kept in order. His enthusiasm for the subject was clear from the way in which he set out his full and detailed knowledge of it. I congratulate him on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para23"><a name="stpa_268">My hon. Friend has identified an important area in which he has seen great potential savings for schools, but which it might be difficult for individual schools to deal with. He raised the matter, as one might expect, positively and demonstrated extensive knowledge of the subject. He had a similar debate four years ago and, with great persistence, has come back to see what progress has been made. I did not have the advantage of hearing his exposition first time around, but I have been able to read in <i>Hansard</i> what was said. I hope that, in the time that I have to reply to the debate, I shall be able to reassure him about some matters, although I am sure that he will leave feeling a little impatient about progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para24"><a name="stpa_269">It is important to remember why there is still a lot of spend on teacher vacancies and why schools must use a substantial portion of their budgets to advertise. Obviously, there is still churn in the profession. There are no longer extensive teacher shortages because there are almost 35,000 more teachers in England since 1997 and the vacancy rate is lower. However, in any profession of 432,000 people&#151;that is the number of teachers in England&#151;there is bound to be a great deal of movement and churn. For that reason, advertising vacancies will always be with us and my hon. Friend is right to try to find a way in which that could provide better value for money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para25"><a name="stpa_270">Every year, there is an influx of newly qualified teachers seeking their first jobs, and employers advertising vacated posts to attract them into schools. The latest figures suggest that 18 per cent. of teaching posts change hands every year&#151;about 70,000 posts&#151;which means that a substantial chunk of information spreading needs to be done as efficiently as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para26"><a name="stpa_271">My hon. Friend is right to say that switching the entire advertising effort from using the printed word, which is the old-fashioned way, to the internet is the way of the future. He also said that that should, perhaps, be done in a big bang or all in one go, and compared it to switching the side of the road on which we drive. That is an interesting analogy because we have often contemplated doing that, but have never done so. One barrier to making the kind of effort that he urges is that big bangs can have unforeseen downsides.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para27"><a name="stpa_272">I shall tell my hon. Friend a little about what has been going on in the four years since he last raised the subject. The key is to change teachers&#039; attitudes about where they should look for job vacancies and employers&#039; attitudes about where they should place advertisements to get the best possible response and good candidates

into posts. My hon. Friend fully explained the tradition surrounding the <i>TES</i>. I do not think that there is a staff room in the country in which one will not find a dog-eared copy that is fairly up to date, but well thumbed. That illustrates his point about the profession being wedded to the <i>TES</i> as the way in which to find and fill vacancies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para28"><a name="stpa_273">Some 70 per cent. of teachers access the internet at least weekly, so there is not a total barrier to using new technology. We need to persuade more teachers to associate the internet with browsing for jobs. My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that my Department has made a start since the last debate. Last December, we added a new online recruitment portal to our popular TeacherNet website to encourage more jobseekers and recruiters to use the internet for recruitment. TeacherNet receives almost 3 million hits a month and is widely used by teachers and employers, so it is a good window in which to advertise and encourage cultural change, which is, I suppose, what we are talking about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para29"><a name="stpa_274">The portal does not currently hold vacancies independent of other websites, but has links to many online recruitment sites that offer that service. As it is on TeacherNet and the links are all in one place, it is, in a sense, a place to which people can go to find other online places where vacancies in the profession can be seen and accessed. It brings things together for the first time in one place to which teachers often go. That is valuable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para30"><a name="stpa_275">As well as linking information and websites, the portal adds value and introduces teachers, particularly those who have not tried it before, to the convenience of online job searching by offering advice on researching jobs on the internet. People may have used the internet but not for researching jobs, and therefore may not have seen what extra it can bring when compared with thumbing through an old copy of the <i>TES</i>. It also has a standardised CV and application form, which we are encouraging schools to accept in place of their individual forms, which will, to the extent that it is done, make it easier to apply for different jobs. There is also a career development section for teachers, which includes the online CV, that can help them to work out what they are looking for in their next job and get their thoughts together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h04_para31"><a name="stpa_276">Those measures are helping to win teachers, particularly younger, newly qualified and web-aware teachers, over to job searching on the internet. They will be able to experience the advantages of sites that offer other relevant information at the click of a mouse, such as the Ofsted report on the school that they are considering, a prospectus, or information about where the school is in the performance tables, as well as simply advertising vacant posts in their areas of search. That brings a lot of information together in much less time than one could ever obtain using print-based mechanisms. All those things are available at the click of a mouse on TeacherNet to get teachers used to the idea of job searching online. It is also important that employers increasingly realise the advantages of internet advertising, whether they be Scottish local authorities or, as is more often in England, schools themselves.
</p>

That is not many in the context of 3 million hits on TeacherNet, but it is a useful start. The portal has been operating for a comparatively short time, but one can already see a discernible change in awareness of online recruitment. My hon. Friend will probably say, &quot;Not before time&quot;, given the speed with which other professions have embraced online recruitment.

<p>
<a name="51116h04_para34"><a name="stpa_279">My hon. Friend mentioned other parts of the public sector, particularly the national health service. He did half my job by pointing out some differences between health service recruitment and schools recruitment. I am grateful to him for that. He is right to say that there is not a central, dominant long-standing player such as the <i>TES </i>for vacancies in the health service. There are, however, sectorally based print publications, which he also mentioned. Far less disaggregation of different employers perhaps makes it easier to introduce centrally orchestrated change in the health service than in the teaching profession.

<p>
<a name="51116h04_para35"><a name="stpa_280">My hon. Friend made several suggestions, which I want to deal with briefly before we hand the Chamber over to a debate on Oxfordshire. He said that one way in which we could promote faster change would be to top-slice schools&#039; budgets. It is always tempting to do that, and the Department for Education and Skills has been doing so for years. We are trying, however, to be more consistent by stopping ourselves from top-slicing schools&#039; budgets. We wish to ensure that our new funding arrangements provide clear three-year budgets for local schools and far greater autonomy for schools

&nbsp;<br>

to spend their money.Crude top-slicing can cut across that trend, but, unfairly, it also creates winners and losers; for example, schools with rapid staff turnovers would gain at the expense of those with greater staff stability. Some schools would argue that that would be unfair.

<a name="51116h05_time0"><h5>4.55 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51116h05_spnew0"><b> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon)</b>  (LD): I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate. I welcome the Minister and other hon. Members whose timetables may have been slightly affected by the inevitable delay to the start of the debate owing to Divisions in the House. I am happy to see that the hon. Members for Banbury (Tony Baldry) and for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) are in their places. I know that they hope to catch your eye, Mrs. Dean, as does the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). I intend to sit down at seven minutes past 5 o&#039;clock, after 12 minutes, in order to give those hon. Members a chance to have three or four minutes among them and still leave the Minister a chance to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para0"><a name="stpa_283">I have given the Minister notice of the broad subjects on which I wish to speak. I have no prepared script, because the problems are obvious and not much preparation is required to address them. Oxfordshire&#039;s health economy is faced with huge cuts because of the savings that it has been asked to make this year. Those savings are to be made this year, not over a number of years through a financial recovery plan, which many of the units of that health economy&#151;especially the hospitals and trusts&#151;are undertaking. Those cuts represent about &#163;30 million. Given the scale of the savings that must be found and the fact that the decision comes after years of cuts because of the need of many trusts to achieve financial balance through financial recovery plans, it will be impossible to meet that target without cuts to front-line patient services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para1"><a name="stpa_284">As other hon. Members representing Oxfordshire constituencies will know, this matter must be seen in the context of the history of repeated annual cuts in social services provision. The pressure on the Oxfordshire social services budget is a result of an unfair formula, the imposition of extra duties on local authorities that have not been properly funded by central Government, and a capping regime that prevents local people from voting to preserve services to the vulnerable, even at the cost of increasing an unfair tax that I would like abolished in favour of a fairer one. The matter must also be seen in the context of cuts in funding for the Supporting People programme owing to an irrational change in the funding formula. That will result in extra pressure on the health service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para2"><a name="stpa_285">The strategic health authority was told in July that it had to break even within a year without brokerage from the wider NHS. It is not possible, fair or reasonable to impose that time scale. There will need to be hundreds of whole-time equivalent job losses even to begin to meet that. The Government must step in and say that that is not what is supposed to happen in the NHS. If there must be a cuts programme, it ought to be phased, so that huge cuts are not made that result in redundancies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para3"><a name="stpa_286">The strategic health authority decided to impose the cuts on a formula that is based mainly on staff numbers. That is unfair on those specialties and services that are human-resource rich compared with the broader operating figure or turnover of a trust. That applies especially, but not exclusively, to mental health and learning disability services. There are questions as to what consultation took place with providers when the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 296WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
formula for allocating the cuts was set out and, indeed, on what wider consultation occurred before that decision was taken. It is one thing to have to make cuts, but another to create an arbitrary basis on which hospitals should make them when, by common consent, many of the hospitals instructed to cut budgets are not responsible&#151;having met their financial recovery plans&#151;for the position in which the Oxfordshire health economy finds itself. The Oxfordshire health economy is faced with an impossible situation: the Government have asked it to do things for which there has not been sufficient funding while still meeting its targets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para4"><a name="stpa_287">The Government will say one thing that I would like to address pre-emptively: more money has gone into the health service nationally. That is a fair point to make to those who voted against the tax increases that brought that extra money for the NHS, but the Minister will know that I voted consistently for the tax increases, and I am still concerned. I did not criticise the tax increases to pay for the NHS. Indeed, my party said that we should implement them before the election in 2001 and not just after it. Obviously, people who do not support tax rises to pay for the NHS have to find other ways to provide the money, but the imposition of political targets that Oxfordshire health trusts have been told to meet or they will be named and shamed or zero-starred and the managers sacked means that they have chased the targets at all costs. That may not have been the right thing to do. I think that they should treat patients at all costs, not chase targets. It is not fair that patients should suffer because of the cost of meeting the targets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para5"><a name="stpa_288">The sort of cuts that we are discussing&#151;we do not have time in half an hour to go into them in detail and we know about only a few of them at the moment&#151;apply already to the pain clinic beds. I gave the Minister notice of this list. I am referring to the in-patient beds to treat people suffering from chronic pain. That measure will, as I understand it, save only tens of thousands of pounds&#151;it will not make a big dent&#151;and the service is a specialist one for a very special group of patients who do get relief from it. A community-based service, without in-patient beds, cannot provide that service. When I was a doctor in the Oxford area, I recognised the value that other clinicians placed on it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para6"><a name="stpa_289">We have heard about the proposed closure of the Barnes unit. That is the acute psychiatric service at the John Radcliffe hospital, on which when I was a doctor in Oxford we relied in accident and emergency to deal with people whose physical problems were based on or largely due to acute mental impairment. The fact that a unit was embedded in the hospital took a big load off the emergency department. Losing that service without there being a direct replacement will put more pressure on beds elsewhere in the hospital, and patients will be treated in inappropriate beds, which is extremely unfortunate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para7"><a name="stpa_290">That situation is associated with seven consultant job losses. At a time when the NHS needs to be growing and there is a shortage of psychiatric posts, to say that there will be a loss of seven posts, even though the post holders have been saved through a merger, is a worrying sign of things to come. As I understand it, the scale of the cuts that have to be made across Oxfordshire means hundreds of redundancies. We would not often expect to find ourselves talking about a bigger NHS, as the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 297WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government tend to, and then about making doctors, who cost a fortune to train, redundant. That is not a good way to seek to recruit people into Oxfordshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para8"><a name="stpa_291">There are other cuts in mental health and learning disability services. Horton general hospital, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Banbury, is also affected by these provisions. The only response that there seems to have been to the general concern about the extent of the cuts is a bizarre proposal to privatise the management of the primary care trust. Will the Minister tell me about the Department of Health&#039;s role in the genesis of the idea that the solution to Oxfordshire&#039;s problems was to sack some managers in the new PCT and to outsource the management by tender, probably to a private company, which would then have the commissioning role? As we have discussed in this Chamber before, there are real problems to do with the vested interests that private companies would have in commissioning services from themselves or their commercial rivals. The proposal seems to miss the point in a big way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para9"><a name="stpa_292">There was no consultation. The notice about the idea said that there had been consultation of key stakeholders. I do not want to give myself or other Oxfordshire Members airs, but clearly the health service in Oxfordshire does not think that Members of Parliament or the PCTs are key stakeholders. I presume that we are talking about the Department of Health. I would be interested to know, if the Department of Health was not behind the proposal&#151;Lord Warner said in the Select Committee on Health recently that the proposal would not be imposed, because it would be a matter for the PCT&#151;whether the Minister is happy that we have a health service that proposes something and then gets it withdrawn. At best, the situation is a mess; at worst, it is a U-turn forced by the opposition to the measure. If we could have some explanation of what on earth was going on in relation to the proposal, and reassurance that it is firmly off the table, I would be grateful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para10"><a name="stpa_293">I have a thick file of letters from concerned constituents, and I am sure that that applies to other hon. Members from Oxfordshire. Our constituents are very worried about the impact that the proposal will have on patient care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para11"><a name="stpa_294">I share with the Government the aspiration of a bigger, wider NHS that is properly funded. I do not see why Oxfordshire should be left out of that wish and why Oxfordshire patients, across the board, should be facing such cuts. If there have to be reductions there needs to be time to plan them, but I cannot believe that it is beyond the Government to find a way of ensuring that patients and, indeed, hard-working staff, are not punished for the fact that what the NHS is being asked to do by the imposition of Government targets and, I accept, by patient need is greater than the amount of resources available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para12"><a name="stpa_295">There are particular issues in Oxfordshire such as the need to employ agency staff; it is difficult to recruit and retain staff because of high living costs. There are special factors but they are not adequately recognised in the funding formula, although generally I support a funding formula based on need. Oxfordshire has particular problems and I urge the Government to do something 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 298WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about that, because it is a centrally funded service&#151;centrally funded by the Government. There is no option for local people to be able to contribute and they should not therefore be facing such cuts. I urge the Minister in her response to give some comfort to Oxfordshire patients, and to the doctors and nurses.
</p>


<a name="time_23">
<a name="51116h05_time1"><h5>5.6 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51116h05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Smith  (Oxford, East)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) for making available this opportunity, albeit brief, for other hon. Members from Oxfordshire to intervene in the debate. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and the Government will take note of the strength of feeling on the issue in Oxfordshire, which is reflected by the fact that hon. Members from all parties are raising concerns on behalf of their constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para13"><a name="stpa_296">I want to make four points: first, patient care must be paramount. Secondly, the scale of the deficit in Oxfordshire this year cannot be eliminated in one year without unacceptable damage to patient care. It is a tragedy that we are faced with these cuts when &#163;15 million a year extra is being put into the Oxfordshire health economy. That puzzles local people. It is their unanimous view that things cannot be straightened out in one year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para14"><a name="stpa_297">Thirdly, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon did not mention that the region had to find &#163;15 million extra this year for Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes has a very good case, but it has limited the ability of the strategic health authority to help with the situation that Oxfordshire faces. If the Government wanted to make some extra help available without setting a precedent nationally, which for various reasons might be difficult for them to accept, I suggest that that is a particular and very important factor that should be considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para15"><a name="stpa_298">Fourthly, I want to highlight the putting out of primary care commissioning to private tender. An indication of delay in that respect is not good enough; it would be much better for it to be refused now, because when several trusts are grappling with financial imbalances and other difficulties, the last thing they want is that threat and uncertainty hanging over what should be the core responsibility of primary care trusts. It is a bad idea, which it would be better to bury now.
</p>

Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) for allowing me to intervene in the debate. I agree with almost everything that he and the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para16"><a name="stpa_299">I shall say a quick word about deficits. Originally it was said that there would be a deficit in the Thames Valley strategic health authority of &#163;35 million and in Oxfordshire of &#163;25 million, mostly in the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS trust. I understand that at a recent meeting of the strategic health authority it was said that that figure may have come down to &#163;15 million, but the figures &#163;23 million and &#163;18 million have also been bandied around. My first request, therefore, is please can Richmond House&#151;the Department of Health&#151;and the strategic health authority agree on the size of the deficit? That surely must be possible.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 299WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para17"><a name="stpa_300">Secondly, the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS trust did not start this year with a deficit. It had a three-year recovery programme, so all the deficit is in this year because of what the Oxford Radcliffe hospitals&#151;the John Radcliffe and the Horton&#151;have been doing to meet the Government&#039;s waiting list targets. It has not been financial recklessness. My next request is please can we have a clear indication from Ministers whether the hospitals can have more than one year to pay off the deficit, as the right hon. Member for Oxford, East said, or will it all have to be done by the end of this financial year?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para18"><a name="stpa_301">When I wrote to the Secretary of State about this matter, I was told that it is the responsibility of the strategic health authority. I have written to the chief executive of the SHA, but I have yet to receive a response. However, I understand that Sir Nigel Crisp has signalled that in-year deficits must be met by the end of this year. The Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS trust would have to find about &#163;18 million or &#163;15 million in this financial year. That cannot be done without crazy slash-and-burn policies. That would have a dramatic impact on both the John Radcliffe hospital and the Horton general hospital in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para19"><a name="stpa_302">I have two simple requests for the Minister. Can we agree on the deficit and can a clear signal be given to the Thames Valley strategic health authority that it is not feasible for the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS trust to save &#163;15 million or &#163;18 million in a single year, especially as that would come after a three-year recovery programme? There has to be a sensible proposal for how that money can be recovered over a number of years. Unless that is made clear now, we will have a disaster in the last quarter of this year. In order to make such savings, the chief executive and the board of the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS trust will have to make cuts, not because those cuts are rational but just because they are the quickest way of saving money. That will damage patient care.
</p>


<a name="time_25">
<a name="51116h05_time3"><h5>5.11 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51116h05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Edward Vaizey  (Wantage)</b>  (Con): When I asked the Prime Minister about this issue this afternoon, I quoted from an excellent and closely argued editorial in <i>The Oxford Times</i>, which concluded that Ministers must intervene, and set out three reasons why they should do so. The right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) has four reasons why Ministers should intervene, and I have five reasons. The Prime Minister gave me the brush-off&#151;to use a colloquialism&#151;but I hope that the Minister will not do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para20"><a name="stpa_303">There are five reasons why there must be intervention. First, historically, Oxfordshire has been underfunded; we receive 85 per cent. of the national average. Secondly, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, &#163;15 million has gone to Milton Keynes. That is a demonstrable case of underfunding; the money has gone there because the population of Milton Keynes has increased rapidly over the past four years, but the funding is still based on the 2001 census. Thirdly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) pointed out, the John Radcliffe hospital has done such a good job in meeting its targets and cutting waiting lists that that has put a strain on finances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para21"><a name="stpa_304">My fourth reason is a more general point. Health inflation is running at about 6 per cent. The Prime Minister said that funding had increased by 6.5 per cent. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 300WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Therefore, in effect, that increase is almost negligible. Finally, we have had a bureaucratic organisation imposed on us&#151;the five primary care trusts that were imposed from the centre. That is now being scrapped, as my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury and other Members mentioned, and one PCT will be formed instead. That has imposed costs on us that are not our responsibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para22"><a name="stpa_305">In conclusion, I simply say that I hope that the Minister will intervene.

<p>
<a name="51116h05_para23"><a name="stpa_306">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made the point that extra money has gone into the NHS. He also pointed out&#151;I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) would agree&#151;that the Conservative party voted against the increases that have enabled us to put it there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para24"><a name="stpa_307">As my right hon. Friend said, our aim is to improve patient care, and we have to make sure that patient care is paramount. However, it is also important to realise that good patient care and good financial management go hand in hand. As my right hon. Friend said, an extra &#163;50 million has gone into the Oxfordshire health economy this year. The primary care trusts in the Thames valley have received an overall increase of &#163;167   million this financial year and will receive &#163;427 million next financial year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para25"><a name="stpa_308">We are devoting big increases in spending to the NHS. Despite that, the Oxfordshire health economy has built up a financial deficit. We need to make sure that that is sorted out; otherwise, one area in the strategic health authority will effectively carry on subsidising another, year on year&#151;that will mean taking money from one area and putting it into another. It is therefore important that we are rigorous and firm in saying that the financial deficits need to be sorted out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para26"><a name="stpa_309">Both my right hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) asked about Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes is in a situation similar to that of Oxfordshire, and the SHA is providing financial assistance there. However, the SHA has given &#163;10 million in financial assistance to Oxfordshire and an additional &#163;1.5 million to support the Oxfordshire mental health trust, and that has been achieved by using surpluses generated by other organisations within Thames valley. As I say, that situation cannot continue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para27"><a name="stpa_310">All hon. Members who spoke, particularly the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), asked about the balancing of the books for this year. The situation in Oxfordshire is fluid and can change month by month, so 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>16 Nov 2005 : Column 301WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
it is not possible at this stage to give a prediction of what any deficit may be. We never do that until we have audited accounts. However, SHAs are being expected to achieve overall balance this year. That means that they may adopt methods similar to those used previously: they may take surpluses from some areas and use them to subsidise areas with particular problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para28"><a name="stpa_311">However, I reiterate that in such situations we expect the health authorities to achieve that overall balance and ensure what is best in the longer term for local people, patients and staff working in the area. I pay tribute to the staff working in Oxfordshire, who, I am sure, are doing everything they can to deliver good quality services to patients. Nevertheless, it is important for all concerned that we achieve that financial balance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para29"><a name="stpa_312">As right hon. and hon. Members know, the revenue allocations are made direct to primary care trusts, based on the relative needs of their population. A formula is used to determine each PCT&#039;s target share of available resources. There are always arguments about the relative merits of the formula, but we work extremely hard to ensure that it is fair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para30"><a name="stpa_313">I want to deal with some of the concerns about the proposed closure of services. NHS organisations have a duty to involve and consult patients, the public and their representatives in planning and development of and changes to the operation of services, and the overview and scrutiny committees also play a part when such changes are considered. Therefore, I would expect there to be good consultation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51116h05_para31"><a name="stpa_314">I understand that the proposals for the closure of the acute psychiatric in-patient service at Moorview and the Barnes unit will be consulted on shortly and that the Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS trust is seeking to redeploy staff in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire mental health services. I hope that that gives right hon. and hon. Members some reassurance. In regard to the closure of services at Henley, I also understand that Henley was a partnership between the council and the Oxfordshire learning disability trust. The council stopped funding the Chiltern centre at Henley and, for a while, the future of the service was in doubt. However, the charitable Chiltern centre for disabled children now runs the centre.

<a name="51116h05_para32"><a name="stpa_315">I think that all hon. Members referred to the possible out-sourcing of the management of Oxfordshire primary care trust. I shall use this opportunity to reiterate what we have already made clear. We want SHAs and PCTs to put forward proposals through &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;, when it comes to the reconfiguration of PCTs. We want proper

consultation on the proposals, and a model for organisational boundaries then to be determined. However, it will then be down to each PCT to propose how it will discharge its statutory functions. Only after some of the organisational changes are made will the PCTs consider how to make the changes, if they wish to do so, in running services.

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51116h05_spnew5"><b> Dr. Harris </b> : I welcome that, which I recognise as the position put by Lord Warner in the Health Committee. I have two questions for the Minister. First, who is to blame for the fact that people were led to believe&#151;it is clear in the SHA paper&#151;that all this would happen very soon, long before the merger was complete and the PCT would decide itself? Secondly, did Ministers in the Department know at the time about the proposal, which has now been pulled, and did they say that it was unacceptable to make it so prematurely?
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51116h05_spnew6"><b> Ms Winterton </b> : The Secretary of State has made it clear that the letter sent out on 28 July was not meant to indicate that the services provided by PCTs should suddenly be removed, but that we wanted proposals for organisational changes. If PCTs then wished to divest themselves of the provision of services, as opposed to the commissioning of services, they would do so only if they had fully consulted local people and felt that that was the right way forward for their local area. PCTs do not, therefore, have to divest themselves of services. I hope that that has now been made clear to all SHAs and will be reflected in the proposals that they put forward.

<a name="51116h05_para33"><a name="stpa_316">I shall now turn to the closure of the in-patient pain service beds at the Churchill hospital, which are part of a strategic review to look at ways of linking chronic and acute pain services and to ensure that the trust can continue to deliver high quality and integrated care, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East referred. The trust is considering how to provide access to in-patient facilities in an alternative location within the hospital. It is following due process in line with the trust&#039;s policy on organisational change and redeployment.

<a name="51116h05_para34"><a name="stpa_317">I understand that the closure of an orthopaedic ward at the Nuffield orthopaedic centre is part of plans to modernise service delivery. The trust has reviewed its operation to ensure that service quality is maintained following the changes. Again, the overview and scrutiny committee has been consulted and has determined that the proposal does not constitute a substantial change to services.
