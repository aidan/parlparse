<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51122h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Malcolm Moss  (North-East Cambridgeshire)</b>  (Con): I am most grateful for the opportunity to debate the crucial problem in my constituency of land contamination. It has a direct and personal effect on the lives of some of my constituents and wider implications for the Environment Agency and the Government in respect of pollution issues and the Government&#039;s brownfield site development strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">The contaminated site is a mainly owner-occupied residential area in the village of Littleport, near Ely in east Cambridgeshire. Part of the site was previously a coal-gas works, while the remainder was adjoining school playing fields. Its industrial use ceased in the 1960s and housing, as well as a fire station, was built on the site between 1967 and 1992, with little or no clean-up works being undertaken at any stage. Thirty-one families now live in houses on the site, which they are unable to sell or remortgage, and their children are prohibited from playing in their gardens. Theirs is truly a truly nightmare scenario: they live in fear for their health, but are unable to move on in their lives. In fact, their properties are completely blighted by the discovery of contamination by chemicals that are frequently associated as a by-product of coal-gas production, but the legislation that by rights should be helping them is proving both obstructive and unworkable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">The residents are unable to pin down who is responsible for the contamination, as the two sites in question have changed hands many times, including between private and county council ownership. The Gas Board, later British Gas, never cleaned up its part of the site. The local district council&#039;s planning department gave both outline and detailed planning consent for housing on the site. The National Home Builders Registration Council denies any responsibility and the last developer/builder on the site has gone bankrupt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">Although the environmental health department of East Cambridgeshire district council considers that the contamination poses no increased health risk for the majority of residents, potential buyers of the properties are deterred by information revealed in local land charge searches. In fact, that all came to light about three years ago as a result of diligent searches by a prospective purchaser&#039;s solicitor. The local council, whose responsibility it is to investigate the contamination at the site, has been endeavouring since the problem was discovered to find a solution that would result in remediation of the site. It maintains that it has been hampered by inadequate guidance from both the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency, which has prevented it from resolving the situation.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">The main stumbling block is that the contaminating compound found on the site, benzo(a)pyrene, is so widespread at levels exceeding the standard acceptance criteria in the gardens of properties beyond the footprint of the original gasworks&#151;those built on the former school playing field. The council is unable to define accurately the area of land contaminated as a result of the industrial activity, because higher than acceptable readings of the compound were discovered on some properties outside the development site. It seems highly unlikely that the contamination readings outside the site are even associated with the gasworks. They are far more likely to be attributable to the anthropogenic practices of past residents, who spread the ashes from domestic coal fires on the garden areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">It is firmly believed that further sampling and analysis of soil from properties around the gasworks site would merely extend the area found to contain the contaminant, presumably until the edge of the village and greenfield land was reached. Working within the guidance available could therefore entail remedial work to hundreds of houses in Littleport where levels of the contaminant are present without any conceivable link to the activities of the former gasworks. If we extrapolate from that scale to the national level, we could catch hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of older properties that were in existence when coal was our primary domestic fuel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The widespread presence of the compound is causing huge problems across the whole contaminated land sector&#151;a sector that is fundamental to achieving the Government&#039;s national brownfield redevelopment targets. Benzo(a)pyrene is one of a large group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formed by the incomplete combustion of organic materials. Man-made sources include motor vehicle engines, coal and wood fires, refuse incineration, and even cigarette smoke. It is often present in ash. The overall conclusion of a health working group in 1987 was that benzo(a)pyrene was probably carcinogenic to humans. There were no adequate human data then and, to my knowledge, there are still none, but there was
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">It therefore comes as no surprise that acceptable threshold doses of the compound for both oral and inhalation routes have been set at very low levels indeed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">Benzo(a)pyrene is of paramount importance in the investigation of contamination at the gasworks and the associated site in Littleport. The governing legislation for land contamination of such a nature was first introduced under the Environmental Protection Act 1990&#151;or, more particularly, part IIA of that Act, which finally came into force, after extensive statutory guidance was issued, on 1 April 2000. Unfortunately, that was some eight years after the latest houses at Littleport were built. The guidance addressed such issues as what constitutes contaminated land, what course of action will be required, to what extent remediation will be required and who will have to bear the costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">An essential ingredient of that guidance was the role of the Environment Agency and ultimately DEFRA in defining soil guideline values. Those values are designed to answer the question: does the soil concentration of contaminant x pose a risk to human health or the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 351WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
environment? Unfortunately the Environment Agency has yet to issue its soil guideline values for benzo(a)pyrene, and the current rate of production of SGVs&#151;there have been none since December 2004&#151;suggests that it is unlikely to do so in the near future. Perhaps the Minister can say something about when that particular SGV might be published.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">In the absence of an SGV for benzo(a)pyrene, local authorities have had to fall back on the contaminated land exposure assessment&#151;CLEA&#151;model, which sets an acceptable level for benzo(a)pyrene of 1 mg per kg of soil. The readings at Littleport of between 6 and 15 mg per kg are unfortunately well in excess of that. However, in a document of April 1986 entitled &quot;Notes on the Redevelopment of Gas Works Sites&quot;, the interdepartmental committee on the redevelopment of contaminated land&#151;the precursor to the CLEA&#151;set trigger concentrations for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzo(a)pyrene, at a threshold of 50 mg per kg of soil in domestic gardens, and the trigger for remedial action at a remarkable 500 mg per kg. It is therefore not surprising that among both polluters and the polluted there is considerable confusion about the appropriate levels of risk for benzo(a)pyrene.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">In reality, SGVs allow levels of contaminants that under current interpretations represent an acceptable level of risk; they do not signify the level of unacceptable risk. Unlike the Netherlands, the UK does not have an intervention level at which the regulatory authority must intervene and remove the risk presented by the contaminated land. In the absence of other Government guidance, however, the release of SGVs by the Environment Agency has naturally led the regulatory authorities to use those figures as cut-off levels. Any levels that exceed the SGV are considered unacceptable, although that was not the intention. As I have already said, that has the potential to blight huge swathes of pre-second world war housing in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">DEFRA has warned councils that determinations based on a simple exceeding of SGV levels will not necessarily satisfy a legal challenge. The test is how far above the published level the concentration of soil contaminant would have to be to meet the definition of &quot;unacceptable&quot;. DEFRA guidance published by the Environment Agency is silent on that issue. That worst-case scenario may be appropriate for brownfield, undeveloped sites, but for existing sites&#151;not redevelopment sites&#151;it is not practical, because the levels are very low and are often exceeded by background, naturally occurring contamination across the United Kingdom. Those whom the figures should help&#151;regulators, developers, private companies and the general public&#151;do not find them particularly useful and their investigations may be significantly hindered by them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para12"><a name="stpa_12">The first requirement is that the contaminated land sector be given a full complement of SGVs for all contaminants of concern; currently only about half have been determined. Secondly, some indication is needed of what level above the SGVs would be considered acceptable. Perhaps two levels need to be set for each compound&#151;a target level and an intervention level&#151;like the Dutch do. If it is decided that that approach 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 352WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
cannot or will not be adopted, some more comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use the existing SGVs must be issued to provide a clear steer to investigating authorities. Until clear advice and support is available, local authorities have to proceed without all the necessary SGVs, which in their present form are of limited use anyway.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">The regulators are in a very difficult position as they struggle to approve site-specific reports prepared using figures borrowed from various sources, including the Dutch, the now defunct interdepartmental committee on the redevelopment of contaminated land&#151;ICRCL&#151;recommendations, various American studies, and the out-of-date CLEA model. The reports may then be disputed by the Environment Agency, which inevitably is reluctant to approve standards that vary from those that it has published as guidance. The system is incomplete and already out of date, which puts a huge strain on the resources of local authorities and the Environment Agency and means that basic investigations do not always reach a conclusion, because the system is not sufficiently structured. As a result, developers, councils and council tax payers end up paying more for investigations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">Recently the rate at which remediation notices are issued has dramatically decreased nationally, as many councils choose to wait for more substantive guidance before proceeding with determinations. However, in the case of the Littleport site, the financial implications for the residents living there are too severe to delay progress to the determination of this site. Under the regime of part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act, local authorities and the Environment Agency have increased responsibilities to investigate contaminated land, but the programme is often driven by their own resources. To increase the efficiency of that process and make the implementation of the regime less onerous, the determination of contaminated land issues needs to be evaluated according to a more structured set of values for any site. The rate at which councils are tackling sites is extremely slow, partly as a result of the strain on resources that the process puts on individual authorities. If the demands placed on local authorities are considered too great, the answer might be to place more emphasis on the Environment Agency to deal with more sites, particularly the more complicated ones. However, if that were done, the Environment Agency&#039;s resources in this sector would need to be significantly bolstered, as it is grossly understaffed in certain regions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para15"><a name="stpa_15">The current position on benzo(a)pyrene is untenable. Multiple local authorities, and the Environment Agency in the case of special sites, are pursuing site-specific solutions. To increase efficiency, it is essential that a solution be put in place to allow more joined-up working between the different tiers of authorities. Sites could be assessed much more quickly with less strain put on resources if a partnership approach was advocated by all levels of government. That would help ensure that the silo mentality was eliminated and that all parties were committed to reaching agreement on the best practical solution in each case. It is therefore vital that the Health Protection Agency and the Environment Agency support local efforts to reach practical solutions and adopt an approach that recognises the need for local public accountability in each case.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para16"><a name="stpa_16">The interests of members of the public affected by the contaminated land legacy should be paramount, yet on the one hand, given the presence of contaminants above the published thresholds, residents find their properties defined as contaminated and therefore blighted, and on the other, even if a subsequent, site-specific risk assessment finds that the contamination presents no additional risk to their health, the residents will still not be able to sell their homes. That has been the situation for nearly three years at the Littleport site, as the local authority struggles to make sense of the regime in the face of understandable public concern. If the process of investigation does not proceed to determination, the perception of health risk will continue to blight the properties; if determination proceeds, a legal challenge may arise. I trust that the Minister agrees that that is a totally unacceptable situation, not least from the point of view of my constituents, who are now desperate for a solution that will release them from that living hell.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para17"><a name="stpa_17">It is simply not good enough to tell the residents to take the matter to the courts, because universal standards for contamination have not been produced and the residents do not have the financial resources to fight a protracted case. Their plight is not of their making and it behoves legislators to rescue them from their nightmare. I look forward to a positive response from the Minister.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51122h01_spnew1"><b> Jim Dobbin  (Heywood and Middleton)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) on securing this important debate. I shall keep my contribution as brief as possible, as I am aware that the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) might want to catch your eye later, Mr. Cummings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para18"><a name="stpa_18">I asked a question at Prime Minister&#039;s questions last week on 16 November and last night I received a response, which I am grateful to the Prime Minister for and I shall make sure that it gets to the right quarter. My question concerned the contamination of a site proposed for building development in Rochdale. I live in Rochdale; the hon. Member for Rochdale is my Member of Parliament, so I take all my complaints to him. I live close to the site, which is called Spodden valley and was the site of the world&#039;s very first and largest asbestos textile factory&#151;first a Turner Brothers factory, then a Turner and Newall factory. It was the largest employer in the town in its time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para19"><a name="stpa_19">Many people in Rochdale, including local people who had never worked at the factory but were exposed to its environment, have died as a result of the asbestos produced; asbestos was produced on the site from the 1870s until the 1990s. As we know, asbestos is now outlawed throughout the European Union. The factory site produced high levels of asbestos dust, including asbestos fall-out that escaped from the factory buildings and settled on the factory and the surrounding land. The surrounding land included disused coal mines and was used for dumping large amounts&#151;potentially tens of thousands of tonnes&#151;of asbestos waste on the site.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para20"><a name="stpa_20">The entire Spodden valley, which is approximately 72 acres, was sold by the administrators of Turner and Newall in April 2004 to property developers MMC Estates Ltd. An offshore company, Rathbone Jersey Ltd.,

<br>&nbsp;<br>
which is a subsidiary of Countryside Properties plc, entered into an option agreement at the same time. In May 2004, contractors working for the developers began destruction of the woodland to the north and south of the site, but felling was halted by the intervention of the Forestry Commission and the local council because of their concerns. A reaction to the woodland destruction and concern about disturbance of soil that could be contaminated with asbestos was the formation of a local group, Save Spodden Valley. In December 2004, Countryside Properties (Northern) Ltd., Rathbone Jersey Ltd. and MMC Developments Ltd. submitted an outline planning application for demolition of all the buildings on the site and replacement with more than 600 homes and community facilities, including a children&#039;s nursery. That is when the problems started.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para21"><a name="stpa_21">The planning application was put on hold by the local authority pending an environmental impact assessment commissioned by the authority. I understand that the results of that assessment were due this month. Throughout 2005, there has been a continuous series of BBC reports and <i>Private Eye</i> articles. Although the developers denied that there was asbestos on or around the site, it has been reported that they knew about exposed asbestos since at least September 2004 and about a 2003 site-contamination drawing suggesting contamination throughout the site. Those are the concerns of the local community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para22"><a name="stpa_22">I am directly involved because it was recently decided to move some of the 3,000 tonnes of rubble, which is a huge amount. Discovering the extent of the contamination of that rubble by asbestos is difficult; it seems to be a secret. I am not sure whether the agencies are allowed to publicise the results of tests, but the local community is finding it difficult to obtain the information.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">The issue for me is the transfer of that rubble through the constituency of the hon. Member for Rochdale and the length of my constituency, and its eventual dumping in the Viridor landfill site in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). There is a hazardous waste cell on that landfill site that can take some of the rubble, but I do not know how much. The issue for me is: how safe is it to transfer that rubble by road through two constituencies and into a third? Assurances were given in the Prime Minister&#039;s letter that all checks have been carried out, but the local community is not convinced and tried to have an injunction put on the transfer of the rubble last week and the week before but failed to achieve that. A public meeting will be held in the town tonight because of people&#039;s concerns. They have experienced the problems caused by asbestos for a very long time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">I hope that the Minister will look at the matter in the light of what I have said. I am sure that if the hon. Member for Rochdale is allowed to speak he will support what I have said.

It is timely, not least because if the Government&#039;s targets for house building are to be achieved, it will be necessary to use more brownfield sites. It is important that the guidance given by

Government Departments is clear and deals with some of the complicated issues to which the hon. Member referred and which cause concern when sites are proposed for development. As the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin) said, I am particularly concerned about that because a site in my constituency had the world&#039;s largest asbestos factory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para25"><a name="stpa_25">Hon. Members may be aware that I had an Adjournment debate on the issue earlier this year. It is interesting that a Minister from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was put up to answer at that time, but today we have a Minister from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The ODPM, DEFRA and the Department for Work and Pensions, and four Government bodies&#151;the local authority, the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the Health Protection Agency&#151;are involved in dealing with sites of this nature. It is clear that there is a lack of co-ordination and guidance in dealing with sites as complex as the Spodden valley, and that considerably hinders development of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">We must be clear about the issues, to which the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred. Like the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton, I would like to discuss the effects on the Spodden valley. DEFRA has not yet issued clear guidance on safe levels of asbestos in the ground. As we speak, the rubble that he referred to is being moved from Rochdale through Heywood and Middleton to Bury. Unlike the first time rubble was moved, there has been a good deal of co-ordination between the Environment Agency and the HSE this time, but it has been voluntary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">I am pleased to say that this time there has also been co-operation from the developer. The method statement that he produced has not been released. When I spoke to him, he said that he was willing for it to be released, but neither the HSE nor the local authority are prepared to release it. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 applies to Government agencies, but it seems not to apply in this case. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is a great deal of concern about what is going on, given the past actions of the developer. If brownfield sites such as this one in Rochdale are to be developed safely, we need clear guidance from the relevant Departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">I understand that the Environment Agency has prepared guidance, but it is up to the ODPM and DEFRA to issue it. When one is dealing with a site as big as this one&#151;as the hon. Gentleman said, up to 650 houses, a nursery and industrial premises are planned for it&#151;the lack of guidance is extremely serious. Can we have some co-ordination between Departments?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">Guidance must be issued on safe levels of contamination and even on how levels of asbestos are to be tested on the site. Then there must be clear guidance on the stages of remediation. Such guidance is not given at present, and that causes great concern. No one has said that they do not wish the Spodden valley site to be developed. However, the development should be done carefully and with transparency, and that is not happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">As has been said, the local authority paid for the environmental impact statement in this case. The developer paid &#163;2,500 to submit his planning

application, yet the local authority will have spent &#163;70,000 to carry out the survey. Clearly, the old maxim that the polluter pays does not apply in this case. I hope that the Minister will respond to some of these concerns so that not just the Spodden valley site but other sites can be developed safely. We all wish to see that.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51122h01_spnew3"><b> Mark Hunter  (Cheadle)</b>  (LD): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) on securing this important debate. I know that the issue has affected a number of his constituents and he appears to have uncovered a flaw in the system for dealing with contaminated land. It is only right that we should seek to pursue a &quot;polluter pays&quot; policy on contaminated land, but in this case the principle appears not to have been enforced in the way that was intended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">I want to broaden the discussion slightly and praise the Government for their endeavours in bringing brownfield sites back into use. That is a worthwhile policy and the Government are making some progress. It is clear that there are a large number of reasons why we should not let the kinds of difficulties that we have heard about undermine what my party believes is a crucial aim. Given the finite amount of land resources available to us in Britain, brownfield development is an obvious and correct policy. That is why I am interested to know how seriously the Government take proposals put forward by my party, and supported by a number of respected and independent bodies, to alter the VAT regime so that we can do away with the frankly ludicrous situation in which it is often more expensive to repair an old house than to build a new one. It is still cheaper to build new houses than to convert the estimated 1 million dwellings that could be brought into use which are located above shops, the conversion of which would go a long way towards filling the black hole in housing provision. I would be interested to know whether the Government intend to publish the report by Grant Thornton, which I understand effectively sounded the death knell for revitalising over-the-shop living. It would make interesting reading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">It is also my belief that the tax regime does not provide the incentives that we need to encourage development on brownfield sites in the first place. Despite some of the problems that can be encountered when dealing with brownfield sites, we simply cannot ignore the fact that that is the only game in town if we are serious about meeting the housing challenge at the same time as protecting our natural heritage. Are the Government still considering proposals for a planning gain supplement, as proposed by the Barker report, or a planning tariff to encourage brownfield over greenfield development?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para33"><a name="stpa_33">On development on contaminated land, all the evidence of which I am aware suggests that we are dealing with a hopeless lack of knowledge about the precise location of the land involved. That lack of knowledge has led to the type of unfortunate situation that we heard about this morning. In my constituency, a planning application on the site of a disused landfill site has caused much local controversy. It is my view, and it was the view of my predecessor in Cheadle, that the local authority lacks detailed knowledge of what went into the tip when it was in use. We should not allow a major development on the site without far more details on the level of contamination.

<a name="51122h01_para34"><a name="stpa_34">Following detailed work at the end of last year, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) found that local authorities across the country had uncovered only the tip of the iceberg when it came to identifying contaminated land in their localities. The problems can be traced back to the mid-1990s, when a certain Environment Minister, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), cancelled plans to develop a toxic land register. With greater vision from a previous Government, we might have avoided many of the problems that an increasingly large number of hon. Members will face over the coming years.

<a name="51122h01_para35"><a name="stpa_35">I would be interested to learn of the progress that has been made by local authorities on inspections under part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen). I understand that the first round should be completed by 2006. It would be interesting to hear the latest progress report and to know the scale of the problem. It seems that this is yet another case of extra burdens being placed on councils with a complete lack of resources to back up the requirements. We cannot forget the danger that some of the chemicals we are talking pose to human health. After all, that is the most important aspect of the problem. In many cases, such chemicals can cause terrible damage.

<a name="51122h01_para36"><a name="stpa_36">In conclusion, a lack of knowledge has caused the problem to arise and it is imperative that we have clarity about its scale so that other residents do not suffer as some already have. More importantly, people need to know more about the location of contaminated sites to protect the health of current and future generations. That does not appear to be happening at present.

He spoke with great feeling about his constituents in Littleport near Ely and the difficulties that they face because their houses are built on the site of an old gasworks. It is extremely difficult for people who are unable to sell their homes and who live in fear for their health. They are unable to escape such health hazards, and, through scientific developments, by-products from coal and gas production will become easier to identify as time goes by.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para37"><a name="stpa_37">My hon. Friend asked who was responsible and made it clear that the responsibility was historic. It was difficult to pin down one group who should or could foot the bill for clean-up. It is a great shame that the guidance from DEFRA and the Environment Agency is so confused. Although we all have benzo(a)pyrene in fires in our homes, in the right concentration it can be extremely dangerous. He did an extremely good job in identifying the problems involved and I have a great deal of sympathy for those poor people in Littleport. I hope that the Minister will tell us who will help them.

<p>
<a name="51122h01_para38"><a name="stpa_38">The hon. Members for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin), for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) and for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) spoke with great feeling about their constituency cases, although I have to take issue with one minor point of the hon. Member for Cheadle. He said that the burden could fall very heavily on local

<br>&nbsp;<br>
councils. That is incompatible with his party&#039;s policy on local income tax, given that local councils with the worst contamination have constituents with some of the lowest incomes. I am sure that he will forgive me for saying that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para39"><a name="stpa_39">The debate provides us with a valuable opportunity to discuss the brownfield situation in England and the Government&#039;s disjointed strategy. The development of brownfield sites, contaminated or not, can play an important role in reducing the housing shortage and preserving our environment. Current Government estimates suggest that 3.8 million new homes will be needed in England by 2021, and if we are determined to preserve the green belt, we will have to develop brownfield sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">In 1998, the then Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions set a target for 60 per cent. of new dwellings to be built on previously developed land, often referred to as brownfield land, by 2008. The real test is whether we can achieve that target. I believe and hope that we are likely to reach it, but to do so it will be necessary to build on contaminated land. I am concerned about the effectiveness of current Government policy towards contaminated brownfield sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para41"><a name="stpa_41">The national land database, which is co-ordinated through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, estimates that 64,130 hectares of brownfield sites are unused or may be available for development, of which only 28,650 have been deemed suitable for housing. In some localities in England, brownfield sites constitute a significant proportion of land use. For example, in Wolverhampton, about a third of the area in the Short Heath and Wednesfield South wards has been classified as brownfield. Overall, brownfield density in parts of Wolverhampton is nearly 15 per cent., in parts of Sunderland it is 11 per cent. and in parts of Bradford it is 9 per cent. Nevertheless, given the industrial past of many of those sites, the Government do not keep accurate central records on the number of sites that are contaminated. Records are only collated at local government level. Moreover, details of developments and remediation for contaminated sites are dealt with through a variety of Government organisations, including the Rural Development Service and the Environment Agency, as well as local government. To clarify the situation, we must have records from central and local levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para42"><a name="stpa_42">We must also know which Department is overseeing the remediation of contaminated brownfield sites. Is it DEFRA, with a responsibility for the environment, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, with its responsibility for planning matters, or even the Treasury? The Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions were also mentioned. One of those Departments at least must take the lead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para43"><a name="stpa_43">It is hardly surprising that with all those different organisations, authorities and Whitehall Departments managing brownfield sites and their remediation, local authorities have failed to make full use of funds available for investigation and contamination clean-up. Although the Environment Agency estimates that there are between 5,000 and 20,000 contaminated brownfield sites in the UK, not all are brownfield. We must know from the Government exactly how many are.

<p>
<a name="51122h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">In a report published in 2000 which surveyed eight locations throughout England, the national brownfield sites project found:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;The highest remediation cost is attributable to those sites that are categorized as contaminated and/or derelict.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para45"><a name="stpa_45">Additionally, the Environment Agency has stated that the cost of developing brownfield land is more expensive than greenfield. It stated also:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;The regulatory complexities of reclaiming some brownfield land may . . . be a barrier to new development.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para46"><a name="stpa_46">Contamination is a major problem environmentally and economically. It must be redressed so that development can take place. We must know the costs, and only the Government in Whitehall can provide us with that information. I hope that the Minister will ensure that those figures are produced. Once the costs are known, effective action can be taken. We should like to know when it will take place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para47"><a name="stpa_47">The Government could make progress on cleaning up and developing contaminated brownfield sites by adopting policies, such as tax incentives, that are designed to encourage private investment, especially in areas where the economic costs of clean-up deter investment. Some 55 per cent. of brownfield land is privately owned and 28 per cent. is publicly owned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para48"><a name="stpa_48">If land is to be developed and, if contaminated, cleaned up, the Government must use a range of economic instruments to promote such activity, particularly in the private sector. If they were to promote clean-up and development of privately owned brownfield sites, the stability that it would offer would provide private developers with the confidence to invest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">When there are plans afoot to develop brownfield sites, currently developers must make provisions for the investigation of contamination and the clean-up of those sites. The Government could help by making the planning process easier and by performing their own studies to ensure that contaminated land is cleaned up effectively. The Environment Agency advocates that, favouring economic incentives such as corporation tax relief and landfill tax exemption. Developers can qualify for tax incentives from the Treasury, such as a 50 per cent. relief for &quot;qualifying land remediation expenditure.&quot; None the less, the Government could do more, including offering VAT relief for new developments. Such incentives would be particularly constructive in promoting developments in the north-east, where many developers are deterred because the high costs of clean-up and red tape do not always make projects economically viable. Those incentives could also be repeated to support the remediation of publicly owned brownfield sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">I understand that the business regulation team has formed a taskforce to consider the possibility of granting a single remediation permit for brownfield developers, and I hope that it will cut through the red tape and bureaucracy that restrains development. None the less, I am concerned about the implications of the decision in the European Court of Justice to classify contaminated soil as landfill. It opens up a new set of red tape and bureaucracy that may serve only to replace any savings made by the business regulation team. I hope that the Government ensure that the decision of the

We must ensure that the Government can facilitate the clean-up of such sites, so that they become available for development. We know how much land is brownfield, but we need to know from the Government the cost of clean-up. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the hon.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51122h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) on his grasp of a complex subject. I understand the pressures on his constituents, which he ably articulated, and the problems identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin) and the hon. Members for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) and for Leominster (Bill Wiggin). I will try to deal with the issues raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">I welcome the general support that has been expressed for the Government&#039;s policy of utilising brownfield sites. Like the hon. Member for Cheadle, I think that it is important because it takes pressure off greenfield sites and releases land that is essential to housing development to meet the needs of communities in England. We have made good progress, having exceeded our target of 60 per cent. of new build on brownfield sites&#151;the current figure is about 66 per cent. That will change as more and more houses come on stream, but it is welcome that those figures are being achieved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">Tackling problems associated with brownfield sites is therefore important. Some perfectly reasonable points have been raised in the debate. It is always worth examining mechanisms that can be used to encourage developments on brownfield sites and a range of measures are available. It would be reasonable to develop a single permit for remediation to ensure that there is not undue bureaucracy in dealing with brownfield sites, particularly their remediation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">I will try to deal with some of the detailed technical points that were raised. I disagree that there is confusion between Departments and a lack of clarity. Part of the problem is that local authorities, not unreasonably, want a simple system with a threshold figure over which there is contamination and under which there is not. That would be nice, but sadly the situation is a bit more complicated than that. The problem with having a single number above which action would be taken relates to the concentrations of any substance. We have been talking about benzo(a)pyrene&#151;or BAP, which is an easy abbreviation and which I shall use from now on. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made the fair point, which the Government accept, that the substance is widespread, so the fact that the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 361WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
substance is being detected does not necessarily mean that the land is contaminated to an unacceptable degree. I understand why he asks what the unacceptable figure is, but that is the point at which things become quite complicated. That does not mean, however, that we should not examine the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">The concentration of any substance that might give rise to unacceptable risk varies according to a range of factors and from site to site. Such factors include the exact form of the contaminant, the way in which the land is used&#151;or is proposed to be used&#151;the depth at which the substance is present, the nature of the soil, how the substance might get into the body and whether there is a pathway by which a source of harm might reach a vulnerable receptor and thereby cause harm. Each site must be examined individually and there must be a risk-based approach on each individual site. That is where the problem emerges. It is not appropriate to have one figure that can be applied to every contaminated or brownfield site in the country. There needs to be a more sophisticated approach than that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">Guideline values are needed, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said. They have to be devised for human health risk assessment. The present values are generic, whereas all the sites and their circumstances need to be considered. Soil guideline values are not binding; they are indicative&#151;a tool to be used in assessments. Some local authorities fail to understand that, and it might be useful to try to make the guidance a bit clearer for them. The mere presence of contaminants does not mean that a risk&#151;let alone an unacceptable risk&#151;is present.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51122h01_spnew5"><b> Bill Wiggin </b> : The Minister has just identified what he thinks the problem is, but I have been imagining what it must be like to live in Littleport. What the Minister says is not right. I agree that when it is determined that there are bad things in the soil in different places, there will be different levels of those bad things and they will have a different impact in each place. However, I disagree with him on this point. What is the point in having guidelines on what that may or may not be harmful to people&#039;s health that might not be understood properly or might be used in such a way that they have a negative impact on people&#039;s sense of well-being or the value of their property&#151;which in this country is probably the most significant investment that anyone can make?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51122h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : It is certainly true that there can be an impact on the value of property, which is why I have a great deal of sympathy for the constituents of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. However, I understand that the former National Rivers Authority advised his local authority that the site was contaminated. Why the proper examination and site impacts were not done at that time is an issue, but that is in the past, so it does not help the people who are living there now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51122h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : To clear up that point, the then NRA advised looking at water movement, but there was no problem with water on the site, so that does not feed through to the present problem, which lies in the upper metre of soil.

</p>




<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51122h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but it would not be appropriate for me to go into the background of the case. How we do these kinds of assessment is the issue that I am trying to address. I am also trying to answer the questions that have been asked and comment on the Rochdale case to which my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton spoke.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para57"><a name="stpa_57">As I was saying, the mere presence of contaminants does not mean that risk&#151;let alone unacceptable risk&#151;is present. That can only be determined through detailed investigations on site and the risk assessments that are made. That can be a complicated and painstaking process, but getting it right can save unnecessary remediation and disruption. That is relevant to a point made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. That work has to be done for individual sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">That point also applies to the site in Rochdale. There has to be an environmental impact assessment, which I understand the local authority is doing; that is a sensible and responsible move. There are strict regulations about on-site remediation. Regardless of whether BAP or asbestos is involved, hazardous material has to be disposed of in a licensed site in a separate cell. In terms of lorry and other vehicle movements, there will be a role for both the Environment Agency in relation to waste licensing, and perhaps for the Health and Safety Executive in making sure that the vehicles are properly sheeted and there is proper dust control. A range of regulations exist to protect our constituents. Sadly, clearance of major sites involves a lot of lorry movements&#151;not much can be done about that. The question is whether we want derelict sites to be left derelict as an eyesore for many years, or whether we want them to be developed and accept short-term disruption, which is inevitable in any site remediation or management. I believe that all of us as Members of Parliament experience that from time to time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51122h01_spnew9"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : No one disagrees that a site must be cleared up, but sometimes developers are prepared to exploit loopholes and the lack of manpower in the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. We have talked about moving rubble. Why is the rubble being moved when the environmental impact assessment has not been completed or the planning application approved? At present there is little that the local authority can do, short of taking out an injunction to stop it happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">I agree that remediation will vary from site to site, but there must be a clear set of guidelines setting out the process to be followed if brownfield sites are to be developed, otherwise developers will exploit the loopholes and the gaps between Government agencies and Departments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51122h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I would not condone any attempt to exploit loopholes in the law and regulations or to find shortcuts. However, I emphasise that there are clear regulations relating to site management and clearance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">Our policy is to encourage remediation of brownfield sites on site and the reuse of rubble, which can be used as hardcore for roads or as building material; 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 363WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
increasingly, it is graded. It is for the developer to choose how remediation is carried out, but with landfill tax and the new regulations on hazardous waste, transporting rubble to a licensed hazardous waste site is an expensive option for the developer. I should have thought it would be worth the developer&#039;s while to consider the option of on-site remediation and the reuse of building waste. The circumstances vary from site to site, but DEFRA goes to great lengths to encourage on-site remediation. We are seeing major changes in the way in which sites are now remediated on site, as opposed to the dig and dump of the past, and I welcome that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">It is important to get the assessments right and to ensure that necessary action is taken. We are arguing about thresholds and about what is acceptable and what is not as it relates to the impact on house prices and the costs of remediation, but we must ensure as part of the evaluation that no shortcuts are taken that cause risks to human health. I know that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will agree.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51122h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : I accept that the individual characteristics of a site such as the geology and the soil should be taken on board. If there is a CLEA model that says that the acceptable level of benzo(a)pyrene, which the Minister acknowledges is widespread, is only 1 mg per kg of soil and the compound is known to be carcinogenic, surely someone living in a house and garden where the reading is 15 mg per kg will panic. The matter is now in the public domain, so nobody will buy such houses unless somebody somewhere says&#151;this is where the Government must take responsibility&#151;that the risks to health arise at a level well above 15 mg per kg. The government must say that the figure is a tolerance level&#151;that people can live there quite easily&#151;and that with remediation, the problem goes away. That is the comfort zone that my constituents need, and I hope that the Minister can give me some idea of how he and his Department intend to satisfy that need.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51122h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I will do my best. I understand what the hon. Gentleman says. As he fairly pointed out, there are some sites where the values are way above the scale and where there is no argument about the level of contamination. To be more precise, the argument comes when one is within a band. As I mentioned, the situation will differ from site to site because of the factors that I outlined.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">Let me explain to the House the procedure for risk assessment. Both part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act and planning policy take a risk-based approach to deciding when action needs to be taken in relation to contaminated land. On some sites, the risk to human health arising from exposure to contaminants is clearly an issue, particularly when the level of those contaminants is way above the scale. That is the most important factor in judging potential consequences for human health, so we have to assess the risk. To help with that, DEFRA and the Environment Agency have jointly published a series of technical guidance documents specifically about contaminated land assessment. That guidance relates to the CLEA framework and reports linked to it.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 364WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para63"><a name="stpa_63">Sometimes the criticism is made that the risks have been overstated and that is when we get problems. Clearly, there has to be an element of precaution in our approach. The guidance documents take into account the views and knowledge of many expert Government bodies&#151;notably the various UK committees on toxicology&#151;as well as various EU committees, the World Health Organisation and work done in other countries. That is where the Health Protection Agency comes in. There is no confusion in terms of the number of agencies involved&#151;there is a number of agencies, but they have specific responsibilities. The Health Protection Agency is an expert body on health risk, and we need its input. The Environment Agency is the expert body in relation to site management and regulation; that is what it is for. The Health and Safety Executive advises on risks to workers on site and people in the adjacent neighbourhood.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para64"><a name="stpa_64">The technical materials have to be understood and used properly, because we are talking about a complex scientific area involving human toxicology, the science of soil, how substances behave in soil, how substances can reach humans to do them harm, and, of course, what the site is being used for. It is a fact that, for a carcinogen such as BAP, there is no risk-free level. As we acknowledged, that substance and many others are widely present, sometimes in areas where there is no particular industrial history, as the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire pointed out. We cannot deal with every site that contains these substances; we have to use judgment, practicality and a degree of realism in dealing with the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para65"><a name="stpa_65">Soil guideline values are a key element. They go to the crux of what the hon. Gentleman said about how we can give better guidance to local authorities. I come back to the point that published SGVs are generic values. They can help to simplify risk assessment, but they cannot reflect all the factors on a site. In broad terms, exceedance of a properly applied value will indicate to an expert risk assessor that further investigation and remediation may be needed, but it does not mean that it is automatically needed, as is often assumed. That is the part that guidance plays in the risk assessment. I repeat: exceedance does not mean that land must automatically be remediated. SGVs are not legally binding numbers. They are not intended to be limits that must be met. Local authorities often think that they are absolute figures and limits&#151;that is a fairly common misconception&#151;but I emphasise that they are not. They are a tool to help to deal with the issues on site.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51122h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : I am listening carefully to the Minister. Local authorities that are tasked under current legislation to look at site contamination accept that SGVs&#151;if they are published; only half are&#151;are to be used as guidelines and are not necessarily threshold levels. However, for gardens in which BAP is present, as it is in Littleport, there is a CLEA level of 1 mg per kg of soil and an earlier ICRCL recommendation of 50 mg per kg as an upper limit before any action needs to be taken. That is a huge difference and that is why confusion is arising.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para66"><a name="stpa_66">Someone associated with the Government&#151;whether at the Health Protection Agency or the Environment Agency&#151;should say that in that particular soil type, at a depth of up to 1 m, a particular concentration of BAP

<br>&nbsp;<br>
is not hazardous to health. I am sorry that this intervention is long, but this is important, Mr. Cummings. The Minister said that there is no acceptable level of BAP because it is carcinogenic. If it is present, it is a problem. However, the risk assessment for health needs to be made&#151;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para67"><a name="stpa_67">The legal test in contaminated land legislation comes under part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act. It is based on the notion of an unacceptable intake of a substance. If the calculations are properly applied, as I said, exceeding the SGV will not automatically equal unacceptable intake, because there is a judgment to be made about what is unacceptable. That judgment would be easy in the case of a huge exceedance, but in many cases it is difficult to make. A judgment has to be made on the level of risk and therefore of contamination, and the SGVs are a tool to use when doing that. The question raised, not unreasonably, by the hon. Gentleman is how to make the issue clearer to local authorities. I accept that we need to give more help to assessors, who generally work for the local authority, to decide whether a concentration in soil will give rise to an unacceptable intake under the legislation. The debate is about definitions and risks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51122h01_spnew17"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : Can the Minister indicate when the SGV for asbestos will be published? That is certainly an issue for the Spodden valley site.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51122h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I think that I can answer the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question. The issue is being worked on as part of the new draft of SGVs also deals with BAP. The publication of the draft, which looks at all SGVs, has been held up because of the widespread nature of BAP, which we have to take into account. However, it is intended to publish the revision when the issues have been properly addressed in further guidance that the SGV taskforce is expected to recommend on that point. The Environment Agency recognises that an SGV for asbestos is a high priority and that we need to produce it as quickly as possible. The unreleased document that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in relation to the Environment Agency is not an SGV, but, pending the revised SGVs it has been made available to local authorities that have had asbestos cases to deal with. The document is an attempt by the Environment Agency to help local authorities deal with their present pressures. However, a new SGV is being developed for asbestos and BAP. Although I do not have an exact date for its publication, I understand that the intention is to get that done as quickly as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para68"><a name="stpa_68">That work is part of our efforts to ensure that we have clear SGVs and give local authorities the best information possible. The SGV taskforce was originally set up to advise on how guidance could be framed to

assist assessors to make their judgment on a scientific and authoritative basis. Ideas are being developed by taskforce members&#151;the HPA in particular has a big input&#151;and they will be considered by the taskforce collectively in the near future. We hope that the taskforce will make some specific recommendations for the Government to consider.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para69"><a name="stpa_69">I will ensure that, if appropriate, we put work in hand to develop and produce further guidance without delay. Following this debate, I will ask for an update on progress on the various work streams and on time scales to ensure that there are no undue delays. These are important issues and those who have spoken in this debate have made a persuasive case about why we need that revised information as quickly as possible.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51122h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : Because benzo(a)pyrene is so widespread and because the existing threshold figures are so low&#151;I repeat the 1 mg per kg figure&#151;if we did trial testing in half the gardens in this country, we would probably get readings above that level. If benzo(a)pyrene is a carcinogen people in those properties will be worried, and if word gets out those properties will be blighted. Because benzo(a)pyrene is so widespread can the Minister not make it a priority to consider this compound above all others, to ensure that we do not blight huge swathes of the country because we have got our figures on this compound far too low?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51122h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I accept the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. If benzo(a)pyrene is widespread, as seems to be the case, and if its presence in low levels in gardens at different depths is not likely to present any risk to people, we should take great care that we do not blight large areas of the country. That would not be in any of our interests and it is certainly not the Government&#039;s intention to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para70"><a name="stpa_70">The hon. Gentleman returns to the point about an appropriate level. All I can do is repeat the point that I made. There will be different risks in relation to different levels. That is why it will be difficult to have an absolute number and say that one point below that things are okay and one point above it they are not. I am speculating in advance of the report, but there may well be a band relating to where greater care has to be taken. The SGVs give some indication&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51122h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : We have not got one for benzo(a)pyrene.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51122h01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : There is guidance now and the SGVs are being updated to make them more sophisticated because it is recognised that that is a particular problem. The SGV taskforce has addressed risk levels, which the hon. Gentleman talked about. The taskforce considers that there are two clear and urgent needs in relation to SGVs. First, there is a need to restate the basis on which SGVs are derived and presented. That is because of the perception of a degree of confusion among users about the relationship of SGVs and the health criteria values, which relate to toxicology to the relevant legal test in the part IIA regime, which is the test of the unacceptable intake in table B of chapter A of the statutory guidance. That is one of the points that the hon. Gentleman has been making and the taskforce clearly recognises it as one of the priorities for it to address. Secondly, the taskforce is exploring the production of additional 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 367WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
technical material that will enable assessors to address more directly the legal test of deciding whether an intake is unacceptable. Those are complex issues legally, in relation to the definition of terms, and technically, in relation to toxicology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para71"><a name="stpa_71">Our discussion illustrates why this country has a legacy of brownfield sites that have been left undeveloped for many years. Until recently there was no guidance on brownfield sites. We are having a fairly complicated technical discussion about the present guidance, so hon. Members will understand the difficulties that arose in the past, when there was no guidance at all. A step forward has been taken but I accept that some issues need to be addressed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51122h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : We are nearing the end of the debate, which has been useful in many ways. If the Minister were the MP for my constituency and he had to face the residents of Littleport tomorrow, what comfort would he give them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"><a name="51122h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : I would tell the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents that the Government have given financial assistance to their local authority to do some of the technical work relating to the site. He mentioned the original developer and we would expect it to be liable because the polluter-pays principle applies. It is the developer&#039;s responsibility to ensure that the site is suitable for building; if there is a problem, it is the developer&#039;s responsibility to rectify it. In many cases, the developers are no longer around, which appears to be the case in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para72"><a name="stpa_72">The hon. Gentleman will know that there are funds available through the ODPM for dealing with remediation of contaminated land. It depends on the circumstances, but his local authority can make a bid for the remediation work once it knows the extent of the problem and the steps that need to be taken. To offer encouragement to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents, I would say that support is available once the nature of the problem has been identified. It is necessary to identify and understand the nature of the problem and that work is currently under way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para73"><a name="stpa_73">The work has to be done properly because we do not want a long-term legacy for people who live in houses on brownfield land. If there is to be remediation&#151;it sounds as if there may well have to be&#151;it should be carried out properly so that there is a permanent solution. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s case is not unique; there are similar sites throughout the country and we are keen to ensure that they are dealt with and that we identify and remove unacceptable risks to human health and the environment. We seek to bring damaged land back into beneficial use and to ensure that cost burdens faced by individuals, companies and society as a whole are      proportionate, manageable and economically sustainable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para74"><a name="stpa_74">I doubt that many constituencies do not have sites with similar problems. On the edge of my constituency in the former borough of Glanford, there was an enormous contaminated site on the site of an old fertiliser factory. The site was not only contaminated with a range of chemicals but had the added piquancy of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 368WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
anthrax. The former council thought that it had struck a very good deal with ICI, the former owner, by buying the site for &#163;1. It was very pleased with the deal because it wanted to develop the land for housing. In return for that &#163;1, however, the local authority took on all the liabilities for the site. As I pointed out, it was perhaps not such a bargain after all. Indeed, that turned out to be the case, because a lot of the site was so heavily contaminated that it could never be used for housing. However, it has been turned into a fantastic nature reserve, so I am pleased with that. I thought that it was quite a good outcome, although there was one problem. Glanford was merged into North Lincolnshire unitary authority, which then took over the liabilities. The site was leaching pollutants into the River Humber, and as North Lincolnshire council now had responsibility, it faced prosecution from the Environment Agency because of the contamination coming off the site. There are all sorts of problems with these sites, as I know, and I have a great deal of sympathy with the points that hon. Members have made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"><a name="51122h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Moss </b> : I wish to put a couple of points on the record. I think that the Minister said that my local authority, East Cambridgeshire district council, could apply for money from ODPM or DEFRA funds for the full remediation of the site. Secondly, after remediation, there must be some kind of scientific comfort zone, whether in the form of threshold levels or SGVs, which we still have not had for BAP. Otherwise, the blight will continue, because it will be common knowledge that the site had a problem. We must be able to say that it now has a clean sheet and is no longer a health risk.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51122h01_spnew26"><b> Mr. Morley </b> : On the first point, I confirm that funds are available from ODPM&#151;not from DEFRA. There is a fund that local authorities can apply to. How much they get and for what depends on the individual circumstances and the basis of the application, and is a matter for the local authority and ODPM.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para75"><a name="stpa_75">I can give the hon. Gentleman some longer-term comfort. DEFRA and the Environment Agency have published the contaminated land exposure assessment, the CLEA, which I think he mentioned. That is a methodology&#151;a series of reports&#151;of which the SGVs are just one part. It provides a scientifically-based framework for the assessment of land contamination and the risk to human health. That technical guidance also applies when we are considering regulatory action of proposals for development of the land.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para76"><a name="stpa_76">Under the CLEA methodology a wide range of guidance is available, not just from the Government but from external experts. The SGV taskforce is also considering the most recent guidance, contaminated land advice note 2/05, which addresses the short-term points, and a development team is working on additional technical guidance. It remains to be seen what will emerge from that work. However, as the CLAN indicates, it is recognised that we need something to bridge the gap between a tox value and an SGV properly applied. It also suggests how that will inform the assessor and what the legal test demands where part IIA of the Act is applied to an area of land. That should deal with the point about the long-term assessment in relation to the risks.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 369WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para77"><a name="stpa_77">As I mentioned, a number of sites fall into the category mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, many of them in the north-east because of its industrial legacy. In the majority of those cases, I am not aware of any long-term problems following remediation. in the majority of those cases. There may well be cases of which I am unaware, but once action has been taken to deal with remediation, there should be no reason for long-term blight. It is uncertainty and doubt which tend to cause blight on people&#039;s houses. As we have seen in the debate, the kind of doubts that can blight property values include questions about what figures mean and whether they mean that is contaminated or not. It can be difficult, but when those questions have been resolved and the contamination level and therefore what needs to be done have been clearly assessed, and when remedial action has been taken, the sites do not just technically comply with requirements in relation to contaminated land, but they legally comply with them as well. Post-remediation, there really should be no problem with the long-term future of those properties. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and his constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para78"><a name="stpa_78">Apart from applications for grants relating to the land, funding is available to help local authorities with their investigation, as well as the remedial costs. DEFRA has some funds available under the contaminated land capital projects programme. I am reluctant to make them public, but the hon. Gentleman has dragged the existence of that money out of me. About &#163;17 million is available to local authorities for carrying out their duties to investigate contaminated land in their area and seeing to its remediation. The Government&#039;s revenue support grant helps to cover local authorities&#039; revenue expenditure. An element for that work was added to the RSG in 1997 to support the introduction and implementation of the regime. However, the local government finance system means that the RSG is not ring-fenced to particular functions; it is distributed on a generalised formula.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para79"><a name="stpa_79">The hon. Gentleman may like to know that East Cambridgeshire district council bid in 2004 for the Littleport site and received &#163;17,000 for the investigation. A further bid was made in 2005&#150;06 for just over &#163;17,000, which was also approved. Those sums of money are for investigations to help the council to decide whether the land presents an unacceptable risk, and therefore needs to be formally determined as contaminated land under part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h01_para80"><a name="stpa_80">DEFRA has issued a letter of intent for a successful bid. Once expenditure takes place on site, a sum is added to the Government&#039;s RSG settlement. Support is based on the notional cost of borrowing money and of paying it back over 20 years, and distributed in accordance with the RSG formula. The relevance of this, as I mentioned, is significant harm. So I can tell the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that there are guidelines, and that they are being revised. Some of the points raised in the debate are being addressed through the taskforce. There is financial help to assist councils in addressing those issues, and providing the reassurance and security that his constituents, and those of other hon. Members, clearly want.

<a name="51122h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Caste Discrimination Overseas (Government Policy)</h3>
<a name="time_6">
<a name="51122h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51122h02_spnew0"><b> Jeremy Corbyn  (Islington, North)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this subject. It affects a vast number of people throughout the world and there are various ways in which we, as a major industrial trading power, can help to eliminate such a scourge. I wish to declare an interest. It is not in any sense financial, but I am a trustee of Dalit Solidarity Network UK. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) is also an active member of that organisation. I have attended several conferences on the network&#039;s behalf in this country and I have also spoken at Dalit Solidarity Network events in Mumbai in India.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para0"><a name="stpa_81">The work of the Dalit Solidarity Network is to give voice to a group of people mainly in India and Nepal, but also in other parts of the world, who are grievously discriminated against. It puts pressure on European and north American Governments to do something about that and to use the international legal system, through the United Nations and the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, to give strength to the cause.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para1"><a name="stpa_82">Caste discrimination is an hereditary system of discrimination that comes from a perversion of the values of Hinduism in India and which, in the case of Africa, is a similar corruption of mentality, but just as brutal in its discrimination. The number of people throughout the world who suffer caste discrimination is astonishing. Those who are seriously discriminated against amount to 300 million people. That number is equivalent to the population of the United States of America or to the population of all of western Europe. Those people lose out on education, housing, employment and job opportunities. They lose out on life. They suffer death by violence, death by poverty and death by illness because health care is not available to them. As a planet, we condemn 300 million people to the worst living standards and to have shorter lives than would otherwise be the case. Discrimination has brutal consequences. It is hard for us in the west to understand fully how bad the position is.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para2"><a name="stpa_83">A Dalit is the modern form of untouchable. When translated, it means broken people. The magazine <i>New Internationalist </i>quotes Narayanamma, a toilet cleaner in India. It says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;&#039;In the rainy season,&#039; the woman began, &#039;it is really bad. Water mixes with the&#039;&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para3"><a name="stpa_84">excrement&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;&#039;and we carry it (on our heads) it drips from the baskets, on to our clothes, our bodies, our faces. When I return home I find it difficult to eat food sometimes. The smell never gets out of my clothes, my hair. But this is our fate. To feed my children I have no option but to do this work.&#039;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para4"><a name="stpa_85">The magazine then well describes the differences in modern India. For example, major railway stations have internet connections, western cappuccino bars, fast food restaurants, people in smart suits and so on. However, 100 m away from those areas, to the backs of the stations and the toilets, are groups of people using the most primitive equipment and who are treated in the most disgusting way. They are the &quot;untouchables&quot;&#151;the Dalit people, who exist throughout India because of a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 371WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
perversion of the values of Hinduism and because it suits the wealthy and powerful to ensure that they continue to exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para5"><a name="stpa_86">It is not as though the problem has not been recognised. Let me outline the social indicators. The infant mortality rate is 83 per 100,000 for Dalits and 61.8 per 100,000 for non-Dalits. The child mortality rate is 39 per 100,000 for Dalits and 22 per 100,000 for non-Dalits. The figure for undernourishment is 54 per 100,000 for Dalits and 41 per 100,000 for non-Dalits. The level of self-employment in agriculture, rather than employment as day labourers, is 16 per cent. for rural Dalits and 41 per cent. for rural non-Dalits. The level of self-employment in non-agriculture is 10 per cent. for rural Dalits and 14 for rural non-Dalits. The poverty rate exemplifies the pattern, and the level of poverty that exists among the Dalit people throughout Indian cities and villages is appalling by any stretch of the imagination.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para6"><a name="stpa_87">As if the poverty and the discrimination are not bad enough, the violence that goes with it is shocking. Many stories could be quoted, and many issues are raised in various local and international media on the subject, but I will just quote a 31 August report, which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;In one of the worst ever instances of caste violence in Haryana, upper caste villages belonging to the Jat community in Gohana village near Sonepat burnt down 60 houses of Dalits today. The officials, however, say about 40 houses were burnt.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">That pattern of practice by officials is normal. The Dalits were attacked because it was &quot;apparently suspected&quot; that a Dalit murdered somebody else the previous week. The report continues by detailing the murder, violence and the burning of homes that occurred. Unfortunately, such events are common.
</p>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="51122h02_para7"><a name="stpa_88">That is not to say that India has not sought to address the problem. Gandhi clearly recognised the discrimination against the untouchable people. During all his marches he sought to seek them out and to work with them. He also sought their protection in the Indian constitution, which, ironically was written by Ambedkar, a Dalit. I shall return to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para8"><a name="stpa_89">It also must be said that India, as the home of the majority of Dalit people in the world&#151;the majority of people who suffer from caste discrimination&#151;is reluctant to have the issue raised internationally. It is to the credit of the Dalit Solidarity Network worldwide and of the Dalit movements in India that the issue was finally brought more to the world&#039;s attention in the 2001 summit against racism that was held in Durban.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para9"><a name="stpa_90">The Indian Government moved might and main to prevent the subject from being raised in India at all. They said that caste discrimination was not the same as racism and that it should not be equated with what had happened in apartheid South Africa or with the degree of discrimination that existed in the southern states of the USA before the Civil Rights Act. They said it was not of that order and that it was more of a cultural issue. It might well have a cultural basis&#151;or a perversion of such a basis&#151;in where it started, but the reality is that it condemns generations of people to a second-class existence when they should be able to have a first-class one.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para10"><a name="stpa_91">It is also important to recognise that the problem is now being more widely understood. Such discrimination does not apply just in India, but in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 372WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Nepal&#151;I will discuss that a bit later&#151;and parts of west Africa, notably in Burkina Faso and Senegal. The same degree of discrimination applies, with the same degree of people not being allowed to go into restaurants or cafes, not being allowed to use the same utensils as other people and not being allowed to undertake any skilled work&#151;only for such people are the foul jobs of cleaning sewers, sweeping streets and that type of thing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para11"><a name="stpa_92">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also recognises that. The excellent Library briefing for the debate includes an extract from the FCO human rights report of 2005, page 213 of which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;In many parts of India caste discrimination remains a problem, despite being outlawed under the Indian constitution of 1950. Dalits&#151;formerly &quot;untouchables&quot; but now known as &quot;scheduled castes&quot;&#151;make up 16 per cent of India&#039;s population (this is approximately two and a half times the population of the UK). A proportional number of seats in both union and state assemblies are reserved for scheduled castes . . . However, many people continue to view Dalits as below the caste system and they are among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable of all Indians. Dalits have poor access to public services such as education, health&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para12"><a name="stpa_93">The report mentions that Dalits are reduced to jobs such as &quot;manual scavenging&quot;. It also points out that when aid is delivered when a natural disaster, such as the tsunami, takes place, the solution to the problem, obviously, is to assist people at a time of desperate emergency. However, in assisting those people, who loses out but the Dalit people? They are last in line to get water, food, clothes and a place of safety in which to live.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para13"><a name="stpa_94">There was a national public hearing on 30 August in Chennai, Tamil Nadu on discrimination against Dalits in tsunami relief and rehabilitation. I shall not quote the entire document, as it is long, but I have selected some of the observations made by the jury of experts who assessed the effects of tsunami relief. It said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;The jury panel observed that there is discrimination in distributing relief and rehabilitation during tsunami. Particularly the revenue officials and the district administration that were carrying out the relief operations have neglected the requests made by Dalits and not provided the relief materials.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para14"><a name="stpa_95">The report goes on to state:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;the relief materials distributed to the Dalits have been plundered&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para15"><a name="stpa_96">by others, and that the
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;district administration appointed for monitoring the distribution was inactive and silent in curbing these atrocities . . . During our visit to the tsunami affected areas, we could see that the temporary shelters constructed by both the Government and the NGOs have segregated the Dalits and the fishermen.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">We feel that it is the duty of the Government to bring peace and harmony between the communities where already exists the concept of discrimination. Instead the relief operation carried out by the government of Tamil Nadu has widened the division between the Dalits and non-Dalits.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para16"><a name="stpa_97">Those millions of people around the world who responded so magnificently to the tsunami disaster did not give their money so that it could be distributed unfairly. They made a humanitarian gesture to ensure that everybody got a fair share of the aid, but the Dalit people certainly did not get a fair share. When my right hon. Friend the Minister replies, I hope that he will offer some assurance on that. I am not blaming the British Government. The concern is whether the aid got through fairly, and, clearly, the evidence is that it absolutely did not.

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para17"><a name="stpa_98">Despite Indian objections, the Durban conference managed to raise several important issues. I want to deal with what is, obviously, a terrible scourge on the face of the earth. First, I recognise the strong position of Indian law and the Indian constitution on the matter. However, the reality at town and village level, and in society, is that the scheduled caste reservation system, which provides for reserved places in state and federal elections and other things in India, works for a small number of people but not for the majority. It does not work for the majority of Dalit people, who continue to be extremely badly treated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para18"><a name="stpa_99">To address the issue, we should consider the Ambedkar principles, which were drafted after a great deal of debate among the community in India, among the exiled community and among the Dalit Solidarity Network worldwide. The Ambedkar principles are based on the work of Ambedkar, a brilliant man who was the author of the Indian constitution. I shall not read all of the document, as it is long, but I shall quote parts of it. Those who have been involved in Irish issues over the years will recognise some similarity with the MacBride principles on employment practices which were eventually introduced in Northern Ireland. They helped to reduce the discrimination that clearly existed there. The principles state:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;The Signatories of these Principles, building on existing national anti-discrimination laws and policies and in the spirit of internationally recognised human and employment rights will . . . Include in any statement of employment policy a reference to the unacceptability of caste discrimination and a commitment to seeking to eliminate it . . . Develop . . . a plan of affirmative action, including training on caste discrimination for all employees and making specific reference to Dalit women&quot;.</p>
</ul>

They were mostly from south Asia but, as a world forum, there were also delegations from elsewhere. The opening coincided with the completion of a Dalit rights march throughout India. The people recreated the great marches of Gandhi and demanded justice. Their joy, the sense of recognition that those people received, and their sense of liberation when they got to the forum is something that will always live with me. Some of the same people attended the conference in Durban, and they travel around the world doing their best to bring about justice for those people. It is up to us to do what we can.

<a name="51122h02_para38"><a name="stpa_119">We fought hard to get rid of slavery 150 years ago. Slavery is a moral outrage, and there is a material-analysis reason for getting rid of it. As well as the moral outrage and the destroyed lives, slavery is an economically inefficient way of organising a society. That is what the American civil war was about: morals and a materialist analysis. We should bear that in mind when we campaign against caste-based discrimination.

<p>
<a name="51122h02_para39"><a name="stpa_120">A year ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Punjab state in India on a private visit, where 55 per cent. of the population is Sikh. There is still caste discrimination in Punjab state, as there is across India and Nepal, and in Africa, and so on. I am chair of the all-party group on UK Sikhs. We have to recognise that one of the tenets of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, was to get rid of caste-based discrimination. He has not succeeded yet. Sadly, there is still caste-based discrimination, even in Sikhism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para40"><a name="stpa_121">We have caste-based discrimination here in the UK. Those who know the UK south Asian community quite well, and I count myself as one of those, can sometimes see, by looking at south Asians and those from a south Asian background, from what caste they have come&#151;because of systematic discrimination for 2,500 years. Dalit people look different. That is reproduced in this country. Sometimes, sadly, here in the UK, it is possible to get a sense of which is a Dalit and which is a Jat temple, or gurdwara, on visiting them. Caste exists in this country, as well as in south Asia and Africa.

<p>
<a name="51122h02_para41"><a name="stpa_122">The Dr. Ambedkar memorial committee in my constituency has a large community hall. I am familiar with the doctor&#039;s work. He was born in the late 19th century as a Dalit, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North said, and obtained a PhD through patronage. He was an economist, philosopher, sociologist, member of the London Bar and one of the most distinguished Indians who ever lived; he was a brilliant man. He was chair of the committee that wrote the constitution of India and rose, through patronage, from being a Dalit. However, like President Narayan, he did not forget whence he came. In fact, in 1956, in the final year of his life, after decades of frustration with the reactionary elements of Hinduism&#151;although I stress that by no means all Hindus are reactionary on caste&#151;Dr. Ambedkar, with thousands of others, led a mass conversion to Buddhism, as my hon. Friend may know. His touchstone was &quot;Educate, agitate and organise&quot;&#151;and he did that all his life on the part of the downtrodden of India, before partition and afterwards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para42"><a name="stpa_123">Education is one of the keys, but it has to be backed up by resources, a will to act and more than just fine words. United Kingdom companies operating in the subcontinent have a particular responsibility, because of the history between the United Kingdom and south Asia, for the way that they operate and how they treat Dalit scheduled castes. My hon. Friend said that he would not read all the Ambedkar principles, and I understand that. They are contained in a handy book called &quot;Caste Discrimination and the Private Sector: Employment Principles for Foreign Investors in South Asia&quot;, published this year by the Dalit Solidarity Network UK.

caste discrimination and a plan of affirmative action; they should avoid any form of bonded or indentured labour; they should use fair recruitment selection and career development processes and take full responsibility for their work force, evolve comprehensive training opportunities, designate a manager at an appropriate level to monitor the issue and have effective monitoring. They should also publish an annual report on progress and ensure that all corporate support to community development programmes includes the participation of Dalits. That is the call to action under the Ambedkar principles. United Kingdom companies that operate in India and Nepal in particular should sign up to those principles and that course of action.

<a name="51122h02_para44"><a name="stpa_125">I am fortunate enough to be a member of the Trade and Industry Committee, which has announced that, in this Parliament, we will conduct an inquiry into trade and investment opportunities between India and the United Kingdom. That is not surprising, in terms of globalisation; it is such an important country, and such a long-standing friend of the United Kingdom. One of the things that I wish to look into is what UK companies investing in India are doing in terms of corporate social responsibility and the Ambedkar employment principles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para45"><a name="stpa_126">As we know from what our Government have done to assist the most disadvantaged in our society&#151;they are incomparably more advantaged than the most disadvantaged in India, Nepal and Africa who face caste discrimination&#151;the dignity of employment, employment opportunities, and education and skills training to get into those jobs are absolutely central. United Kingdom and European developed-world companies that invest in India have a particular responsibility to try to assist the most downtrodden: the Dalits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para46"><a name="stpa_127">My hon. Friend referred to the difficulties that the United Kingdom faces when the Department for International Development offers aid support, and when UK-based charities try to assist in India after natural disasters there. He also mentioned the issue of unequal distribution of aid, and who loses out. One reason why Dalits lose out is that often they have been denied the educational opportunities that would allow them to hold positions of responsibility and to hand out the money. So, the old caste-based discrimination reinforces itself again.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para47"><a name="stpa_128">Sometimes, but not always, those of higher caste who are handing out the money&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;do not take enough trouble to ensure that the most disadvantaged, the Dalits, get the aid. That was the case with the distribution after the recent tsunami, the Gujarat earthquake, and, before that, the Orissa hurricane. That happens all too frequently. I am delighted that DFID has moved on that issue, in terms of both what it says and what it demands when handing out development moneys in India after such disasters.

<a name="51122h02_para49"><a name="stpa_130">I have some questions for the Minister, as is traditional in these Adjournment debates. First, what have our Government done to address allegations of discrimination based on caste in the recruitment of Gurkhas from Nepal? What have they done about the experiences of Dalits who have joined that wonderful band of armed fighting men and women? There have been serious allegations of discrimination, as regards both recruitment and what happens to those recruited, in terms of their career progression&#151;or, according to the allegations, lack of career progression.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para50"><a name="stpa_131">I reinforce what my hon. Friend said about the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. As I understand it, the report is eight years overdue. India&#151;understandably, given its size, maturity and importance in the world&#151;wishes to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. However, if in eight years it cannot produce a report on this fundamental issue, which covers a quarter of its population, for the moment at least, it would not be appropriate for India to be on the Security Council. We are not talking about a report on discrimination against a couple of thousand people, important as that might be; we are talking about discrimination against a quarter of the population of what may now be the most, or at least the second most, populous country in the world. Yet it cannot do a report in eight years. What are our Government doing to encourage the Government of India, through the United Nations, to come up with that report?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para51"><a name="stpa_132">I salute the fact that the UK, during its presidency of the European Union thus far&#151;there are another five or six weeks to run&#151;has gotten the EU to appoint two special rapporteurs to prepare a detailed study on discrimination based on work and dissent. However, I would like to know what steps the Government, through the EU, have taken with the Government of India to ensure that those rapporteurs have full access. I know from my work with the all-party parliamentary group on UK Sikhs and, during the previous Parliament, the all-party group on Panjabis in Britain, about the lack of access to the Punjab state for the UN special rapporteurs on human rights who, 21 years after the appalling events of 1984, the storming of the Golden Temple, the pogroms in Delhi and so on, are still blocked out and not allowed in to investigate. Will the two EU special rapporteurs be allowed to investigate caste-based discrimination in India and to do a proper job there?

<a name="51122h02_para53"><a name="stpa_134">A question that I asked myself&#151;it might be worthy of ventilation here&#151;is why such a grotesque and systematic abuse of human rights on such a huge scale is so little known about and so little debated. I confess that when preparing for the debate, the scales fell from my eyes as I appreciated the reality of a problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para54"><a name="stpa_135">I studied social anthropology at university and pored over textbooks about the caste system in the Asian subcontinent. We were asked to reflect on the history of the caste system through a prism of moral relativism, which implicitly, if not explicitly, suggested that the caste system and the abuses suffered by the victims of the system were so ingrained in the complex history of society in India and other Asian nations as to be somehow beyond the reach of moral or political judgment or influence from outside. That moral relativism towards something that undeniably exists is complex and has profound religious, historical, social and cultural antecedents. It has prevented the political class in this country and elsewhere from turning the spotlight on a problem as fully and sustainably as it deserves to be. The reticence to deal with the issue as forcibly as it clearly requires is no longer sustainable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para55"><a name="stpa_136">As the hon. Gentleman eloquently illustrated, the scale of the abuse is perhaps without historical precedent. There has been appalling human rights abuse at specific times and in specific places, but for that abuse to take place on such a scale, covering almost 300 million people over such a long period, is almost unique. I am not aware of any other cruelty that has been so durable. The grotesque nature of the abuse cannot be ignored any longer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para56"><a name="stpa_137">I challenge everyone to read the Amnesty International report submitted to the hearing of the US Congress. I dare not read out the section on the scale, nature and cruelty of the abuse suffered by Dalit women in particular. The descriptions of rape and gang rape are about as grotesque as anything one could possibly read.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para57"><a name="stpa_138">It is, perhaps, politically important that that abuse is illegal under India&#039;s own legislation. That is crucial, and I shall refer to it later. I do not underestimate the difficulty of shifting patterns of behaviour that are inseparable from the social and political history of India, and the cultural patterns and prejudices involved. Nor do I underestimate the sensitivity of external voices, here or elsewhere, seeking from afar to influence conditions on the ground. However, as the hon. Member for Islington, North and the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) made abundantly clear, the need for urgent action is now overwhelming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para58"><a name="stpa_139">In addition to the excellent points already made, I want emphasise the ways in which fruitful activity could be undertaken. Given that the nature of the abuses suffered by the Dalit community are intimately associated with long-standing prejudices shared by many millions of Indians from other castes, the need to tackle in the classroom the nature of some fundamental prejudices is of paramount importance. Again, I do not underestimate how difficult it is to do that from the outside, but every effort should be taken by the Department for International Development, the European Union and all other donor organisations&#151;they provide assistance to the tune of several hundred million pounds for the Indian education system&#151;to associate aid closely with the requirement to tackle underlying cultural and social prejudices that sustain that level of human rights abuse over such a long period.

aid, to influence the way in which the problem is tackled in classrooms in schools in villages and cities throughout India.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para59"><a name="stpa_140">It is worth reiterating how clear and unambiguous India&#039;s legislation is on that point. The Library briefing&#151;excellent, as ever&#151;says:

<ul>

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para60"><a name="stpa_141">Legislation to criminalise abuses against so-called scheduled castes and tribes began in 1955 with the Protection of Civil Rights Act. That was supplemented by the enactment of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in 1989 and, most recently, the rules of 1995, which extended the scope of abuses that were criminalised and provided for ever graver penalties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para61"><a name="stpa_142">The protection afforded to the Dalit and scheduled castes and tribes in those Acts is extensive&#151;I would even use the word &quot;progressive&quot;. They include, for instance, the provision of legal aid and travel expenses for witnesses and victims attending trials. However, the fact that the legislation, which stipulates the constitutional requirement and prohibits the abuses suffered by the Dalit community, is ignored by the police and courts is of legitimate external concern. We even have the perverse example of other laws&#151;the National Security Act, the Explosives Act and sections of the Indian penal code&#151;being invoked to override those protections. Given that the abuses are taking place and that they fly directly in the face of the legal protections incorporated in the constitution and Indian law, it is right that the moral outrage that we all feel, because of the nature of the abuses suffered, is also directed at the simple failure to abide by the rule of law, which is one of the founding principles of all mature democracies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51122h02_spnew3"><b> Rob Marris </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. As a solicitor, when I was in Punjab, I visited the courts in Chandigarh, the state capital, which are conducted in English. The Dalit people are, not by law but by practice and poverty, excluded from learning English, so, as he says, their chances of enforcing their legal rights are nil.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51122h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Clegg </b> : The hon. Gentleman has a much greater insight from his personal experiences than I do. What he says merely reinforces the fact that the law is an empty shell if those who are victimised cannot seek legal recourse through the courts, because of linguistic or other barriers. The claim on the democratic credentials of a mature democracy, which India is&#151;it is the largest democracy in the world&#151;will always be challenged and will appear threadbare so long as the legal protections on the statute book that are afforded to so many millions of people are not fully connected.

<a name="51122h02_para62"><a name="stpa_143">My final point, which I direct to the Minister, is a political one. If a lot of work needs to be done from the bottom up, particularly in the classroom, it is equally true that pressure needs to be brought from the top down. Given the scale of the abuses suffered in India, and to a numerically lesser degree in Nepal and Pakistan, we want the problem of caste discrimination to be featured at every bilateral meeting at political level between the United Kingdom and India, and between the European Union and India.

If not, what measures can he take to ensure that future EU presidencies make sure that caste discrimination becomes a permanent, political irritant, from India&#039;s point of view, and a persistent feature in bilateral and multilateral discussions, in the same way as human rights issues are raised in our dialogues with many other countries around the world?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para63"><a name="stpa_144">Caste discrimination is clearly a subject that unites hon. Members on both sides of the House. Meritocracy, opportunity for all, fairness, a free and open labour market, and the belief that the only bar to our social and economic advancement is our ability, not to whom or where we were born, are a fundamental part of my conservatism. A healthy market economy depends on free movement of labour, and caste discrimination fundamentally disrupts that. We need to do something about that key aspect of social justice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para64"><a name="stpa_145">A caste system is one where a person&#039;s occupation and social status are defined by their birth, and it exists in many countries. We heard a great deal about India, but my research has revealed that caste-based systems also exist in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauretania, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Senegal, Somalia and Sri Lanka. That is quite a list, so we should not only pay attention to India. Caste discrimination affects the whole of south Asia and many countries in Africa, principally in west Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para65"><a name="stpa_146">India has constitutional protection for equality. It has criminalised discrimination, for which we are grateful. However, as in so many areas of government, it is one thing to get laws on to the statute book, but it is another to ensure that those laws are enforced and that law enforcement agencies adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para66"><a name="stpa_147">I am pleased that the United Nations is starting to take the problem more seriously, because it certainly must do so. It is long overdue in paying serious attention to caste discrimination. A session of the working group on minorities took place in Geneva on 30 May at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN has appointed two special rapporteurs, Mr. Yokota and Ms Chin-Sung Chung. They have been tasked with preparing a comprehensive study on discrimination that is based on descent and work. Furthermore, the UN special rapporteur on racism, Mr. Doudou Di&#232;ne, has stated that caste discrimination is a problem of racism. It is good to hear that formal acknowledgement that caste is an issue of race.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para67"><a name="stpa_148">As the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) said, India&#039;s report to the United Nations is long overdue. It has been required since 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 382WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about 1997 or 1998. It is fair for the Government to ask the United Nations when we will see that report and when it will be acted on. I am interested to hear how the Government will ensure that the European Union, on our behalf, takes effective action through its appointment of a rapporteur to look into caste discrimination.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para68"><a name="stpa_149">It is worth talking about what caste discrimination means in everyday life for those who suffer from it. The Dalits, or, as they have been known, the untouchables, represent more than one sixth of India&#039;s population. That is 160 million people. Many endure almost complete social ostracisation. Many cannot cross the dividing line from their part of the village to that occupied by higher castes. They cannot use the same wells, visit the same temples or even drink from the same cups in tea stalls. Dalit children are often made to sit at the back of classrooms. In what has been called India&#039;s hidden apartheid, entire villages in many Indian states are completely segregated by caste.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para69"><a name="stpa_150">We know that the Indian Government often allocate separate facilities to separate, caste-based neighbourhoods. Dalits often receive poorer facilities, if, indeed, they receive any facilities at all. In many villages, the state administration installs electricity, sanitation facilities and water pumps in the upper-caste section but neglect to do the same in the neighbouring, segregated Dalit area. Basic amenities such as water taps and wells are also segregated. Medical facilities are often available only in the higher-caste areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para70"><a name="stpa_151">India&#039;s constitution contains reservation or caste-based quota policies that were supposed to deal with the situation and improve it. The constitution reserves 22.5 per cent. of federal Government jobs, seats in state legislatures, seats in the lower House of Parliament and jobs in educational institutions for scheduled castes and tribes. Again, it is on the implementation and enforcement of that policy that things have fallen down. If one examines the percentages to see what the Dalit representation is in those areas, one finds that it is much lower than the 22.5 per cent. that is specified in Indian law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para71"><a name="stpa_152">During election campaigns in India&#151;the world&#039;s largest democracy&#151;there is de facto disfranchisement of Dalit communities much of the time. In February 1998, police raided a Dalit village in Tamil Nadu that had boycotted national parliamentary elections. In Bihar, to ensure their majority vote from the Dalit community, political candidates sent in civilian militias whose members intimidated and killed. More than 50 people were killed in elections in Bihar in 1995.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para72"><a name="stpa_153">We heard that during natural disasters separate facilities and even separate refugee camps are set up for Dalits. There are serious questions to be asked about how tsunami aid, which was given in good faith by the people and Government of this country, was distributed. It is unbelievable that the issue of caste comes into play even in the face of appalling natural disasters. The allocation of relief aid is one situation in which one would hope that our common humanity would be uppermost and issues of caste would not apply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para73"><a name="stpa_154">The consequences of having a relationship or marrying outside one&#039;s caste are severe. On 6 August 2001, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, an 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 383WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
upper-caste Brahmin boy and a lower-caste Jat girl were dragged to the roof of a house and publicly hanged by members of their own families as hundreds of spectators looked on. The public lynching was a punishment for refusing to end an inter-caste relationship. In May 2000, in the Hardoi district in Uttar Pradesh, a police constable who was enraged by his daughter&#039;s marriage to a Dalit was joined by other relatives in shooting and killing four members of his son-in-law&#039;s family. In Nepal, some Dalits who married people of higher caste have reportedly been imprisoned by local authorities because of false cases filed against them by members of the upper-caste families. Obviously, that raises severe concerns about the justice system in Nepal. Dalits are often forbidden from performing marriage or funeral rites in public areas or, in some areas, from speaking to members of upper castes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para74"><a name="stpa_155">On debt bondage and slavery, in many parts of the world Dalits are only allowed to perform certain tasks and occupations, which are often badly paid, and in many cases they become slaves. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West was right to equate caste discrimination with slavery. There are many examples in which there are strong similarities between the two. That should give us all pause for thought and should cause serious concern in this country as we approach a significant anniversary as far as Wilberforce is concerned. Again, those problems are due to the lack of enforcement in India of relevant legislation preventing debt bondage. We should be seriously concerned about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para75"><a name="stpa_156">I mentioned education. There are high Dalit drop-out rates from education. We should consider that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51122h02_spnew6"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that in addition to there being poor education for Dalits and a high drop-out rate, large numbers of Dalit children end up being exploited as child labourers in all kinds of dangerous situations, such as brick making? Of course, that contributes to the complete lack of education for most of them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51122h02_spnew7"><b> Andrew Selous </b> : The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and his point comes back to what I said about debt bondage. On education, the literacy gap between the Dalits and the rest of the population is significant. Almost two thirds of the Dalit population are illiterate, compared with half of the general population. That statistic demonstrates the concern well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para76"><a name="stpa_157">On freedom of religion, it is hardly surprising that some Dalits have wanted to move away from Hinduism because of the place that it has accorded them in society. Again, there are concerns about that, which I raised in Westminster Hall in January 2003. In the state of Tamil Nadu, a law was passed to ban conversions by, as the legislation calls it, &quot;force or fraud.&quot; However, the leader of the militant Hindu group, RSS, claimed recently that no one converts voluntarily; it is always motivated by greed. The law is aimed, frankly, at stopping Dalits converting from Hinduism to other religions such as Buddhism, Christianity or Islam, which is something that many have wanted to do. The state authorities in Tamil Nadu vigorously opposed a recent conversion rally where a number of Dalits converted to both 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 384WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Christianity and Buddhism. Again, that is a fundamental issue of liberty and conscience, which the Government need continually to raise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51122h02_spnew8"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that there are attempts to introduce the same kind of law in Sri Lanka, with exactly the same effect?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51122h02_spnew9"><b> Andrew Selous </b> : I am interested to hear the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. He is quite right about Sri Lanka. Although the caste system in Sri Lanka is often thought to be much less severe than that in India, it still exists. There is a lower caste group, called the Rodiya, which still suffers discrimination. I am grateful to him for putting that on the record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para77"><a name="stpa_158">In India, 90 per cent. of those who live below the official poverty line are Dalits. If we are to get away from the notion that poverty is predestined to be intergenerationally persistent for certain groups, we need to address that problem. The Government need to be concerned with that if they are to have any hope of achieving the millennium development goals to which we are all committed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para78"><a name="stpa_159">When, quite rightly, Martin Luther King and others led the black civil rights movement in the United States of America, they did so for a black population of about 35 million, mainly in the southern states of America. When many in this House and outside it joined the struggle to end the abhorrent apartheid regime in South Africa, we did so for an African, coloured, Indian and Asian population of about 42 million. We were also quite right to do so. When some 300 million people worldwide suffer caste discrimination on an ongoing basis, it is unacceptable that the international community looks the other way, turns a blind eye and has not pushed the issue higher up the international agenda.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para79"><a name="stpa_160">This is an issue for our generation. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Islington, North for having secured the debate, to the Dalit social forum in India for its work, to the work of Dalit Solidarity Network UK and to the UK churches that are starting to take the issue seriously. Their interest is important and significant, and I hope that their pressure, along with that of all Members of the House, will continue to ensure that the Government take the issue seriously. If we are, in this year, to make poverty history, we have no choice but to end caste discrimination, as segregation in the USA and apartheid in South Africa have been ended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para80"><a name="stpa_161">We look forward to hearing what specific steps the Government can take in their dealings with international organisations, such as the European Union and the United Nations, and bilaterally with the many countries concerned, to ensure that the issue stays firmly at the top of the political agenda.

colleague recognised, a growing number of British Church people who, quite reasonably, are greatly concerned about the injustice. Their campaign has been worthwhile. This is one of several Adjournment debates on the subject and I regret and fear that it will not be the last, as we face an enduring challenge. None the less, it is right to recognise the campaigners&#039; considerable efforts to bring the issue to the attention not just of the Government but of the wider audience in the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para81"><a name="stpa_162">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) challenged me to offer specific measures. I hope that he will exercise some forbearance and allow me to set out some general points before I address the wide range of questions that were put to me by each speaker in turn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para82"><a name="stpa_163">The Government firmly believe that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out in the universal declaration of human rights, without discrimination of any kind. Discrimination based on descent, to give it the title used by the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, encapsulates discrimination based on forms of social stratification&#151;caste or similar systems of inherited status&#151;that impair a person&#039;s equal enjoyment of their human rights. Caste discrimination of the type found in India, which has featured prominently in this debate, is the most well-known example of discrimination based on descent. In that system, in which social mobility is severely limited and status is completely ascribed, the Dalits, or untouchables, about whose plight we have heard so much this morning, suffer multiple forms of discrimination and are typically assigned tasks or occupations that are considered filthy or polluting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para83"><a name="stpa_164">However, it is not only in south or south-east Asia that caste-like practices, including discrimination based on occupation and descent from slaves, are found. As we have heard today, they are also found in other parts of the world such as Africa. The discrimination suffered by such communities takes the form of a variety of human rights violations, including the lack of ability to alter inherited status; restrictions on marriage outside the community; private and public segregation in housing, health and education, and in access to public spaces, places of worship and even sources of food and water; inability to renounce inherited occupations or degrading or hazardous work; subjection to debt bondage; subjection to dehumanising references such as &quot;polluting&quot; or &quot;untouchable&quot;; and a general lack of respect for their human dignity and equality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para84"><a name="stpa_165">Discrimination based on caste or descent determines an individual&#039;s position in the social and economic hierarchy, not on the basis of merit but of heritage. It perpetuates social exclusion and reduces the rate at which poverty reduction can be achieved, as the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire said. The framework of international covenants and national legislation outlawing discrimination based on descent is an important step towards its elimination, but it has not been enough, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) pointed out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para85"><a name="stpa_166">As we all know, such practices remain all too entrenched despite the many international commitments made by the countries in question. It is therefore important that the international community engages at a more practical level to help to implement 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 386WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
such commitments. One example of engagement is the child health programme: the Department for International Development has worked with the Indian Ministry of Health to develop targets for including Dalit and Adivasi women and children in the programme. It has worked hard with other donors to develop a monitoring system and incentives to ensure that such women are included. DFID supports similar initiatives in education and other areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para86"><a name="stpa_167">It is clear that deep-rooted social attitudes and customs must also change. Of course, that is a much more difficult task, as was recognised by some of the speakers this morning. We welcome the fact that that is beginning to happen through natural social change. Migration, urbanisation, greater contact with other societies and new forms of employment all have an effect, but we can and must do more. We must encourage states, for example, to be proactive in tackling prejudice and changing behaviour to ensure that socially excluded groups benefit from public expenditure and have access to services such as health care and education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para87"><a name="stpa_168">Some hon. Members raised the question of tsunami relief in that context. The British public gave to that cause in record numbers almost a year ago, as did the Government. Unfortunately, media reports suggest that Dalits have experienced discrimination and difficulties in gaining access to emergency aid, but the Foreign Office&#039;s assessment is that that has been localised and complex, rather than universal. For DFID, I understand that emergency funding and first-stage rehabilitation require a demonstration of an appreciation of social issues and a strategy for addressing the issue of caste discrimination when targeting aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para88"><a name="stpa_169">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire brought to the attention of the House the full range of countries where the practices we have been discussing exist, and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North spoke about Senegal. We understand that there is a form of caste system in that country based on occupation, affecting blacksmiths and griots&#151;traditional troubadours&#151;in particular, and that marriage outside the caste system is strongly discouraged. An offer that I can make to my hon. Friend is that I will ask our desk officer in the relevant embassy to raise his concerns and write to my hon. Friend about the specific matter that he raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para89"><a name="stpa_170">I was asked what action we are taking through the United Nations or European Union. We and our EU partners are of course committed to the promotion of all people&#039;s human rights and we continue to raise the subject of discrimination based on work and descent in our meetings with the Governments of the affected countries. The Prime Minister, as president of the EU, led the EU-Indian summit at Delhi on 7 September. During the summit an EU-India joint action plan was agreed, identifying key areas in which the EU and India agree to work together, and one such area, I am glad to say, is human rights. The UK presidency is planning to take that human rights dialogue forward before the end of the year and is consulting EU partners and the Government of India on the form, content and date of the dialogue. The British high commission in New Delhi has also discussed the issues with the Indian National Commission for Minorities and National Commission

We are aware of the work that the International Dalit Solidarity Network has undertaken. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) for raising the specific challenge to British business that was contained in the documentation provided. I should be grateful, however, if the network provided the Foreign Office with a comprehensive outline of the proposals, as we have only the summary document that my hon. Friend mentioned.
</p>

Friend would be prepared to hold a serious seminar with British investors in India to discuss how they might best advance anti-discrimination legislation that applies in this country and about their attitude to where they invest.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51122h02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : The challenge is complex. I do not claim that the complexity of British government quite matches the scale of that challenge, but as my hon. Friend will know, the Department of Trade and Industry leads on the issue of corporate social responsibility. There is a locus for the Trade Minister in the Foreign Office, who is not present in the Chamber today. I shall certainly pass on my hon. Friend&#039;s request. I am aware that in the past Ministers have raised the question of foreign investors&#039; corporate social responsibility and I shall offer my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion to my colleagues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51122h02_spnew12"><b> Andrew Selous </b> : I apologise for asking the Minister a question that I did not raise in my speech; I shall understand if he needs to confer with ministerial colleagues before he replies to me. We have heard a few examples today suggesting that caste discrimination is being practised in the UK. Given that the Equality Bill is before the House at the moment, will the Minister undertake to raise the issue with his colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry so that we can be absolutely sure that if caste discrimination is occurring in the UK, an amendment covering that issue can be tabled?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51122h02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : The hon. Gentleman anticipates the more general point to which I was coming about the evidence that would need to be produced. To add further to the layers of complexity, I think that the Home Office would be involved in what he suggests, given its responsibility for the single equality commission. I happily undertake to make my colleagues in the Home Office aware of the points raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para91"><a name="stpa_172">Of course we are concerned by reports of discrimination against Dalit and other minority communities in India&#151;as I said, the British high commission in New Delhi has raised them on various

occasions. During the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights, the European Union expressed concern about discrimination based on caste and supported the decision to appoint two special rapporteurs to prepare a detailed study on discrimination based on work and descent.

<p>
<a name="51122h02_para92"><a name="stpa_173">The fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination against minorities and indigenous people is a priority for funding under the European initiative for democracy and human rights. A call for proposals was launched in January 2005. The projects selected will provide a concrete follow-up to the Durban declaration and programme of action of 2001, and activities to combat caste discrimination are eligible for support. Oxfam, along with other local partners, is already running one such project in Nepal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para93"><a name="stpa_174">Let me respond to a couple of the other points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North about how the United Kingdom Government contribute to persuading the Indian Government to make their report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Race Discrimination. As we heard this morning, that report is now eight years overdue. A prompt submission of reports to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Race Discrimination by all state parties is a key part of the international framework to combat discrimination, and we are therefore concerned about the delay in India&#039;s reporting. It is right that we encourage authorities to submit prompt and comprehensive reports, including on the situation of scheduled castes. Together with our European Union partners, we will continue to take every suitable opportunity to make clear our collective concerns on this and related matters. We aim to discuss that with our European Union partners when putting together the proposed human rights dialogue, of which I spoke a few moments ago, and we anticipate that that will take place towards the end of this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para94"><a name="stpa_175">I was asked whether there had been any follow-up to the UN Commission on Human Rights study in 2004 and whether the United Kingdom could encourage that to be brought forward. At the Commission on Human Rights, the European Union expressed concern about discrimination based on caste and supported the decision to appoint two special rapporteurs of the sub-commission, about whom we heard from the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, to prepare a detailed study on discrimination based on work and descent. Since then, the experts have been working with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on what they are permitted to do under their mandate. In particular, they would like, I understand, to hold regional consultations&#151;ideally in the Indian subcontinent, Japan and west Africa, and possibly Senegal. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has told them that it does not think that they can organise UN consultations, given that that was not explicitly provided for in the mandate. Strictly speaking, from a financial perspective, that may be correct, as no consultations were provided for in the budget approved for the study, but the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is considering whether to hold such consultations and fund them from some other part of the budget.

there be some way by which either the UK Government or the European Union could raise the matter that we have been discussing, perhaps by initiating the consultation at that venue to encourage the more local consultations to take place later?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51122h02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : The first priority is to make sure that the special rapporteurs are able to do their work. Although I shall certainly bear in mind my hon. Friend&#039;s suggestion, it seems to me that the first priority is to support the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in its efforts to make sure that if there is an alternative means by which that work can be undertaken in the meantime, that should be a priority. For the time being, the rapporteurs have been working on a questionnaire on the issue to distribute to all missions, which I understand should be ready for distribution by the end of November.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para95"><a name="stpa_176">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam raised a related question: what has the United Kingdom done on caste discrimination during its presidency of the European Union? It is right to recognise that the Prime Minister, as president of the European Union, took part in the summit in Delhi on 7 September, during which an EU-India joint action plan was also agreed. One of the areas under question was human rights. The form, content and date of the dialogue is still under discussion with our European Union partners, but it is possible that the reporting and access for the special rapporteurs could form part of that consultation. I will reflect on the points that have been put to me today as we take forward our discussion with European Union partners on that human rights dialogue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para96"><a name="stpa_177">More generally, the hon. Gentleman said that there was a challenge in working with the Indian Government to ensure not only that the international pressure is felt, but that domestic action is taken. One specific issue that was raised was the need for access to justice, and I am glad to say that specific action is being taken in that respect. The Department for International Development is making good progress on its partnership with the United Nations Development Programme and the Indian Government in developing the access to justice programme, which has recently been approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and is now awaiting final approval from the Ministry of Finance to move to full design.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para97"><a name="stpa_178">To assist and to inform colleagues, I will say that the aim of the programme is to achieve real access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups in India, including Dalits. To that end, DFID India has contacts at various levels in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, and also with other groups and institutions that work on Dalit issues. The views and issues of poor and vulnerable groups, including Dalits, will be the driving force behind the design and implementation of the access to justice programme.

provision India&#039;s quota system reserves approximately 26 per cent. of Government jobs in India for Dalits and other tribal groups. The aim is to bring them into the political and social mainstream. I understand that there are also reserved places in the education system for the same groups.

<a name="51122h02_para99"><a name="stpa_180">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam will appreciate that his specific point on conditionality of aid extends far beyond one country or one specific issue. I make an offer on behalf of my colleagues in DFID: perhaps they can write to him to deal with the general issue of conditionality in light of today&#039;s specific suggestion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para100"><a name="stpa_181">The problem of caste-based or descent-based discrimination manifests itself in a range of thematic areas, including contemporary slavery, racism, religious discrimination, poverty reduction, and social exclusion. That means that there are many angles from which to raise, and to tackle, this issue. Wherever poverty adversely affects people&#039;s enjoyment of their rights, we support country-led development agendas. We also encourage partner Governments to develop policies to take into account the needs of all groups in society.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para101"><a name="stpa_182">A striking feature of caste discrimination is its intersection with bonded labour, where a person is required to give their labour as security for a loan. With literally nothing else on offer, that person is open to exploitation and is trapped into working for little or no pay until the debt is repaid. Sometimes, entire families are bonded or debts are passed down through generations. I say that with some personal feeling, given that when I was the Minister in the Foreign Office with responsibility for south Asia I had the privilege of visiting a DFID-funded project in Nepal. It provides land and a means of sustenance for former bonded labourers through the freed Kamaiya food security programme. It has supported a number of activities including income generation, scholarships and access to drinking water and sanitation, in partnership with international, national and local non-governmental organisations. The work continues through a number of smaller-scale projects under the community support programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para102"><a name="stpa_183">Mention of Nepal reminds me of the earlier point that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West raised in respect of the Gurkhas. I am aware that recruitment takes place in Nepal, but I was unaware of the specific issue that he identifies. I give an undertaking that I will raise that matter with the relevant Minister in the Ministry of Defence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h02_para103"><a name="stpa_184">I can assure hon. Members that the Government take this issue seriously. It is an issue on which, not least on the basis of the discussion that we have had today, there is great strength of feeling in this House. I know of the concern that is felt not only by Members of this House but by the many campaigners outside the House who have brought the issue to the attention of parliamentarians. That is why I offer this assurance: we will continue in our efforts to address the poverty, injustice and discrimination to which this issue contributes.

<a name="51122h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Ardmore Peninsula, Sutherland (Mail Deliveries)</h3>
<a name="time_11">
<a name="51122h03_time0"><h5>12.25 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51122h03_spnew0"><b> John Thurso  (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</b>  (LD): I am grateful to have this opportunity to raise the vital issue for my constituents on the Ardmore peninsula of mail deliveries, the cessation of which threatens the very existence of that small and vibrant community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para0"><a name="stpa_185">Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to explain where the Ardmore peninsula is. It is to be found on the west coast of Sutherland, to the south of Kinlochbervie. It is a small crofting township, comprising some half dozen or so households. There is also an important business located in it. It was founded by John Ridgeway, who is perhaps better known to Members as one half of the team of Chay Blyth and John Ridgeway that rowed across the Atlantic. He founded a very successful adventure school on the peninsula, which has been in operation for some 40 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para1"><a name="stpa_186">Ardmore is in many ways typical of the remote west coast townships in my constituency and of many other communities in the west highlands, but it is atypical in one regard. Many such communities have withered and died in the modern era, but Ardmore has flourished and succeeded. It has made the most of its environment, and has a business that keeps it going.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para2"><a name="stpa_187">Mail deliveries are essential for that business, but in March Royal Mail ceased to deliver mail to the Ardmore township. It cited two grounds for that. The first was that it was caught by the 15-minute rule exception&#151;the rule by which, if it takes more than 15 minutes to deliver to a dwelling, Royal Mail can apply for an exemption from the universal service obligation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para3"><a name="stpa_188">Therefore, I should perhaps explain the access that there is to the township. From the main road, a single-track road goes most of the way to the township, but for the final part of the journey that becomes a one-and-a-half-mile path. It is a public path that is maintained by the Highland council, which has the responsibility of looking after it. I should also mention that the last part of the path is a steep rise through what is described as a waterfall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para4"><a name="stpa_189">Let me deal with the issue of the 15-minute rule. In an e-mail to me of 28 March, Royal Mail stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;Although this decision&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para5"><a name="stpa_190">the decision to cease delivery&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;has been taken primarily following the recent accident it has also been taken due to the delivery time falling out-with the regulators set criteria. This is set at 15 minutes&#151;where the postman should not be delivering for longer than this to one door.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para6"><a name="stpa_191">Throughout its dialogue with me and the residents of Ardmore, Royal Mail has maintained that the 15-minute rule applies, irrespective of what might happen with regard to health and safety. However, when Postwatch looked into this matter, it found that that was not the case. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;Royal Mail had cited two reasons for ceasing deliveries to the above-mentioned addresses; health and safety, and delivery to the properties exceeds 15 minutes . . . The Direction states that in order for an address to qualify as an exception under the 15 minute rule it must be a single premise and be located on a private road or track and the track may be in poor condition . . . Therefore the 15 minute rule does not apply in this instance. The issue for Ardmore is therefore a single issue of Health and Safety.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 392WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para7"><a name="stpa_192">Therefore, my first question to the Minister is to ask him to confirm that that is indeed the case, and that we may set aside the 15-minute rule in respect of Ardmore.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para8"><a name="stpa_193">On the matter of health and safety, on 15 March a temporary postman slipped and fell. He reported the incident and also reported suffering bruising. The Lairg delivery manager, who has responsibility for the area, carried out a health and safety assessment and recommended the cessation of deliveries. At that time, I asked Royal Mail for a copy of the risk assessment, which it sent. It is clear from that assessment that it was written with the objective of achieving the desired conclusion, of which I give one example, rather than going through it line by line. The assessment states that by this stage of the route
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;you have been walking for 38 minutes and it is difficult to keep concentration as you are very tired.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para9"><a name="stpa_194">Earlier in the year, I actually walked the route. I am nowhere near as fit as I used to be and I indulge in too many cigars, but I managed to walk from start to finish in 27 minutes without breaking into a sweat. I suggest that that is the more proper time for completing the circuit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para10"><a name="stpa_195">What is perhaps more worrying is that when the residents obtained a copy of the health and safety assessment through the Freedom of Information Act 2000, which they were entitled to do, the copy that they received was substantially different from the original copy that I had received, as significant changes had been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para11"><a name="stpa_196">Postwatch has made it clear that it will not challenge Royal Mail&#039;s health and safety finding, as it correctly points out that it is Royal Mail&#039;s statutory duty to provide a safe working environment and Postwatch will not challenge its conclusion. However, its independent assessor also it made clear that it is the very last part of the walk, the steep part by the waterfall, that is of particular concern. I find it curious that a path that is considered safe by Highland council for a three-year-old and a five-year-old to walk to and from school every morning and evening, which is used throughout the year by thousands of visitors of all ages to access the adventure school, and which is used&#151;obviously&#151;by residents, and by tradesmen and other visitors, should be of such singular concern to Royal Mail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para12"><a name="stpa_197">There is a compromise that could be acceptable to the community, that the deliveries would be resumed to a point at the base of the waterfall where there is a fence. When I walked the path I was very pleasantly surprised, because there are a great many paths in the other part of my constituency, in Caithness, some of which even fall within my property, which are in nowhere near the same condition. The path is rather good and up to the fence it is reasonably level; it undulates rather than rising steeply. The community proposes that a post-box is placed at that point, which would be visible from their houses. The residents could then make the arduous ascent and descent to collect their mail. I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that Royal Mail considers that option and, I hope, accepts it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para13"><a name="stpa_198">In the words of the residents,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;mail deliveries are the survival artery of the business community here.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para14"><a name="stpa_199">The Scottish Executive&#039;s policy objective in Scotland&#151;I am sure that it is shared in Westminster&#151;is to encourage remote and fragile communities to survive, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 393WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
therefore diversification into the kinds of business that they have is vital. For their success in the modern era, it is vital that arteries such as the mail continue to enable them to survive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para15"><a name="stpa_200">I have always suspected that the decision was not really about health and safety, but far more to do with cost-cutting and with removing the costlier ends of the spectrum from the universal service obligation. I also suspect that the decision could be the first of many in my constituency and others like it in rural areas. We have heard a great deal during the last week about Royal Mail&#039;s profitability and its desire to become a viable and competitive business. I hope that that will not be achieved by shedding the more costly aspects of the universal service obligation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para16"><a name="stpa_201">Will the Minister commit today to a truly universal service obligation? Will he confirm that the 15-minute rule exception does not apply in this case? Will he confirm that a decision taken under the health and safety exemption is a temporary exemption and that it can and will be reviewed on a regular basis? Would he support the proposed compromise, which should go a long way to solving the perceived problems of delivery and would be&#151;if not entirely&#151;a satisfactory answer for the residents? Will he help a flourishing community in a remote part of Scotland to continue to flourish?

<a name="time_12">
<a name="51122h03_time1"><h5>12.36 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51122h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Barry Gardiner) </b> : I am tempted to begin by saying that we must stop meeting like this, Miss Widdecombe. I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship and all the more so because I know of your keen interest in the rural post service. I congratulate the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) on doing exactly what a constituency MP should do: representing the needs and concerns of his constituents in a matter that is exceedingly important to them. He has done that clearly and set out proper concerns about mail deliveries in his constituency. I hope that I shall be able to address all his points.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para17"><a name="stpa_202">It might be helpful if I begin by setting out the background to the restructuring of Royal Mail over the last four years, the universal service obligation, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and the framework for UK postal services. My right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, made two statements in the House in March 2002 and June 2002 following the announcements by Allan Leighton, the chairman of Royal Mail, then known as Consignia, about the company&#039;s three-year plan to restructure its postal services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para18"><a name="stpa_203">Nobody could have disputed that restructuring of Royal Mail was needed. The company was showing a pre-tax loss of &#163;1.2 billion in 2001&#150;02. Even allowing for exceptional costs from restructuring, there was still an underlying loss of &#163;318 million on day-to-day operations. The company was losing more than &#163;1 million every working day. The aim of the company&#039;s three-year renewal plan was to reduce costs by &#163;1.4 billion a year, wipe out these losses and return the business to profit by April 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para19"><a name="stpa_204">I am pleased to say that Royal Mail has returned to profitability and the management have got to grips with costs and reduced overheads. The latest figures 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 394WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
published last week for the half year to 30 September 2005 show that Royal Mail Group made an operating profit of &#163;159.3 million. These interim results show a 20.5 per cent. improvement on the previous year&#039;s figure. As hon. Members will have seen, that performance was tempered by the 1.2 per cent. fall in mail volumes and by the size of Royal Mail&#039;s pension deficit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para20"><a name="stpa_205">Nobody should underestimate Royal Mail&#039;s achievement. The chairman, board, management and particularly the work force should all be congratulated on their efforts to turn the company around. However, Royal Mail still faces a huge challenge to build on this success and secure long-term sustainable profitability in a liberalised postal services market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para21"><a name="stpa_206">It was unfortunate, although perhaps not surprising, that Royal Mail&#039;s quality of delivery dipped for a while during the implementation of the renewal plan. There was a lot of media interest and justifiable concerns were expressed by customers about the poor performance they were receiving. However, it was a period of great change for Royal Mail&#151;certainly the largest in its recent history and one with few parallels in British industry. Major changes were made simultaneously across Royal Mail&#039;s huge operational infrastructure&#151;transport, sorting and delivery. Allan Leighton and Adam Crozier, Royal Mail&#039;s chief executive, held up their hands and apologised for the dip in service. Both gave personal assurances to the Government that they would give quality of service top priority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para22"><a name="stpa_207">The quality-of-service figures for the first half of the year were published last week and they are very encouraging indeed. The delivery of first class stamped and metered mail stands at 93.9 per cent. and is thus running at record levels. That performance beats the newly increased target of 93 per cent. as well as any performance that Royal Mail has ever achieved in the past. In northern Scotland, the figures for the most recent period indicate that Royal Mail delivered more than 96 per cent. of first class letters the day after posting. Royal Mail believes that 11 of its 15 quality targets are achievable this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para23"><a name="stpa_208">We welcome those figures, which show a continued improvement in Royal Mail&#039;s quality of service results. Royal Mail and, in particular, the dedicated postmen and postwomen up and down the country, should be congratulated on their performance. However, the company recognises that it still needs to do a great deal. Market developments and changing customer needs continue to stimulate service improvement. Put simply, Royal Mail cannot take its customers for granted. Quality of service remains the board&#039;s top priority, because it cannot compete in a fully liberalised market if it does not get that right. The Government are confident that the company remains committed and determined to raise the quality of its service and that it will continue to focus special attention on those areas of the UK where local problems still undermine customer confidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para24"><a name="stpa_209">The Government believe that they have established the right framework for the postal services market and Royal Mail. We have given Royal Mail greater commercial freedom in the public sector, established independent regulation as required by the EU postal services directives, and strengthened consumer representation. That policy was clearly set out in the White Paper &quot;Post Office Reform: A World Class 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Service for the 21st Century&quot;, which was published in 1999 and implemented through the Postal Services Act 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para25"><a name="stpa_210">Underpinning the framework is the continued provision of the universal service at affordable prices. That is my first assurance in response to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. That is why the obligation is enshrined in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act&#151;the first time that any Government had done that&#151;and why Postcomm&#039;s only statutory duty is to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para26"><a name="stpa_211">The universal service as written into the law&#151;in section 4 in part I of the Postal Services Act&#151;guarantees the following: a delivery every working day to homes across the UK, a collection every working day from access points throughout the UK, and a uniform and affordable price for posting letters and parcels up to 2 kg. In layman&#039;s terms, the universal service means that anyone in the UK can post letters and parcels to any other part of the country at the same affordable rates. It guarantees one delivery of mail for every UK household and business six days a week and one collection of mail six days a week. The Government aim to ensure that all UK postal users have access to postal services that are efficient, innovative and responsive to their needs. As the only licensed universal service provider in the UK, Royal Mail has the universal service obligation written into its licence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para27"><a name="stpa_212">There are exceptions to the universal service daily delivery, but exceptions can be allowed only in very specific and restricted circumstances. The Postal Services Act states that the universal postal service is provided
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;except in such geographical conditions or other circumstances as the Commission&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para28"><a name="stpa_213">Postcomm&#151;&quot;considers to be exceptional&quot;. The reason for building that exception into the Postal Services Act is clear. The Act recognises that there are or will be some circumstances in which it may be impractical to deliver and collect mail daily. The responsibility for determining those circumstances was conferred on Postcomm as part of its overall responsibility for operating the regulatory regime. It has approached the issue with proper diligence and care with a view to balancing the needs of the customer and the service provider&#151;Royal Mail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para29"><a name="stpa_214">Following a wide-ranging consultation, Postcomm published a policy statement in January 2003, in which it explained the circumstances in which Royal Mail would be exempted from its licence requirement to deliver letters to all homes or premises every working day. The new direction specified two categories for long-term exceptions to the universal service daily delivery obligation: health and safety, and difficulty of access. Long-term exceptions apply to addresses on islands serviced by regular but not daily ferry or air services. In those instances, Royal Mail should provide deliveries on the days on which a ferry or air service is available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para30"><a name="stpa_215">Fewer than 1,100 addresses receive mail on fewer than 6 days a week, and three quarters of those are on islands without a daily ferry service. For the few islands and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 396WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
other locations accessible only by boat and without a ferry service, Royal Mail has to provide a postal delivery service not less than once a week, by boat, using local agents. Mail is available to pick up free of charge from the local delivery office on other days, for those customers who can get there. Customers are able to request a temporary suspension of the universal service&#151;for example, if they want delivery only on particular days of the week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para31"><a name="stpa_216">Royal Mail has a legal duty to protect the health and safety of its staff. Where that is put at risk&#151;because, for example, access to addresses is possible only across difficult terrain or over treacherous paths on mountainsides&#151;the addresses concerned will be considered for exemption from universal service on health and safety grounds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para32"><a name="stpa_217">Royal Mail cannot unilaterally decide not to fulfil its licence obligations on an ongoing basis. Any exceptions to the universal service obligation require authorisation from Postcomm. Postcomm has ensured that there is a four-stage formal process by which potential and ongoing exceptions are carefully scrutinised by the regulator. It involves the attention of the consumer watchdog, Postwatch. The first two stages of the process involve risk assessments carried out by Royal Mail. At stage 3, Postwatch, the Consumer Council for Postal Services, takes a view on the case for exception. At stage 4, Postcomm carries out its own evaluation of the site before making a final decision on the case. The process is rigorous and inclusive and it ensures that all exceptions are properly justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para33"><a name="stpa_218">Postcomm&#039;s exceptions policy is designed to ensure that the number of homes or premises exempt from delivery every working day is kept to a minimum. I understand that just over 3,000 addresses out of the 27 million in the UK&#151;about 0.011 per cent., or 1 in 9,000&#151;are exemptions from the universal obligation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para34"><a name="stpa_219">The hon. Gentleman has expressed his concerns about the situation facing some of his constituents on the peninsula. I understand that Postcomm has received &quot;stage four&quot; universal service obligation delivery exception appeals from the residents of the crofting township of Ardmore, and from Royal Mail
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para35"><a name="stpa_220">The Ardmore residents and Royal Mail have asked Postcomm to reach a final decision on the debate, following the company&#039;s decision based on health and safety reasons to suspend daily deliveries to Ardmore. Royal Mail is, as I have mentioned., required by law to provide a safe working environment for its employees. As part of the exceptions appeals process, it has carried out two health and safety risk assessments of the track conditions in the area. On both occasions, it found the track to be unsafe. Postwatch, the consumer watchdog, also came to this conclusion at stage three of the appeals process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para36"><a name="stpa_221">Postwatch subsequently proposed a compromise solution: the positioning of a mailbox halfway along the track that Royal Mail had been using to make deliveries, at a point before the track reaches its most dangerous point. Royal Mail has argued that on this occasion, the compromise solution does not eliminate the health and safety risk to its employees, as the delivery officer will still be required to walk along the first part of the track to deliver mail to the box. I understand that the residents&#039; appeal is based on a view that the track is not 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 397WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
so dangerous that their addresses should be exempted from the universal service obligation of delivery direct to their doors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para37"><a name="stpa_222">In accordance with the agreed process for determining appeals, Postcomm has arranged to visit the site at Ardmore. The visit is scheduled to take place on 1 December. The aim is to gain a first-hand account of the background to the appeals case and to take a view on the specific conditions affecting delivery. In line with its policy on determining USO exception appeal cases, Postcomm will be accompanied by an independent health and safety consultant who will be required to carry out a health and safety assessment of the access track used by Royal Mail to deliver to the properties in question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para38"><a name="stpa_223">In due course, the consultant will produce a report summarising the findings from the site visit and recommend what can be done to reduce any identified risks to an acceptable level so that Royal Mail can resume daily delivery. Postcomm will consider that independent health and safety advice and any other relevant facts before a fully informed decision can be taken on the future delivery of mail to these addresses. I am confident that the process that Postcomm has put in place is rigorous, inclusive and robust enough to produce the right decision.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51122h03_spnew1"><b> John Thurso </b> : I asked the Minister about the 15-minute rule exception. I am grateful for everything that he has said about the robustness of the processes, but will he say why Royal Mail maintained absolutely in an e-mail to me and throughout subsequent conservations between its authorities and the residents that the addresses were subject to the 15-minute rule, and why it sought to back off from that assertion only when Postwatch visited and ruled in its submission that the addresses were not subject to that rule? Is not that indicative of a desire to close the matter regardless of that submission?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51122h03_spnew2"><b> Barry Gardiner </b> : I shall talk about the 15-minute rule in a moment. First, let me respond by changing things around slightly. Postcomm, not the Royal Mail, designated the 15-minute rule and decided that there should be no limit on the additional road distance travelled by a postal delivery vehicle to reach an address over a public or a private road that is maintained in good condition. There is a round-trip limit of 15 minutes on the extra time that the Royal Mail must spend on delivering mail on foot or by the vehicle used for the delivery route along a private road or track where access conditions are poor but not so poor that they the address is excepted on health and safety grounds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51122h03_spnew3"><b> John Thurso </b> : My point is that the road is a public road. Until 20 years ago, the post was delivered by bicycle along the track. It is not quite up to bicycling standards now, but it is certainly up to walking standards.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51122h03_spnew4"><b> Barry Gardiner </b> : I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point. I was simply stating the conditions under which the 15-minute rule applies, while making the point that the 15-minute rule was designated by Postcomm, rather than by the Royal Mail as he implied. If the track is public&#151;he has told the House that it is&#151;the 15-minute rule as I 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 398WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
understand it clearly does not apply. I believe that Postcomm has conceded that already, but that the focus of stage four of its investigation is on health and safety. Those are the matters on which we should focus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para39"><a name="stpa_224">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether this was simply a cost-cutting exercise. I do not believe that a minor incident has been exaggerated so that costs can be cut in rural deliveries. Royal Mail has been working very hard to improve its safety record, and the number of accidents has decreased considerably in recent years. Most accidents that occur when someone is accessing customer premises do not result in a suspension of delivery, and cost is certainly not a consideration in assessing whether a situation is safe. The process put in place by Postcomm is robust enough to ensure that any exceptions are properly justified under its long-term categories.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para40"><a name="stpa_225">I am confident that this is not a case of people simply saying, &quot;Wouldn&#039;t it make life simpler and cheaper for us not to have to deliver to these rather remote addresses?&quot; Royal Mail delivers regularly to such addresses throughout the country and it is happy and proud to maintain the universal service obligation, so I do not believe that we are talking simply about a cost-cutting exercise. I am advised that the postman who suffered the accident was a mountaineer. I have not travelled the track as the hon. Gentleman has.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51122h03_spnew5"><b> John Thurso </b> : It might help the Minister to know what the craic, as they call it, is in Kinlochbervie. All the other postmen were issued with high-quality mountain boots to enable them to go along the track. The casual postman, who as the Minister says was a mountaineer, had not been issued with those boots. The view is that he reported the accident in the hope that he would be issued with a good set of boots.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51122h03_spnew6"><b> Barry Gardiner </b> : That is a good story and I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has relayed it to the House this morning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para41"><a name="stpa_226">The hon. Gentleman asked whether the health and safety exemption was temporary or permanent and put a question mark over any permanency. There may be points on which the health and safety exemption could be made permanent, but I imagine that the situation that we are discussing is remediable if the track is improved to such a level that it becomes safe for Post Office officials to walk it. Exceptions are, in any event, subject to annual review or an intermediate review at a customer&#039;s reasonable request, so the matter would always be open to reinspection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para42"><a name="stpa_227">I firmly believe that the Government have established the right framework not only for the postal services market and Royal Mail, but to deal with the problems that have arisen in the specific case that we are discussing. We have given Royal Mail greater commercial freedom in the public sector, established independent regulation as required by the EU postal services directive, and strengthened consumer representation. Postcomm&#039;s primary duty remains to ensure the provision of the universal service obligation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h03_para43"><a name="stpa_228">Adequate procedures are in place to examine exceptions to the universal postal service. They are being applied in the present case and are ongoing. It is not for the Government to become involved in decisions on

<br>&nbsp;<br>
deliveries to specific areas; that is, rightly, Postcomm&#039;s ultimate responsibility. I am confident that Postcomm is fulfilling its duty correctly in this instance and I hope that, after 1 December, when the final phase 4 inspection takes place, a satisfactory compromise can be agreed between the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents and Royal Mail. I congratulate him on raising his constituents&#039; concerns so effectively in the House today.

<a name="time_13">
<a name="51122h04_time0"><h5>12.59 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51122h04_spnew0"><b> Ed Balls  (Normanton)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity at this my first Adjournment debate to raise an issue that is of real importance to my constituents and to our district. It is about how we can boost levels of enterprise in Normanton and the Wakefield district, and help more young people to fulfil their dreams while making our economy stronger and fairer. I am also grateful to the Minister for agreeing to the debate. His commitment to the area was testified when he toured Yorkshire on 4 November to see our local progress in enterprise, skills and technology. He said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;It is evident that the Yorkshire and Humber region is breaking through in a number of important enterprise areas where others could follow.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para0"><a name="stpa_229">My right hon. Friend shares my belief, as do my hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett), that enterprise and skills are critical for the future economic success of not only my Normanton constituency, but the Wakefield district and Yorkshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para1"><a name="stpa_230">Last week was national enterprise week, a campaign backed by the Government as well as the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, chambers of commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, Business in the Community and the Prince&#039;s Trust, which organised 2,000 events throughout the country&#151;twice as many as the year before&#151;that involved young people in enterprise. It focused, in particular, on women&#039;s enterprise and social enterprise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para2"><a name="stpa_231">The make your mark campaign is about bringing together an unprecedented coalition of businesses, charities and education bodies to make enterprise a reality for young people aged 14 to 30. In my constituency, many school pupils and college students were involved in enterprise activities last week, not least at Wakefield college, where on Friday an enterprise fair was organised at which I was interviewed by music students from the college who were learning how to run their own radio station. The interview was tough, but fair.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para3"><a name="stpa_232">The Minister might ask why I chose this week to debate enterprise in the Wakefield district, when last week was national enterprise week. Last Friday, an important announcement was made that could have profound and historic implications for the district. The national enterprise campaign decided that, over the next two years, it will run and fund local enterprise campaigns throughout the country that can act as demonstration hubs of what can be done locally. It chose four areas for the hubs: Liverpool, Coventry, Lowestoft and, of particular importance to me and my colleagues, the Wakefield district.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para4"><a name="stpa_233">The national enterprise campaign plans to invest &#163;500,000 over the next two years in a local campaign to promote enterprise among young people. It will work with schools, local businesses, youth organisations, the local council and Members of Parliament. It will be based on the same principles that inspired the national campaign over the past few years&#151;to motivate young people, to inform them and to allow them to make connections, and to influence local bodies to come together and support them. The same will happen locally.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 401WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para5"><a name="stpa_234">The Minister might wonder why the Wakefield district has been chosen as the place to demonstrate to the rest of Britain how successfully a local enterprise campaign can be run. Our district has been chosen for three reasons. First, it has great economic potential. It is a great location in which the M1, the M62 and the A1 all intercept. It is truly the crossroads of Britain. We have a good industrial, mining and manufacturing tradition. There are many fine local companies, but new investors have also come into our district, such as Asda, Coca Cola, Next, Pioneer and Xscape, the second indoor ski centre in Britain. We have great skills and a hard-working work force. Over the past few years, unemployment has fallen below the national average as employment has risen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para6"><a name="stpa_235">At the same time, everyone in our district accepts that we have not yet taken proper advantage of our potential. Levels of adult skills in the work force lag behind the Yorkshire national averages. Too many young people still leave school at 16 without going to college, undertaking an apprenticeship or staying on in some form of education and therefore obtaining skills for the future. We have lower levels of business creation than other parts of the country. We have only 29 new businesses per 10,000 residents. In Yorkshire and Humber, the number is higher at 32 new businesses, while the United Kingdom average is 38. The highest number of start-ups in our region is 49, which is almost twice as many as in our area. Therefore, the second reason why our areas was chosen is that we have the potential to change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para7"><a name="stpa_236">The third reason is the determination in our district to turn around statistics and to take advantage of our location and potential, and for Wakefield to lead again in the economy of the future, just as the north of England and our district led industrialisation in the 19th century. In our district, we are determined that we should lead again in the new industrialisation of the 21st century, not only closing the north-south divide, but allowing Wakefield to catch up with and even surpass our neighbours. That is not just my view. A year ago, our local authority decided, in response to the northern way initiative, to set up what we call the Wakefield way, to work out how our district should respond economically to the regional and national challenges, and look, for example, at how we can tackle the numbers of people on incapacity benefit and boost skills in the adult work force, regenerate our town centres and boost levels of enterprise in our community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para8"><a name="stpa_237">We also have regional support. Yorkshire Forward, our regional development agency, is a member of the Wakefield way and has backed the local make your mark campaign. Many local businesses are actively involved. I have had commitments in the past week from a number of businesses, not least from Coca Cola, whose bottling plant in my constituency is the largest in the world, actively to engage in our local enterprise campaign and visit district schools, and many other companies are willing to do the same.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para9"><a name="stpa_238">We also have interest from schools, where head teachers are enthusiastic about the new opportunities that our make your mark campaign can bring, and from young people. To give one example of the commitment in our area to tackling these issues, only last week Connexions organised a careers fair for modern apprenticeships, which took place on a rather cold 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 402WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Thursday evening last week, and between 100 and 200 people were expected to attend. In fact, the queue looped round the streets of the Wakefield district as more than 500 people came to find out about apprenticeship options and see how they could take up those opportunities. There is a real desire among young people to engage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para10"><a name="stpa_239">Last week I visited Sheridan, a company in my constituency that was started in Leeds by two Normanton residents to make bespoke table tops and work surfaces for kitchens and bathrooms. Their company now employs more than 150 people and it is relocating from Leeds to Wakefield with a &#163;4 million new investment, because they decided that if they wanted the business to expand and grow, with the space to do so, an authority that would back them, and the available skills, it was better for them to come to Wakefield. That is another sign of local commitment to enterprise, the strengths of our area and also the strengths of young people who have made their mark and started businesses that are now flourishing in our district.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para11"><a name="stpa_240">Two weeks ago, in a local school, I met a young former pupil from Freeston school, who is now playing professional rugby at Warrington, and a 16-year-old from my constituency called Leeanne Newton, who, while studying for A-levels, is the number one in England at karate and the number three in the UK, with the potential to win a gold medal, if we can persuade the International Olympic Committee to allow karate at the 2012 Olympics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para12"><a name="stpa_241">As well as commitment from young people, we also have real commitment from the wider community. Our make your mark campaign is backed not just by the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i> and Ridings FM, our local radio station, but also the <i>Wakefield Express</i>, which is a high-selling local newspaper with some of the best regional business and enterprise coverage of any local newspaper that I have ever seen. So, we have a real commitment to make the initiative work. The national enterprise campaign was inspired by our potential, the gap and the ground that we need to make up, and also by the local commitment across the community to make it work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para13"><a name="stpa_242">I am sure that the Minister agrees that building an enterprise culture is critical if every young person in our district and throughout the country is to fulfil their dreams, whether they want to get an apprenticeship, go to university, write a film script, start a rock band or run their own business. If we in Wakefield could raise our game to the Yorkshire average, 1,500 new businesses would be created every year, and if we could raise that to meet the UK average, 3,000 more businesses would be created every year. Our target for the next few years  should be to raise our game to the Yorkshire and then the national levels. As well as encouraging more young people to start businesses, if we can find in our district the next Kaiser Chiefs, and make sure that they come not from Leeds but from Wakefield, we will be putting Wakefield on the map for culture, too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para14"><a name="stpa_243">I thank the Minister in advance for replying to this debate. Can he assure me and my colleagues that the Government will continue to support enterprise among young people, the national enterprise campaign and the four local campaigns over the next two years? Will he encourage our regional development agency to give strategic support to our area, so that we can fulfil our 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 403WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
potential, and the potential of our young people? Will he encourage his colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills to throw their full weight behind the initiative in order to boost enterprise and education in the curriculum? Also, will he encourage all schools to back the campaign, and in particular ensure that all teachers have the training and resources to back enterprise in the curriculum?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para15"><a name="stpa_244">Finally, will the Minister come and visit our district in the next two years to see how we are doing, to encourage us in our efforts to boost local investment and jobs, and to back us as we fulfil our ambition to make Wakefield district the enterprise capital of not only Yorkshire but Britain?
</p>

<a name="51122h04_time1"><h5>1.11 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51122h04_spnew1"><b> Jon Trickett  (Hemsworth)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) on securing this debate and on the role that he has played in encouraging enterprise, both as part of his present duties as a Member and in his previous role in the Exchequer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para16"><a name="stpa_245">If I may reflect on my own life for a moment, I left school with no qualifications; in fact, the head teacher said: &quot;Trickett, perhaps you shouldn&#039;t return for the exams, since you&#039;re clearly not going to be too successful.&quot; For a while, I wondered what to do, and eventually I joined my father and grandfather in the building industry. I became self-employed and ran a business for a number of years during the Conservative Administration. That was a time when small businesses such as mine suffered from a surfeit of regulation, but that is another story.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para17"><a name="stpa_246">Wherever I go in Wakefield&#151;I represent the south-east of the district&#151;I encounter people with similar life histories to mine. They have a dream and they have skills; all that they need is a little advice and support to realise their dream of running a small business that will perhaps one day grow into a larger one. We very much welcome the initiative and thank the Government for making it possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para18"><a name="stpa_247">I want to reflect on another aspect of enterprise. We can define enterprise as someone having a dream, and then making that dream happen. Wherever I go in the 22 small villages and towns that I represent, I encounter people who have a dream, and who, occasionally, are struggling to make it happen. I describe those people as social entrepreneurs. They tend to invent a whole series of mechanisms to achieve what they want. I will briefly describe some of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para19"><a name="stpa_248">In Upton there is a piece of land worth &#163;2 million. It belongs to the local parish council. If it can be developed, that money would be used to develop sports facilities for the local rugby club, but there is no mechanism to achieve that at the moment. In Moorthorpe, St. Luke&#039;s church has created a cr&#232;che providing care for very young children whose mothers need to go out to work. A small surplus generated from that was used to open a shop selling second-hand clothes to very poor people in the area. Ten per cent. of the profits from those two enterprises go immediately to Romania, of all places, to help women who have fallen into prostitution.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 404WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para20"><a name="stpa_249">In Featherstone, a range of local sports clubs have joined with the Featherstone Rovers in an attempt to build a sporting village. The village is badly in need of regeneration, and people there have very poor health. It would be wonderful to encourage sport and exercise, and to achieve our ambitions to create a healthier community. The facilities are very run down, but the land is there, as are the buildings, although they need investment. People of the area now understand that they need some sort of corporate vehicle in order to take their ambitions forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para21"><a name="stpa_250">In Hemsworth, there is the Spring Life group, a small, church, faith-based group. It has created a healthy living centre. Again, we are talking about an area of very poor health. That now employs one person. There are a number of volunteers working there, in a local shop right in the middle of Hemsworth. Again, some small employment is being achieved, which gives assistance to those living in hell as a result of the long-term effects of the mining industry, in which all the villages that I represent were involved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para22"><a name="stpa_251">All those and many other schemes have been started by people who are not motivated by profit, but want to create something in their community, having recognised a need. Another scheme was started in Fitzwilliam. Kinsley, a former pit site, was in a shocking state, with the land derelict and poisoned. Two women, Anne and Margaret, got together and found the money, which, through their initiative and entrepreneurial skills, they converted into a wonderful park. What those entrepreneurial people need most frequently is a corporate vehicle&#151;a not-for-profit company, co-operative or some other mechanism&#151;to help them to achieve their objectives. I hope that, as well as stimulating private entrepreneurs, we do not forget that our communities need social enterprises of that kind. If we are to define enterprise as having a dream and then making it happen, I hope that that kind of initiative will help all those people and many others.

I attended with him the launch of the make your mark campaign at Outwood Grange college last Friday and was really impressed by the young people and business representatives whom I met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para23"><a name="stpa_252">As part of national enterprise week, I followed my trip to my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency with a trip to Wakefield college, which had been showcasing young businesses all day. I was there last year too, before I became a Member of Parliament. Wakefield college is a centre of vocational excellence in enterprise, which gives the district a head start in creating an enterprise culture. However, I was disappointed this year, because I arrived just as all the stores had shut up and I was too late to do my Christmas shopping. My disappointment increased when I discovered that the start-ups that I had missed included a shoe company called Kitten Heels, which I thought sounded promising, a lingerie company and, best of all, a chocolate company. The lesson for all politicians is to make sure they get there on time and have a chance to spend some money with these new companies. I shall make sure that I arrive a little earlier next year.

<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 405WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para24"><a name="stpa_253">I am particularly glad that enterprise week is a national event, as there was clearly an exponential growth in the number of people attending this year. We need more entrepreneurship education, so that young people have a greater financial understanding, as well as the confidence and the aspirations to go out into the world and achieve their dreams. I believe that the make your mark campaign will go a long way to providing that education and creating a solid foundation. However, we must also address the gender gap and encourage young women to start their own businesses. A couple of months ago I led an Adjournment debate in this Chamber that looked at the difference in the numbers of men and women who start their own businesses. Young women have all sorts of extra barriers to doing so, such as child care responsibilities, very low incomes and lack of capital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para25"><a name="stpa_254">A number of projects in Wakefield help young women to start their own businesses. As my hon. Friend said, Yorkshire Forward has a women&#039;s enterprise strategy, and West Yorkshire Enterprise Agency Ltd. has a women&#039;s network that brings women together from across the county. I attended its monthly networking meeting in September and met some of the women business leaders who are putting our area on the map.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para26"><a name="stpa_255">To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett), Wakefield has several excellent social entrepreneurs. A new community centre in St. Swithun&#039;s at Eastmoor now has a healthy living centre and a cr&#232;che, which my son attends. There is also a new Denby Dale centre, which has been given by the mill owner, where community enterprises can start their businesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para27"><a name="stpa_256">In short, I would be keen to hear what plans my right hon. Friend the Minister has to address the gender gap in non-gender specific roles, and I wonder whether our education system can support social entrepreneurs and help young people to aspire and achieve their dreams.

<p>
<a name="51122h04_para29"><a name="stpa_258">I am extremely pleased that Wakefield was chosen as one of the first places in the United Kingdom to run a make your mark local enterprise campaign. I suspect that there are three reasons for that. The first is the partnership demonstrated today, with my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton being supported vigorously and knowledgably by his two colleagues. That makes clear their local leadership. Secondly, my hon.

<p>
<a name="51122h04_para30"><a name="stpa_259">I will do all that I can to support national enterprise week, and the expansion of those activities throughout the year. I have met people from Enterprise Insight on several occasions to try to ensure that we do as much as possible this year, and to throw the full weight of the Department of Trade and Industry behind enterprise week. My hon. Friend may be interested to know that we will have a manufacturing day next year, as well as the social enterprise and the women&#039;s enterprise days that took place this year. Manufacturing is still crucial to the economy, and it needs that specific focus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para31"><a name="stpa_260">I also agree with my hon. Friend on the importance of working in close co-operation with colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills. The money going into enterprise education is crucial, but one of the messages that I have been trying to put across to business leaders is the importance of them engaging with schools that are undertaking enterprise education. We do not want enterprise talked about; we want young people to get the feel and the smell of enterprise from those who have done the work of setting up their own businesses. In that way, they will understand the options before them. I am happy to promise to visit Wakefield to see how it is developing. There are some real challenges in the Yorkshire and Humberside area, and a variety of approaches is being taken in a number of towns and cities, which will be particularly interesting for us all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para32"><a name="stpa_261">My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield referred to a range of imaginative enterprises, and she rightly underlined the importance of women&#039;s enterprise. Were we to have the same proportion of women running businesses as the United States, we would have another 750,000 businesses. Think what contribution three quarters of a million more businesses could make to the economy. Promoting women&#039;s enterprise is not only a question of enterprise and economy; it is also a question of equality. I am pursuing the matter in conjunction with the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn), who is enthusiastically dealing with such issues in the DTI.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para33"><a name="stpa_262">I was pleased to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth refer to social enterprise. He spoke of having a dream and making it happen. People aspiring to live in a better society and making change in a business-like way is what underpins the community interest company that we launched recently. It makes it easier for people to become involved in real businesses&#151;ones that address the triple bottom line of achieving commercial, environmental and community value. That contribution to the economy should not be underestimated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para34"><a name="stpa_263">Promoting enterprise involves engendering a can-do approach to life and business. Specifically, the make your mark campaign gives Wakefield a unique opportunity to promote enterprise and to inspire its young people to turn their ideas into reality by launching businesses and community projects and by developing new ideas in existing organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para35"><a name="stpa_264">Wakefield is one of only four places in England that have been chosen for these intensive local campaigns. The others are Liverpool, which I visited recently, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Coventry and Lowestoft. Each has been chosen because senior local figures are willing to act as champions for the campaign. Moreover, key local and regional organisations are working in partnership to run the campaign. Importantly, each area has a sense of identity. Local people share a sense of place and community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para36"><a name="stpa_265">The aforementioned leadership is important, and Wakefield clearly has it. However, we must also promote activity in places where leadership is not so apparent. I look forward to working with my hon. Friends and others to promote ideas that spin out from what I hope will be considerable success in Wakefield. The make your mark campaign is the first business-led and Government-backed campaign of its type. It aims to kick-start an enterprise culture among the UK&#039;s young people, particularly those aged 14 to 30. The message at the heart of the campaign is that enterprise is about having ideas and ambitions, and about making those ideas and ambitions reality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para37"><a name="stpa_266">A coalition of business, charities, education bodies and Government supports the campaign to inspire young people to be enterprising, so that their ambitions can be expressed through business start-ups, through social and community enterprise and through becoming enterprising employees&#151;people who make their ideas happen at work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para38"><a name="stpa_267">I have always favoured promoting the culture of an enterprising public sector as much as promoting the culture of an enterprising private sector. I hope that I contributed a little to that through my youth and community work. Life can be exciting in the public sector as well as in the private and third sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para39"><a name="stpa_268">The local campaign will use a proven coalition-building and campaigning approach. To summarise, the local enterprise campaign will seek to lead a coalition of partners that inspires young people to connect to the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 408WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
enterprise agenda. The campaign will bring together businesses, including regional development agencies, business links, enterprise agencies, local government economic development units and others to support and act to inform people who have a genuine desire to advance their ideas. It is important to form local networks to connect young people. Those networks will encourage peer-to-peer engagement and personal development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para40"><a name="stpa_269">We should not underestimate the extent to which peer influence brings about change. Young people look to their peers and to their peers&#039; attitudes. The sky is the limit for a generation of young people who want to be enterprising. Enormous possibilities exist. It is also important to gather the necessary evidence in order to influence key players. We must lobby locally and nationally for resources to support what is essential work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para41"><a name="stpa_270">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton on forming such a strong group in Wakefield. It includes the council leader, Councillor Peter Box; the chief executive, John Foster; the deputy chief executive, Tony Reeves; the director of education, John McLeod; the director of regeneration, Jonathan Hall; and Yorkshire Forward&#039;s deputy chief executive, Tom Riordan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para42"><a name="stpa_271">As my hon. Friend said, enterprise week was a great success this year. I am very impressed by the range of activities that took place in Wakefield: Wakefield goes live for &quot;Children in Need&quot;; the Wakefield media challenge; and Wakefield enterprise goes live, which was a young people&#039;s enterprise radio station.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h04_para43"><a name="stpa_272">That is an impressive basis on which to continue with the campaign for which Wakefield has been chosen after winning the national enterprise challenge. The campaign will also form an important part of Yorkshire Forward&#039;s activity. We want the regional development agencies to drive the enterprise agencies&#151;

<a name="time_17">
<a name="51122h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51122h05_spnew0"><b> Simon Hughes  (North Southwark and Bermondsey)</b>  (LD): I am grateful for the opportunity to have a short debate on flooding in London. I thank the Minister for attending and for his continuing interest and expertise in these matters. I look forward to a response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para0"><a name="stpa_273">I have asked for the debate now because of three interconnected issues. First, in my borough&#151;although, as it happens, not in the part that I represent, but in Dulwich&#151;significant flooding was caused last year by the drainage system not being able to cope. That was in April, when severe thunderstorms happened periodically across the city. The local authority, together with Lambeth, the authority next door, has completed its investigation and made recommendations as to what might be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para1"><a name="stpa_274">Secondly, I represent a riparian constituency, which is nearly all extremely low lying. Indeed, almost nothing is above sea level and many homes and commercial properties in north Southwark and Bermondsey have below-river-level basements, living accommodation, cellars and storage places. There is general concern that we plan to ensure that the floods of yesteryear are not repeated in the years ahead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para2"><a name="stpa_275">Thirdly, a comprehensive study was undertaken by the London assembly and completed, as the Minister will know, a month ago. It was chaired by Darren Johnson with the participation of colleagues across the parties, including my colleague Mike Tuffrey, and has made some recommendations about what we should do for the future. It would be helpful to flag up what it suggested was the responsibility of the Government and of public agencies, and how there ought to be a response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para3"><a name="stpa_276">In the month that I was elected for the first time&#151;February 1983&#151;the Thames barrier opened for business. A year later, it was formally opened. I remember going to the event. It was an extremely cold day in what can be a fairly bleak bit of the Thames estuary in Woolwich. The Thames barrier has been a huge benefit to London. Ever since it opened, it has helped to prevent some of the flooding that we used to have in the part of London upstream of the barrier. Between Teddington lock, which I formally visited for the first time this summer, and the Thames barrier, there is a much greater sense of security than there used to be. Happily, the Thames Gateway has not been severely affected since the 1950s, when the whole of the east coast was severely affected by flooding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para4"><a name="stpa_277">The design and construction of the Thames barrier was based on projections up to 2030. Although it will be able to function after that, planning is now beginning to ensure that it will meet demands beyond that. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) submitted a written question not many months ago in which he asked the Secretary of State on how many occasions
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;the Thames Barrier has been closed in each year since its inception&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para5"><a name="stpa_278">it is obviously closed to deal with the tidal surges&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;and what estimate she has made of the number of occasions when it will be closed in (a) 2010, (b) 2020, (c) 2050 and (d) 2100.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16 June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 564W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 410WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para6"><a name="stpa_279">It traces a pattern, which we would have expected, that shows that the climate is changing and the water level is rising. We need protection more than we used to and will need it even more in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para7"><a name="stpa_280">To select figures from the answer, the barrier was closed for tidal reasons once in the year it started, in 1982&#150;83. A decade later, in 1993&#150;94, it was closed seven times. In the last year for which we have figures available, 2004&#150;05, it was closed three times. In 2000&#150;01, it was closed 24 times and in 2002&#150;03, 20 times. The Environment Agency expects 10 to 12 closures a year until the end of this decade, 20 to 35 by the end of the following decade, anything up to 75 closures a year by the half century and 325 a year by the end of the century. That is because, as the Minister will accept, the combination of climate change, heavy rains and rising sea levels causes the agency rightly to anticipate that it will be used much more.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para8"><a name="stpa_281">There is another consideration to add to the list of concerns, which includes local issues relating to the capacity of the current sewerage system infrastructure to take away surplus rain and other water, and the safety of areas upstream from the Thames barrier. We must consider how we will cope with the projected house building and development in the Thames Gateway. Although it is welcome, it which needs to be done in a way that gives people security.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para9"><a name="stpa_282">When preparing for the debate, I noted that the Association of British Insurers estimates that the further investment in defences that will be needed for the whole of greater London is between &#163;4 billion and &#163;6 billion over the next 20 years&#151;if development is allowed north and south of the river in the boroughs along the Thames in east London&#151;if we are to do what Government planning, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and others want done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para10"><a name="stpa_283">I received an unsolicited but helpful note from the London borough of Barking and Dagenham. I am conscious that the riparian boroughs consider and plan for these things, and that they are on the case&#151;as they should be. I hope that it is appropriate to get some of the planning work out into the open. Will the Minister do that in his reply?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para11"><a name="stpa_284">I shall address the considerations that I listed in turn, starting with the lack of capacity in the sewerage or drainage system. Occasionally, we in London see how much pressure the system is put under when there is heavy or continuous rain. What does the Minister consider to be the ability of the responsible authority&#151;Thames Water, under the regulation of Ofwat&#151;to respond to the need for significant investment in drainage in London? Thames Water says that if it is to do that, it needs much more than Ofwat will allow it to raise. The Minister and I know that there is perfectly reasonable consumer pressure from our electors, who do not want their water bills to go through the roof, so there will always be tension between the water companies, which say, &quot;Give us the money and we can do the work; we can make the drains work,&quot; and the regulator, which says that that is unreasonable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para12"><a name="stpa_285">Some parts of the drainage and sewerage system are old, and there is sometimes feedback of sewage into the Thames when there is flooding. That is highly undesirable. I do not detect any particularly political debate on that, and there is a general desire to get the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 411WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
infrastructure in place as soon as is practicably possible, so that there is capacity around the London boroughs to process normal or frequent heavy rainfall without a significant number of homes being flooded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para13"><a name="stpa_286">The number of homes flooded as a result of the flash floods in Southwark in April 2004 was just short of 1,000, and there was considerable inconvenience and cost to those concerned. That could happen anywhere. It happened to be there on that occasion, but Dulwich is not the most low-lying part of the city. It would help if the Minister said where the Government envisage their role to be in working with the water industry and regulator to ensure that the capital city functions well in terms of its capacity to deal with flooding. I know that local authorities such as mine would be happy to collaborate with him and his officials in future, as they have in the past.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para14"><a name="stpa_287">By and large, people are happy to accept the reassurance that, barring the entirely unexpected, the area between Teddington lock and the Thames barrier should be safe from flooding. It would help if the Minister confirmed that and told us what is being done by his Department, the Environment Agency and the ODPM to deal with the small areas of the river bank where defences are weaker and need to be replaced. They are often perceived as crisis points, at which there is a confluence of small rivers coming into the Thames and with the Thames itself. It would also help to know that where there has been significant additional building on what used to be wharves&#151;they became empty and are now residential homes, businesses and offices on the Thameside&#151;those boroughs will be secure and people will know that they can plan ahead. That is the second issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para15"><a name="stpa_288">On the Environment Agency&#039;s helpful website, on which people can type in their postcode to see what the flooding risks are, there is a map of London, showing where the risks are and fanning out as one looks downstream. I thank the agency for proactively and informatively trying to ensure that the public are informed. In the north of boroughs such as mine, we are, in theory, at risk. The Minister&#039;s assessment and analysis of what can be done, will be done and, with the Environment Agency, is planned to be done, would be helpful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para16"><a name="stpa_289">The third issue is the big one. If London is to expand as the Government anticipate it will, if there is to be the additional population for which the Mayor of London is planning, and if there are to be the additional homes that we need&#151;we need a significant number of extra homes&#151;it would be helpful to hear what the Government think about the policy for ensuring that development is reconciled with pressures on the land. I understand that some sensible strategies have been accepted and proposed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para17"><a name="stpa_290">I should like to put on the record the relevant recommendations from the London assembly investigation, which, having finished just a month ago, was timely. I understand that 120,000 new homes and 250,000 new jobs are proposed in the Thames Gateway. I am told that the evidence to its committee stated that 5 per cent. of defences were in a poor or very poor condition. That is not a huge amount, but it is significant 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 412WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and the defences must be dealt with. Some 1.25 million people are in the area and, were things to go wrong, they could be adversely affected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para18"><a name="stpa_291">The London Climate Change Partnership made the following projections for our changing weather during the next 70 years: winters will become wetter by up to 30 per cent.; heavy winter rainfall will occur twice as frequently; the number of storms each winter crossing the UK could increase from five to eight; relative sea level in the Thames estuary will continue to rise, reaching between 26 cm and 86 cm by the 2080s, with extreme sea levels experienced more frequently; and, finally, without flood defences, 15 per cent. of London&#039;s homes will suffer a 0.1 per cent. chance of tidal flooding each year. It is only 0.1 per cent., but it is significant, and that percentage will increase as the sea level rises.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para19"><a name="stpa_292">Those are the pan-London figures, and the committee made the following recommendations. First, it recommended that the Government, the Minister&#039;s Department and the Environment Agency work out the funding mechanisms to ensure that the Thames estuary 2100 project, which will take safety beyond 2030 to the end of the century, is secure, can go ahead and can be planned with collaboration from other public authorities. It is early days, but I know that the project is in the sights of the Department and of London&#039;s government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para20"><a name="stpa_293">The second recommendation was that not only the tidal defences, but the other defences along the river are surveyed so that the survey is complete and up to date. The proposal is to complete it by the end of next year, so that any necessary work can be done in the few years after that. It would help if the Minister said whether the Government see themselves having any indirect or direct or role in that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para21"><a name="stpa_294">Thirdly, are the Government&#039;s strategic plans for housing in the Thames Gateway going to leave up to 40 per cent. of the land undeveloped to provide the capacity with which to take up any flooding or water need? One way to deal with the pressures of the build is to leave a lot of open space with the capacity to soak up any flooding. It would be reassuring to know that the Minister&#039;s Department was fully engaged with those plans so that we did not overdevelop. Overdevelopment would mean that many people who might have been encouraged to go to that part of the world will not or might not go, having been told by their insurers that it is a bad risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para22"><a name="stpa_295">Fourthly, what are we doing to ensure that the new and old infrastructure of our roadways can cope? I am no engineer, but I understand that the surface of the road determines its effectiveness. The assembly committee recommended involving Departments, as well as others, to ensure that we have roadways that reduce surface water and serious flooding. Fifthly, are there proposed changes to the planning guidance to ensure that we build in the right place and in the right way, and that we do not over-pressurise the natural capacity of the river and the river defences to do their job properly, particularly along the Thames Gateway, but and also further upstream?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para23"><a name="stpa_296">Lastly, how do Ministers plan to respond if anything untoward happens? Obviously, the principal responsibility in London lies with London government, but the central Government have rightfully asked 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 413WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
whether they can assist in Carlisle, in Yorkshire and in other parts of the country, as we have seen. We would all rather not have to ask them to assist after the event. We would prefer people to say, &quot;Thank goodness everything was in place and we were all secure.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para24"><a name="stpa_297">I do not mean to suggest that there is huge alarm and panic; quite the contrary. I want this to be an opportunity for the Minister to assure people that things are in hand, that we are learning from past mistakes and experience, and that plans are in place, whether at borough level, at London level or at Government level, to ensure that London is as safe from flooding in the next 25 years as we have been in the 25 years since the Thames barrier was built.
</p>


<a name="time_18">
<a name="51122h05_time1"><h5>1.47 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51122h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment  (Mr. Elliot Morley) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) on his comprehensive little run-around on London&#039;s potential flood risks. There is no doubt that any major city with a tidal river and several waterways running into it is at risk. The Government&#039;s job is to work with local authorities and the Environment Agency to find ways of reducing that risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para25"><a name="stpa_298">I am happy to address the points made by the hon. Gentleman, because London and the Thames estuary is generally very well protected. Most of the area is protected up to a standard of 1 in 2,000 years. A standard of 1 in 1,000 is very common in the gateway area, which is a pretty good level of protection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para26"><a name="stpa_299">The hon. Gentleman talked about non-fluvial flooding, which is flooding from drains and sewers, and that is a big issue. In the major floods of 2000, about 40 per cent. of properties were flooded from non-river sources such as blocked drains and sewers. We identified that issue in our policy paper &quot;Making space for water&quot;, which examines all forms of flooding so that we can consider the matter holistically, recognising that flooding comes from several sources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para27"><a name="stpa_300">As part of the &quot;Making space for water&quot; initiative, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will pilot integrated urban drainage partnerships in 2006&#150;07 and publish its recommendations in 2008. We are trying to give the Environment Agency a much more strategic overview of all sources of flooding, and have allocated &#163;2.1 million to those pilots. Several local authorities have expressed an interest in being part of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para28"><a name="stpa_301">We also continue to promote the use of sustainable urban drainage systems where appropriate. We have developed an action plan to resolve any barriers to uptake. We are also working to improve the uptake of resilience and resistance measures so that households and businesses are better able to protect themselves from the effects of a flood.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para29"><a name="stpa_302">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the development of the Thames Gateway and the use of green space. I confirm that the green settlements will include green space, which will have the benefit of providing recreational areas, but can also be used for sustainable urban drainage. So there could be a number of uses, which are being addressed in the plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para30"><a name="stpa_303">It is also true that there has been discussion on the design of roadways, so that they can be used to channel water away in the event of a flood event or an extreme 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>22 Nov 2005 : Column 414WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
downpour. I do not know how far that has been taken in the Thames Gateway, but I can confirm that it is a consideration. Also, the flood risk maps are important in providing information for people and have been well utilised through the Environment Agency website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para31"><a name="stpa_304">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the state of river flood defences between Teddington lock and the Thames Gateway. Again, they are generally to a high standard. The Environment Agency is carrying out a survey of all flood defence assets, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Incidentally, the idea is that the survey is designed to look at all flood assets because not all flood defences are in the ownership of public authorities or the Environment Agency. There are privately owned flood defences; it is useful to know that, and to know their condition. If there are weaknesses within the flood defence network, they will be need to be addressed. That, as the hon. Gentleman says, is under way, and I am quite confident that the Environment Agency will deal with it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para32"><a name="stpa_305">As I was saying to the hon. Gentleman, we recognise that we have no room for complacency on any area in managing flood risk. Although standards are high in London, we need to ensure that they are up to date, properly maintained and fit for purpose. In terms of London&#039;s defences, apart from the well-known Thames barrier, there are 12 other major barriers, 36 industrial flood gates and over 330 km of tidal walls and embankments protecting the estimated 1.25 million people working and living in the tidal floodplain. The Thames barrier, and associated defences, provide London and most of the Thames estuary with a flood defence standard of one in 2,000 years, which is a high standard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para33"><a name="stpa_306">In addition, flood risk is being taken into account much more in the development of local and regional plans. For example, the London Development Agency is currently completing a strategic flood risk assessment for the lower Lea regeneration area. That includes taking into account the point that the hon. Gentleman rightly made&#151;the increasing risk of climate change and its implications for more extreme weather events, and more winter rain. That is part of the modelling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para34"><a name="stpa_307">The 2030 issue is mentioned repeatedly with regard to the Thames barrier. Some people almost think that it will disappear in a puff of smoke in 2030. That may not be what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but some people are getting a bit carried away, saying, &quot;Oh, it reaches the end of its life in 2030.&quot; Well, it does not. When it was originally built, the projections in sea level rises went up to 2030, so that post-2030 it may move from a standard of, for example, 1 in 2,000 years to 1 in 1,900. There is rising sea level in the east&#151;as you will be aware, Miss Widdecombe, since it affects your own constituency. To compound further that rising sea level, south-east England is slowly sinking as the country tilts geologically. That, too, has to be taken into account&#151;I believe it contributes about 2 mm of the projected sea level rise&#151;but the Thames barrier has a considerable life yet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51122h05_para35"><a name="stpa_308">What might need to be done in order to raise the efficiency of the Thames barrier would actually be to raise the outer London flood walls and flood embankment. That is taken into account in longer-term planning. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Thames Estuary 2100. The Environment Agency is developing a

major flood risk management strategy to address how we can protect London over the next 100 years. We are trying to look ahead at the long-term implications. That study will examine the options and their technical, economic, environmental and social implications. TE2100 will also look at options for the Thames barrier. Barrier closures are increasing&#151;as a consequence of rising sea levels, as anticipated by the Environment Agency&#151;and the barrier can easily accommodate the predicted closure frequency for 2030.

<a name="51122h05_para36"><a name="stpa_309">This is an important and welcome study. It will be vital for informing our long-term plans for London and the Thames estuary. Taking steps now to identify future needs means we are less likely to be storing up trouble for the future. TE2100 will look at long-term flood management needs, but all decisions on planning, development and regeneration cannot await the outcomes of that project.

<a name="51122h05_para37"><a name="stpa_310">Development on the flood plain cannot be avoided completely. In many cases, there are compelling social and economic reasons for development to continue in such areas; that can prevent blighting areas. However, we must also make sure that flood risk is properly managed. For development to be sustainable, it must avoid flood risk where possible.

<a name="51122h05_para38"><a name="stpa_311">In that respect, Government planning policy statement 25 is being updated. It will give guidance to planning authorities about developments in flood plains. In some cases, it will be appropriate to reject planning applications because of flood risk. In other cases, it might be possible to accept them, but on the basis of a contribution being made by the developer in respect of mitigation not only for the development, but for implications for other existing development in the area. Most importantly, PPS25 proposes as part of the current consultation that if the advice of the

Environment Agency is ignored by the planners&#151;which I am glad to say happens in very few cases these days, but it does happen&#151;it can ask the appropriate Minister to call in the application so that it can be properly examined. That is an important sanction.

<a name="51122h05_para39"><a name="stpa_312">The hon. Gentleman asked about the condition of sewerage. As part of the recent price review, the regulator made available to all the UK water and sewerage companies an additional &#163;1 billion, to address sewer flooding. I do not know offhand what proportion of that was included in the Thames Water business plan, but I am sure that it has bid for a proportion of it to upgrade its sewers. I also know that its business plan includes upgrades for the three main sewage treatment plants in London to deal in particular with storm surges. That might not, in itself, tackle all the issues of drain and sewer flooding, but it will certainly help in a number of respects, not least in relation to storm discharges into the Thames. I welcome that investment.

<a name="51122h05_para40"><a name="stpa_313">The hon. Gentleman identified a range of serious issues that need to be addressed. The last one, which I did not mention, is resilience and contingency. We have contingency plans, which are regularly tested. There was a major recent test called Operation Triton. It was a desktop exercise involving breaches in the outer London defences&#151;we did not actually dig the breaches in the defences. Its purpose was to test the responses of local authorities. The London resilience committees and sub-committees also deal with such major situations.

<p>
<a name="51122h05_para41"><a name="stpa_314">The defences are in good condition, and they are of a very high standard, but we do not take these matters lightly. We plan for the future. We are looking ahead for the next 100 years, and, given the importance of London and the need to protect lives and properties, people can have confidence that the necessary investment and commitment will be made.
