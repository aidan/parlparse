 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I hope that we do not cause you too much stress and discomfort over the next hour and a half. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to introduce this debate on digital switchover and particularly grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing me to do so. I also welcome the Minister to her new role within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I appreciate that broadcasting is the responsibility of her soon-to-be noble Friend Lord Carter, but we all look forward to hearing her comments and answers at the end of the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000011">I sought this debate because switchover is very important to my constituency, where, in three weeks, we will see the first stage of switchover when analogue BBC 2 is switched off and moved across to the digital platform exclusively. That will be followed a fortnight later, on 20 November, by all the remaining stations. Over the past three years, since the timetable was published, we in the borders have been getting ready for this, particularly in the Selkirk transmitter area, which serves my constituency. Over that time I have chaired eight different meetings of the borders digital forum, which has brought together community activists and representatives, voluntary groups, broadcasting professionals and many others with an interest, direct or indirect, to ensure that we are on top of the issues and communicating our concerns to those with responsibility for ensuring that switchover is a success. In a couple of weeks I also look forward to welcoming the Secretary of State to the borders, when he comes to see for himself the preparations that are nearly complete.</p>

We have since come a very long way from that technological marvel&#151;whether it was moving from black and white to colour televisions, seeing the proliferation of new channels, or learning the different ways in which we can now record programmes or pause them and continue watching afterwards. It is unrecognisable from the service that started all those years ago. Switchover will be another giant step forward and a very welcome development. It will bring together a great many technological advances, provide much more choice&#151;I shall return to that theme&#151;and be compulsory, which makes it different from many previous developments. It is compulsory because of the intention to free up the analogue spectrum to allow it to be used for other purposes&#151;another theme to which I shall return.</p>

Kingdom to transfer: constituents of the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr. Reed) in Whitehaven were the first to do so, last November. However, the digital switchover taking place in the Selkirk transmitter area in a few weeks represents a significant step change, covering a very large rural area involving more than 100,000 people and a number of transmitters. Whitehaven has just one transmitter, which was converted in a matter of minutes, but we have one main transmitter and 11 relay transmitters, so it will take the best part of a day on each occasion to manage the switchover. That represents a change in scale, and it matters that we get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000014">None of my constituents has complained about the fact that we are right at the front of the queue. Occasionally they have asked why they in particular have been chosen, but we recognise that before certain geographical issues associated with the sorting out of frequencies across Europe are addressed, it is easiest to deal with the borders, because that will interfere least with neighbouring countries. Equally, it is fair to say that most people recognise that there are fewer people in the borders than in many other places, so it is perhaps easier to do a little testing and experimentation. That has led to the guiding philosophy of the digital forums and other local activities: we are happy to be first, but we want to be the pioneers who get it right, not the guinea pigs from whose poor experiences other people learn.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman describes this as an exciting project; he says that various groups in his constituency are engaged in discussions and that 100,000 people will see an improvement with the changeover to digital. However, does he agree that among those 100,000 people will be large numbers of blind, partially sighted and disabled people who will be desperate for the available talking menus and programme guides? Does he think that it is important that that figures very greatly in any of the provisions for switchover? On today&#146;s Order Paper is mention of a statement by the Secretary of State on the digital switchover help programme. Perhaps we will have some more news about how we can help those who are partially sighted and blind so that they can better enjoy the programmes.</p>

 I pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman who has long campaigned on these issues, and I certainly endorse what he seeks to achieve. I hope that the Minister has information that she can share with us this morning and that more information will be made available in due course in the Vote Office. Those with sight difficulties and visual impairments need every help possible to make the experience of enjoying the available broadcasting facilities as good as possible. Surely one of the key features of the new technological era in which we live is the ability to package up many of the points that he raises. I hope therefore that she will also support the thrust of his comments.</p>

I shall also address some of the shortcomings in Freeview, which is the main platform for switchover, and to consider the impact of the process on ITV, and in particular its regional programming and news. Furthermore, I shall set down some markers on what I think that says about broadcasting policy, particularly for rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000018">On a practical level&#151;on the ground in the south of Scotland&#151;Digital UK has been working flat out for some time. It has run a very intensive campaign to raise awareness, which has been supplemented by a lot of fieldwork by key local people to ensure that residents are as ready as possible for switchover. Indeed, one cannot drive through Hawick, Galashiels or Kelso in my constituency without seeing the large pink banners with &#147;Digital&#148; emblazoned all over them, along with a warning that switchover is coming. I have no doubt about general awareness, and I am sure that the Minister will produce a raft of the latest statistics to re-emphasise that point. My concern is more about detailed awareness and the need to help people with some of the technical problems that they will face at the beginning&#151;when their screens go blank or they get a caption saying, &#147;This programme will cease to transmit in a matter of days&#148;, which will be someone&#146;s final warning if they have not done much up to that point.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="08101444000019"><a name="81014h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="08101444000472"><b>Mark Williams (Ceredigion) (LD):</b>
 In his history of television, my hon. Friend mentioned the flickering screens of the past, but in many of the most geographically challenging areas, such as those that he and I represent, flickering screens remain very much a reality. There is still concern that while a sort of picture is still received under the analogue system, there will be no picture at all after the digital switchover. What support should be given to help people in those areas to access Freesat? Should the Government give financial help to access services through Freesat in those geographically challenging areas where people are fearful,? Has that idea been a feature of the consultation in the south of Scotland?</p>

 The so-called digital one and a half&#151;the 1.5 per cent. of the population who will not get any kind of Freeview picture&#151;are an important part of the equation. About the same percentage of the population does not get an analogue picture at the moment. There is a group on the cusp who get some kind of picture, but under the more brutal broadcasting regime of a digital system, either people will get a picture or they will not. There will be no halfway house, so those people will be anxious about what goes on. I am worried about how many such people will be in my constituency and my hon. Friend&#146;s, because there is no easy way of predicting that. I certainly hope that the Minister will give an assurance that that group will be considered carefully. If the number turns out to be much bigger than her Department and Digital UK have been predicting, will she urgently consider supporting those people? They should not be marginalised during this process.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for securing the debate. I see him as a pioneer rather than a guinea pig, because I am next in line after him. I hope that anything that he experiences will be a lesson for future stages of the process. Has Digital UK given him any indication or commitment that it will have enough people available to help, on the ground, during the two or three-week periods when all this will be happening?</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="08101444000025"><a name="81014h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="08101444000475"><b>Mr. Moore:</b>
 No specific numbers have been mentioned to me, but I have been given countless assurances that plenty of people will be available either on helplines or in situ in the borders. Certainly, plenty of people have been coming and going during the past few months; let us hope that they are all in position on the day itself. My parliamentary office in the constituency is slightly nervous about what might happen if problems emerge at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08101444000026">As I have said, Digital UK has been ever present. It has attended every digital forum that we have had, as well as countless meetings. I thoroughly respect its team on the ground, particularly John Askew, who has played a blinder and has covered countless miles in the past few months. As soon as he finishes at the Selkirk transmitter, he has to head off and deal with the constituency of the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) and ensure that it is properly looked after as well. I have pushed those people all the way, and they must have been a little irritated at times by all the things that I have been trying to get them to do. However, I respect the fact that they have so far responded to everything that people have asked of them, and I hope that that will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000027">The help scheme that the hon. Gentleman mentioned is the next stage of the process, although the jury is still out on whether the scheme will be a success. I tabled a parliamentary question during the recess about the number of people in my constituency who are eligible for the scheme and take-up thus far. In the middle of September&#151;I acknowledge that that was a few weeks ago&#151;less than 10 per cent. of nearly 18,000 eligible people had taken up the scheme. I do not think that people are fully aware of the scheme yet. That could be because people have already prepared themselves or because of confusion, but there is certainly confusion about who is running the help scheme. That is one thing that will need to be reviewed at the end of the process. Many people have been involved along the way&#151;from the BBC having overall responsibility, to the subcontracting to Eaga, to the awarding of the prime contract to Sky, which took everyone by surprise. Many of my constituents have experienced confusion, and we must tackle that problem in other areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000028">The fact that the help scheme has been so narrowly drawn has meant that Digital UK and others have had to rush in to fill a gap for those who are older but   <br>

under 75, and those who perhaps do not qualify for some of the relevant disability benefits but still need assistance. I welcome the fact that Digital UK has done that. The Bridge, a group in my constituency that co-ordinates local voluntary organisations, has taken a leading role in that on a very modest budget. I hope that Ministers and their officials will reconsider carefully the adequacy of the scheme. As is so often typical of the way that government is run these days, much is presumed of the voluntary sector. I know that many people in my constituency have spent many hours of their time going out to groups and trying to get to the hard-to-reach individuals who are among the most vulnerable. We do not know yet how successful that has been, but it will need urgent and quick review after the process is complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000029">I highlight in particular Elder Voice, a group in my constituency that was set up to look after the interests of older people. That brilliant advocacy group, which deals with a whole range of issues, has gone out to take the message to all the different communities across the south of Scotland. As part of that, it recently held a forum in Newcastleton, bringing in huge numbers of people with lots of questions about switchover. That experience makes me think that specific awareness about some switchover details is not as high as we would like. No doubt the Minister will remind us that there is no shortage of help, but some problems regarding the organisation and co-ordination of that help and how it is resourced have still to be adequately addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000030">As I have said, the adequacy of Freeview is one of the issues that concern me most, as it will go beyond the switchover date. A constant theme of switchover has been the idea that we will all enjoy increased choice, and that is correct&#151;whatever platform they use, everyone will get more TV channels to watch. However, the system is fundamentally flawed, because not everyone will get the same deal, particularly those using the most common form of reception&#151;getting TV through their aerial. Ofcom recently published some research that it had done that highlighted the fact that in my constituency&#151;indeed, across the Border Television region as a whole&#151;as little as 55 per cent. of the population will receive the full Freeview service. That is way below the figure in any other part of the country. It is expected to increase to about two thirds, but even that figure is substantially short of that in just about any other part of the country. The problem arises because we rely on so many relay transmitters&#151;the 11 that I mentioned earlier&#151;reflecting the wonderful topography of my constituency: the hills get in the way of the signal, which then needs to be boosted by relays. However, I do not think that my constituents, just because they have the good fortune to live in a beautiful part of the country, should have the misfortune of being denied the choice and range of television channels that others in this country will receive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000031">As anyone who already has digital will know, there is a range of channels&#151;about 40&#151;that changes week by week. Frankly, the Freeview setup is a complete mess: there is broadcasting anarchy, where one cannot work out the sequence in which BBC or ITV channels, or any other channels, will come. If regulation and national intervention is the Government&#146;s new mantra, perhaps they might want to look again at how Freeview organises itself so that the poor consumer can understand it a little better.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. The central region, in which my constituency is situated, will be switched over in the first full year of  the fourth Labour Administration in 2011. His point about topography is particularly relevant to the area I  represent, as we are the westernmost constituency of the east midlands. Because of the topography, parts of my constituency, despite being in the east midlands, are unable to receive the signal for east midlands regional TV from Waltham-on-the-Wolds, but instead receive the signal from the west midlands transmitter at Lichfield. Does the hon. Gentleman hope, as I do, that the Minister will be able to encourage the authorities to piggy-back east midlands regional programmes on the back of the west midlands signal, as we now hear more about the undoubtedly fine places of West Bromwich, Aldridge and Coventry than we do about our own communities of Whitwick, Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Coalville. That is a problem in parts of England, as I am sure it is in parts of Scotland also.</p>

 I might not share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s confidence about that fourth Labour term, but I share his concerns about the impact that the new form of transmission will have on smaller communities such as mine. He has given the <i>Hansard</i> reporters a nice little challenge with the different communities he mentioned. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000034">Although the technology exists to get around all those problems, my worry is that the Government have thus far let the broadcasting industry off the hook. We have a two-tier service. I was rebuked by Digital UK when I started referring to a two-tier service some years ago&#151;I was told that it prefers the term &#147;Freeview Lite&#148;. I said that I was happy to call it &#147;Freeview Lite&#148; too, but they are now irritated by that and claim that such a name suggests that it is not the full service. However, it is not. There has never been a good reason for that, other than the fact that the commercial broadcasters have been let off the hook and are not obliged to put their multiplexes in all of the relay transmitters. I have not yet been given a costing for doing that, so perhaps the Minister could share with us today how much it would cost the broadcasters to put their bits of kit in all of the relay transmitters. What sum are we talking about? With that information, we could start to debate the public policy questions about who should fund it. For now, it looks like we will end up in a position where only part of Britain will get everything and large parts in rural areas will receive a much reduced service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000035">Currently, the case could be made that some of those extra services are not exactly wonderful television, but top-up television&#151;Setanta Sports, which has been controversial for other reasons recently&#151;and many of the other channels that are held at the moment for ITV or Channel 4 for their more peripheral services, although I am sure that they will not like me using that term, are in that extra segment of transmission. I simply do not understand why people in rural Britain should be excluded and why that should have been allowed to happen.</p>

of other things that are important. I was absolutely appalled by that attitude and hope that the Minister will distance herself from it. I hope that, regardless of our political positions and parties, her Government remain a Government for the whole UK and not only urban Britain. This will be an important test of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000037">Choice is one of the key themes of the digital switchover, as I have already mentioned, but choice also has to be about diversity. We have been told how much more we will have to enjoy, but at the same time ITV is predicting meltdown and suggesting that the public service broadcasting licence requirements are perhaps too onerous and that it might just give up the licences in due course. I have not seen ITV offering to give up position three on any of the different channel guides or anything that goes with that, so perhaps there is an element of bluff to be called in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="81014h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000038">However, we can see ITV&#146;s intent, and without diminishing or underplaying the serious economic challenges facing it, we have seen in the past few weeks the latest announcement about what it plans for regional news and programming. In the Border Television region, those plans amount to broadcasting vandalism, and what Jim Graham and Paddy Merrall put in place over decades on behalf of Border Television is to be swept aside. Michael Grade met with MPs from across the Border Television region a year ago and has agreed to come back to discuss the detailed proposals with us, so I hope that there is still a chance that those in charge at ITV will change their minds.</p>

It was a bit of a threadbare system, but it worked, and it meant that the communities that I represent were regularly featured on television and that local news was relevant to them. Since that cameraman retired, coverage of my constituency and those neighbouring it has declined. There are no two ways about it. There has been no replacement reporter.</p>

and am sure that he will contribute hugely to the House. On the point that he has just made, I agree that it goes to the heart of the process of switchover and the consequences for ITV that areas such as mine will not feature as strongly in the news agenda. I do not think that the answer, as Ofcom now seems to think, is to push us in with Scottish Television, whose finances do not seem to be any more robust than ITV&#146;s. I am afraid that I see little in its current news coverage that suggests that it would have a great interest in coming to the south of Scotland and giving us the sort of coverage that we have enjoyed until now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para0"><a name="08101444000043">I hope that there will be a rethink by ITV. If we are to continue to see ITV as relevant to the regional map of Britain, ITV must be asked to rethink its decision. The company must understand that it has a duty to the diversity of Britain and that there is a proud tradition of coverage that ensures that subjects such as rugby in my constituency&#151;indeed, in the whole of the south of Scotland&#151;and local history are properly covered. Broadcasters such as Alistair Moffatt, who have made a career out of writing and broadcasting at senior levels, are now producing first-class programmes that are of interest to people in the borders; Mr. Moffatt&#146;s latest project was about Hadrian&#146;s wall. Under the present proposals, however, I do not see where there will be room for such work in the future, so I hope that the Government will think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000044">The digital switchover process is important, and not just because of the precise issues of a technical and support nature it raises in my constituency, or because or the ITV programming questions. It is also important because of the principles that are being laid down. I know that there are different ways of defining the &#147;digital dividend&#148;&#151;whether it is the freeing up of the television spectrum, or the resources that the Treasury may receive from selling off parts of that spectrum. Nevertheless, there are lots of exciting ideas about how that dividend might be used, including new types of services that we cannot really guess at now. Ten years ago, who would have predicted what television we would be enjoying now and its shape? What I do not want to see&#151;I hope that the Minister will agree with me&#151;is that with this switchover process we establish a principle that people in rural Britain will have to accept a second-class service and that new services will not be for everybody. That is the direction that the free market approach of Ofcom and the policy framework within which it operates seem to be leading us. When mobile phones came out years ago, the licence requirements demanded that huge parts of the United Kingdom were covered. The same has not been true of digital television coverage, and I hope that that will change. Otherwise, we will entrench the wrong type of principle.</p>

 Thank you, Mrs. Humble. I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore), both on securing this debate and on an excellent, wide-ranging speech. During his speech, he paid tribute to a very large number of people in his constituency and in the wider borders area who have been working very hard indeed to ensure that switchover goes smoothly. However, I think that it would be amiss if I did not also record that my hon. Friend himself has put in a great deal of effort on this issue, and he deserves the praise of the constituents for the hard work that he has done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000049">From the outset, my hon. Friend made it very clear that he is fully supportive of the move to digital. He said that it was a giant step, which offered consumers more choice, although he was concerned about the limitation of that choice for some of his constituents, improved viewing quality and at least the opportunity for a very wide range of additional services.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and for his contribution. Would he perhaps expand a little on the suggestion by his hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore), that people have a right to obtain a substantial amount of regional broadcasting? It is true that they have that right, but could the hon. Gentleman expand that to say that they have a right to receive regional broadcasting for the region in which they live, so that we do not have the situation whereby large numbers of people throughout England, Scotland and Wales receive news of areas that are not in their own region? Without being too parochial, those people want to hear about their own community.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in his view about what our own constituents want. People in my constituency in Bath will pay a passing interest to what happens in Bristol, which is only nine miles away; they have very limited interest in what happens in Taunton or Exeter, but under the new proposals they are somehow expected also to be interested in what happens in Truro, which I think is extremely unlikely. Therefore, like the hon. Gentleman, I am very concerned about the current proposals, which will have a huge impact on our opportunity for local and regional viewing as we know it, about the areas in which we live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08101444000052">Consequently, I very much hope that the Minister will comment on that fascinating quotation from the Secretary of State, which was mentioned by my hon.

and many other Members of this House have expressed about how we resolve the current situation and the problems faced by ITV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000053">Figures show that 88 per cent. of UK households now have digital TV on at least one TV set, and that is far higher than the Government&#146;s predictions. That is good news. Also, the market for digiboxes is working very well now. A few years ago, a set-top box would cost about &#163;100; now people can get one for about &#163;25 to &#163;35, and indeed on some occasions boxes can be bought for as little as &#163;9.99. In very recent times, we have also seen the launch of Freesat, which was referred to earlier in this debate. That launch was in May and already 100,000 homes have subscribed to that very exciting new digital service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08101444000054">In general, the picture is encouraging. Therefore, although I want to concentrate on some areas of concern, in no way do I want that to diminish the clear view that I have that digital is an exciting development within television and that it is providing more choice and more services. Nevertheless, I want to pick up on some areas of concern&#151;I hope that the Minister will understand why I want to do that&#151;and to echo some of the concerns that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08101444000055">My first concern, obviously, is that having said that 88 per cent. of UK homes have at least one digital TV set, we must of course recognise that the vast majority of UK homes with a television set have more than one set. The latest figures point out that there are something like 18 million TV sets in this country that are still analogue, so there is a lot of work still to be done in ensuring that all of the TV sets in a home move to digital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000056">There is a particular issue that I hope that the Minister might be able to comment on. I would like to see much more urgent work being done about the issue of switchover in rented accommodation with communal areas, in other words in all forms of houses of multiple occupation. I believe that private and social landlords need to do very much more, and they need to be encouraged to do very much more, to take action to ensure that their tenants are ready for switchover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08101444000057">I am well aware that Digital UK is about to commission pilot research to evaluate and monitor the progress and attitudes among people in the privately rented and leasehold residential housing sector in Manchester. However, the results of that research will come far too late to inform what happens, for instance, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk and in the wider borders area, where, as we have heard, switchover is about to begin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000058">I am also concerned that although the switchover in the Copeland area was extremely successful, given the time scale involved, it seems that there will not be an opportunity to use in the borders the lessons learned from it. It is worth reflecting that the National Audit Office points out in a report that it prepared for the BBC Trust that</p>
<a name="81014h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08101444000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not all lessons from Copeland will be known in time to incorporate them into the national contract&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000059">That is a great pity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000060">I have concerns that echo those raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk about the targeted help scheme, which is the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 Oct 2008">

joint responsibility of the Departments for Culture, Media and Sport and for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. I have said in previous debates that I believe that the targeted help scheme is a Government policy and, as such, ought to be funded by the Government. It is wrong to fund it from the BBC licence fee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000061">I am also concerned that, in setting up the targeted help scheme&#151;this is mentioned in a recent Public Accounts Committee report as well&#151;the two Departments did not really do enough work on getting adequate safeguards and ensuring ensure value for money from the scheme. My hon. Friend listed the many organisations that are involved in it&#151;undoubtedly, there is a tangled web of accountability. Because the estimates to date for the targeted help scheme have been so wrong, a large amount of the money is, in fact, unlikely to be used. Only 28 per cent. of the people in Copeland who it was predicted would use it actually did, and some figures suggest that as much as &#163;250 million of the fund set aside for it will not be used and may become available.</p>

 I do not wish to stop the flow of the hon. Gentleman, who, as many Members will know, is my mentor in this House, but he mentioned a possible &#163;250 million surplus. Could he indicate what his party would do with that surplus, were it to form the first Liberal Democrat Administration for almost a century?</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="08101444000065"><a name="81014h0002.htm_spnew8"><a name="08101444000487"><b>Mr. Foster:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking that question, which I indicated prior to the debate that I would ask him during his contribution. It would be inappropriate for me to reveal at this stage the response that he gave, but I hope very much that he will answer the question himself when he makes his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000066">There are many interesting opportunities for using the money. Some might argue that it could go back  to the licence fee payer who provided it&#151;not, of course, the taxpayer. Others might suggest that it form part  of the solution to the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. I suspect that &#163;250 million might easily help commercial broadcasters to provide their bits of kit for the relays in his constituency. Of course, there are other opportunities: we could look at some of the possibilities for providing a wider range of services for people who move to digital. I shall return to that point in rather more detail in a minute, if the hon. Member for Wantage will allow me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000067">So there are concerns about the targeted help scheme&#146;s tangled web of accountability and about the inadequacy of the planning. My hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk raised several specific problems in his own constituency and spoke about what even Digital UK itself has termed &#147;Freeview Lite&#148;. I genuinely believe that the Government must help to find a solution to that problem so that all parts of the country are able to benefit to a fairly equal degree from the move to digital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000068">However, my hon. Friend did not raise other concerns about how the targeted help scheme will work in his constituency. One that has been raised by several people is the awarding of the contract to Sky. I have no problem with Sky getting the contract. Indeed, its offer to those who will benefit from it seems to be a good one. I have no criticism of Sky&#146;s winning the contract or of what it is offering. Where I do have a problem is with the use of data that will now come into its possession.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08101444000069">During passage of the Digital Switchover (Disclosure of Information) Bill, I expressed considerable concern about the uses that could be made of the data that will become available. After all, whoever gets the contract to provide services under the targeted help scheme will have access to details&#151;a great amount of information&#151;about the large cohort of people who fall under the various categories that are covered by the scheme. I was concerned that we ensure that they are not able to use that information for any form of marketing purposes, because, otherwise, they would have a considerable commercial advantage over any similar organisation. During the passage of the Bill, I was given absolute assurance that there would be no ability to use the data for purposes other than delivering the targeted help scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000070">Sky is offering an extremely good deal. For two months, people will get not only its basic service but also Sky Plus. After two months, Sky will write to those people, tell them that their free opportunity has come to an end, and ask them whether they would like to pay a subscription to continue receiving its wonderful service. I do not know how hon. Members would define that, but I would say that it is marketing the sale of a particular service to a particular group of people. I genuinely believe that that comes within at least the spirit of what was agreed during passage of the Bill, and I would be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s views on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000071">My other disappointment with the targeted help scheme is that the boxes that are on offer will not include an ethernet connection&#151;a connection to the internet. The specification for the box does not include a return path; it is not part of the core receiver requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000072">Providing a return path would open up a wide range of additional services. On 27 February, the Department for Communities and Local Government produced a detailed document about the benefits of including a return path with digital set-top boxes. They ranged from smart metering to helping people with independent living to extending local government e-services. In short, the Department said that a return path would improve the delivery of a wide range of services to those who most use them, and that it would improve the quality of life of the recipients. Indeed, the paper concluded that such opportunities deserved to be &#147;robustly explored&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000073">Sir John Bourn of the NAO said that the Government need to do more to encourage technology-shy older people. He stated that</p>

So what has been the response of the DCMS? During a series of parliamentary questions, I asked the Secretary of State what he knew about the work that was going on. I knew that it was happening well before the report was published, yet in his answer the Secretary of State told me that the first he knew about it was on the day that the document was published. He and his Department seemed to have had no involvement in the work that was going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para25"><a name="08101444000076">Despite all that evidence suggesting that a return path is a good idea, it is currently not going to happen, because the DCMS&#151;the Minister&#146;s own Department&#151;has consistently refused to include it as part of the specification and, before that, it refused to say that we should look at what the cost might be. In April, in a meeting of the emerging technologies group, in which the Department is represented, it was decided that, despite the evidence from the DCLG on the benefits of a return path, its inclusion would &#147;unnecessarily complicate matters&#148; and, as a result of that, the industry&#146;s advice on how to move forward on this issue was not to be sought. That is a disgrace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para26"><a name="08101444000077">There is a real opportunity to get the whole country connected up and to get e-services and a range of other services that could help to the most disadvantaged people in our society in particular.

The kit is already being made in respect of the satellite receiver system. If hon. Members do a Google search, they will find that a number of boxes with such an internet connection are available. Although it is not much use if the software is not contained in the box to make it do things, at least it is already there in the specification of some of the commercially available boxes. I fail to understand why this idea is not going forward and I should love to hear the Minister&#146;s explanation about why that is so. The Minister has now made it even more difficult to move forward, because the latest technological specification for boxes in the core receiver requirement has within it an energy maximum figure set at such a level that, to meet it, it would be impossible for an internet connection or even a hard drive to be included. I hope that the Minister will agree to look at this matter.</p>

not. As a result of our campaigning, we persuaded the BBC to bring digital radio to the Borders for the first time. However, people are now frustrated that they cannot get Radio Scotland and other local services on digital radio. Does my hon.

 My hon. Friend is right. The move to digital radio has been slow off the mark, in comparison with television. That is particularly worrying in view of the recent announcement by Channel 4 that it is not proceeding with its planned digital radio venture. Of course, that offers a number of alternatives. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to discuss with colleagues in other Departments the way in which that space might possibly be used for ventures, such as those proposed by many in respect of children&#146;s radio, which has huge educational benefits that should be explored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="81014h0002.htm_para28"><a name="08101444000081">Digital switchover for television is a huge step change; it brings huge benefits, including increased choice, better quality of viewing and opportunities for a wide range of new services. I do not think that we have got it all right, but it is still exciting and I am sure that we will all benefit from it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk has rightly pointed out, those benefits are not going to be shared equally around the country and it is critical that something is done about that. It is equally important that we find ways of learning the lessons as we gradually roll digital switchover out across the country. Above all, I hope that the Minister will give some response in respect of the real missed opportunity of the ethernet connection.</p>

 It is a delight to debate this important subject under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. May I also congratulate the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) on securing this important debate?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para0"><a name="08101444000083">It is a delight to have the second chance to welcome the new Minister not quite to the Dispatch Box but to the table in Westminster Hall. It is a reflection of the importance of culture and media issues that I will probably face the Minister for a third time in a debate on a private Member&#146;s Bill on Friday. Therefore, this week, as Parliament returns and the economy collapses around our ears, we have the opportunity to debate many important subjects in the media world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000084">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) took this opportunity to congratulate a few people, so may I add to the mix Digital UK, the organisation responsible for helping with switchover? The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk said kind words about Digital UK. I should like to put on record that, in my dealings with that organisation, I have found it completely professional. As far as I am aware, its work in pushing through switchover seems to be going pretty well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000085">When we debated the small Bill to enable the sharing of data, thereby enabling digital switchover to take place, we in the Conservative party put on record our support for switchover and switching off the analogue signal. Before that Bill, there had been considerable debate about whether that was right, or perhaps too bold a step. It was compared, at one point, to a combination  <br>

of gasification and North sea oil in terms of the technology and sheer scale of the work being undertaken. At least one important hon. Member&#151;the Chairman of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)&#151;moved from being a sceptic to a convert during that debate. All three major parties support compulsory switchover, so the task of Parliament is to scrutinise the process and ensure that it goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08101444000086">The reason that this debate is so important, and that it was so important that the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk secured it, is that it reminds those hon. Members who represent more metropolitan areas&#151;although my constituency is fairly rural, it is just an hour from London and is unlikely to suffer a great deal of difficulty during digital switchover&#151;that rural areas in this country could be the losers in switchover, and that everything possible must be done to ensure that any difficulties are kept to a minimum and that the maximum possible coverage should be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000087">There is some credibility to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s statement that Ofcom has perhaps been mildly complacent in believing that rural areas will always suffer some kind of second-class service, rather than putting its shoulder to the wheel and thinking about how to ensure that rural areas get a first-class service. That is why this debate is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08101444000088">I hope that the Minister will address two key points that came across in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s speech and are worth exploring in some detail. He said that we are seeing the first major switchover. We know that switchover went smoothly in Copeland, but, as he said, the Borders area is a different kettle of fish, with not just one main transmitter but 11 relay transmitters and a rural population spread over a large area. Therefore, we will have to see whether switchover goes as smoothly there as it went in Copeland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000089">The hon. Gentleman made a good point about patchy Freeview and the failure of some commercial broadcasters to fit their multiplexes to relay transmitters. I shall deal later with the surplus that may occur in respect of the funds set aside to finance digital switchover. As the hon. Member for Bath said, that may be one use to which that surplus could be put. He and I would be interested to know what discussions the Minister has had with Digital UK, Ofcom and the commercial broadcasters about encouraging and supporting them to make technical changes to ensure that Freeview coverage in rural areas rises from two thirds to a substantially higher percentage. The Minister has been in the job for only three days, so she may not yet have had those discussions, but I know that they will take place soon after this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para7"><a name="08101444000090">The second issue that the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk brought to the debate was news from the front line and, I confess, it surprised me. I was tempted to intervene in a genuine spirit of inquiry to discover more details when he referred to the muddle that many of his constituents find when trying to access the help scheme. It would certainly be a major concern, given the number of different players involved in providing help and assistance&#151;Sky, BBC or Digital UK&#151;if people were confused about what help could be accessed.</p>

 I am not suggesting that my constituents are confused, because they are generally able to access helplines that are well publicised and so on. Where it exists, the confusion is among the players about who does what, and the crossover between the official help scheme and the outreach scheme, which must cover all the gaps in the official help scheme and draw in many of the voluntary groups on which so much responsibility is then placed.</p>

 I am grateful for that clarification, but it makes the point even more effectively. A number of bodies are involved, and there may be some confusion and overlap. We want clarity, not least to ensure the effective use of public money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08101444000093">The issue that is emerging from digital switchover is not significant concern that it will not run smoothly, that technical issues will not be addressed or that people will be unaware. We know that some 26 million analogue televisions remain out there, that about 10 per cent. of the population is unaware of switchover, and that some people feel unprepared for it. There are concerns that perhaps with hindsight the switchover scheme has been drawn too narrowly and that, given the surplus, people who fall outside the narrow remit of the scheme should be able to access some help.</p>

<p><a name="st_24"><a name="08101444000094"><a name="81014h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="08101444000493"><b>Mr. Don Foster:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that later today the Secretary of State will make a statement on the very issue to which he refers. I understand that he will say&#151;the Minister may be able to confirm this&#151;that as of today people who have been in a residential care home for six months by the end of the eligibility period will be included among those who will be helped. I am sure that he agrees that that is a welcome step forward by the Secretary of State, and adds another much-needed category to the list of those being helped. However, making that announcement just two weeks before switchover will create great difficulty in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk.</p>

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="08101444000095"><a name="81014h0003.htm_spnew4"><a name="08101444000494"><b>Mr. Vaizey:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right to pull up the Government for adapting the scheme on the hoof, but we should welcome the change if that is the case. I am not privy to the Secretary of State&#146;s inner thoughts, and I have not seen an early copy of the statement announcing that, because of the surplus that has been built up, the Government are prepared to extend the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000096">There may be other technical difficulties along the way. When we debated the Bill there was enormous concern about large blocks of flats, and whether switchover could be successfully carried out in such buildings. I hesitate to call on the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk again, but I am not sure that he would have such difficulties in his constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08101444000097">The surplus that could build up in the money set aside to fund the digital switchover scheme is becoming increasingly apparent, and will be subject to debate. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister will have discussions with Ofcom or, indeed, the BBC about that. When we debated that during consideration of the Bill, we secured a commitment, thankfully, from the Government that they would underwrite the process of switchover and that if for some reason the money set  <br>

aside was not enough to fund switchover completely, the BBC&#146;s licence fee would not be raided. The Conservative party, which was supported by the Liberal Democrats, was grateful for that commitment to secure BBC programming to 2012. It is obviously too early to say whether the estimated surplus of &#163;250 million will become reality and, as this debate has shown, there may be technical issues that were not anticipated for which the surplus could provide icing on the cake and finance technical changes in rural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000098">The Government have four, or possibly five, options. The first, which I emphatically would not support, is to give the surplus to a major retail bank. We have given them quite enough money, so I am not calling on the Government to do that. Top-slicing is being debated&#151;we wait to hear the Secretary of State&#146;s thoughts in the new year&#151;and is becoming more popular with Ofcom and may be even more popular for the Government now that the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, Stephen Carter, who is the father of top-slicing, is going to the Lords. That may be one place for the money. Another option is to let the BBC keep the money to put into programming. A third option might be to give the money back to licence fee payers. A fourth option might be to support the roll-out of super-fast broadband, which will be the next challenge in communications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000099">It was interesting to hear the hon. Members for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk and for Bath talk about the challenge facing regional news, and the rapid technology changes with set-top boxes fitted with internet access. One issue that is of great interest to the Conservative shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt), is local television. We are all extremely concerned about ITV&#146;s proposals for regional news, but the advance of technology and the internet in becoming a broadcasting medium may be able to fill that gap and provide low-cost, very local programming, but that will be effective only if we have a strategy to roll out super-fast broadband.</p>

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="08101444000100"><a name="81014h0003.htm_spnew5"><a name="08101444000495"><b>Mr. Foster:</b>
 I entirely support what the hon. Gentleman says, and surely he acknowledges that even if we moved to local television, it would be far preferable if that were seen on our television screens and not on a computer some way away. Doing that via super-fast broadband and on television is another argument for having an internet connection on digital boxes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000102">In conclusion, what concerns many people involved in the roll-out of super-fast broadband is that although the plans of commercial companies&#151;British Telecom and Virgin Media&#151;are well advanced, the industry is telling us that it is concerned that there is a complete lack of leadership from the Government. It is not necessarily saying that the Government must provide funding&#151;no one is suggesting that, and estimates of the amount of investment needed vary from &#163;10 billion to &#163;15 billion&#151;but the industry wants certainty from the Government that this is the right way forward, and particularly that it will be supported with regulation and co-ordination.

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I would like to thank everyone here today who has congratulated me. I am afraid that having a new job often makes one tired and that I have acquired a cold with my new job. I hope that I am audible through the cold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000104">I congratulate the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) on his success in securing an Adjournment debate and on using it to raise some important issues about the switch off of analogue signals in the Selkirk transmitter group area and across the United Kingdom more generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000105">As the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) said, there is cross-party agreement on the issue. I welcome the Opposition parties&#146; scrutiny of the way in which digital switchover has been rolled out, particularly the work of the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. I know he has taken a great deal of interest in the issue and that he established the Borders Digital Forum in 2005 to review progress on digital switchover. Experience in Whitehaven shows that the support of a local MP is an important factor in ensuring that switchover proceeds smoothly in an area, so his engagement with this giant step is most welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000106">In responding to the hon. Gentleman, I shall say a bit about the progress on switchover generally, and then a few words about what is happening in the Selkirk transmitter area. I shall then turn to the specific points raised by him and other hon. Members during this debate. Hon. Members will be familiar with the reasons for switching off the analogue TV signals and replacing them with digital and will know that there are benefits to consumers. Only by switching off the analogue signal will it be possible to increase the coverage of digital terrestrial television, so that it reaches almost everyone in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000107">Digital will provide efficiencies and long-term cost savings on terrestrial transmission switchover for public service broadcasters. In addition, allowing the development of new services through greater spectrum efficiency will provide savings for the UK economy. Digital UK is responsible for co-ordinating the switchover process and ensuring that everyone knows what to do, when and where. As the hon. Member for Wantage said, there is no doubt that the work of Digital UK and others is proving to be highly effective. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, Ofcom&#146;s digital progress report for the second quarter of 2008 shows that 88 per cent. of UK households now access multi-channel TV on their main television sets and more than half&#151;55 per cent.&#151;of all secondary TV sets in UK households have been converted to multi-channel TV. That means that 69 per cent. of all TV sets in UK households can receive multi-channel TV. However, I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that 18 million TV sets are still analogue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08101444000108">The latest Digital UK/Ofcom tracker, which was published yesterday, also tells a good story. National awareness of switchover stands at 89 per cent. Slightly more worryingly, understanding is now at 68 per cent., so there is something of a lag in relation to that. Clearly,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="14" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>14 Oct 2008 : Column 205WH</b><br>
switchover is still a few years away for many people and it is not surprising that although they might be aware of it, they do not yet fully understand the subject. However, in the areas where switchover is about to happen, levels of understanding are much more positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000109">For example, in Selkirk, awareness stands at 99 per cent and understanding at 92 per cent.&#151;much of that is probably thanks to the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. Moreover, actual conversion to digital TV stands at 88 per cent. Only around 6,420 analogue-only homes remain, compared with about 45,000 homes that have already converted. Those figures suggest that we are on track for a successful switchover in Selkirk. Comparison with Whitehaven at the same point suggests that Selkirk is in a better position, but I stress that no one is being complacent. Digital UK&#146;s promotional and information activities will continue right until switchover and beyond to ensure that everyone understands what is happening and knows what to do. I know that the hon. Gentleman will also do everything he can to encourage his constituents to take the necessary steps in good time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000110">I shall now turn to the switchover help scheme both in general and in Selkirk in particular. The Government have been clear from the start that practical help will be available for those who might otherwise struggle to make the switch to digital TV. That is why we and the BBC have established the switchover help scheme. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the scheme is open to people who are 75 or over, or to those in receipt of social security benefits, such as disability living allowance or constant attendance allowance</p>

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="08101444000111"><a name="81014h0003.htm_spnew7"><a name="08101444000498"><b>Mr. Moore:</b>
 I thank the Minister for her earlier kind comments. She has pointed out that the scheme is open to those who are over 75 and we passed legislation in this place to ensure that the database that allowed access to the right age groups was made available to the help scheme. Can she therefore explain why Professor Fenton Robb, one of the doughtiest campaigners in my constituency on the subject of switchover, was asked to produce his birth certificate to prove his age when that information should already have been available? He has been campaigning about a lot of things and that was the final straw for him.</p>

 I apologise to Professor Fenton Robb. I hope that that situation occurred because he looks young. I do not know exactly why that has happened, but I will ask my officials to look into the matter and write to the hon. Gentleman and to Professor Fenton Robb.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000113">As heralded by the hon. Members for Bath and for Wantage, the Secretary of State has today put out a written ministerial statement formally announcing that the help scheme will be extended to include everyone normally resident in care homes. Letters seeking information on residents have been sent to all care homes in the Selkirk transmission area, so that those people know that the help scheme can offer them assistance. As the hon. Member for Bath said, someone is normally considered to be a resident if they have been in a care home for six months or more, or if the care home manager expects them to have been resident for more than six months by the end of the eligibility period.</p>

 I am grateful to have confirmation about the expansion of the scheme and, as I said earlier, I welcome that. On the eligibility period, can she confirm that once digital switchover is completed in the UK, no one after that will be eligible for support? Surely an issue in relation to that needs to be addressed: we need to ensure that people who were refuseniks early on and want to move into the digital world at a later stage can access support?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000118">Points were made about take-up rates in Copeland compared with elsewhere and the possibility that there might be &#163;250 million in over-funding. Based on only 0.1 per cent. of the country having switched over, it might be a bit early to speculate in that way&#151;although I am sure that we all hope some excess money will be left over at the end. If that is the case, the Government have agreed to first discuss it with the BBC trust and to look into innovative and useful ways of using that money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08101444000119">The hon. Member for Bath also asked about social housing providers and people in buildings of multiple occupation. We picked up on that issue from the Copeland switchover and as a result have done a great deal of extra work to engage landlords in Selkirk. Private landlords have been contacted via letting agents, managing agents, the Scottish Borders council private landlords&#146; forum and, more recently, through the tenancy deposit scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="81014h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08101444000120">In addition, all householders in the area have received direct communication, which includes information about what to do if they live in a building with a shared aerial. Digital UK has a dedicated website, which gives specific advice on that, and social housing providers in the area have had specific advice sheets from Digital UK. I hope that that covers the issue, but it will be interesting to see what happens in Selkirk.</p>

 I was slightly taken aback by the Minister saying that the Government picked up the issue of houses in multiple occupation in Copeland, because we had a lengthy debate about that issue, raised, as it happens, by me, in Committee two years before that, so it has been around for some time. Another issue raised at the same time and connected to it concerns the problems faced by people living in conservation areas, where planning issues prevent the erection of, for example, dishes or even, in some cases, television aerials. What progress has been made on that issue or was it picked up only in Copeland?</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will have to forgive me. I am a wet-behind-the-ears Minister in this case and I did not know about his contribution. Nor can I give him an answer now on conservation areas, although I know about the issue because I happen to live in one. However, I will ask my officials to write to him about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para0"><a name="08101444000123">My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) asked about people with certain disabilities not being able to hear or see what was happening on the television. The emerging technology group in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been considering talking Members&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I meant talking menus&#151;Members do nothing but talk. The group has been considering talking menus and talking electronic programme guides, and officials have had a number of constructive discussions with the Royal National Institute of Blind People about that. I know that good progress is being made, but I am not in a position now to say exactly what is happening at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000124">The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk spoke about boxes becoming obsolete. If anyone eligible for the help scheme finds that their existing boxes become obsolete or stop working, they will be eligible for help under the scheme. In other words, they will get a box either for &#163;40 or for free. In general, when older boxes become obsolete, as technology in this area does at an increasingly rapid rate, people will just have to stump up for that themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000125">More than 7 million people throughout the UK will be eligible for help if they want it. The help scheme will be rolled out in each TV region as switchover approaches. I was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman describing the work being done in his area. Every eligible person in a region will be contacted by post directly at their home three times in the run-up to switchover. The scheme will provide a comprehensive service that includes the provision of easy-to-use equipment, installation and practical advice and assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08101444000126">There was discussion of Sky pay TV and the Sky packages. The hon. Member for Bath mentioned that people on the help scheme are written to two months after the box has been installed and asked whether they want to continue to get all the free digital television and radio channels that they are currently enjoying. I want to make it clear that the help scheme has put in place very strict restrictions on the practice of up-selling, with the result that help scheme participants will receive Sky marketing material only if they have explicitly chosen to do so. Sky itself has said that it has no desire to send people unwelcome marketing material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000127">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned return-path technology. I thought that the Department&#146;s emerging technology group was still considering that issue; he says not. Again, my officials will have to clarify that&#151;I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman will receive a raft of letters from me after the debate.</p>

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="08101444000128"><a name="81014h0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="08101444000506"><b>Mr. Foster:</b>
 The Minister may find it helpful to know that I asked the Secretary of State to place the minutes of the various meetings in the Library and that what I have referred to is those bits of the minutes that are not blacked out. Unfortunately, large chunks of the minutes have been blacked out, as the Minister will see, so I have given my interpretation of what it says, which is that the decision has been taken not to go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="08101444000129"><a name="81014h0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="08101444000507"><b>Barbara Follett:</b>
 In addition, Digital UK has entered into a contract with Digital Outreach Ltd to deliver community outreach services across the first four TV transmission regions. That is designed to help people who are not eligible for the help scheme but who nevertheless may have difficulty in switching to digital. It will provide  <br>

information and training to volunteers and charity staff, and organise meetings and events in the run-up to switchover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08101444000130">I commend Digital Outreach, which is a not-for-profit company set up by three leading national charities&#151;Age Concern, Help the Aged and Community Service Volunteers&#151;and Collective Enterprises Ltd. They have been doing great work in the Selkirk area. Any lessons learned in that area about interaction between the various help providers will be examined with great care. I would welcome any feedback that the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk has, because obviously we want to ensure that these things work in other areas in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000131">Given the shortage of time, I shall not say as much as I had hoped to about the help scheme in Selkirk. The hon. Gentleman touched on most of it. He expressed some concern about how low the take-up was. There are approximately 19,000 potentially eligible people in the Selkirk transmitter area, and I understand that virtually all have now been contacted at least once if not twice. The help scheme has had responses from 5,700 or about 30 per cent. of them, and about 2,300 of those have opted in and 3,400 have opted out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08101444000132">There may be many reasons why take-up is relatively low, but it is not at all clear at this stage that that is anything to worry about. Many people will have already decided to adopt digital TV of their own accord, and others may have decided that they are quite capable of doing so without the aid of the help scheme. The help scheme is there as a safety net, and I am glad to see that it is operating. It is keen to receive further responses and is in the process of sending out two more reminders to eligible people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08101444000133">The hon. Gentleman is concerned that not all his constituents will get six mux&#151;multiplex&#151;coverage after switchover. He describes the three mux coverage as &#147;Freeview Lite&#148;. Across the Border TV region as a whole, only 51 per cent. of households can currently receive digital TV through an aerial; after digital switchover, that will increase to 98 per cent. Of these households, 53 per cent. are predicted to receive the full Freeview line-up of 48 channels; elsewhere, 20 channels will be available. The first point to make is that the so-called Freeview Lite service means that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents will be able to receive 20 of the most watched channels. That includes all the public service broadcast services currently available, plus a good deal more. Of course, digital terrestrial television is only one way to switch to digital. There are many alternatives, which I personally have to use, living in a hilly area. In particular, people who want more channels may choose from a range of free or subscription satellite services offering 90 to 400 channels. The BBC and ITV have launched Freesat; there is also Freesat from Sky. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Government and Ofcom are committed to ensuring that digital coverage for public service broadcast services substantially matches current analogue services&#151;covering 98.5 per cent. of UK households&#151;at switchover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000134">I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern about the proposed restructuring of regional news in the Border and Tyne Tees areas and the impact that that could have on local TV coverage, but he will have to raise that with the TV companies themselves.</p>

<a name="time_4"><a name="81014h0004.htm_time0"><a name="08101444000454"><h5 align="left">11 am</h5>
<p><a name="st_40"><a name="08101444000137"><a name="81014h0004.htm_spnew3"><a name="08101444000509"><b>Dr. Doug Naysmith (Bristol, North-West) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 As always, Mrs. Humble, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate, as it will provide a welcome opportunity to discuss with my colleagues the needs of patients who suffer from rare and complex medical conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000138">I emphasise that the Government&#146;s commendable policy of making the national health service more locally accountable should not prejudice the interests of people with such conditions, as they have requirements that need to be planned and provided for regionally and sometimes nationally. Many of these conditions are severe, genetically determined and sometimes life threatening. They include cystic fibrosis, some myelomas, Gaucher disease, paroxysmal natural haemoglobinuria&#151;PNH&#151;and muscular dystrophy. However, many of us, or our friends and families, could need specialised services for severe burns, spinal injuries or serious mental health problems, to take only a few examples. Those living with rarer cancers often encounter similar problems receiving care as do those with other rare medical conditions. Examples include some brain tumours, soft tissue and bone cancers, and HIV-related malignancies such as Kaposi&#146;s sarcoma.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000139">The point of listing these conditions is to emphasise the fact that rare conditions and specialised services are not unusual curiosities, but are to be found at the heart of what makes our NHS special. For that reason, those of us with an interest in the treatment of rare and complex conditions were delighted by the Government&#146;s decision to ask Sir David Carter to review the commissioning of specialised services. In an impressively coherent report, published in 2006, Sir David recommended that 10 specialised commissioning groups should be set up at regional level to plan and procure services catering for populations of more than 1 million, and that the constituent primary care trusts should pool budgets to pay for the procured services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000140">Indeed, on 8 January, the Prime Minister said:</p>
<a name="81014h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="08101444000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as the cost of ever more effective technology intervention rises and there is little advance knowledge of upon whom the cost will fall, it is more important than ever to pool the risk and share the cost of those interventions fairly across our whole population.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000141">That risk-sharing aspect of the NHS was one of its fundamental features when it began 60 years ago. Another feature apparent then was a commitment to research and the development of new treatments and technologies. That makes it all the more bizarre these days that when effective treatments become available, often developed within the NHS, they are sometimes denied to patients on the ground that they cost too much.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000142">Considerable progress has been made towards implementing the Carter reforms in the two years since publication of the report, and that should be recognised. However, specialised services seem to have a habit of moving to the periphery, and there has been a worrying lack of recognition of the Carter principles in a number of recent Department of Health documents. For instance, there is no mention of them in the next stage review final report or in &#147;High Quality Care for All&#148;, nor are they mentioned in the draft NHS constitution. Furthermore,  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="14" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>14 Oct 2008 : Column 211WH</b><br>
because small patient numbers requiring individual services means that the cost of treatment tends to be high, it puts rare and complex conditions in the thick of the current debate about top-up fees and the like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000143">As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, I am a strong supporter of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and a firm believer in its role as an arbiter of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medicines&#151;and, I hope, increasingly of other forms of treatment. However, if we used cost-effectiveness as the sole criterion for decision making, the NHS would rapidly lose public support&#151;for example, palliative care could instantly be discontinued, and heart and liver transplants could be at risk. Indeed, NICE&#146;s citizens council has constantly found that large majorities are in favour of society taking care of those in greatest clinical need. The Secretary of State&#146;s directions for NICE cite clinical need and innovation as factors to be taken into account alongside clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. However, the directions on clinical need and innovation are not explicitly recognised in NICE&#146;s recently revised document on social value judgments. Surely all the Secretary of State&#146;s directions should be adhered to when decisions about the funding of treatments are taken by NICE, PCTs and other bodies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000144">On the subject of exceptional cases and exceptional case panels, procedures for assessing exceptional cases were originally established to consider the funding of treatments that could be of debatable clinical benefit, such as tattoo removal, breast enlargement or hair transplants. In order to receive funding, patients had to establish clear clinical benefits, such as the alleviation of severe suicidal depression. However, with the advent of new high-cost treatments for a number of rare conditions&#151;for example, some of the rarer cancers that NICE cannot assess because a drug has not been licensed or because it is waiting in a queue&#151;primary care trusts are increasingly using exceptional case procedures in order to assess whether or not such patients should receive treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08101444000145">The clinical benefit of such treatments is often not in doubt, which means that it is difficult for patients to prove that they are exceptional. In many such cases, it is clear that the procedures are being used to assess whether the treatments are cost-effective&#151;something that they were not designed to do and which they are ill-equipped to undertake. That is not satisfactory, and the Rarer Cancers Forum has pointed out some of the drawbacks. For example, 3,000 patients make a request for exceptional funding every year, of which a large proportion&#151;2,200&#151;are approved. However, those patients first have to navigate a confusing system that has no common term to describe exceptional cases to help the panels that assess them. Indeed, exceptional cases are varyingly referred to as &#147;underfunded&#148; or &#147;non-normal&#148; treatments, or even &#147;case-by-case&#148; requests; and the panels are sometimes referred to as &#147;priorities panels&#148;, or &#147;commissioning advisory groups&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000146">There are huge variations in the number of exceptional applications made to PCTs and in the proportion of applications that they accept. One PCT received 180 applications over 20 months, whereas another received only one. Likewise, some PCTs approved all applications and others approved none. There are differences in how PCTs deal with exceptional case procedures: some have panels to assess treatments and others do not; some of those panels are dominated by administrators, and others  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 Oct 2008">

<notus-date day="14" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>14 Oct 2008 : Column 212WH</b><br>
include a majority of clinicians. In addition, some PCTs use social criteria, such as whether a cancer patient has children, in order to determine whether a case should be approved; and others do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000147">We need to make improvements to ensure that the NHS does not progressively become a body that fails to provide health care based on clinical need rather than ability to pay or some other criterion, and that applies particularly to patients with rare and complex conditions. Despite the rapid recent growth in NHS spending, affordability will always be an issue. The NHS will always have a limited pot of money, and we have to accept that it cannot fund everything. However, the existence of a NICE threshold for cost-effectiveness, which has changed little for 10 years, must be contributing to the current pressure for top-up fees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000148">Some positive things are happening, which should help in future. For instance, some substantial savings for reinvestment will be made from a generation of blockbuster drugs that are due to come off-patent in the next few years. The Department of Health and the pharmaceuticals industry have recently come up with a few innovative approaches to risk sharing that enable patients to access new products earlier in their life cycles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000149">It is easier to draw attention to problems than to provide solutions, and I am conscious that I have done the former so far, so I shall conclude by listing a number of things that I believe need attention if we are to put things right. The aim is to introduce fairness and transparency into the current systems for specialist commissioning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08101444000150">First, I hope that the operating framework that is due out later this month will help to complete successful implementation of the Carter report on specialised commissioning. Secondly, the NHS&#146;s proposed right of access to local services should be extended to include specialised services. Thirdly, the Secretary of State&#146;s directions to NICE on clinical need should be actively adopted by NICE and throughout the NHS when taking decisions that affect the funding of treatments. Fourthly, the Department and NICE should explore ways in which to recommend a treatment for use in the NHS, even when it does not have product licence, on the basis that it can be used to treat a biologically similar condition. I realise that proposal is complicated, but it is worth exploring.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08101444000151">Fifthly, there is a need to encourage collaborative working between PCTs, which is already happening in many places. A poll by the NHS Confederation in June showed that more than three quarters of NHS organisations believed that PCTs should work together nationally or regionally when deciding which expensive drugs or treatments should be offered to patients. Finally, as the Select Committee on Health has frequently recommended, it would be helpful if NICE evaluations could be speeded up. I know that there is a willingness in both the Department and NICE to do that, but progress, interestingly, is remarkably slow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08101444000152">I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Minister has to say on those very important matters.</p>

<notus-date day="14" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>14 Oct 2008 : Column 213WH</b><br>
debate and on the thoughtful, measured and well-informed way in which he opened it. I agree with the thrust of what he said, and I am grateful for the opportunity to participate. I have recently been made aware of the work of the Rarer Cancers Forum by meeting a constituent who is affected by some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman spoke about. Briefly, I should like to describe my constituent&#146;s experiences and draw some conclusions about how the system is working or, more to the point, not working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08101444000154">My constituent, Robert Derrick, is in his mid-60s; he is a father and grandfather who lives in Charfield in my constituency with his wife, and who runs a small business. He could be any of us. Last year, he saw a surgeon in Gloucester because it was clear that something was not quite right. The surgeon suspected bone cancer, but in June 2007, he was diagnosed with kidney cancer and had a kidney removed. In October 2007, he had a knee and part of a femur removed. He went through the wars but, interestingly, made a good recovery. He still runs his business, which I believe involves transfers for vintage motorbikes, and he is keen to go on doing so. We have a correspondence, and I met him and his wife on Friday. He has had kidney cancer, but one would not necessarily recognise that he was ill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para27"><a name="08101444000155">In June 2008, he was admitted to Gloucester hospital bleeding from the lungs, and was diagnosed with inoperable metastases on both lungs, at which point the system started to go wrong. The family spoke to the consultant, who told them that they can have two drugs, one on the NHS and one not. The drug that is available on the NHS is called Interferon. In Mr. Derrick&#146;s circumstances, it offers a poor quality of life and works for only one in six people; it might, with luck, give him another six months. The consultant said that Sutent, the other drug, should work well. The family wrote to me to tell me that their impression was that the consultant had told them that Mr. Derrick could expect to lead a normal life on Sutent, so there is a huge contrast between the drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para28"><a name="08101444000156">Sutent and associated treatments cost &#163;4,000 a month&#151;no-one pretends that that is not a lot of money&#151;and the family were told that the NHS would not pay for it. The consultant said, &#147;Every time I get a patient who would be appropriately treated with Sutent, I fax a request to Gloucestershire PCT, but it has told me to stop doing that because it has an exceptional funding process.&#148; If the consultant referred everybody who he thought would benefit from the treatment, by definition, they would not be exceptional, so the PCT told him to stop making requests. He replied, &#147;All my patients are exceptional, so why should I look at 10 people who come through my door and privately make a decision to pick this person or that because they are somehow more exceptional than the other nine? That is not why I came into medicine.&#148; When Mr. Derrick and his wife went to see him he said, &#147;There&#146;s no point me even applying for this drug, because the PCT will just say no.&#148; Understandably, the family were unhappy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para29"><a name="08101444000157">When approached, Gloucestershire PCT said, &#147;You haven&#146;t asked for or applied for the drug, in this case, for this patient, so we haven&#146;t yet refused.&#148; Having been told to apply, we did so. The family wrote in, the consultant said why Mr. Derrick would benefit and I  <br>

wrote letters of support. The PCT had a meeting and decided not to fund the treatment, which is probably not surprising. However, the meeting was held behind closed doors, and had I not told the family what date the decision would be made, they would not have known. They were not allowed to send anyone along, did not know who was making the decision, and there is no accountability for what happens behind those closed doors. Making what is literally a life-or-death decision behind closed doors, unaccountably, is a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="81014h0004.htm_para30"><a name="08101444000158">When the decision was made and the family came to see me on Friday, they said that they had not yet had an explanation from the PCT. I phoned the PCT on Thursday night, and was kindly sent a copy of the letter that explained things, which they were about to post. In the letter, the chief executive of Gloucestershire PCT wrote:</p>
<a name="81014h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08101444000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whilst sympathetic to the patient&#146;s condition&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>

However, there was uncertainty whether NICE had taken account of the fact that Pfizer provides the first course&#151;four weeks of tablets and two weeks off&#151;free of charge. NICE did not factor that into the costing of the drug, because the Department said that it was not sure that it was national, robust or rigorous. However, I believe that Pfizer confirmed that the first month is free to the NHS, so NICE could take account of it when it revises its guidance. Will the Minister assure us that it will? The first month being free to the NHS should be taken into account in the costing. Pfizer has also provided further clinical data. I hope that NICE has a more favourable cost assessment when it revises its judgment and that it recommends the treatment. I asked NICE whether it can speed up the process, because until the guidance is revised, PCTs throughout the country will use the preliminary guidance and probably say no in most cases. I also contacted Pfizer to see whether my constituent can go on a clinical trial or something.</p>

It would be unfair to say that the people making the decisions are faceless, but they are in the sense that they sit behind closed doors. The problem is that people do not know who is deciding their fate.</p>

This is not a case in which a drugs company is making vast profits by charging huge amounts in this country. The drug is cheaper here than elsewhere. Most other European countries pay for it, and some PCTs have approved its being prescribed, but not my constituent&#146;s. That is the root of the problem.</p>

The Minister has a fixed budget and has to allocate it. My argument is that if the public&#146;s priorities were really getting through in the NHS, they would want Mr. Derrick to have his drugs at the expense of other things the NHS spends its money on. If the public were actively involved&#151;even locally in Gloucestershire&#151;and were asked to list their priorities, I believe that this case would be one. This case is not about localism. I believe in localism and that the health service should respond to local needs. However, this is not about that. Mr. Derrick&#146;s needs are not different because he lives in Gloucestershire; he would have the same needs wherever he lived. Localism is not relevant in the provision of a treatment because, morally, it should not matter where a person lives. What should we do? I believe that the system is cruel and inhumane because it has the random element of where a person happens to live. The system is not working and it is not what the public wants.</p>

It is about &#163;30,000 for a quality-adjusted life year. I know it is not quite as simple as that, but that is the figure that appears in the Sutent judgment. As the hon. Gentleman said, that figure has not kept pace with the costs of the NHS and its medicines since NICE was introduced. If that one change was made&#151;if NICE was asked to adjust that threshold to reflect what has happened since it was created&#151;and the Sutent appraisal was redone in the light of the fact that the first treatment is free and of the latest clinical evidence, that could just make the difference. It would not make a difference for some drugs, but it would for this one.</p>

It is a choice between treatment that will prolong Mr. Derrick&#146;s life, perhaps for a good long period, and his death. It is not that there is a treatment that works and a treatment that does not. There is only one effective treatment, and the NHS does not pay for it. That is wrong. The NHS does not pay for the treatment because of where Mr. Derrick lives. If he lived somewhere else, it would pay for it. I ask the Minister to look again at the threshold that NICE is using and objectively assess whether it should be increased because of NHS inflation and drug price inflation, and to let us know how quickly it can be done, to benefit not just my constituent but many others.</p>

 It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Humble. I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) on setting us down the track on this important issue and covering lots of ground, which will save us getting into it, because we absolutely agree with him. He has the facts at his fingertips. I can sense a whiff of socialism in the air around this place. It is apparent, if one is in the right wind direction. I am aware, though, that there are hon. Members here who do not like that. On Radio 4 this morning, I heard a Republican denying that what was happening in America had any semblance of socialism. He said that recent events were a little episode that will suddenly disappear and then we will get back to good old strong capitalism again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000173">We are seeing that in the health service too. Last night, I was with the Minister at a party on the 29th floor of a building not far from Millbank. Many people were talking about the information that patients were getting now, not just through websites and the internet but from individuals. They said that the balance of power was swinging in the health service. Jonathan Miller described it as a revolution. He said we were moving towards a situation in which doctors, GPs and consultants would have to find time to listen to the patient. Sometimes the patient knows what is happening, can understand it and should be put in a position in which they can say clearly, &#147;This is having a good effect.&#148; They understand that doctors should not be as omnipotent as the system often makes them. That is important. Some of what we are talking about today is part and parcel of that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000174">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West has delimited many of the things that are happening. I have reason to congratulate the Government. A consultant at Guys called me to say that the Government had used a special system, on which the Minister will elaborate, for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. A special commissioning group had decided to extend the system to a group of patients in this country, and various strategic health authorities had come out and said that Eculizumab must be available on the NHS. What a way forward. At last, amazingly, something is happening that will make a difference to people&#146;s lives. I am not talking about millions or even thousands of people, but individuals  <br>

and groups of people, who, politically, punch well beyond their weight in numbers. They are not 3,000 beekeepers coming down to make a noise about bees. Those patients might be numbered in fives and tens, but they have a huge influence on the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000175">It is not just MPs and Ministers who play a part, but people across the country. That gives confidence to other groups to take similar action. Therefore, people who punch beyond their weight can have an effect. We must ensure that when we implement this system, there are no delays and no postcode lotteries, whereby one place gets the drug and another does not. Those days are past. That nonsense is surely over. After all, NICE was inaugurated to prevent such behaviour. Ever since, there have been problems relating to finance, the way in which people make their judgments, and who is on the committees that make such judgments. One of the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West touched on was that the people on the committees are often hidden away and we cannot find out who they are. Some committees are made up of administrators, some have a few clinicians, and others have a large number of clinicians. It is no surprise that there are huge differences across the country and they must be eliminated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000176">I want to carry on the Sutent argument. For my sins, I have to chair the Rarer Cancers Forum, whose meetings take place in here, in dining rooms and so on, and who are an amazing organisation of people. They are enthusiastic, determined and knowledgeable. They have recently published a well-researched, well-documented report called &#147;Taking Exception&#148;, which is a must-read for the Health Committee. The way forward is for groups of people to come up with things that are not contained by the rules of this House. Such people come together from different parts of the country and produce new and exciting ideas. We tend to get trammelled by the pathways that operate in this place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000177">This morning I phoned a friend of mine who has just been given Sutent by NHS Norfolk. His name is David Blackett, and I met him at a football competition at Tasburgh; he was not a bad player in his time. He has kidney cancer. He wanted the drug, and he has been paying for it. He has funded it himself, and it is costing an arm and a leg: the house, the insurance and other things have had to pay for it. On top of that, there is the top-up issue&#151;the Government are holding an inquiry into it&#151;which means that people who self-fund are not allowed to use other NHS facilities. It creates a huge political dilemma about a two-tier service that must be eliminated quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000178">The issue arises only because decisions are made not to give people the prescription drug Sutent. Why was it given in David&#146;s case? It was partly because of the inquiry being held into the need for top-up fees, but also because his doctor stood up in front of the committee with two pictures, one taken before Sutent and one after, and said, &#147;Just look at that cancer. There it is then, and here it is now.&#148; There was a huge difference.</p>

 Absolutely. It is important that the patient should be there, too, to see that he is being well represented by his GP and that they have talked together. David has a friendly GP and consultant who have allowed that. In some places, the consultant&#146;s word is good enough; in other places it is not, and the administrator must sign the claim form and so on. All sorts of different systems operate. No wonder there is great confusion. I am pleased that doggedness can make it happen, but we must stop this nonsense, as the hon. Member for Northavon says.</p>

 Absolutely. That is why I started by saying that the Government had created a special commission to represent different PCTs across a region. There is no reason why there could not be an East Anglian regional determination for such matters. Why is it important? It is because of the number of exceptional cases. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West has already quoted the numbers, but of maybe 5,000 cases a year, only 800 are refused. One wonders whether some of those refusals come about because of some doggedness in a PCT or in individuals, or whether the wrong people are involved and so on. The numbers are not astronomical, but let us say that those 800 all paid top-up fees. I am sure that good administration and good judgments about how the system operates and who is involved could greatly reduce that number until it became fairly trivial.</p>

 My hon. Friend is making a good case, but the PCT special committees called to consider exceptional cases used to vary greatly. A member of the trust would be brought in who happened to be in the office that day, and two or three of them would sit around and make a decision. Then, the next time a decision had to be made, different people would make it. It has been recommended that that should change, and it has changed in Bristol PCT, although I do not yet know about South Gloucestershire PCT. It is important to have much more continuity if we are to get standard and reproducible decisions.</p>

 It is true that that is improving in places, but by gosh, people have to fight to make it happen. Some lawyers are active in that field. I will not name them, but they have attended debates here and hammered away at MPs. They do not do it for profit; they just take the case and fight it, and it has been hard.

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000186">We talk too much about drugs. In my socialist mood, I would nationalise the drug industry. Everybody laughs when I say that, but at every union and Labour party conference in the 1970s, one had to say that or get booed, and anyone who said it would be cheered to the echo. If we are nationalising banks, why do we not start thinking about nationalising other things? But that is enough heresy in this place for one morning. We do not hear much of it, but it is a thought. Drug companies are merging anyway, and if they do not get their evil way, they get the hump and threaten to go to Ireland, Europe and so on. The first drug NICE ever considered was made by SmithKline Beecham, as I think it was called at the time, which threatened to go to Europe if it did not get its evil way. There are all sorts of political pressures like that, and in cases such as the ones that we are discussing, the drug companies have some questions to answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000187">I think that the next few years&#151;the next few weeks, even&#151;will be quite exciting. It is high time that things happened. Many of our constituents are wary of the process because they do not understand it, and it is our job to ensure that it is simple. Many things could be said about the issue. It is not just about cancer; it is about technologies becoming available. People can do things such as blood sampling, treatment for diabetes and so on at home. Those technologies need to be assessed, and I accuse NICE of not taking other technologies as seriously as it takes drugs. An inquiry is probably needed; the Health Committee may have something to say about it. We may need a separate arm of NICE to push along other technologies such as stents for heart problems. An exhibition is held here every year, although hardly any MP goes to it, of all the new, modern gizmos that allow people to assess their own health, take measurements, save GP time and so on. It is an exciting time and NICE is at the hub of it, but it must get its act together quickly or socialism may come into it.</p>

A lot of work has been done in Europe by the rare disease task force, which has chosen the most ironic day to be rare disease day in Europe: 29 February. As to the availability of treatment, I commend the Government for following up the Carter review and creating the regional specialised commissioning groups and national specialised commissioning groups, which will make a huge difference. A word about the national commissioning group: its website gives a list of the illnesses and groups of illnesses covered, but there are just 38. I do not think that that can be complete.</p>

of touch with medicine. My 2006 edition dismissed treatment for PNH as being only supportive. However, I received a letter from a constituent of mine with that very rare disease. He is 45 years old with a wife and three children under 16. In 2000 he lost his job when the disease was diagnosed and for a long time was out of work and receiving disability living allowance and incapacity benefits. He also had to have blood transfusions every three months, despite which he was extremely ill. He heard of a team in Leeds working with Alexion&#151;a drugs company in the United States&#151;and went up there fortnightly. For four years he has been taking Eculizumab and has not required a single blood transfusion. Furthermore, the treatment has been free, because it is part of a phase 3 clinical trial. He is now off the disabled register and back in part-time work. He would have been devastated if he could not have had the treatment, which is to be introduced on 1 April. Will arrangements be made for those such as my constituent to receive the supply that they need up until that time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para23"><a name="08101444000191">That brings me on to NICE and other points raised by other hon. Members. Eculizumab seems to have bypassed NICE. It is absolutely right that it has been approved, and I suppose that it could not be examined by NICE because the condition is so rare that there is not enough evidence and are no comparative trials. That makes it very difficult. However, that means that, if things that are examined by NICE are turned down, they have a desperately unfair status. We have heard already from the hon. Members for Northavon (Steve Webb) and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) about Sunitinib. I have seen three patients whom I thought were exceptional cases&#151;the first two, in Worcestershire, were described as &#147;not exceptional&#148; just like in Gloucestershire, and it was suggested that there was no point in referring any more similar cases because they would not be exceptional either. Then I saw a patient whom I thought was definitely exceptional: a 36-year-old lady with young children to whom even an extra few months of life would make all the difference, but again she was not counted as an exceptional case.</p>

In those cases, some fairness could be introduced into the system, because Sunitinib, as we have heard, is funded in several parts of the country, but not in others. I would very much like there to be other ways of treating such non-exceptional cases of relatively common cancers, but where the patient is in truly exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="81014h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08101444000193">Not very much has been said about research into rare diseases, which of course is desperately important. I shall always remember a John West cartoon of a very worried lady talking to her husband in a hospital bed saying: &#147;The doctor says it&#146;s so rare that they cannot be bothered to find a cure&#148;. Sadly, that is rather near the truth. I remember a particular Health Committee report that found that drug companies at the time were investing &#163;3.3 billion a year in drug-related research, which was many times the figure invested by the Department of Health, the Medical Research Council and medical charities combined. We are dependent on the pharmaceutical industry for research into drug treatment, but inevitably, owing to the costs of new drugs, the industry must consider drugs that will produce a return.</p>

With that report, we discovered that the Department of Health does not respond to a conclusion unless the word &#147;recommendation&#148; is in it. One of our conclusions read:</p>

The industry will continue to undertake the bulk of research in this area, but there are improvements that could be made. We welcome Lord Warner&#146;s recognition of this and look forward to his proposals to align more closely the drug companies&#146; research strategies with the public health aims&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000196">In fairness, there were some comments about that in the introduction to the Government&#146;s response, although the Department did not pick out that particular conclusion. One comment read:</p>

I am sure that the Minister is not quite prepared for this line of questioning, but what progress has been made on the NHS contribution to health research?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000198">On the pharmaceutical industry, the response stated:</p>
<a name="81014h0006.htm_brev3"><a name="08101444000441"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One of the areas considered by the Committee was how the Government could inform the industry the disease areas where more research was needed.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000200">How do we find the money to begin to afford all these expensive treatments? To me, the answer is obvious, but no one will accept it because nobody likes the dread word &#147;rationing&#148;. In a briefing for this debate, the Specialist Healthcare Alliance suggested that we use the money saved from medicines coming off patent to re-invest in new treatments, which the Department has started to do. Ages ago, it produced the paper, &#147;Better Care, Better Value Indicators&#148;, which I have mentioned umpteen times before, and which showed that if everyone prescribed generic statins the way that the best 25 per cent. of primary care trusts do, we would save &#163;80 million a year.

I shall finish with a quote from Nick Bosanquet in an article about top-up fees, which I hope will be passed across the Minister&#146;s desk as well. He said:</p>
<a name="81014h0006.htm_brev5"><a name="08101444000443"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Top-up payments should be regarded as an interim solution until we are prepared to reform the lop-sided rationing problems of the NHS. NICE is in effect applying an intensive form of rationing to one corner of health spending. NICE claims that it is making these decisions on the grounds of affordability, but there is no connection at all between the denial of these therapies and the financial state of the system. Nor are patients in neglected areas getting more because cancer patients are getting less. NICE is intensively rationing cancer drugs while large areas of inefficiency, waste and duplication have had no attention at all.&#148;</p>

 It is a great privilege to work with you again, Mr. Cummings. A long time ago, we worked together in a very different place. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) on securing the debate, and I assure those present, particularly <i>Hansard</i><i></i>staff, that I shall do my best not to use words of more than three syllables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000206">I am not a health professional, as many colleagues present are. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) spoke about the Merck Manual; the only Merc I ever had was a 1990 230 estate, but that was an automatic, not a manual. My background is in coal mining, and I was once a care worker for elderly people, but I have spent a lifetime in a family that has been devastated by muscular dystrophy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000207">Within a month of coming to this place, I was asked whether I would be prepared to chair the all-party group for muscular dystrophy, and I was pleased to take up that opportunity. I want to put on record my thanks and the thanks of those involved with the parliamentary group, as well as campaigners on muscular dystrophy, for the great response that we have had so far from the Minister. She has shown real good will in trying to take forward the campaign with which we are involved. I thank her in particular for giving us access to the civil servants in the research department whom we met during the recess. They were very positive about their role in helping us to maximise opportunities to develop good-quality research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000208">I shall spoil the party a little bit now, though, by telling the Minister that I am going to write to her about an issue that has arisen as a result of those meetings. It is ludicrous that Government money that had been allocated to the development of drugs to help people with this disease has been classed as underspend because it has not been spent within a certain time scale, and will probably be clawed back. That money has been underspent not because people have not wanted to use it, but because the phasing of what they have been doing did not work as they thought it would. It is not rocket science, but it is research science. Surely, the essence of research is that things develop in a way that is uncertain. Things sometimes go much quicker than expected and sometimes much slower. That money is a relatively small amount in the Department&#146;s global sum, and the  <br>

fact that it has not been spent within the expected time scale should not be a way of getting money back into the Department. It should be kept by the groups doing the research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000209">I have received information from the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign that I want to take hon. Members through to inform them of the current situation. There are more than 60 types of muscular dystrophy and related neuromuscular conditions&#151;rare conditions for which there is no cure. That shows the importance of the research work being done. It is estimated that such conditions affect more than 1,000 children and adults for every 1 million of the UK&#146;s population, and conditions can be genetic or acquired. Some types, such as Duchenne&#146;s, are aggressive, causing muscular deterioration and wasting. They are responsible for respiratory and cardiac problems and, sadly, result in premature death, particularly in young boys. Other conditions can cause lifelong disability. My sister was 53 when she died and my brother was 48. They had lifelong disabilities, but not very long lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000210">The campaign invests about &#163;3 million of its own money in research, care support services, muscular centres, development networks, and in sharing information and resources. It has pioneered research into treatments and cures for nearly 50 years, but it cannot do everything on its own. The House, the Department, the Government and the Minister all have a responsibility, and I know that the Minister takes her responsibility very seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000211">Last December, the campaign produced a report called &#147;Building on the Foundations: Establishing a Specialist Neuromuscular Service across England&#148;, which found classic disparities such as those that the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) mentioned. In the north of England, where we have a strong lead in muscular research, the average survival rate for patients with Duchenne&#146;s muscular dystrophy is 30 years, whereas in the south-west it is, sadly, only 18 years. That is a huge difference in life expectancy. The report also found that two out of three primary care trusts do not support a muscle clinic for either adults or children, which means that many patients do not receive the special care that they need. It also found that the service is dependent on a handful of world-class specialists. What will we do when those people retire or move on to another area and there is no on left to come behind them? We must take control and embed what they are doing into a national structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000212">Last month, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign carried out the &#147;State of the Nation&#148; survey as part of its muscle week. The survey focused specifically on access to specialist services, quality of life and the impact of living with a rare disease. There were 1,000 respondents, of whom 50 per cent. said that their experience of the diagnosis process was either poor or very poor. The results showed that half of patients have not seen a physiotherapist and that half do not have access to a specialist neuromuscular consultant. The survey also found that 80 per cent. of patients do not visit a specialist centre or receive specialist care for their condition. The campaign believes that those problems can be put right, and we seek commitments from the Department on its recommendations. It would be great if the Minister said yes today, but I do not suppose that she has the authority to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08101444000213">The campaign recommends that we should, as a matter of course, designate specialist muscular services within the Department of Health&#146;s specialised services  <br>

definition set, so that specialised commissioning groups can be set up across England. Each such group, and responsible bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, should follow the lead of the South West SCG and carry out a comprehensive review of the provision of specialist services. Let us know what is going on out there. We should also ensure that every person who is affected by muscular dystrophy has access to a care co-ordinator or key worker who can take a lead on their behalf with the care team and provide them with support, information and a regular review of their care plan. We need more. Far be it from me to fall out with my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), but the truth is this: socialism might put this matter right, but whether there is socialism, capitalism, a laissez-faire approach or a middle-of-the-road system, those people are not being looked after properly, and we need a system that does look after them properly.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) on his introduction to the debate. Indeed, all hon. Members have spoken in a well-informed and, at times, moving way. I apologise for the manner of my delivery, as I have a heavy cold, which, fortunately, is neither rare nor complex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000215">It is a principle of NHS care that care should depend on the severity of a condition rather than its rarity. No one should be discriminated against simply because their complaint is rare or complex. In reality, rare conditions have fewer lobbyists&#151;there are many in this Chamber, but not so many in the outside world. Rare conditions are less well understood, are generally more expensive to treat and interest the world of pharmacy and commercial medicine less because they do not hold the prospect of such lucrative gain. Often, the therapies and treatments for such conditions are less certain and are harder to test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000216">In such a world of limited resources&#151;the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) talked about rationing, as he does in many debates&#151;there is a utilitarian argument that would lead to the deprioritisation of such illnesses and complaints. However, I do not think that the NHS was ever meant to be run along utilitarian principles. To address the natural effects of resource pressure, the Government have wisely allocated the commissioning of services for rarer and complex conditions to special commissioning groups, using pools and top-sliced funds from PCTs. That follows the Carter review&#146;s recommendations, which I think everyone in the Chamber broadly supports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000217">We also have a national commissioning body to deal with those things that cannot even be financed on a regional basis. That has a sound objective: to ensure an even pattern of commissioning, which we clearly do not seem to have at the moment, given hon. Members&#146; contributions. I support that strategy, but it does not quite get us out of the woods, for two reasons. First, there will be an understandable tension over budgets between the regional commissioning bodies and the individual PCTs, and I have certainly seen PCT minutes that express anxiety about what the specialist commissioning groups might do. Secondly, specialist commissioning groups and PCTs might have different expectations of each other, as patients often access services that are  <br>

commissioned by both&#151;physiotherapy is a prime example, particularly for patients with muscular dystrophy. We must admit that, even with regional commissioning groups on a specialist basis, they will not all follow the same pattern of commissioning and are not bound by an absolutely fixed list, although there are definitions on what counts as specialist commissioning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000218">The postcode lottery will not be absolutely abolished by the Government&#146;s proposals, but I support them and think that they will make significant progress. I am encouraged by the reports I hear from the north-west region, where the specialist commissioning organisation has a budget that is almost as big as that of the largest PCT and is making appreciable strides, not only in producing new facilities and arrangements, but in giving positive guidance with regard to therapies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para23"><a name="08101444000219">The issue of drugs is the most acute issue that has been raised today, particularly the orphan and ultra-orphan drugs. We ought not underestimate the fact that controlling the drug price is an important issue for PCTs in delivering value for money across the piece. I am familiar with the National Audit Office report on that, which pointed to wide disparities in the efficiency of PCTs in using their drugs budget. I would like to quote from Sophie Christie, the chief executive of Birmingham East and North PCT, whose views on that issue were included in the Library&#146;s debate pack. She puts it rather nicely, and certainly better than I could:</p>
<a name="81014h0006.htm_brev6"><a name="08101444000444"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The delegation of the rare and the expensive to the service provides a real test of our ability to commission collaboratively with a focus on outcome.

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08101444000221">Clearly, the procedure currently being followed is unsatisfactory. Hon. Members have mentioned the exceptional cases procedure, and the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West made absolutely clear that it was never intended to do the job. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) made it absolutely clear that, as it is currently being conducted, it is a hopelessly confused process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08101444000222">Even using guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence does not resolve the issue because it can always be argued that NICE has neither sufficient data on those rare conditions, nor the resources and time to test within a reasonable timescale. In any case, hon. Members have consistently been told by Ministers over the years that the absence of NICE approval is not a trump card for the PCT. It is a difficult and fraught area, and the specialist and exceptional nature of orphan drugs is probably the reason why there is special legislation from the EU and the USA on that subject. It is a profoundly difficult area for PCTs, which have to made a profoundly difficult judgment call. That is why the help of the specialist commissioning groups can be so important in producing the standardisation that hon. Members would like to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08101444000223">However, there is also a role for the charity and voluntary sector, which is often the prime advocate of better provision for people with all kinds of conditions, including rare ones.

advocating what is reasonable. Its role is so crucial to the piece, both in fighting battles on behalf of patients and educating the wider NHS. That applies not only to the most critical and life-threatening conditions, which have largely been dealt with in the debate, but to less-threatening conditions. I was recently approached by someone in my constituency who suffered from a disease called Fibromyalgia, which had to be explained to me. That person found that there was wholesale ignorance of the disease in all parts of the NHS, and many parts had been accessed about the condition. There was a real need for the voluntary sector to fill the vacuum in educating the professionals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para28"><a name="08101444000225">Although the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) attempted to give a definition of a rare and complex disease by stating that a GP would see one example per year, there are a number of definitions. There is an official definition, but the prevalence criteria used in national commissioning is one per 50,000. Interestingly, that varies from the EU definition of fewer than five per 10,000. Many diseases with a prevalence of fewer than five per 10,000 do not require special arrangements for health services to be commissioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para29"><a name="08101444000226">None the less, there are many thousands of different diseases, many of which are suffered by only a few hundred people in the UK, and even fewer than that in some instances. Collectively, however, the numbers can be much higher. For example, recent research shows that between 30 and 50 per cent. of all cancer cases could be classified as rare as they fall outside the more common and highly publicised cancers such as colon, breast, lung, prostrate and bowel cancer, which we hear about frequently in the press.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="81014h0006.htm_para30"><a name="08101444000227">One prominent feature that I do not think has been highlighted strongly enough in the debate is that those suffering from rare and complex diseases often feel a tremendous sense of isolation&#151;more so than if they were suffering from a more common disease. There might be few survivors and no available support networks, the GP might know little about the condition and it is often difficult to get accurate information about the prognosis or effective treatment. Of course, availability to much wider networks on the internet has made a significant impact on that problem, but many of those people do not necessarily have access to the internet and might not be comfortable joining support networks in that way. The isolation, the feeling of fear and the lack of information are significant factors.</p>

even 30 years ago when I was training, the newest surgical services were provided on a regional basis and in specialist centres. None the less, the aim of the arrangements is to purchase specialist services, ensure fair access to clinically effective services where patient numbers are small and a critical mass of patients is needed to achieve the best outcomes, maintain clinical confidence, sustain the training of specialist staff, ensure cost effectiveness in provision and made the best use of scarce resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000229">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West rightly commented that local decision making should not prejudice the situation of people with rare or complex conditions and raised the fact that there is considerable variation in the applications to PCTs for exceptional cases. There are wide variations in the review of those and in the clinical input of those review panels and the decisions made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000230">What is causing the increasing concern that we are seeing among the public and in the press are these huge variations and indeed the lack of fairness and transparency associated with them. We must have right of access extended to specialist services. It is very important that people have confidence and trust in a system that is making what could be life or death decisions about them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para3"><a name="08101444000231">The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West also said that the Department of Health and NICE should work together better. I find it extraordinarily frustrating, and I think that my frustration will be shared by many people, that NICE and the Department of Health do not work more effectively together. It staggers me that everybody wants this process speeded up, to be more efficient and to be more transparent, but the continuing frustration is that that improvement never seems to happen. I am sure that the Minister will address the issue of why it takes so long to get what feel like quite simple decisions or simple actions taken to make this process work more quickly and more effectively for the patients involved; the delay makes me very impatient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000232">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) highlighted the issue affecting one of his constituents and, as ever, personal experiences and personal stories are particularly poignant. He also mentioned another source of frustration, that Pfizer was prepared to share the cost of the drug that his constituent required, but that offer was not taken into account by NICE. I and many other people would like to see a much more common-sense approach taken by NICE. The fact that Pfizer would share the cost of the drug is relevant and should have some impact on NICE&#146;s decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para5"><a name="08101444000233">I would like to congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on his excellent work on the Rarer Cancers Forum. However, although he has clearly felt a wave of socialism around the place recently, I would suggest that nationalising the drug companies might see a halt in any progress that has been made in the innovation and research carried out by them, particularly in relation to PNH&#151;I leave the full pronunciation of that condition to the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000236">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest rightly raised the issue of research, which had not been mentioned until that point. The hon. Member for Norwich, North talked about people with rare and complex conditions punching above their weight; I think that he is absolutely right that they do punch above their weight. Nevertheless, there are concerns about the lack of incentives within the system, not only for research but for diagnosis and treatment innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08101444000237">The hon. Member for Norwich, North also talked about some obvious ways of saving money to pay for new and expensive treatments. I could feel a certain tension&#151;an anticipation&#151;as we heard from him that the way that he would finally solve the problem was through paying for some of these drugs, which I well appreciate is not easy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08101444000238">I would also like to congratulate the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) on his work on muscular dystrophy. It was very useful to have the example of one particular rare and complex condition. He also highlighted the fact that, even within the group of people who suffer from a rare disease such as muscular dystrophy, that rare disease can itself be further split up, into even rarer subsections of the same disease type. It is very sad that the experiences of people with muscular dystrophy have been poor, in terms of the diagnosis and treatment that they have received. He then widened the debate away from the issue of drugs, which was the focus at the start of the debate this morning, into the wider and important societal and care issues surrounding rare diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000239">I would like to finish by asking the Minister to address a few a few points, in particular the view that was expressed that PCTs are out of their depth; the issue about their decision making on exceptional panels, and the significant issues that surround some of the ignorance among those in general practice, even if that ignorance is not surprising given that these conditions so rarely emerge. Nevertheless, the issues of training, education and, just as importantly, continual professional development are important and it would be encouraging to hear from the Minister what she is doing to ensure that those issues are addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08101444000240">It is also of note that since 1997 there has been an increase in mortality for those people with rarer cancers. Although that increase can be partially attributed to the lack of knowledge among physicians of the symptoms of rarer cancers and also the late presentation of such symptoms, it would be interesting to know what the Minister is doing about this issue and whether she has any ideas in the pipeline about how to reduce the mortality for those people with rarer cancers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000241">The next point that I would like to make is that there is a European directive to incentivise the investment in research and development in orphan medicines for rare and life-threatening diseases, which I understand has had some success. Since its adoption, 22 products have received a marketing authorisation. Overall, that is  still a comparatively low number, but given the disproportionately low survival rates for rarer cancers, does the Minister agree that more needs to be done to incentivise drug research?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000242">Rarer cancers often require treatment by drugs that have not yet been approved by NICE or rejected on cost, requiring patients to plead the exceptionality of their case, as we have heard on numerous occasions. I know that we have heard a few figures, but perhaps we  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="14 Oct 2008">

have not heard so many this morning. I would like to give one other figure; 5,000 patients have been forced to demonstrate their exceptionality in the last 20 months, in order to receive cancer treatments that are not recommended by NICE. Of those 5,000 patients, 1,300 had their request rejected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000243">I think that it was the hon. Member for Northavon who said that what finally gets to people is this battling away against the system. Not only do they have to live with a rare disease and with the isolation that surrounds the fact that they have a rare illness&#151;there is fear and lack of information&#151;but they also have to do battle against a system that they do not entirely understand. In fairness to the Minister, I think that she would agree with me that that system is indeed not understood by her or by the Department of Health. The lack of fairness and transparency makes the situation even worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000244">In the past, NICE has proposed an ultra-orphan drugs evaluation committee, to undertake an appraisal of medicine for very rare diseases. I understand that Ministers have received NICE&#146;s report on appraising ultra-orphan drugs and have concluded that it is not appropriate at this time to establish a separate appraisal system for such drugs. Perhaps the Minister could bring me up to date on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000245">We have had a debate today on exceptional and rare conditions. Special cases require special treatment; exceptional medical conditions need exceptional treatment. I know that the Minister agrees with that view and has much sympathy with it. However, what we want to hear from her now is what action she will be taking.</p>

In fact, all hon. Members here today have congratulated us on that progress.</p>

continues to promote these causes vigorously and determinedly, with the help of stakeholders and sponsors. It is right to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000250">I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words about the Carter review of arrangements for the commissioning of specialised services, which was introduced in April 2007. The arrangements, which have been in place for 18 months, are making significant progress in improving the quality of specialised commissioning at regional and supra-regional levels and, as a consequence, are improving access to specialised services for local people. Parts of the country, including the area in which my hon. Friend serves, which had hitherto been notably weak in their approach to commissioning specialised services, have improved rapidly as a result of the Carter reforms. From next year, we expect that more services than ever before will be commissioned by specialised commissioning groups through primary care trusts&#146; pooled budgets. Additionally, the new arrangements allow the national health service to take collective and consistent action across the country to pursue areas of agreed priority. A good example is work now commencing in SCGs to plan for improved levels of renal transplantation, in response to the recently published report of the Organ Donation Taskforce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000251">Another example of the strengthened national approach that the national specialised commissioning group has delivered is provided in the agreement of all SCGs to adopt the unified commissioning approach in &#147;Target Therapies for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Adults&#148;. Adoption of a national policy by all SCGs will mean substantial increases in investment by some of them to raise standards to those of the best and to provide a level playing field for patients across England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000252">Our world-class commissioning programme is designed to raise ambitions for a new form of commissioning that has not yet been developed or implemented in a comprehensive way anywhere in the world. World-class commissioning is about delivering better health and well-being for the population, improving health outcomes and, of course, meeting the huge challenge of reducing health inequalities. As part of the programme, a commissioning assurance system has been launched this year. It is a national system to hold commissioners to account, to reward performance, and to ensure that health outcomes improve. As the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) said, we are running a pilot with the north-west SCG to design a national scheme for holding commissioners of specialised services to account, and for encouraging better co-operation and co-ordination between PCTs and SCGs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000253">Hon. Members may be aware that the Government have actively supported the provision of high-quality treatment services for many rare conditions and complex procedures through the arrangements. Some 40 highly specialised services are currently commissioned nationally through the national commissioning group. I approved the national commissioning from April this year of a proton-beam therapy service for complex and difficult- to-treat patients with rare cancers, and of an islet cell transplantation service for diabetic patients who suffer recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia.</p>

matters, released a statement last week that confirmed approval for the national commissioning of a service for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria&#151;perhaps I should have said &#147;PNH&#148;, as I obviously did not see those words coming. It will ensure a high-quality service for patients who would benefit most from high-cost drugs, which are estimated to cost some &#163;25 million a year. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) raised that matter. I congratulate Dr. Peter Hillman, the professor who is leading the group in Leeds, and can say to the hon. Gentleman that, yes, the drug will be funded before the service commences in April. Dr. Hillman has been important in our making that decision.</p>

The report describes a health service that delivers fair, personalised, effective and safe care. Lord Darzi calls his final report an enabling document because it sets out more than 90 commitments from the Department of Health that will help the NHS to deliver high-quality health care that puts the patient at the centre of the organisation and meets the challenges of the 21st century. Its time is overdue. The time is right to bring quality into the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08101444000256">I am aware of colleagues inside and outside this Chamber who have discussed quality over the years.

I can say to him before seeing the letter that I will meet with him, but also that I believe a review is necessary. Let me consider that in preparation for our meeting. The director of national specialised commissioning has been in discussion with the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign about its concerns, so some progress has already been made, but there is obviously more to do.</p>

The differences that have been described today by hon. Members are not acceptable in a modern, national health service. We must address the points that were raised so powerfully in my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution. We must work with NICE, which is independent&#151;its whole point is its independence&#151;on the speed of delivery of what are obviously complex issues that are challenging to health clinicians, politicians and economists in the health field. I believe that every patient in the United Kingdom recognises that they have a national health service that is there to be a safeguard and to give treatment but also to do research. Bringing together the work of the NHS and the Medical Research Council will be only to the betterment of patients in the future, and future research and knowledge will be used effectively.</p>

 Mr. Cummings, I thank you for your chairmanship of this debate, which is important for residents in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies. I thank the Minister for coming along today to respond to the debate. I welcome him to his new position and wish him every success in his role as a Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para30"><a name="08101444000266">The M3 motorway and network roads are at the heart of the reason why, over a number of decades, Basingstoke has become not just a great place to live, but a great place to run businesses. We have more than 60,000 jobs in the borough of Basingstoke and Deane, making it one of the top 10 centres for employment in the south-east. Many companies are located there because of our communication network, our highly skilled labour force and, importantly, because we have superb residential communities throughout north Hampshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para31"><a name="08101444000267">We are proud to be home to many household name companies, including Macmillan books, Motorola, Sony, the Automobile Association, Game and Barclays: I could go on. The Prime Minister has recognised how important Basingstoke is and has recognised the opportunity it affords to the whole of the south-east of England and the role it could play in helping build the United Kingdom economy into the future. That is perhaps why it has been designated by Ministers as a business growth point, recognising the area&#146;s potential for sustainable economic growth. The South East England Development Agency has recognised the area as just one of eight diamonds for growth: it has been identified as such for its potential to drive economic growth both regionally and nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para32"><a name="08101444000268">On the housing side, the Government have set targets that mean that we are already building 1,000 houses a year in Basingstoke. I understand that they would like even more to be built in future, although I am not sure that market conditions or the residents will favour that demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="81014h0007.htm_para33"><a name="08101444000269">The Government are right to identify the strengths of the community that I represent, but this can never be a one-way street. No area can accommodate the considerable scale of house building and business growth that is expected in my constituency without the necessary investment in local infrastructure and services. The motorway is the critical element driving the Government&#146;s focus on Basingstoke, both in terms of housing and business targets, yet local residents and local businesses who already use the motorway regularly, or live by it, are experiencing significant congestion and noise pollution. Noise pollution, particularly, has spiralled as a result of growth not just in Basingstoke and Deane, but throughout the south-east region.</p>

The raw facts, which I have gleaned through parliamentary questions, are as follows. Congestion between junctions 6 and 7 has increased by 5,000 vehicles a day over the past 10 years; there have been some slight changes to the signals at junction 6 to maximise traffic flow, but no increase of capacity over that part of the motorway. Junction 6 already operates in excess of capacity, with 100,000 vehicles using it every day. The most sobering  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000272">I am concerned that things look set to become more of a concern for local residents and businesses. There is talk of yet more house building, but in the present conditions the Government&#146;s ambitions in that area may be more limited. There are plans by Southampton airport to double passenger numbers in the next 10 years, which will add further pressure on the motorway that passes through my constituency. All those plans amount to additional vehicles on the M3 and additional noise and congestion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08101444000273">What does that mean for businesses and local residents in my constituency? The Government need to start listening when the chairman of one of the major employers in my constituency&#151;indeed, in the UK&#151;says that:</p>
<a name="81014h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="08101444000446"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;congestion on the M3 in the vicinity of Basingstoke at peak times has reached a level at which it has a significant negative impact on local industry. Indeed, it is likely now to be an important factor in companies&#146; decisions about locating or expanding operations in Basingstoke.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000274">The Government need to listen carefully to such comments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para5"><a name="08101444000275">Basingstoke will not be the diamond for growth, or the growth point that the Government need it to be in these difficult economic times, if employers see the reason that they chose Basingstoke&#151;its location and road networks&#151;becoming a problem rather than an advantage in terms of location. I am sure that the Minister will make himself familiar with the congestion problems suffered by businesses in Reading and will know about some of the actions taken there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000276">For residents, Basingstoke&#146;s attractiveness is as a great place to live and work: 80 per cent. of my constituents live and work in the constituency. However, noise from the motorway has become a growing problem for many of them. As the number of vehicles, both commercial and domestic, grows, so the noise from the motorway grows and affects ever more communities. That direct cost of growth cannot be ignored, but I fear that that has been the position to date&#151;the approach taken to mitigating its effects has been at best patchy. Some remedial work has been done in my constituency. On a nationwide basis, the Government set aside a limited pot to deal with remedial noise measures, primarily through the use of fencing. However, the limited use of such provision in my constituency is causing me a great deal of concern. There has also been a limited use of noise retardant material on the motorway surface, but there is a lack of clarity about how to move that forward to ensure the sort of noise-reduction measures that my residents would like to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para7"><a name="08101444000277">Returning to sound barriers for a moment&#151;I should like the Minister to pick up on this issue&#151;they have been used on a limited basis to deflect noise away from  <br>

residents, but that usage appears somewhat haphazard and is not always co-ordinated, because it is dealt with by the Highways Agency, not the local authority. Some of the worst-affected communities in my constituency are those situated near a sound barrier, where sound has been deflected from one residential area into another. In my closing comments, I shall return to matters that the Minister might want to consider in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para8"><a name="08101444000278">Villages in the east of my constituency are so badly affected by noise that the Highways Agency has acknowledged that, if their population density were greater, they would be eligible for Government support. However, because of the sparseness of those villages&#146; populations, they receive no help at all. That method of allocating money is not an equitable and fair way of recognising an extreme problem for some of the communities in my constituency. Some might say that that discriminates against rural communities in areas such as Basingstoke.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000279">Many already appreciate the great scale of the problem locally in Hampshire. The M3 Action campaign has presented a petition with 2,000 signatures calling for action to be taken to reduce noise and congestion on the M3. Hampshire county council has already identified that &#163;300 million of improvements are needed to our roads in Basingstoke, and that &#163;160 million is needed to improve reliability and safety on the M3.</p>

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="08101444000280"><a name="81014h0008.htm_spnew0"><a name="08101444000530"><b>Mr. Mark Oaten (Winchester) (LD):</b>
 I entirely support the hon. Lady&#146;s comments. My constituency borders hers, and many of her comments about the M3 apply in Winchester.</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for his support for the campaign. The issue affects many of the constituencies through which the M3 runs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para10"><a name="08101444000282">Hampshire county council believes that it is critical to improve junction 6 if house building figures are to be sustainable in the county, and that was a key part of its submission on the south-east plan. The highways department clearly recognises the problem, but there is a lack of clarity as to how it fits into ministerial priorities for Hampshire. The council has made it clear that growth is conditional on the infrastructure being funded, with the M3 being pivotal. Without that investment, it is difficult to see how the Government&#146;s house building targets, and their plans for business development in my constituency, can be sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000283">Will the Minister take the opportunity afforded by the debate to confirm that, as detailed in his Department&#146;s answer to my parliamentary question on 15 January 2007, by 2010 both carriageways of the M3 between junctions 5 and 6 will have noise retardant material in all lanes? Will he tell the House what consideration is being given to lowering speed limits, not just on the M3, but generally, as a way of reducing noise? I understand that cutting the speed limit to 50 mph could have a considerable impact on noise levels, as well as cutting accidents and congestion. The Minister will be aware that that technique is used on the M25.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000284">Will the Minister undertake to consider how noise barriers, such as those that his Department commissioned in my constituency at the Hatch, can be better co-ordinated to ensure that noise is not just bounced around into neighbouring residential areas? Perhaps there should be an obligation on local authorities to ensure that sufficient  <br>

noise protection is in place before new house building is allowed in the vicinity of established motorways such as the M3. Again, neighbouring residential areas have significant problems in that respect. Most importantly, will the Minister give an undertaking to identify how improvements to junction 6 of the M3 will be funded to cut accidents and rat running through neighbouring communities, where drivers try to find ways of avoiding the long tailbacks at peak times?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000285">Basingstoke businesses and residents need to hear from the Government that they understand the problem and that action will be taken. They cannot be expected to take on the burden of Government-set targets for businesses and house building with no clear way of funding the necessary improvements to our motorway. We look forward to the Minister&#146;s response and to hearing firm proposals for his Department&#146;s plans to support Basingstoke residents and businesses. We need to hear what action will be taken, not just more kind words.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend and neighbour, the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller), on her choice of subject for this important debate this morning, and on the eloquent way in which she made the case for improvements in congestion and noise pollution on the M3. I want to follow briefly in her slipstream and to add a footnote to what she said. I pay tribute to her M3 action campaign and her presentation of a petition earlier this year. Everyone in Basingstoke and Deane borough is grateful for her campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000287">My constituents in Beggarwood suffer from exactly the same problems that my hon. Friend mentioned, but further east the villages of Dummer and North Waltham suffer from constant and growing background noise from the M3. As my hon. Friend said, it is now a much busier road than it was some 10 years ago, so the amount of noise that it generates is higher.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000288">A footnote on congestion is that I was caught on the eastbound M3 on Friday evening and spent an hour in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency, which I had not planned to do. The road&#146;s capacity is being tested, but the point that I want to leave with the Minister is that people want to know when. They understand the problems of departmental budgets and pressure on public expenditure, but they want some idea of when they might get some relief. Perhaps the Minister could share with us his and the Highways Agency&#146;s priorities, and when the sort of measures to which my hon. Friend referred might be introduced. It would help them to live with the problems that they currently endure if they had some knowledge that help was around the corner. Any information that the Minister can share with us would be appreciated. I welcome him on his appointment and his shortly-to-be-delivered maiden speech in his new capacity. I hope that what he has to say will be welcomed in and around the M3 corridor.</p>

pollution and congestion on the M3. I know that it is a matter of concern, and the hon. Members for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) and for North-West Hampshire also contributed to the discussion. I am aware of the keen interest that the hon. Member for Basingstoke has shown with her M3 action campaign and the presentation of a 2,000-signature petition earlier this year. I hope that my response will clarify the route forward by dealing with some of the issues that we understand are of concern to the hon. Lady&#146;s constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000290">The M3 is part of the core motorway and strategic road network, providing a link from south-west London to Southampton. It is an important key road corridor for long and medium-distance traffic travelling between Southampton and London. I am delighted that the hon. Lady endorsed the Prime Minister&#146;s forward thinking and the importance of Basingstoke in the decisions that have been taken. It is an important part of the M3 route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000291">Protecting and enhancing the environment is an increasingly important role for the Highways Agency, and that includes mitigating the impact of traffic noise wherever practicable. The Highways Agency is committed to taking action by March 2011 on those sites listed in <i>Hansard</i> in November 1999&#151;the <i>Hansard </i>list. Under the national &#163;5 million ring-fenced annual budget, the Highways Agency has installed acoustic barriers at various locations on the M3 in the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency since 2001 on the basis of priority according to their noise severity rating at a total cost of approximately &#163;8.5 million. They include Hatch Warren, Black Dam and Hatch caravan site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08101444000292">The 2007 comprehensive spending review confirmed that resurfacing of concrete roads for noise mitigation reasons ahead of maintenance need would not be allocated funding. Traditional surfacing with hot-rolled asphalt uses high-quality stone rolled into the top layer, but quieter surfacing requires that higher quality stone throughout the full depth of the wearing course leading to an increased environmental impact at quarry sites. The hon. Lady will appreciate that there is environmental impact from that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000293">I am sure that the hon. Lady is aware that the Highways Agency is working closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the production of noise maps and action plans in line with the Environmental Noise (England) Regulations 2006. The maps for England's roads were first published on 16 May 2008 and DEFRA is working with the Highways Agency and local authorities to develop traffic noise action plans. Those plans will be used to review the priorities and measures to provide noise mitigation solutions. Funding levels and responsibility for delivery, when required, have yet to be agreed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000294">The action plan is expected to identify practical and cost-effective solutions for reducing road noise. It will include a cost benefit analysis of measures to ensure they are sustainable and estimates of the reduction in the number of people affected by excessive noise as a result of the proposed measures. The Highways Agency is also developing a forward strategy for noise mitigation that will include implementation of a new system for identifying and prioritising problem sites. As I am sure the hon. Lady appreciates, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on that until the work is complete and I have fully considered the region&#146;s advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000295">As has been identified by right hon. and hon. Members, congestion generally occurs during morning peak times on the north-bound approach to the M25, south bound on the approach to the M27 at Southampton and at junction 6 at Basingstoke in both directions. We recognise that problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000296">The Command Paper produced in July 2008 by the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West (Ruth Kelly), highlighted locations for potential funding for improvements to the strategic road network. As part of my right hon. Friend&#146;s proposals, she highlighted a number of techniques to get more out of the existing network, such as the dynamic use of hard shoulders to provide additional capacity. Following the Command Paper, two studies are now underway to investigate the feasibility of traffic using the hard shoulder during peak periods on two stretches of the M3 between junctions 2 to 4A, and junctions 9 to 14.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08101444000297">To allow maximum to access and egress from Basingstoke, the Highways Agency has programmed the traffic signals at junction 6 of the M3 to give priority to clear the queuing traffic exiting the motorway and to reduce the hazard of vehicles queuing on the main carriageway. As the hon. Lady said, that could make a significant difference. Delays into Basingstoke town centre on the A30 and A339 are due to the high volume of traffic on all approaches to the Black Dam roundabout, which links the local network with junction 6 of the M3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08101444000298">I noticed that the hon. Lady talked about the sustainability of jobs, homes and housing. Equally, we need sustainability in terms of traffic and transport options for people going to and from work, home, schools and so on. That is why it is important that we work collectively on sustainable solutions and do not put all our eggs in one basket. Strategically, of course, although that transport corridor&#151;the M3&#151;is important to Basingstoke, there are other options, which I will come on to shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08101444000299">A scheme to reduce the hazard of traffic queuing on the main carriageway is currently being worked on. The scheme will include extending the off-slip roads at junction 6 by using the hard shoulder. A study programmed for 2009-10 will model the wider road network around junction 6 and assess the impact of the growth point status of Basingstoke that was announced by the Department for Communities and Local Government in October 2006, as the hon. Lady noted. That study will include further options for improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para26"><a name="08101444000300">As I have said, there needs to be sustainable solutions that take all parties and all stakeholders into account, which is why the Highways Agency is working with all the local planning authorities along the M3 to reduce traffic demand in relation to future developments. Measures will concentrate on providing workable alternatives to car-based travel, principally by improving public transport and facilities for walking and cycling. I am well aware of the problems concerning the location of junction 6 and of coming off there and meeting the Black Dam roundabout, which I know has been phased to make the situation easier. Of course, there are substantial business and residential developments off that road, but I am well aware that Basingstoke station is close to that area. Therefore, when we talk about sustainability for housing or jobs, we must consider the multitude of options available. We have been working closely with local authorities to consider how we can take options forward.</p>

 I hope, Mr. Cummings, you do not mind me mentioning something slightly tangential to this debate. The Minister raised the issue of the station and he may be aware that we were promised an additional station in Chineham. Am I to take it from his comments today that that proposal is firmly back on the table?</p>

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="08101444000302"><a name="81014h0008.htm_spnew4"><a name="08101444000535"><b>Paul Clark:</b>
 What the hon. Lady can certainly take from my comments is that we look at all possible and affordable options. That is where we have to be. The programme on the various road surfacing and changes that are ahead, which I shall run through in response to her final points, obviously has to be subject to the funding available. The hon. Lady has said, and rightly so, that we have specifically identified a ring-fenced budget for some of the work. Equally, she will be aware that there are many demands on that budget from the length and breadth of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para27"><a name="08101444000303">On the three specific areas that the hon. Lady raised and in terms of looking for whisper quiet surfacing and so on, we are committed to a programme of working through priority areas and what finances permit. Further resurfacing work will take place between junctions 5 and 7 in 2008-10 and, funding permitting, further work on quieter surfacing is scheduled for between junctions 5 and 6 by April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para28"><a name="08101444000304">On a co-ordinated approach to noise barriers, far more joint working is needed. Some &#163;8.5 million has been put in by the Department for noise barriers along road sections that fall within the Basingstoke constituency. The hon. Lady will also be aware that others have been agreed with developers through the planning process and in co-ordination with themselves. I understand and hear clearly what she is saying about the potential knock-on affects in other areas. That is why there needs to be joint working across local authorities and planning agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="81014h0008.htm_para29"><a name="08101444000305">Finally, on the co-ordinated approach to junction 6, I have already indicated that work will take place on the off-slip roads and on ensuring that the hard shoulder can accommodate and make the access and egress from junction 6 into Basingstoke safer. Overall, in terms of flows, we must take all possible options into account and look at sustainable transport measures to meet the needs of what is obviously a thriving community in Basingstoke, where there are strong jobs and strong possibilities for further development. Together, we need to find a solution to making sure that the traffic of people to jobs and schools in the community continues to flow.</p>

 I am pleased to welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to his new responsibilities; I wish him well in his post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para0"><a name="08101444000309">There is increasing recognition of the urgency of the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, so I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject at this crucial time. Concern about the situation is shared by hon. Members on both sides of the House, as the attendance at today&#146;s debate shows. It is also deeply felt among the large number of Sri Lankans who have settled in the UK. In London alone, there are more than 150,000 Sri Lankan Tamils, who since their arrival here have made and continue to make a distinguished contribution to our public life. Their concern about recent developments was made perfectly clear last Monday, when 6,000 of them marched on Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000310">Those worries are increasingly finding an international voice. I note the recent comments by the European Commissioner for External Relations and by the UN Secretary-General, which clearly acknowledged the seriousness of the present situation. I also welcome the recent statement issued by my right hon. Friend Lord Malloch-Brown and by my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik), when he was an International Development Minister. That statement acknowledges the gravity of the situation. However, we need to say and do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000311">The current humanitarian crisis must be understood in the context of two interrelated developments: first, the escalation of fighting, particularly since July, between Government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam; and secondly the compulsory withdrawal of UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations, including all their staff, supplies and vehicles, from the northern Vanni region. That measure was issued on 8 September and came into force on 29 September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para3"><a name="08101444000312">Although this debate is on the humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, my remarks will focus on the Vanni region. That does not mean that suffering in Sri Lanka is confined to the Tamil-speaking areas. Like all hon. Members, I read with horror the news of two suicide bombings in Sri Lanka last week in which 30 innocent civilians lost their lives. I am sure that all hon. Members present will join me in condemning the slaughter of innocent civilians wherever and whenever that takes place. None the less, it is fair to say that the costs of war are concentrated in the Tamil-speaking areas of the north.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="08101444000313"><a name="81014h0009.htm_spnew1"><a name="08101444000539"><b>Barry Gardiner (Brent, North) (Lab):</b>
 My right hon. Friend will be aware that until December of last year, about 70 lorries a day of humanitarian aid were going into the north and north-east; in September of this year, that figure fell to zero. Does that not precisely represent the scale of the humanitarian crisis now faced by the displaced people in the north and east of Sri Lanka?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000315">The conflict in Sri Lanka has been as protracted as it is bloody. In a civil war that has spanned more than 25 years, as many as 200,000 lives have been lost. There is, however, reason to believe that the current spate of violence between Government forces and the LTTE in the north, particularly since July 2008, is worse than the conflict that preceded the 2002 ceasefire, and that the Government military campaign has become more brutal and indiscriminate. With that escalation in violence has come a deterioration in the humanitarian situation. I am talking about more than 4,000 people killed since 2006, tens of thousands injured and more than 220,000 displaced. I use the word &#147;displaced&#148; hesitatingly, because for me it does not really capture the seriousness of the situation. It seems to imply a minor and perhaps temporary inconvenience when it really means people being forced to leave their home and all their worldly possessions and abandon their livelihood and then finding themselves lacking adequate shelter, sanitation, clean drinking water and food to feed their children. For some 10,000 families, displacement means living in the open air, living under the trees.</p>

 Does the right hon. Lady agree that included in the 250,000 innocent Tamil civilians are 40,000 children who are suffering now, and that the time has come for NGOs to be allowed back in to deal with humanitarian problems?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para5"><a name="08101444000318">At the same time as the humanitarian situation has worsened, the agencies and bodies that were previously giving people food, offering medical treatment and providing families with things such as mosquito nets, bed linen and sleeping mats have been forced to leave. More and more people have come to rely on international agencies and NGOs to meet their most basic needs, and the compulsory withdrawal of UN and humanitarian agencies denies them that lifeline.</p>

 I congratulate my right hon. Friend on securing the debate. The situation is a catastrophe now. Only today, the Pearaa&#146;ru bridge was blown up by the Sri Lankan Government. That was the one route whereby humanitarian aid was being taken into Vanni. Is it not time for the British Government to act, either by themselves or in co-ordination with the European Union, to tell the Sri Lankan Government that they must stop the bombing of innocent Tamils?</p>

The conflict has not yet precipitated a large-scale epidemic, but with the start of the monsoon season, that remains a real threat, particularly if the violence is prolonged or conditions deteriorate further. Given what my right hon. Friend has said, we can expect that to be the case.</p>

<notus-date day="14" month="10" year="2008" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>14 Oct 2008 : Column 242WH</b><br>
with the burden of war casualties, the role of international aid agencies in the provision of medical treatment becomes even more important. Forcing them to withdraw leaves the Tamils in the precarious position of facing increasing demand for medical treatment and falling capacity to meet that need. Only two weeks ago, M&#233;decins sans Frontières was forced to withdraw from Kilinochchi, despite the fact that there are only 17 qualified doctors working in the whole of the Vanni region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para8"><a name="08101444000323">As with medical services, so too with food supplies. I know that, at the end of September, the British Tamils Forum took up that issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury, in his previous capacity as an International Development Minister. Forced to leave their homes and jobs, thousands are now unable to earn a living. That, coupled with rising food prices&#151;they have risen by 50 per cent. this year alone&#151;and a shortfall in the domestic supply of rice, which is the staple food of islanders, means that the Tamils face a severe food shortage and the prospect of malnutrition and even starvation, without even the assistance of international aid agencies, on which they could previously rely for food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000324">If the situation in the Vanni region is almost unremittingly bleak, so too are its future prospects. Figures that I have obtained from Save the Children indicate that more than 30,000 schoolchildren from 154 schools have been displaced and denied any prospect of an education or a future. They have been denied access to schooling and care that was previously provided by international aid agencies, and I fear that another generation will grow up knowing nothing but the grim reality of war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08101444000325">It is also clear that the time to act is now, before the crisis descends into catastrophe, although given what we have heard today, we are now on the brink of that catastrophe.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Lady on securing the debate and on her speech. Although we are seeing a catastrophe unfold and we need urgent action both from the British Government and the international community in putting pressure on the Sri Lankan Government, this is a story that many of us have watched unfolding for several years now, with the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s unwillingness to allow human rights groups to monitor the undermining of human rights in the Tamil communities and Tamil area of the island. Does the right hon. Lady agree that it is time that the British Government take a much stronger line against the Colombo Government on their failure to allow even human rights monitoring of the conflict in the north and east of the island?</p>

 We are here today to urge the British Government to say and do more. That is undoubtedly the truth, but I also think that the British Government have raised their voice on these matters and it is incumbent on all parties in the House to do that together. It is clear that we are on the brink of catastrophe. That is why the timing of the debate is very important. If the international aid agencies cannot do so, who will ensure that the Tamils have somewhere to sleep, something to eat, access to health services and some security? I fear that it will not be the Government of Sri Lanka, as the hon. Gentleman points out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000328">I am grateful to the high commissioner for providing me with an accurate and up-to-date briefing on the situation. I was pleased to note his acknowledgement that the conflict cannot be solved through military means. He also reaffirmed his full commitment to finding a lasting political solution. I know that hon. Members endorse that position as being eminently sensible, and that point has been made time and again in previous debates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000329">None the less, it seems to me that the Sri Lankan Government&#146;s priority is not to address the humanitarian situation or to work to restore the ceasefire but, on the back of the their military successes in the east, to achieve a decisive military victory in the north. Forced withdrawal can be understood only in the broader context of what Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and International Crisis Group have described as</p>
<a name="81014h0009.htm_brev0"><a name="08101444000447"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a quite deliberate and sustained government campaign to vilify and intimidate international agencies and their staff&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000330">That the press is not free in Sri Lanka is well known. Dissenting voices are frequently subject to harassment, physical attacks and even assassination. Less well known is the fact that international aid agencies are subject to similar pressures. In preparing for today&#146;s debate, I spoke with a number of aid agency representatives, and I was shocked but not surprised by their reluctance to speak out publicly on the situation in the north, in part for fear of Government reprisals. However, in addition to their vital humanitarian functions, the agencies act as the eyes of the world. In August alone, some 1,750 people in the Vanni contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross to make allegations of human rights abuses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000331">Provoked by suicide bombs, freed from the constraining gaze of the international community and emboldened by their apparent successes in the east, I fear that the Government of Sri Lanka may have deceived themselves into believing that they can press home their advantage with a decisive military victory in the north, and thereby achieve a permanent solution. However, there can be no military solution. Until the underlying political grievances are addressed, some form of violent resistance is almost certain. The Government of Sri Lanka cannot indefinitely control and pacify the Tamil areas in the north.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="81014h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000332">The only long-term solution will be a political one, achieved through inclusive political negotiations that satisfy the legitimate aspirations of all communities in Sri Lanka. In short, it means genuine devolution to the Tamil-speaking areas in the north and the east. Genuine negotiations can begin only when a ceasefire has been established, so restoration of the ceasefire must be an urgent priority for the Government of Sri Lanka.</p>

Under that ceasefire, proposals were made for proper devolution and an autonomous Tamil province. Only under a ceasefire can meaningful negotiations proceed and a solution be found. However, although such a prospect is obviously urgent it seems more distant than ever. Meanwhile, suffering in the Vanni region continues unabated. Any approach must therefore be twofold. On one hand, urgent action must be taken to tackle the immediate humanitarian situation. In my view, that must include the Government allowing access for aid organisations and ensuring that aid reaches those who need it. On the other, the Government of Sri Lanka, being the party that formally withdrew from the agreement, must make a genuine and sustained effort to re-establish a ceasefire, stem the increase in violence, and return to talks about peace.</p>

We have taken the lead in international efforts to tackle global poverty, driven by our desire to see social justice and equality on a global scale. Since the Department for International Development was created in 1997, it has become a world-renowned development agency and a key actor in the global system. By 2010, the Government will have trebled the aid budget in real terms since 1997 and put the UK on course to deliver the United Nations gold standard by spending 0.7 per cent. of gross national income on aid by 2013, which is two years ahead of the European target.</p>

Although the world is understandably focused on the global financial situation, we cannot ignore the plight of the most vulnerable. There is a real risk that efforts to eradicate global poverty will be undermined by global financial and commodity price crises, threatening progress made on meeting the UN&#146;s millennium development goals that aim to make poverty history.

Only a few weeks ago, we sent a humanitarian expert to assess the situation and to see what further help is needed. On the basis of his findings in Vavuniya and Jaffna, I am pleased to announce that DFID is providing an additional &#163;2.5 million to support the efforts of the ICRC and other UN agencies and NGOs.

 Before the Minister talks about the tsunami, a simple message could be sent to the Sri Lankan Government.

It cannot continue to persecute people simply because they have opposing views. Similarly, in the south, there have been restrictions on the freedom of expression, with journalists and newspaper distribution agents intimidated and sometimes killed. Three democratically elected MPs have been killed in the past few years, and many ordinary people have been reported as disappeared or have simply been killed.</p>

 It is a pity that a Minister is not here at the moment, but I am sure that one will turn up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08101444000385">I did not seek this debate because there is an immediate need to make decisions about the testing of cosmetics on animals. A set of decisions has already been made, and I am delighted that we are now moving away from the testing of cosmetics on animals. I raise this topic because I want to point out some of the conclusions that flow from that fact and to highlight some of the philosophical issues that need to be debated as we move forward over the coming years because they have been too little debated and discussed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08101444000386">It is evident that there is no obvious set of dividing lines. In this area, we are dealing with things that are continuums of one kind or another. To illustrate, let me start with the supposed distinction between cosmetics and household goods. Clearly, a distinction can be drawn between life-saving drugs at one end of the spectrum and cosmetics at the other. I wonder whether one really can draw meaningful distinctions between cosmetics and household cleaning items. Moreover, it is not clear exactly where the distinctions come as we move along the spectrum. We know when we are at a point of dealing with a life-saving drug. We also know when we are at a point of dealing with something frivolous such as a cosmetic. As we move between the two, however, we encounter severe difficulties of definition and identification. That is not unusual. Philosophers call it the sorites paradox. For example, when is a pile a pile? One stone probably does not amount to a pile, but 50 certainly do. However, where does one hit the pile? Is it at two, three or four? That is a feature of one of the most difficult issues that we face as human beings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08101444000387">It is not just the continuum between different kinds of things for which animals might be used in experimentation. It is also a question of the continuum of different kinds of animals. I do not mean to disrespect hon. Members or anyone else, but we are all animals. We are a particular kind of animal known as a human being. Partly because we care about our own species, partly because of the extraordinary effects that any other attitude would have on our society and our preference for democracy and liberalism and so on, and partly because of an internal revulsion, we would hugely object to anybody who sought to conduct an experiment on a human being&#151;to experiment on an unwilling human being in a way that was painful&#151;even if the purpose of the experiment was to produce a life-saving drug that might save millions of lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08101444000388">From time to time, some people are inclined to argue that the right position ethically is always one that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number. One of the reasons that I am not a supporter of that view about ethics is precisely that I am revolted by the idea of an in vivo experiment on a human being, even if someone could persuade me that the result would save millions of lives. On the assumption that we take that view&#151;I think that we are entirely joined in taking that view&#151;one has to start asking where the dividing lines are as one moves down the chain from human beings to ants and mosquitoes. I have ho hesitation about how we treat ants and mosquitoes&#151;perhaps I should, but I do not&#151;but there  <br>

are people who are concerned about ants and mosquitoes. I am enormously concerned about human beings. Where do I start drawing lines?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08101444000389">At the moment, the line is drawn broadly between the great apes and the other primates. I know that lines have to be drawn, and that no lines are perfect. For the life of me, I cannot see how one can rationally defend the proposition that there is such a great difference between great apes and the other primates as to make sense of a law&#151;the current law&#151;which prohibits experimentation on the one and allows it on the other. I do not say that it is easy, or that as one concerns oneself with the consequences of recognising that degree of incoherence in the current law, one will suddenly come across the great truth about where the dividing lines should be. That is why I said at the beginning that I see this not as a debate leading to some immediate conclusion, but rather as the beginning of a very long process&#151;or intervention in what is already a very long process&#151;of debate and discussion, which I thinks needs to be much more general and much deeper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08101444000390">Therefore, we face difficulties of definition, both in respect of the application of such controls across the range of things for which the experiments are intended and a debate about the dividing lines between those beings that may legitimately be used for such experiments and those that may not. In neither case do we have good and clear criteria for making robust and coherent distinctions. That is not because our Ministers, officials, political establishment as a whole, thinkers and scientists are collectively deficient, and if they were a little cleverer such things would be resolved. That is not the case. These are genuinely difficult matters. We will not come quickly to obvious and robust dividing lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08101444000391">That leaves us with the practical question of what we do in the knowledge that the current construction of the law is not easy to defend on a coherent or rational basis, that there are potentially great advances to be made in things that matter desperately, such as advancing the cause of science to relieve disease, and that we do not have a clear intellectual apparatus for making robust and coherent decisions in this area. As a society, we ought to press forward and explore some practical steps while we continue&#151;it may be a long time&#151;to try to sort out such extraordinarily difficult issues and to arrive at more robust and coherent arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08101444000392">The first thing that is evident is that we will not be able to have a prolonged, careful and rational debate unless there is more transparency about such matters. I draw an analogy between this area and the efforts that many have made to investigate the efficiency with which the Ministry of Defence spends its money. I do not make that as a partisan point; the issue has been ongoing in British politics for as long as I can remember. Every time one asks a question of the Ministry of Defence, one is told that the answer cannot be given because it is a matter of national security. Some of the time, that is undoubtedly true. Some of the time, however, it is not entirely true. But it is a useful device for those sitting in a place that does some things brilliantly and others not so efficiently for avoiding transparency about the things that are not so efficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para22"><a name="08101444000393">In a somewhat similar way, because of the activities of some entirely reprehensible individuals whose main motivation, I fear, is hatred of human beings rather than love of animals, and because those activities have  <br>

involved violence, and because there are entirely innocent, law-abiding and in many cases talented and deeply devoted scientists at work whose lives, livelihoods and families are under threat&#151;which prompts the analogy with national security&#151;there has been a tendency to clam up about what is going on in the domain of animal testing. Some of that tendency is justified. Clearly, we must not enter terrain in which there is transparency about the names and addresses of individuals who do things that might lead them to be attacked. I do not recommend any such thing. Proper safeguards must be observed. On the other hand, as in my analogy involving the Ministry of Defence, such genuine anxiety should not be used as the basis for refusal to reveal the details of what is going on in a way that creates confidence that there is transparency about the nature of the actions being taken and their effects on the animals concerned.</p>

 I am listening to the right hon. Gentleman with great interest. On a point of clarification, he is expounding on the philosophical issues that should be discussed in terms of where we should draw the line, how many experiments should happen and to what extent they are necessary. Does he agree that we should not be considering what experiments on animals are necessary for cosmetics testing, because there is no need for any to be carried out?</p>

 I am sorry. I explained at the beginning&#151;before the Minister arrived, and while it was rather noisy&#151;that I did not seek this debate to discuss whether cosmetics testing should take place on animals, as it has already been decided, in my view rightly, that it should not. I chose the topic precisely because, as it happens, it has already been decided. I wanted to make the point that this debate is not&#151;although most debates, quite rightly, are&#151;about an immediate, practical policy issue. I am trying to raise a wider issue, so I chose a topic on which the decision has been made. I am reflecting on the consequences and reverberations of that decision. I agree entirely with the hon. Lady on that point, and, thank goodness, so will the law in due course. We are rightly heading towards the abolition of cosmetics testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="81014h0010.htm_para23"><a name="08101444000396">Transparency is a vital component of a rational debate, but a second issue merits much more attention in light of the fact that we do not know exactly how to think about such matters or where to draw the line, yet we know that some experimentation is necessary. That issue is the question of alternatives. It is characteristically the truth that a good thing to do when we face an extraordinarily difficult issue that we do not know collectively how to resolve is to look for a way of not having to resolve it. It is not intellectually noble, but it might achieve the practical result that we all seek. I think that this is such an issue.</p>

I also know a general rule: scientists are incredibly clever, and if they are given a lot of money to do something, quite a lot of them will do it sooner or later, but if they are not given much money, it is jolly lucky if they come up with something.</p>

that in those circumstances more experimentation will occur than if that balance were shifted. Given that we do not have a robust way to understand which kinds of experiment on which animals are ethically reasonable, it seems entirely fair to demand that a higher proportion of what is spent on testing should be spent instead on developing alternatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para1"><a name="08101444000399">It is obviously a delicate matter of balance, and there is much discussion to be had about how any such thing could be arranged.

Until and unless that balance alters, I suspect that enough alternatives to make a difference will not be developed. Much more transparency and many more alternatives would allow the debate to proceed constructively despite the huge intellectual and ethical difficulties involved. I also suspect that in the meantime, fewer animals would be subjected to fewer experiments, because there would be more alternatives and more awareness of the facts of the case due to transparency.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) on securing this debate on an issue whose importance is reflected in our postbags as constituency MPs. We are a country of animal lovers, and we are concerned about unnecessary testing on animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08101444000401">There is a clear distinction between legislation on cosmetics and legislation on other things such as medical devices or household cleaning products, and the Home Office licence is very clear about what tests may be carried out under which legislative regimes. The right hon. Gentleman raised an interesting issue about how we should take the debate onwards in respect of testing in general on animals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08101444000402">Perhaps it would be helpful if I clarified the situation regarding the testing of cosmetics on animals. Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office is responsible for licensing test houses that carry out testing on animals for any purpose. The terms and conditions of licensing indicate that a licence will be issued only if there is no alternative to animal tests, if the generation of new data is justified, if the protocols proposed cannot be further refined and if the protocols will be likely to produce data meeting the specific objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para4"><a name="08101444000403">In 1997, following discussions between the test houses and cosmetic product and ingredient manufacturers, it was agreed that existing licences would be withdrawn and no new licences would be issued for animal testing of finished cosmetic products, ingredients or combinations of ingredients. In effect, no testing of cosmetics on animals has taken place in the UK for the last 11 years.</p>

it introduces a provisional ban on the marketing of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals or contain ingredients that have been tested on animals using a method other than an alternative method where such a method has been validated and adopted at Community level. In other words, if an approved alternative method exists, testing on animals is unlawful. Thirdly, the amendment introduces a longstop ban that will prohibit the marketing of cosmetic products tested on animals from 2009 for the vast majority of animal tests and from 2013 for the remaining three tests, toxicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics, for which development of alternatives, as the right hon. Gentleman highlighted, is much more complex. The longstop ban will come into force irrespective of whether alternative methods have been developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para6"><a name="08101444000405">That means, in effect, that no animal testing of cosmetics can take place in the UK or other EU member states and that, in a phased transition starting next year and culminating in 2013, the marketing of cosmetic products tested on animals will be prohibited. The marketing ban will include not only products from within the EU but cosmetic products manufactured outside of the EU that have been subject to animal testing. That is of particular importance, because there are still countries, such as Japan and the United States, where animal testing of cosmetic products is an important part of product safety assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para7"><a name="08101444000406">It might be useful to mention briefly the progress being made in the development of alternatives to animal testing. For the deadline in 2009, alternatives already exist for tests for skin corrosion, acute phototoxicity, skin penetration and skin irritation and mutagenicity. Work on the replacement of the genotoxicity and eye irritation tests is progressing well&#151;I am sure that we all have very clear images of the sort of animal welfare posters produced, at the time, of rabbits, in particular, involved in the latter tests.</p>

It is worth pointing out that once those tests are validated and legally accepted, they are to be used as alternatives to animal testing in all areas, not just those related to cosmetic products&#151;I think that that addresses the point that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para9"><a name="08101444000408">As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, the Home Office, via its Animal (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate, is responsible for ensuring that test houses do not carry out testing on animals for cosmetic purposes. Day-to-day enforcement of the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2008 is the responsibility of local authority trading standards departments, which have access to the safety assessment dossiers, which companies must retain for all the cosmetic products that they supply. Those dossiers will contain information on any animal testing that has been carried out in the past. If hon. Members are contacted by constituents with concerns about such matters, they can refer them to their local trading standards department.</p>

the House that the cosmetics industry has made no such approach to my Department and that, even if it did, we would not change the existing legal framework. My officials have also confirmed that no approach has been made by the cosmetics industry to the European Commission seeking changes to the European directive on cosmetics in respect of animal testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para11"><a name="08101444000410">All animal testing must be conducted under the REACH&#151;Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals&#151;regime, which was initially an EU regulation, but is now incorporated into UK law. Its overall objective is to establish a rapid, efficient system for collecting the necessary information on chemicals and for tackling those of most concern, while minimising animal testing and maintaining the competitiveness of the chemical industry. The UK Government continue to be strongly supportive of the principles and objectives of this new EU chemicals strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para12"><a name="08101444000411">Although it is important for the industry to demonstrate that its chemicals are safe to the environment and to human health, via the environment, the animal testing required under REACH to achieve these ends must be minimised and undertaken only where it is needed, and not just for the sake of filling data gaps.</p>

 There has been a significant increase in animal experiments over recent years. Is one of the problems not the lack of data sharing between companies? Sometimes that is because of commercial confidentiality, but could the Minister tell us a bit more about what is being done to encourage companies to share test results, so that they are not all carrying out the same tests unnecessarily?</p>

 I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend. It is important that the industry recognises the Government&#146;s and the EU&#146;s intentions in ensuring that we reduce the amount of animal testing. It is in everybody&#146;s benefit, therefore, that companies share that basic data. That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="81014h0011.htm_para13"><a name="08101444000414">It is important to note that the legislation focuses on &#147;information&#148; rather than &#147;data&#148;. There is flexibility to use all available information, not just data from tests, to satisfy particular registration requirements. To avoid duplication, the REACH regulations specifically exclude the need to consider the risks to human health for uses in cosmetic products within the scope of the cosmetics directive. However, the need to reduce animal testing is a key issue for the UK Government who will continue to emphasise the importance of requiring information where this is necessary for risk management.</p>

 Does the Minister agree with my right hon. Friend that transparency needs to be encouraged and supported far more than it has been. Without transparency, we will not gradually find further ways in which we can reduce animal testing, not only for cosmetics but a whole range of other things. Will she undertake to make this a priority for the Government to ensure that there is much greater transparency throughout the whole area of research?</p>

 On transparency, there is another issue is there not? Consumers often do not realise that what they are buying has been tested on animals, because labelling is not clear. The average person on the street does not want to buy products that have been tested on animals, but that information simply is not available. Will the Minister convey to the Department the need for more transparency in the information that is given to consumers when they buy household products?</p>

 My hon. Friend raises another important point. I am sure that the Minister who has full-time responsibility for this issue will study the <i>Hansard</i> report of this debate with great interest, and that my hon. Friend&#146;s points will be taken on board.</p>

There has been a huge change in the public&#146;s state of mind in the past few years, initially as a result of people such as Anita Roddick and organisations such as the Body Shop making changes to the way in which they marketed and sold their products, and others seeing the value of those changes. In time, we will move on to the changes that the right hon. Member for West Dorset suggests. He sees this as a much bigger issue involving the use of animals for testing not only cosmetics, but household, medical and many other items.</p>
