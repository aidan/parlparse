 It is a pleasure to have you presiding over our proceedings, Mr. Caton. I welcome the Minister to his new role and wish him well in it. I am reminded of Vera Lynn&#146;s &#147;We&#146;ll Meet Again&#148;, because we come together every few years. I look forward to what he has to say on this important subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000011">The middle east may not be our near geographical neighbour, but we cannot escape from our involvement in the region. That can be seen throughout history with the magnificent crusader castles across Syria, our support for the Arab revolts against the Ottoman empire, the founding of the state of Israel, and the construction and subsequent loss of the Suez canal. The list could go on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000012">This is not a moment to discuss the merits of the recent invasion of Iraq. Suffice it to say that it impaired a number of our relationships in the region. Today, violence on the streets of Gaza inflames passions on the streets of our country. Whether we like it or not, we cannot escape from the realities of our past and current involvement. In that, we are blessed with outstanding diplomats, whose knowledge of the middle east is unsurpassed. When their judgments have been ignored, it has led inevitably to difficulties for us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000013">In the past few weeks, we have seen extraordinarily successful and peaceful elections in Lebanon, an inspiring speech in Cairo by President Obama, post-election turmoil in Iran and Bibi Netanyahu implicitly acknowledging the problems brought by the growth of settlements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000014">I should like to concentrate on Syria, which has been remarkably stable in the past decade under a new and younger President. At no stage in the long history of the region could Syria sensibly have been ignored. I declare an interest as a director of the British Syrian Society, which seeks at all levels to build up our bilateral relationship. I pay particular tribute to two individuals who dedicated themselves so successfully to that task, Dr. Fawaz Akhras and the late Sir David Gore-Booth, who was a distinguished diplomat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000015">Having spoken out against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Syria strongly opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In expressing the notion of an axis of evil, the United States took a hostile view of Syria. It was widely believed by Syrians that America would invade them, too. There is no doubt that jihadis crossed from Syria into Iraq across a long border that is difficult to police. It was a source of fury that some of those individuals may have been directly or indirectly responsible for the loss of life among coalition forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000016">A second source of criticism of Syria stems from the civil war in Lebanon, after which Syrian military forces were invited to help restore order. In time, their role  <br>

became resented by key players in Lebanese political life, who believed that there was inordinate interference in the domestic, political and economic life of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000017">A third source of criticism is the ties between Syria and Iran, which rose initially out of a shared fear and dislike of Saddam Hussein. Although they may have close trading and economic ties, Iran is a theocratic state, whereas Syria is constitutionally secular. Different religious groupings co-exist extremely well in Syria and Islamic fundamentalism is simply not tolerated. A final source of criticism is Syria&#146;s support&#151; shared by Iran&#151;of Hezbollah and Hamas, with their terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000018">The central thesis of my remarks is that those important issues must be put in context or updated to reflect current realities in a continuing process of mutual exploration between our two countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000019">A chunk of Syria&#151;the Golan heights&#151;is illegally occupied by Israel. The area holds no strategic value for Israel. In 2000, the late President Hafez Assad came close to a deal with Israel that included the return of the Golan heights and a clear recognition of the state of Israel. Israel continues to have concerns about Iranian and Syrian support for Hezbollah. However, it is noteworthy how acquiescent Hezbollah was when Israel invaded Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000020">Also noteworthy is that Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah fully accepted the results of the recent Lebanese elections. It has been a fundamental view of Syria that Hezbollah is a political reality in Lebanon and that it should be seen as such. Latterly, it has worked hard to encourage change in the political topography of Lebanon to entrench Hezbollah as part of the democratic political process. Relations between Syria and virtually all Lebanese political leaders have improved dramatically with many ministerial visits and the exchange of ambassadors, which was inconceivable until recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000021">Syria was told that its role in the lead-up to the Lebanese elections would be observed carefully. The outcome was beyond everybody&#146;s expectations. I am pleased that our Government, including our ambassador in Beirut, have met with the political arm of Hezbollah, thus recognising its electoral legitimacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09062511000022">I have said many times to Israeli friends that a core impetus to Hezbollah&#146;s military activities would be changed if Israel returned the Golan heights to Syria. Without that, there will be no comprehensive and enduring sense of security for Israel on its northern border. The Turkish Government sought to broker talks between the two countries. We wait to see whether Syria&#146;s offer to reopen talks with Israel will be taken up by Mr. Netanyahu. His Foreign Affairs Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has so far explicitly rejected discussion of the Golan heights, but these are early days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000023">No hon. Member can have failed to be concerned about the recent events in Iran.</p>

 I hear what my hon. Friend says about the importance of bringing peace on Israel&#146;s northern border, particularly with respect to the Golan issue. Does he agree that hon. Members from all parties must encourage the Israeli Government to engage with Syria, whether through a Turkish intermediary or any other intermediary, because talking is better than not talking?</p>

 My hon. Friend is right. I pay tribute to him for the work that he has done to develop that argument. I am sure that he will agree that although a comprehensive settlement in the region would be desirable, that is presenting huge difficulties, not least because of the seemingly irreconcilable tensions between Fatah and Hamas. It would be a shame if that was a major stumbling block or distraction to a Syrian track, because it is in Israel&#146;s interest to have the security to which he alluded. We should encourage the Israelis to consider the Syrian offer to continue the exploration, brokered by the Turks.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there has been no ministerial visit to Iran for about six years. Does he agree that now might be the time for the Foreign Secretary to go over there to strengthen our dialogue and engagement with Iran, so that we can stop the worrying escalation? Jaw-jaw is better than the alternative. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is a risk worth taking?</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="09062511000027"><a name="90624h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="09062511000508"><b>Mr. Spring:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right to raise the long-term significance of a relationship between Iran and the United Kingdom. However, at a moment when two of our diplomats have just been expelled from Tehran for no reason&#151;apparently, the British Government are behind the protests on the streets of Tehran, which is an interesting take on events&#151;the British Government are absolutely right in the circumstances to react by expelling two diplomats from London. Although we hope that calm will prevail in the long run and that logic will enter into the equation, I do not agree with the timing suggested by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="09062511000028"><a name="90624h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="09062511000509"><b>Richard Burden (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</b>
 May I take the hon. Gentleman back to the question of the Golan, which he mentioned earlier? He referred to the Golan heights. We all refer to the area as that, but in so doing, we minimise its importance. It is an 1,800 sq km plateau, where the rainfall is higher than in Damascus. It is of great strategic significance. There are more than 346,000 displaced persons from the Golan, but that is often treated almost as a side issue to achieving a comprehensive middle east peace. The area is about more than that; it is absolutely central&#151;strategically for Syria in terms of natural resources and other things, but also in terms of doing right by those 346,000 displaced persons.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="09062511000029"><a name="90624h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="09062511000510"><b>Mr. Spring:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning the humanitarian aspect. I certainly know individuals whose family origins lie in the Golan heights. Of course, the humanitarian tragedies that abound in the region are what we are seeking to address. That applies on all sides of the equation. Although the Golan heights are occupied, I do not think that even people in the Israel defence forces regard them as strategically significant. However, the matter will sour the relationship between Syria and Israel, which is why some sort of solution to the problem&#151;a solution was nearly arrived at in 2000&#151;could take the whole process forward. I hope that the new Government in Israel will see the matter in those terms because the flow of the issue into the Hezbollah argument, with which the hon. Gentleman will be very familiar, means that it is important to Israel&#146;s own long-term security to address the problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para14"><a name="09062511000030">As I mentioned, there have been extraordinary events in Iran in the past few weeks, and there are concerns about the views of senior Iranian figures. The truth of the matter is that Iran unreservedly supports Hezbollah and Hamas. As I said, it is in Israel&#146;s vital strategic interest to seek to minimise the impact of Iran&#146;s stated aim to export Islamic revolution in the form expressed. Israel enjoys workable relations with Egypt and Jordan&#151;that should be the role model&#151;and it should seek to develop a pragmatic relationship with its northern neighbours. Syria has made its position clear: a return of the Golan heights is part of a full normalisation of relations. Israel should simply road test that offer without delay. If successful, the prize would be to enhance its own security and stability, although much work would have to be done and, of course, much reassurance needs to be given.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000031">At different times, Syria has had poor relations with other Arab countries. However, that is no longer the case. The Syria-Saudi Arabia relationship is particularly important, and is back on track. There have been a number of welcome ministerial exchanges between Baghdad and Damascus. The criticism of the border crossings, to which I alluded, has substantially evaporated and help has been given to Syria to achieve that. Exploration of greater commercial ties between Syria and Iraq continues to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000032">Two other facets of Syrian life bear examination. Syria has developed a culture that is unique in the region, perhaps because its history has been marked by so many invasions and occupiers&#151;from the Romans and the Persians, to the Umayyads, the Ottomans and the French. More than a century ago, Gertrude Bell wrote about that with amazement in her diaries. The Grand Mufti of Syria radiates a generosity of spirit and understanding, which personifies the attitudes of the Muslim majority to the religious minorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000033">I welcome the recent official visit to London by the Syrian Minister of Religious Affairs to discuss Syria&#146;s approach to key sensitive matters, including countering radicalisation. It is worth noting that the aim of what was, from every possible viewpoint, an important visit was to represent the Syrian model of moderate Islam, which combats terrorism and rejects extremism. The visit resulted in an offer to send a group of Muslim scholars to lecture at the Islamic centres in the United Kingdom on moderate Islam as practised in Syria. The visit also drew on Syria&#146;s willingness to train British imams in Syria according to a curriculum approved by the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Religious Affairs in Syria has indicated a willingness to teach British students who want to study Arabic and sharia for four years at the international institute for Arabic and sharia, so that they can become advocates of moderation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000034">I say to the Minister that at a time when relationships are very fractious and we have seen a most disagreeable increase in Islamophobia and, indeed, anti-Semitism in our country, it is precisely through such moderation and contact that Syria can play a valuable role. I know the Minister will welcome that visit and the return visit that took place to Syria by British Muslims to discuss messages of peace from Islam. That collective generosity of spirit has enabled about 1 million Iraqis, a significant number of whom are Christians, to find sanctuary in Syria, which is a huge burden on a country of some 20 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000035">Refugee children go to school free up to the 12th grade and medical care is available on the same basis as it is to the local population. This year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees launched an appeal for $150 million. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister how Britain is assisting in what the UNHCR has described to me as&#151;this is well known to be the case&#151;an internationally under-recognised refugee crisis, which, of course, arises directly out of our invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000036">It is gratifying that, after a long period, relations between Syria and Britain have improved considerably. I hope that the Minister will go there soon, as his predecessor and the Foreign Secretary have done. Of course, Opposition parties&#151;including my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)&#151;initiated a dialogue some time before. Many European politicians have now visited Damascus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000037">There continue to be attempts to liberalise and modernise the Syrian economy through banking and investment code reforms and the establishment of a fledgling stock exchange. Since 2005, the EU-Syria association agreement has been frozen. It is hoped that, finally, the agreement will be signed this year, which will encourage trade flows between Europe and Syria and the lowering of any tariff barriers. That will compel and encourage the Syrian Government to bring forward further reforms, especially at a time of diminishing oil reserves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para22"><a name="09062511000038">There is now open discussion about the transfer of gas via Syria and Turkey from some of the main gas producers to the east and Qatar. There is concern throughout Europe about increasing dependence on Russian gas supplies. An opportunity is presenting itself to diversify supply to the Mediterranean, and the strategic significance of that is obvious. In the end, real movement in the region will be brought about by focused US involvement. The Obama Administration seem to have made a concerted effort to follow a fresh approach to the region in particular and the Islamic world in general. Numerous visits to Damascus by US Government representatives signal that engagement, and the involvement of George Mitchell, who played such a significant role in Northern Ireland, is to be welcomed. Nevertheless, the US currently has no ambassador in Damascus, and a wholly counter-productive boycott is still in place. Of course, concerns remain about human rights violations in a number of Arab countries, and controversy surrounds the access of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Syria.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para23"><a name="09062511000039">I shall conclude by coming back to where I started. Many of the criticisms of Syria during the past decade now appear to be out of date. In the right circumstances, Syria could help to unlock a whole series of huge challenges&#151;whether in relation to the security of Israel, the actions of Hezbollah or Hamas, or through its long-standing relationship with Iran. The terms &#147;dialogue&#148; and &#147;road test&#148; once again spring to mind. Our bilateral relationship is far from perfect, but we can play a part in trying to make continuing progress. In so doing, we would fulfil our historic engagement in the region, which, regrettably, has become so lamentably absent, greatly to our country&#146;s cost.</p>

 I shall be extremely brief, Mr. Caton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para24"><a name="09062511000041">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) on obtaining this extremely important debate. He concentrated necessarily on Syria and Britain&#146;s strategic interests abroad. He also touched on Britain&#146;s security interests at home, and it is that point that I would like briefly to amplify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000042">It is undeniable that the main threat to our domestic security at present comes from those who mistakenly claim and exercise violent extremism in the name of Islam. As the House has repeatedly heard, I have a particular interest in this issue as the Conservative Member with the largest number and proportion of Muslim constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000043">It is important to appreciate that Syria is, in strictly religious terms, an extremely moderate place, as my hon. Friend said&#151;he has great experience of the country&#151;and, on the Islamic map worldwide, it is important as the heartland of traditional classical Islam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para27"><a name="09062511000044">Syria is important for three reasons. First, as my hon. Friend said, it contains Damascus, which is an important historical site and the home of the Umayyad dynasty. Secondly, it is the home of many well-known ulema and scholars such as Ahmad Hassoun, the Grand Mufti, whom my hon. Friend referred to, Dr. Mohammed al-Buti, Sheikh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi and others. Those names may not be well known to us, but they are well known to British Muslims who have an abiding interest in what scholars and ulema in the Arab world have to say. Thirdly, Syria is a centre of a classical Islamic world view that is fundamentally at odds with the modern conception of a sharia state, particularly one that is brought into being by violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para28"><a name="09062511000045">Given all that, and despite political difficulty, I have three quick questions for the Minister. In essence, they follow up what my hon. Friend said. First, given how seriously many British Muslims take the scholarship and expertise of Syrian ulema and scholars, will there be opportunities to bring some of those scholars here, perhaps as part of a radical middle-way programme or something like it? Secondly, in reverse, will there be opportunities in the future to take British imams and scholars to Syria? I understand&#151;my hon. Friend referred briefly to this&#151;that the Quilliam Foundation and others recently went to Syria for theological and political discussions that I gather were very lively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="90624h0001.htm_para29"><a name="09062511000046">Finally, what opportunities does the Minister see for British students to go to Syria to study the traditional classical Islam that is so much at odds with the violent extremism that is a threat to our security and to the security of other countries, too?</p>

to Syria took place in January. I was a member of the delegation, which was led by my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill). In terms of building understanding, contacts and dialogue between UK and Syrian parliamentarians, the visit was very worth while indeed. I hope that further such exchanges will continue, in addition to the good work that the hon. Member for West Suffolk does through the all-party group on Syria and the British Syrian Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000049">The hon. Gentleman referred to Iraqi refugees in Syria, which is one of the issues that I would like to raise with the Minister. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is a major issue for us because of our involvement in the situation that led to those refugees being in Syria, but it is also a major issue for Syria. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which we met while we were there, there are 1.2 million Iraqi refugees with valid visas in Syria at present. I give credit to Syria, which gives them access to services and at least primary education. It has done much more than several other countries would have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000050">However, there is still an issue for Syria, because of the drain on its resources, but perhaps most of all for the Iraqi refugees themselves. We met several of them. We visited several UNHCR installations, including its reception centre, and we were able to speak to and hear first hand from Iraqi refugees about their situation, which is something that we need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000051">The international community needs greater coherence around its approach to repatriation: would it be viable, and, if so, when and how are pathways to be built towards it? However, it also needs to grasp much more consistently the question of resettlement. Several Iraqi refugees told us that, because of all kinds of changes in Iraq and elsewhere, they were now looking at resettlement. If that is to be dealt with properly, it requires a co-ordinated response from the international community. The UNHCR has a great deal to say about that. We need to listen to what it has to say, because it is a major issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000052">My second point on refugees concerns Palestinian refugees in Syria. I am not speaking particularly of those Palestinian refugees who are in Syria as a result of events in 1948 or 1967 but rather those who are in Syria or on its borders as a result of the conflict in Iraq. About 300 Palestinian refugees currently live in a camp in the desert&#151;in essence, they are cut off from many facilities. Again, that is a humanitarian issue that we need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000053">My hon. Friend the Minister will not have come here today prepared to speak about the Palestinian refugees, but I would ask him, if he is not able to say much about them today, to look into the situation, and to consider what we and the international community are doing to try to ease their plight. To some extent, they are the forgotten refugees arising out of the Iraq conflict, but they deserve to be forgotten no longer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000055">I called a meeting in the House on Monday evening of Iraqi Christians, and I would like to say just a few words about it. It was a bit harrowing: many difficult stories were told of kidnappings, and violence, extortion and threats against various minorities. Several witnesses at the meeting explained the problems of split families; that is, families that have been separated, with members scattered around various countries including Iraq, Syria and Jordan, and as far afield as Scandinavia, north Africa and this country. The principle of family reunion is given insufficient weight by our Government and other Governments, the UNHCR and other organisations. I am sure that the Minister is aware of that, and will consider carefully what the Government can do to lead the international field in trying to put those families back together, and to stop the persecution of Iraqi Christians.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000056">There is clearly a backlog of old asylum claims in the UK, which is another urgent issue&#151;</p>

 I thank the hon. Gentleman for the courtesy of his comments. He might not be aware that although a substantial percentage of Iraqi refugees in Syria are Christians, they come from a variety of faiths, but do not live in separate conditions. It is interesting how the pervasive culture of Syria has influenced them, and that the tensions that existed between those communities in Iraq have evaporated as they live side by side in Syria.</p>

 I am grateful for that clarification. My comments were aimed essentially at the difficulties that arise in Iraq rather than in Syria. As with Thailand and Burma, neighbouring countries often act as host and suffer great pressure from the refugee problem, but do magnificent work. We must encourage them to continue that, and we must tackle the refugee problem worldwide. I am sure that the Minister has taken on that message.

 Like other hon. Members, I did not intend to make a speech today, but I was galvanised into doing so by the eloquence of my very good friend, the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) and his excellent speech. I will make a couple of short points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000060">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a comprehensive resolution of the intractable problems in the middle east requires engagement with Syria. As he rightly pointed out, the British Syrian Society has played a valuable role in seeking to build relations with that country, and I pay tribute to those who have been involved. I am honoured to be a member of its board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000061">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) made the valid point that it is in Israel&#146;s interest to engage with Syria, but there will be positive engagement only if the Golan issue is resolved. He rightly said that the Golan heights are often referred to as a mountain, but it is a region, and a large one  <br>

housing many people, many of whom, sadly, have been displaced. Those issues must be resolved because that is crucial to a lasting normalisation of relations between Syria and Israel. It is obvious from my discussions in Syria that the Syrian Government are willing, able and want to engage with western Governments and to play a part in bringing about lasting normalisation and a just settlement of the intractable problems in the middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000062">The problem is not just the issues between Israel and Syria, but the wider issues of the Palestinians and a viable Palestinian state. That is not the subject of this debate, but I am becoming more and more sceptical about whether there will be a two-state solution. The intractable problems between Fatah and Hamas, and the fact that the two parts of an embryonic Palestinian state are divided by a piece of land that was Israeli territory prior to 1967 leads me to question more and more whether there can be a viable two-state solution. It is possible that there could eventually be a three or even four-state solution in the middle east, but that is not the subject of this debate. The debate today is about Syria, our relations with it, and its role in bringing about a resolution of middle east problems. I commend the hon. Member for West Suffolk on initiating it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000063">The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) made an excellent point about the role that Syria can play in wider Islamic theology. Under its constitution, Syria is a secular state. I am impressed by and admire the fact that different religions exist in the state and seem to do so in a relationship that is respectful of one another&#146;s differences. Like him, however, I am becoming more and more concerned about the export of Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia, and the effect of that on communities in western countries such as the United Kingdom where large Muslim populations live. Unless one lives in areas where that can be seen daily, as he and I do, it is difficult to understand how destructive Wahhabism can be. However, unless we treat the issue seriously and address it, it poses a threat to the cohesion of good community relations in the United Kingdom and other western countries. I hope that that will be taken on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09062511000064">It is important to have this debate today. It is important also that the British Government treat seriously the messages that Syria is sending that it wants to engage and to be fully involved in assisting with bringing about a resolution of some of the problems in the middle east. I am sure that the Government are aware that Syria stands ready, willing and able to help, but that the Golan issue must be resolved. I commend what other hon. Members have said. Israel must treat seriously Syria&#146;s concerns about the Golan, and it must negotiate and come to an agreement with Syria, whether that is a bilateral agreement or part of a wider agreement in the middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000066">This is a good time to debate Syria and the middle east, not least because of recent developments in the region and the change in the US&#146;s approach to the middle east. Obama has made engaging with Syria a key point of his foreign policy, which is a welcome change from the Bush years, and is a cause for optimism. As has been outlined, such engagement with Syria is vital to ensuring a peaceful withdrawal from Iraq, maintaining peace and stability in Lebanon, and for the Arab-Israeli peace process, on which we all so desperately want more progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09062511000067">Historically, Syria has been more isolated because of its support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and its close ties with Iran, which have given countries reason to be cautious in their dealings with Syria. However, I argue that those are the very reasons why we must engage, because the influence that Syria has across the region makes it a vital player.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000068">Recently, George Mitchell, the US envoy for Arab-Israeli peace, visited Damascus. That is a hugely positive step. Traditionally, the UK has been somewhat less hostile than the US towards Syria. We have maintained diplomatic relations and engage directly on regional and consular issues. That approach must be welcomed, because engagement is the cornerstone of how we can use influence with Syria to try to unlock some of the problems in that troubled region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000069">The hon. Member for West Suffolk talked about the close links between Syria and Iraq. He said that this is not the place to go over the arguments about the war, and I agree, but later today we have the Opposition-day debate on the Iraq inquiry. It is important that that inquiry, with its broader remit, is also able to consider the impact that the war had on the wider region and Britain&#146;s foreign policy objectives in the wider region, because, as he said, they have been somewhat undermined by our actions in Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000070">There is the issue of Syria having allowed insurgents to cross the border into Iraq, which has made the situation there much more difficult. According to the eighth report of 2006-07 from the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Syria expert Patrick Seale said that Syria had allowed &#147;a few Jihadists&#148; to &#147;go across that territory&#148; because</p>
<a name="90624h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="09062511000442"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Syrians do not want the Americans to have too easy a time in Iraq, because they think that the Americans will win there and they will be next.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000071">That sense of vulnerability and concern will have been a key motivator in Syria&#146;s decisions. I hope that now, with the change of approach, the Syrians will have some confidence that they will not be next and that that will help to build trust in order for them to clamp down on insurgency crossings into Iraq. Obviously, there is a fear with the troop withdrawal and handover that this will be a vulnerable time in Iraq and insurgency activity could instead increase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000072">The situation of Iraqi refugees in Syria was mentioned by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden). It was interesting for us to hear about his experiences seeing the refugee camps at first hand and to hear the positive stories that he had to tell about education and development there, but clearly the situation places huge stress on Syria. That strengthens the case for pointing out to Syria that it is in its interests to engage more regionally and to have a prosperous and stable Iraq next door, not only to act as a trading  <br>

partner but to facilitate the return of refugees, at an appropriate pace, and to lessen the burden that Syria is experiencing. In foreign diplomacy, using the self-interest of countries to encourage certain behaviour is often the most successful approach.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="09062511000073"><a name="90624h0002.htm_spnew5"><a name="09062511000518"><b>Richard Burden:</b>
 The hon. Lady is right to say that repatriation of some Iraqi refugees will be the right option, but the point that I was trying to make and the issue that we need to tackle as an international community&#151;this is certainly the view of a number of the Iraqi refugees themselves&#151;is that a programme for resettlement elsewhere may be the long-term solution for a number of those refugees. In some cases that will be in Syria and the middle east; in other cases it will be in the wider world. We need to think through how that will be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="09062511000074"><a name="90624h0002.htm_spnew6"><a name="09062511000519"><b>Jo Swinson:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, which highlights the importance of Syria being part of the wider engagement, because creating such a solution will not happen with just one country; it needs to be part of a much wider discussion.</p>

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="09062511000075"><a name="90624h0002.htm_spnew7"><a name="09062511000520"><b>Mr. Newmark:</b>
 During my visits to Syria, I have talked about that issue as well. Given the work that the Syrian Government have done in absorbing perhaps 1 million or more refugees and giving them health care, education and housing, surely the international community, purely on a humanitarian level, should be doing more in giving some sort of funding towards that to support the Syrian Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="09062511000076"><a name="90624h0002.htm_spnew8"><a name="09062511000521"><b>Jo Swinson:</b>
 I certainly think that the Syrian Government should be praised for what they have done. No doubt the humanitarian agencies will be involved, and they should be involved. I will not go into all the arguments about the Iraq war, but particularly where we have contributed to problems and to what I view as a terrible mistake, we have a responsibility to help to clear up the mess that we have made and to provide such support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000077">On Israel and Palestine, I was intrigued by the comments of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff). I was feeling slightly despondent when he talked about being unable to see a two-state solution. As someone who supports a two-state solution, I thought that perhaps it was going to be a pessimistic comment, but I was interested to hear his suggestion that in fact a three or four-state solution might be the end point. I do not know whether that will be the case, but whether it is two, three or four, the word &#147;solution&#148; is what matters. That is surely the end that we all want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000078">Clearly, Syria will play a vital role in that. Various hon. Members mentioned the key importance of the Golan heights in getting Syria involved in the peace process. That is obviously a bottom line for the Syrians. Unlike many hon. Members in the debate, I have not been to Syria, but I did go to the Golan heights on a trip to Israel some years ago. It is clearly a much contested piece of land but, as was also pointed out, it is not just a territorial dispute. There is the human aspect in terms of displacement. What surprised me somewhat when I went there was the strategic importance of that land in terms of water&#151;that key resource that sometimes in the  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Jun 2009">

UK we have far too much of with our climate, but which in drier areas of the world can be a strategically important resource. I think that, increasingly, water will replace oil as the key resource that might be in a position to provoke conflict. We need to be aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09062511000079">With regard to Israel&#146;s approach, Netanyahu was promising before the election not to return the Golan heights, but there is some cause for optimism, in that his stance may have softened when he told George Mitchell:</p>
<a name="90624h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="09062511000443"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am unwilling to commit in advance to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para23"><a name="09062511000080">That seems to constitute a move from his pre-election position. It is not yet clear whether it could be a concession that he would make later. The basing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Damascus gives Syria an obvious role, potentially, in the peace negotiations. If we can resolve the issue of the Golan heights, Syria might be more willing to exert influence over Hamas to support the peace process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09062511000081">There is a key economic imperative in considering the situation with Syria. Its isolation and the suspension of the EU trade association agreement, which was mentioned, have clearly caused difficulties for Syria. There is a danger in Syria being too isolated and ending up too dependent on Iran. They have obviously had close ties and that is a potential danger. Perhaps if Syria were to distance itself a little more from Iran, some of the other negotiations might end up being easier. Although the EU trade association agreement suspension in 2005 was put in place for sound reasons, it might end up being counter-productive, so it is worth considering again how we could shift economic incentives to encourage Syria to play a fuller role in the international community, including the trading ties that come with that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000082">The situation in Iran is moving incredibly quickly. Syria will be keeping a close eye on the demonstrations, perhaps with the fear that they might provoke similar unrest in Syria. I am sure that the Minister will mention the diplomatic developments over the past few days with the expulsion of the diplomats. I am sure that that is of great concern to us all, as have been the pictures of violence on our television screens. Just from a human point of view, they cannot be ignored. However, I think that it is right that the Government and Britain generally have not intervened and sought to tell the Iranians what to do. History shows that that type of intervention will not be helpful, so the Government have taken the right view on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000083">The Government&#146;s approach to Syria is broadly welcome, because regular engagement and making progress step by step has to be the right way forward. Syria is clearly suffering financially because of the EU trade suspension, US sanctions, the fact that its oil reserves are going down and repeated drought, which goes back to what I said about water. There is also the huge burden, which it has been bearing well&#151;it is living up to its humanitarian responsibilities&#151;in relation to the influx of Iraqi refugees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="90624h0002.htm_para27"><a name="09062511000084">That brings dangers and opportunities. The situation is difficult for the Syrian people, and if they are allowed to continue in isolation, they could become closer to Iran. However, the UK, the EU and the US have an opportunity to offer new economic incentives to promote political reform and co-operation, particularly on Iraq and the peace process in Israel and Palestine.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) on his success in securing the debate. I pay tribute to the work that he has done throughout his time in the House of Commons to enhance and improve understanding between Syria and the United Kingdom. Members from all political parties have benefited over the years from his expertise and, indeed, his detailed understanding of the retail opportunities for western visitors to Aleppo and Damascus. He is probably the best guide that a new visitor to Syria could have, because, as he showed in his opening remarks, he understands its history and the important role that it, and Damascus in particular, plays in the religious, cultural and political history of the entire region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para0"><a name="09062511000087">I want to say a few words about economic issues, human rights and regional and foreign policy questions. I want to start, however, by welcoming the steps that the Government have taken over the past 12 months or so, and that the new United States Administration have taken, to engage with the Government of Syria. For quite a long time, my party&#146;s view has been that nothing is to be gained from seeking to isolate the Syrian Government. Although there remain profound differences of interest and attitude between this country and Syria, our national interest has not been served by pursuing a policy of isolating Damascus, and recent history shows that such a policy has, if anything, been counter-productive. I therefore welcome the steps taken by the Foreign Secretary and the US Administration in recent months, and I wish them success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000088">However, it is also important that we seek engagement not simply for its own sake, but with a view to pursuing our national interests in the broadest sense of the term, and that brings me to economic development. Taking steps to strengthen the economic links between Syria and the UK will bring opportunities for our two countries. During my visit to Damascus in January, more than one senior Syrian leader clearly told me that the UK was allowing other European countries to steal a march on it in terms of involvement in developing the Syrian economy. If there are contracts and jobs going, I would like them to go to the UK, rather than to Germany, France or Italy.</p>

 I apologise for being so late, but I was speaking at a conference, and I have come straight here. I want to follow on from my hon. Friend&#146;s point, because I was in Damascus in April, and Deputy Prime Minister al-Dardari made absolutely the same point. Given this country&#146;s strategic strength in financial services&#151;notwithstanding what is happening in the world at the moment&#151;and Syria&#146;s ambition to make more of Damascus as a financial centre, it is key that we exploit the situation and link with Syria to ensure that our national interest is protected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000091">When the Minister responds, I would be interested to hear what the Government&#146;s attitude is towards the EU-Syria association agreement. An updated version of the agreement was initialled in December 2008, but approval awaits a decision by member states. Does Britain regard progress on that updated agreement as conditional on further improvement in political relationships between Europe and Syria, or will it be judged only on economic and commercial criteria?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000092">There are also opportunities for the UK in public administration. Another point that was made to me in Damascus was that Syria recognises the need to improve the quality of her public administration and would be looking to this country and other western partners to help in that project. I hope that we can take advantage of such opportunities, but, again, there is an issue that I want to raise with the Government. In the fairly recent past, there have been exploratory conversations between London and Damascus about giving such assistance, but they fell foul of the theology of the Department for International Development because Syria is not one of the poorest countries in the world. Although improving the capacity of Syria&#146;s public administration would be very much in the UK&#146;s national interest, DFID felt that it was unable to be of assistance, and as the Minister and I know, the Foreign Office budget is not exactly overflowing with gold pieces. There is therefore an issue for the Government to consider. Offering Syria such help may accord with our national interest, but the ways of providing it are being blocked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000093">On human rights, the evidence of religious toleration within Syria&#146;s overall secular framework is striking. It is at its most striking when one goes to the ancient central mosque in Damascus and sees the Christian shrine to the head of John the Baptist in the centre of the Muslim prayer hall. Although we rightly make, and should continue to make, many criticisms of Syria&#146;s human rights record, we should applaud its record of religious toleration and the freedom that Christian Churches, in particular, have had to thrive at a time when they have been under huge pressure in much of the middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000094">My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) made a good point when he argued for steps to be taken to strengthen contact between Muslim religious scholars in Syria and their counterparts in the UK. When I met the Syrian Minister for Religious Affairs at the Oxford centre for Islamic studies, during his visit here, it seemed to me that he was interested in pursuing such an objective, and I hope that the Government will support that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000095">I hope, also, that the Minister will confirm that, while seeking better relations with Syria, the Government will not hold back from frank conversations about human rights. The 2009 Amnesty International report on Syria says that hundreds of people were arrested or detained for political reasons, that torture is still committed with impunity and that the military police in Syria were reported to have killed at least 17 detainees. We should not shrink from frank discussion with the Syrian  <br>

Government about those abuses of human rights. In addition to bilateral conversations, if institutions such as the United Nations Human Rights Council are to work, and to be more than window dressing, we must show, along with other European countries, that we are prepared to hold countries around the world, friends and adversaries alike, to account within that forum for their human rights record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000096">I want to talk finally about foreign and regional policy. Like other hon. Members who have spoken, I hope that despite the difficulties of the past six months a way can be found to restart the talks hosted by Turkey that brought Israel and Syria, at least indirectly, into a conversation about a peace settlement and, in particular, the future of the Golan heights. Such a settlement, to which they came desperately close a few years ago, is in their strategic interest. Although anyone who considers Israeli-Syrian relations can understand the legacy of bitterness and mistrust at personal and national levels, such an agreement is in the interest of both countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000097">It should be possible to achieve a deal on borders and demilitarisation arrangements, lease-back arrangements for particular peaks, and water, but other issues must be dealt with if there is to be an enduring settlement. Those involve Syria&#146;s relationship with the Palestinians. I hope that the Syrian track will be pursued; I suspect that it will be very difficult to disentangle a Syrian track to peace talks wholly from the Palestinian peace track. Two issues will have to be addressed. The first is Syria&#146;s relationship with Hamas. As we all know, Syria plays host to Khaled Mashal and one of the Hamas factions. I would be interested to know the Government&#146;s assessment of whether Damascus is trying to promote Palestinian unity, because it is difficult to envisage an enduring settlement between Israel and the Palestinians without a measure of Palestinian unity. Nor do I see that such Palestinian unity and a deal, or even a path towards a deal, with Israel, will be attainable without Hamas making concrete progress towards meeting the Quartet conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000098">There have been statements in recent months and years by various Hamas leaders. Sometimes we get a message in articles and interviews in the western press that seems not to be matched by what is said in Arabic language media in Gaza or elsewhere in the Arab world. Certainly I have not yet seen anything that persuades me that Hamas has made concrete progress towards accepting the Quartet conditions. However, it is clear to me that Syria has a significant influence over Hamas. Yet at the time of the Gaza conflict, in the early weeks of this year, we were getting very clear reports that it was Mr. Mashal and his faction in Damascus who were taking the hardest line in opposing efforts to try to broker a ceasefire and truce, to bring at least an immediate end to that bloody conflict, which was costing both lives and livelihoods. We should like a report from the Government on their assessment of Syria&#146;s policy towards Palestinian unity and the role of Hamas; and we should like to know whether the British Government are making their views clear in their conversations with the Syrian authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000099">If there is to be an enduring Israeli-Syrian settlement, the issue of arms supplies to Hezbollah across Syrian territory will have to be addressed. I find it hard to  <br>

envisage any Israeli Government of any political tradition being willing to sign up to a peace treaty with Damascus unless the issue of Hezbollah&#146;s arms is addressed. That, in turn, means attending to issues affecting Lebanon, such as the Shebaa farms, and brings into the equation Syria&#146;s relationship with Iran. It is welcome that, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk said, the Lebanese elections took place peacefully, that the outcome seems to have been accepted by all parties in Lebanon as the fair outcome of the people&#146;s votes, and that there has not been the upsurge of violence or tension that many feared as the elections approached. I hope that that is a good augury for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000100">As to relations between Syria and Iran, I think the Government and Opposition would agree that we want fruitful engagement with Iran, but that the chances of that look, at the moment, sadly slim. Given Iran&#146;s history and population, it is entitled to expect us to take into account legitimate national and regional interests. It is within Iran&#146;s power to be a constructive player in the region, if it should so choose. It is sad that the current leadership seems to be turning its back on that prospect. Syria has access to the top leadership in Tehran&#151;access that no western power enjoys. I simply ask the Minister whether the European Union or other western powers are seeking to use the Syrian channel to communicate messages to the top leadership in Tehran, as we cannot do so directly. Those conversations with Iran are so important, and the possibility of misunderstanding is so great, that even an indirect channel through Damascus is something we should be willing to use whenever possible.</p>

Lebanon passed off smoothly, and Israel has a new Government who may be able to push forward a peace deal with Syria. For some time, the British Government have recognised the importance of the relationship between Syria and the United Kingdom, and I agree with the hon. Member for West Suffolk that Syria has a crucial role in ensuring peace, stability and prosperity in the middle east.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000105">I turn to some of the specific points raised during the debate. The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath asked how we can reach out to moderate Muslim voices, how we can encourage much closer contact between moderates in the middle east and in the UK and how we can bring scholars and young people together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000106">The first thing to put on record in such a debate is that those who preach hate or engage in violence represent a bastardisation of Islam, not a manifestation of it. It is incredibly important that we should say so at every opportunity. When speaking to Muslims, both here and throughout the world, we hear that the mainstream majority want us to make that point time and again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000107">I turn to the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Wycombe. We are working closely with Syrian bodies to exchange knowledge and wisdom on the question of scholars. We look forward to continuing exchanges between Syria and the United Kingdom, and the Government will most definitely support them. The British Council has programmes on student exchanges in partnership with Syrian organisations. I and my officials will be happy to brief the hon. Gentleman, so that we can discuss in more detail how those programmes should function.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000108">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) raised an important matter. He has a long track record of speaking with great passion and commitment on the middle east, but today he raised the important question of refugees. My hon. Friend will be fully aware of our considerable assistance in Iraq. For example, the Department for International Development spent &#163;16 million last year to support agencies working directly with refugees. The Government will continue to discuss the issue with the Syrian regime and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Future support, of course, will be a matter for DFID, which is my former Department&#151;sadly, I can no longer make spending commitments on its behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000109">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield and the hon.

A number of things need to be said. First, we believe that the will of the people of Iran, as expressed in the recent election, must prevail. That matter must be resolved. Secondly, it was entirely inappropriate for Iran to throw out two British diplomats during the past 48 hours; there was no justification whatever for that. Unfortunately, we have been obliged to summon the Iranian ambassador in London to the Foreign Office on three occasions during the past three days. On the first occasion, the deputy ambassador arrived. On the second two occasions, senior  <br>

Foreign Office representatives met the ambassador. At the most recent meetings, we were obliged to ask Iran to remove two of its diplomatic staff from London. That does not assist us in trying to improve the relationship between our two countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000111">Some of the rhetoric deployed by Iran against the United Kingdom over the past few days is clearly and unequivocally unacceptable and undesirable, and it does nothing to help Iran&#146;s relationship with the UK or with the rest of the international community. Indeed, during the past 24 hours, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said that Iran has a choice: it can either be a part of the international community in every way&#151;politically and economically, and from a security point of view, it is part of the solution&#151;or it can stand aside. The consequences of the latter will clearly not be desirable to the people of Iran.</p>

 My hon. Friend makes an important point about human rights affecting the ability to trade. I presume that he takes the same view of all countries in the middle east, particularly Israel.

If that is the case for Israel, it should also be the case for Syria.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Further progress on the EU-Israel association agreement depends on progress in the middle east peace process, as has been made clear in the dialogue within the EU and between it and the state of Israel. The hon. Member for Aylesbury raised a point about the UK&#146;s ability to help Syria with governance and administration issues. We shall consider any requests for such help sympathetically. Our embassy currently has a small number of civil society projects in which we work in co-operation with the Syrian Government, and I am happy to provide him with further information about those projects if that would be useful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000119">I think that I have dealt, more or less, with hon. Members&#146; specific contributions, and I now want to talk in more detail about the UK&#146;s relationship with Syria and how we envisage the latter playing a crucial role in the middle east more generally. Our dialogue with the Syrian Government has focused on engaging with Syria, using our diplomatic tools to encourage progress in certain areas and urging a change of policy in others. However, we are realistic about the issues in our so-called critical dialogue with Syria. Our eyes are wide open and&#151;to mix my metaphors&#151;there is no danger of the wool being pulled over them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="90624h0003.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000120">That is part of a wider process. As the Foreign Secretary noted, in his recent speech on Islam in Oxford, Britain has embassies in 38 Muslim-majority countries and maintains diplomatic engagement with countries with which we have disagreements. The key point is that we seek to influence through engagement and dialogue. As part of that, last year, the Foreign Secretary visited Syria&#151;the first British Cabinet Minister to do so since 2001&#151;and my ministerial predecessor, who is now the Minister for the Armed Forces, visited Syria in April as part of our ongoing efforts to engage with it. I hope to visit the region over the next few months. Perhaps the hon. Member for West Suffolk would like to be my guide&#151;that was not a totally serious offer, but we shall see.</p>

What are those issues? We welcome past movement towards dialogue between Israel and Syria&#151;crucially on both sides. It is obvious that talks between these two countries have the potential to provide a significant contribution towards a lasting and comprehensive middle east peace process. We want talks to continue on the basis of land for peace&#151;full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan heights in exchange for peace and security for Israel with fully normalised bilateral relations. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath and the hon. Member for Aylesbury made that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000123">One issue on which Syria has an opportunity to work productively with the international community is co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. More recently, the IAEA has raised concern over uranium particles found in Syria, and we strongly urge Syria to co-operate with the investigation and to provide, without further delay, the access that the IAEA seeks. It is unacceptable for Syria to continue to refuse access. The US has provided compelling evidence to suggest that Syria was developing a nuclear reactor, and we strongly support the mandate of the IAEA to investigate those claims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000124">Another important part of Syria&#146;s role in the region relates to Iraq. It is important to acknowledge the number of positive measures that the Syrian Government have taken to improve relations with the Iraqi Government&#151;a number of high-level visits between the two and the establishment of a joint working group to help secure the Syria-Iraq border. We should welcome those very positive steps. However, it is vital, for Syria&#146;s own security and as part of building its relations with the west, that it continues on the path of taking concerted action to tackle al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. I welcome Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem&#146;s statement that tackling al-Qaeda and other groups that use Syria as a transit route for attacks in Iraq is a high priority. The UK Government have made it clear to the Syrian Government that we are prepared to support and encourage their work in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000125">We cannot, however, tackle extremism or find a resolution to the middle east conflict without regard to the human angle. We need to give people the confidence that their state will protect them and secure their rights. Syria&#146;s record on human rights is poor. There can be no excuse for, or dismissal of, that point when discussing our relationship. The Prime Minister has argued, and I agree, that ours is a global society in which universal rights and values still leave room for extraordinarily rich and different ways of living. As the hon. Member for West Suffolk pointed out, Syrian society is rich and diverse, with a tolerance for different faiths. There is much to welcome and applaud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000126">As the hon. Member for Aylesbury mentioned, however, over the past year, there has been a worrying deterioration in the human rights situation in Syria. Critics of the Government&#151;those who call for peaceful democratic reform and those who post dissenting comments on internet blogs have been imprisoned&#151;and as much as we might be tempted to go down that path, in this country, I can assure hon. Members that it will never happen. Sadly, however, disappearances, travel bans and arbitrary detention are increasingly common. There are reports of torture during interrogation and deaths in police custody. We continue, however, to call on Syria to implement internationally agreed minimum standards on the prevention of torture.</p>

the dignity of the state and distributing false news&#151;another interesting crime that we could think about putting on the statute book in this country. The defendants pleaded not guilty and have done nothing except peacefully exercise their fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Syrian constitution and international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000128">In recent months, there has also been a significant increase in arrests and harassment of Kurds. Hon. Members would like to make it clear that that is not acceptable. Kurdish rights are still not legitimised within the Syrian constitution. Three Syrian Kurds were killed after security forces opened fire on a demonstration marking Kurdish new year in March 2008. Such behaviour does not serve Syria well; nor does it help to bring peace to a region of extraordinary history and complexity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000129">I do not want to rehearse the history of Syria&#146;s relationship with Lebanon, because it is more useful to focus on the future. We welcome the decision by Syria and Lebanon to establish diplomatic relations and the arrival of respective ambassadors. We also welcome the peaceful conduct of elections in Lebanon and the acceptance by all parties of the outcome. These are important steps forward. However, Syria can do more. It is bound, by UN Security Council resolutions 1559, 1680 and 1701, not to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs, including through material support for Hezbollah. Instead, Syria should continue its regional role in promoting stability and political progress in Lebanon, including through its relations with Saudi Arabia. Demarcation of the Syria-Lebanon border and a resolution of the issue of those missing from both sides are urgent next steps. For too long, Lebanon has suffered from external interference of one kind or another, and Syria has a role to play in ensuring that Lebanon does not again fall victim to that.</p>

Members, I disagree. Isolation is not the answer. We should be realistic, but we shall not ignore Syria or its important role. At this time of great importance in the region, the UK will, through high-ranking Ministers and senior officials, continue to make all efforts to address all the issues between the UK and Syria. This is a timely debate. None of us needs reminding of the importance of President Obama&#146;s speech in Cairo. He acknowledged the tensions, fears and mistrust that can exist between different peoples, but he also spoke of a new beginning based on trust and respect.</p>

 I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the issue of nitrate vulnerable zones. I should like to thank the National Farmers Union for its expert knowledge, and the Environment Agency for its briefing. I secured this debate because the matter of nitrate vulnerable zones is of great concern to farmers in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000134">I should like to put it on record that I own farmland, but it is not in my constituency and it does not lie within a nitrate vulnerable zone. The sole purpose of this debate is to stand up for the interests of my constituents in Norfolk. Farmers there have had a tough time recently due to increased bureaucracy, extreme weather conditions and animal disease. The farming community makes an extremely important contribution to Britain&#146;s economy. Does the Minister not agree that that means that it is even more vital to ensure that farmers feel supported by the Government?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para12"><a name="09062511000135">Although agriculture has been in general decline over the last century, it remains hugely important for rural employment and the rural economy as a whole. In South-West Norfolk, agriculture plays a large role in maintaining our local communities, which is why I have raised the issue of nitrate vulnerable zones on more than one occasion in Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000136">All hon. Members with big farming communities in their constituencies have received a lot of correspondence from farmers who are worried about the new rules. Farmers have raised their concerns about closed periods for the spreading of manure, compulsory cover crops, slurry storage regulations, the lack of scientific evidence to justify changes and the increase in regulations and red tape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para14"><a name="09062511000137">Farmers have always accepted the fact that the environmental impact of farming practices must be addressed. However, more than anything they are dismayed by the associated costs of the regulations that have now come into force. The NFU estimates the average cost of extending slurry storage alone to be somewhere in the region of &#163;50,000 per farm. Does the Minister accept that that is a huge additional cost, particularly in light of the fact that farmers are already struggling?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000138">Moreover, there are a number of concerns surrounding the implementation of the nitrate vulnerable zone regulations, on which I shall concentrate. At this point, I should like to say that this is a timely debate. The Government have succeeded in securing a derogation from the livestock manure nitrogen limit in designated NVZs, which I welcome. It will allow farms up to 80 kg more nitrogen per hectare than the EU standard of 170 kg. At least 80 per cent. of the farmland is grassland, so such a measure will particularly benefit dairy farmers. It is likely that a statutory instrument relating to the derogation will be scheduled for the autumn. That will be a window of opportunity for the Government to consider and address other critical issues of concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000139">Part 7 of the new regulations introduces a number of rules relating to slurry storage. By January 2012, farmers must provide at least six months&#146; storage capacity for poultry manures and pig slurry, and at least five months&#146; capacity for other types of livestock manure. Farmers must follow a defined process when calculating how  <br>

much storage they need. They must ensure that storage facilities meet legal standards of construction as well as keeping annual records regarding all of the above. Until the next review in 2012, farmers will be subjected to a rigorous action programme to ensure that they meet the new guidelines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000140">It has now emerged that the Environment Agency believes that 6 per cent. of all farmland has been wrongly designated. That may sound insignificant, but we are talking about some 6,000 farms.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that there is some reason to be very concerned about the methodology that is being used to designate nitrate vulnerable zones? In my own constituency near Holsworthy, we have under appeal a nitrate vulnerable zone, in which the nitrate levels are attributable not to slurry or to farm run-off, but to a series of other factors that have nothing to do with farming.</p>

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="09062511000142"><a name="90624h0004.htm_spnew2"><a name="09062511000532"><b>Christopher Fraser:</b>
 At the end of the day, there is a lot of confusion about nitrate vulnerable zones and the criteria under which farms have to operate. My hon. and learned Friend articulates very well the concerns of farmers in both his constituency and mine, which must be addressed by the Government today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000143">When I say 6,000 farms, I am including areas that were designated NVZs in 2002 but which did not technically meet the necessary criteria in 2006 under the new methodology that was used, yet the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs took a policy decision to retain the farmland as NVZs on the ground that nitrate levels in those areas might increase again. Its justification for that decision can be found in step 6 of the surface and ground water methodology. Farmers in such zones will be expected to invest tens of thousands of pounds in additional slurry storage that may prove to be unnecessary. What is the Minister&#146;s response to the Environment Agency&#146;s assessment and does he recognise that there is an argument for amending the nitrate pollution prevention regulations so that they do not apply to those areas designated as NVZs under step 6 of the surface and ground water methodology?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000144">DEFRA has said that the methodology used in 2006</p>

Does the Minister still believe that DEFRA&#146;s decision was robust, and does he recognise that farmers see it as yet another example of the Government&#146;s policy of unnecessary gold-plating? All areas including those not designated as NVZs were subject to a further four years of monitoring that came to an end in 2008. The date may or may not confirm that some farmland does not now require designation. When does the Minister expect the Environment Agency to complete its assessment of the new data? Moreover, can he prioritise the issue and ask the Environment Agency to analyse the information as speedily as possible?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000146">That request is most urgent because the issue of slurry storage is a matter of capital investment for farmers across the country. Farmers will incur significant and possibly avoidable costs to meet the NVZ action  <br>

programme requirements. If the Minister is not willing to commit to prioritising analysis of the new data, what consideration will he give to compensation for those farmers who, through no fault of their own, might lose out financially as a result of their land being wrongly designated?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para22"><a name="09062511000147">Unlike in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, English farmers receive no grants for building extra slurry storage. That requirement has been imposed on farmers and it has, unsurprisingly, come as a huge financial blow to them. Does the Minister not agree that the lack of grants for our farmers in England is discriminatory?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para23"><a name="09062511000148">Having talked about the rules over slurry storage, I should like to touch briefly on closed periods for the spreading of manure and fertiliser. The new regulations mean that most farmers are prevented from spreading between September and February. That aspect of the regulations worried farmers before they came into force for a number of persuasive reasons. A farmer from my constituency said:</p>
<a name="90624h0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09062511000446"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Closed periods for spreading of manures does not really have any effect on diffuse pollution - muck is still to be spread on the land. Our weather is so unpredictable we could be spreading during a month of heavy rainfall, damaging soil structure or the next crop.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para24"><a name="09062511000149">The NFU concurs with such arguments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000150">The closed period means that farmers will be spreading their manure when land is more likely to be waterlogged. With heavy vehicles going over the land, soil damage is inevitable. There is also a greater risk of run-off if the land is frozen solid. Before the regulations came into force, farmers had the freedom to spread manure at their discretion. Many, including most dairy farmers, would spread little and often to manage their lagoons, but closed periods mean that they are unable to do so. Why are the Government so reluctant to trust farmers to make informed decisions on when it is best to spread manure? Does the Minister accept that the closed period regulations are simply a barrier to farmers following good agricultural practice derived from their professional judgment and endless experience?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000151">The Government are forcing farmers to operate under a prescriptive system that fails to take their experience into account. Does the Minister agree that it would be better to trust farmers to follow responsible farming practices? He could ensure, through regular inspections, that those who do not do so face the consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para27"><a name="09062511000152">One solution for farmers who will struggle to spread their manure during the very short available time frame is new technology. One company I know of has just developed an energy-efficient pulse jet irrigator that allows farmers to spread their manure quickly and effectively with a reduced risk of run-off. However, the technology is prohibited solely because its trajectory exceeds by a small margin the 4 m limit. That is another example of the regulations making it harder for farmers to operate efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para28"><a name="09062511000153">I do not want to endorse one particular company, but will the Minister assure me that DEFRA is taking into account the development of new technologies that could help farmers to cope with the new rules? Does he believe that in some cases, there might be an argument for amending the regulations, particularly if that would benefit farmers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para29"><a name="09062511000154">The methodology for designation for the next review in 2012 is not yet fixed, but it needs to be improved. The Environment Agency developed the current designation method under considerable time pressures, and I believe that it contains weaknesses. If an area has a lot of sewage points, it will be designated as nitrate vulnerable. However, that may not reflect agriculture in the area. As a result, farmers have to bear high costs through no fault of their own. That is unfair and it must be addressed as a matter of great urgency. Will the Minister confirm that DEFRA is looking at amending the methodology as a matter of priority in time for the next NVZ review? I am aware that the network of monitoring points was reviewed in 2007, but given that NVZs are based on historical data, it could be several years before data from the old network are removed from the system.</p>

 The Minister might be able to help us on one matter. There is a huge number of outstanding appeals in connection with current designations. Will he give us some sort of timetable for the disposal of those appeals? Many farmers are living in suspense and are unable to make business decisions.</p>

 My hon. and learned Friend makes a first-class point. Appeal processes cause enormous disruption to farms and the processes within farms. I know the Minister to be a decent and genuine man, and I am sure that he will give fair consideration to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para30"><a name="09062511000157">The financial burdens are inappropriate and unnecessary, particularly in a period of flux concerning appeals and processes, and they create a major problem for rural businesses that are already suffering. Does the Minister recognise the frustration that farmers feel when their land has been designated as a result of sewage discharge, particularly given that nitrate from sewage works is dealt with by the urban waste water treatment directive, which is an entirely different directive? Moreover, although all farms must take action when nitrate levels are considered a problem, only certain sewage works are required to do the same. Does he accept the need to reduce emissions of nitrate from sewage works that drain to waters that are nitrate polluted? What is he going to do to ensure that that happens?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="90624h0004.htm_para31"><a name="09062511000158">The new regulations that apply to NVZs have huge financial implications for farmers&#151;I cannot over-emphasise that point. I believe it to be incumbent on the Government to implement the rules fairly and accurately across the board. So far, they have fallen short on that duty, and farmers have been left in the lurch. I look forward to the Minister addressing the various points that I have made, so that we can return to our constituencies and assure our farmers of a brighter future.</p>

It is sufficient to say that it is a prime Government objective to protect water,  <br>

improve the condition of protected sites and enhance biodiversity. We do not resile from those imperatives, and nor would he and his colleagues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000161">We must put the debate in the context that we have achieved substantial improvement in the past couple of decades. That is good news, but it does not mean that we have succeeded entirely. In fact, the continuing high levels of nitrate in our waters from various sources remain a concern and they are a significant cause of water pollution. The costs for treating water to meet drinking water requirements on nitrates during the period 2005 to 2010 are estimated to be &#163;288 million in capital expenditure and &#163;6 million per year in operating expenditure&#151;not insignificant amounts. The costs of environmental damage to river and wetland ecosystems and natural habitats are estimated to be in the region of &#163;716 million to &#163;1,297 million per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000162">This is not entirely about farming, as was rightly pointed out, but we estimate that agriculture contributes approximately 60 per cent. of nitrogen entering our rivers. We cannot get away from that. Therefore, farmers are part of the solution and have a key role in reducing such pollution. Their actions will also contribute to meeting the more demanding environmental objectives of the water framework directive, which is coming down the track towards us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000163">We carried out a review of the action programme and introduced some changes. The review of nitrate pollution and the effectiveness of the old action programme measures highlighted that we continue to have one of the highest levels of nitrate pollution in Europe. Although the monitoring data suggest that nitrate levels in many surface waters have a downward trend, we have no certain basis on which to conclude that they are significant or, importantly, sustained trends. We do not want ping-pong, back and forth; we need to ensure that the trends are sustained. Our review showed that concentrations remain high and that they are increasing in some areas, particularly in ground waters. That is part of the reason why we increased the coverage of NVZs from 55 to 70 per cent. in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000164">During the review, we took on board the views of stakeholders through the consultation process and made a number of significant amendments to our original proposals as a result. For example, farmers told us that the proposed requirement for cover crops to be established on land left bare over the autumn and winter could cause significant practical difficulties, and they were right. We listened to their concerns and as a result removed the measure from the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000165">We also had to take on board concerns raised by the European Commission through infraction proceedings&#151;the dread of any Minister&#151;that were ongoing at the time.

 In the time remaining, I will try to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. If I leave any unanswered, I will ensure that I write to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000168">On the issue of gold-plating and what is happening in other European member states, it was clear that we were lagging behind in implementation and in achieving environmental outcomes. The revised action programme brings us more into line with action being taken in other member states. However, I must point out that some of them have more stringent requirements. For example, 12 months&#146; slurry storage is required in Finland, satellites are used to check compliance in Belgium and applications of fertiliser are restricted below economic optimum in Denmark. I just wanted to put that issue in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000169">We believe firmly that the revised action programme measures represent the best possible outcome to advance our aims of protecting the water environment and meeting our legal obligations while taking account of the impact on farmers as well. Their concerns are quite practical. We recognise that farmers may face significant costs as a result of the revised action programme. In some instances, those costs might prove difficult to meet, especially in light of the current economic climate and the recent collapse of Dairy Farmers of Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000170">However, we do not intend to change our position on grant support, and I will explain why. No new Government money will be provided to help with construction of additional manure storage facilities. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said about other countries, but experience indicates clearly that awarding capital grants can, for example, increase storage tank supply prices&#151;we have seen that happen before&#151;and postpone the impact of market forces. Providing grants would also contravene the &#147;polluter pays&#148; principle, to which I think we all generally sign up, and we prefer to avoid putting public funds towards securing compliance with regulatory standards. However, we remain committed to improving how we regulate and enforce regulation and to keeping administrative burdens to a minimum, and we will seek to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000171">For example, we recently announced our success in obtaining a derogation from the livestock manure N farm limit of 170 kg of nitrate per hectare per year, which was one of the more demanding requirements of the directive. I note the hon. Gentleman&#146;s welcome of that announcement. In the short term, it will reduce the economic cost to the livestock industry significantly, by between &#163;16.9 million and &#163;21.7 million a year. That represents about 50 per cent. of the overall cost to the dairy sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000172">There are also numerous existing sources of financial support for our farmers, and we need to do our best to highlight them.

Slurry storage facilities are eligible for plant and machinery allowances such as the annual investment allowance, which is capped at &#163;50,000 per year.

 Can the Minister confirm what the National Farmers Union and other farming organisations have estimated to be the average cost of extending slurry storage?

 I cannot confirm the exact costs, but as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we recognise that they could be significant. When I was on a farm the other day, I spoke with a gentleman who had purchased the equipment second-hand from another farmer down the road who was upgrading his equipment; he had made a killing on it. Fair dos. I speak from my own family background: farmers can be a good and ingenious lot who ensure that they maximise their economic output. However, the costs could well be significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000175">The hon. Gentleman raised a specific point about de-designation. As a result of the latest review, we de-designated some small areas originally designated in 2002, amounting to about 1.5 per cent. of England. That was done on the basis of improvements in the monitoring of ground water quality and the use of hydrological knowledge and data that allowed us to identify more accurately where polluted ground waters and their catchments were.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para12"><a name="09062511000176">The review also identified that there are small areas of the NVZs that drain to waters which no longer have nitrate concentrations above the &#147;polluted&#148; threshold of 50 mg. However, I must make it clear that those areas were not wrongly designated. They were correctly identified as polluted at the time of the previous round of NVZ designations in 2002. They were not de-designated following the latest review, owing to issues with sustainability. The data are insufficient for us to be confident that the observed improvement in water quality would be sustained. That might change, but at the moment, if we de-designate, we could well start ping-ponging back and forth. It could be to the disadvantage of farmers if we de-designated them and then had to re-designate them if the improvement proved unsustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000177">We have taken the decision to develop a methodology in good time for the next four-yearly review. I have noted the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about timeliness; I will ensure that that is done and keep my foot on the throttle. I also noted the comments that farmers in potential de-designation areas might have to commit to significant expenditure even though the application of the action programme rules in those areas might be short-lived. As the Minister responsible, I recognise that that issue is important and thank him for raising it. We will engage actively with the agricultural industry and farmers in the areas concerned&#151;we know where they are&#151;to discuss the options and how to resolve the situation. We do not want to be impractical; we want to work with them to find a way through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para14"><a name="09062511000178">I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we are continuing our work to improve the methodology in good time to reflect improvements in scientific understanding. We  <br>

will develop those improvements in consultation with stakeholders and academic experts, using peer review where necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000179">In conclusion, we are continuing work to ensure that our implementation of the nitrates directive achieves the right balance between achieving sustainable and efficient farming practices, allowing as much flexibility for farmers as possible and minimising unnecessary costs and burdens, and respecting the need to improve water quality through the regulatory framework set down in the nitrates directive.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for giving way for the last time, as we have a few minutes left and he said &#147;in conclusion&#148;. Will he address my question about closed periods and tell us why the Government are so reluctant to trust farmers to make informed decisions in their farms&#146; best interests? The Government are being prescriptive. Farmers have had generations of experience, and occasionally Departments have not.</p>

 That is a good point, and I apologise for not addressing it. I am glad that we have a little time left. The action programme prohibits slurry applications to waterlogged and frozen land. Farmers need to assess the risk of run-off before applying slurry, using their own judgment, and to apply it only when ground conditions are suitable, but the closed periods are designed to avoid the risk of contamination through run-off of ground water in tricky conditions at certain times of the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000182">The hon. Gentleman mentioned sewage treatment works. We implement the European Community urban waste water treatment directive, which sets the standard for treatment at sewage treatment works. We are equally committed to driving that through as well. He was right to make the point that it is not only about what comes from the agricultural industry. That is a significant part of the problem, but it is also about the other ways that we treat sewage.</p>

Gentleman has given us to reiterate that fact&#151;and to work with his constituents and many others throughout the country who, I am sure, share our desire to achieve good water quality standards and ensure that our farmers are assisted with advice, support and, occasionally, through the measures that I mentioned, financial help.

 It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Caton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000186">So much has been written and said over the last few years about the collapse of Equitable Life that I begin this debate with some trepidation, especially as the previous debate in this House was barely a month ago and was introduced by the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis). Although our political perspectives are very different, he is a Member of this House for whom I have the greatest respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000187">Today, I wish to make a further attempt to advance the just cause of many of my constituents who have been so badly affected by what has happened to Equitable Life, and whose lives have been altered radically as a result. I am certain that I am not alone in that. The debate of 19 May showed how many hon. Members take a close interest in the issue. My aim is not simply to repeat that and other debates, but to add something new from the experiences of my constituents, and to give other hon. Members the chance to make contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000188">My most important aim is to persuade the Government to agree to the recommendations of the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s original report, &#147;Equitable Life: a decade of regulatory failure&#148;, which was published in July 2008. Since the publication of that report, the Public Administration Committee has produced a report entitled, &#147;Justice Delayed&#148; on 11 December 2008 and just last month, on 5 May, the parliamentary ombudsman published a further report, &#147;Injustice unremedied: the Government&#146;s response on Equitable Life&#148;. There is no shortage of reports, just a shortage of justice for those who, through no fault of their own, have suffered huge losses in the life savings that they accrued over years of hard work. Surely that cannot be right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para22"><a name="09062511000189">I admit that, like many hon. Members who until recently knew little about how all this came about, I was not very sympathetic at first. However, as it became clear that, as much as the world&#146;s oldest mutual insurance company had overstretched itself, the real issue was poor regulation, I became more and more concerned and so more and more interested in what my constituents were telling me. I suspect that that experience has echoed around the whole House and that there is not one hon. Member who has not received correspondence from their constituents about Equitable Life. That is reflected by the attendance at this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para23"><a name="09062511000190">It may be helpful if I reiterate a brief history of how this disaster came about before I recount some of the personal tragedies that resulted from the poor management and disastrous regulation of Equitable Life.</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="09062511000191"><a name="90624h0005.htm_spnew7"><a name="09062511000543"><b>Sir Paul Beresford (Mole Valley) (Con):</b>
 I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is right that every MP has constituents with such difficulties. I probably have more than most because of the spread and make-up of my constituency. The damage that this matter has done to people who have worked and paid for their retirement is enormous. I have two points to make. First, we should move the compensation and have it early. Secondly, we should take the partiality of the scheme away.</p>

 I hope that the hon. Gentleman will listen carefully to my speech because it will include many of the points that he has rightly raised. I hope that he will be satisfied that I am pressing for the same things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para24"><a name="09062511000193">Equitable Life was founded in 1762 as a mutual insurance company, based on the ideas of Charles Dodson, a fellow of the Royal Society and a man well ahead of his time. It started selling pensions as early as 1913, but it was not until 1957 that the society started selling its infamous guaranteed annuity rate pensions, which gave a clear and unambiguous return on capital invested, depending on the age at which the policyholder decided to start taking the annuity. That carried on until 1988, when the society realised that its rates were so good and so far ahead of the rest of the market that they were unsustainable. In December 2000, Equitable Life was forced to close to new business. By that time, it had more than 1.5 million members. That is why so many hon. Members have so many constituents who have suffered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="90624h0005.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000194">The introduction to the December 2008 Public Administration Committee report stated:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para0"><a name="09062511000200">I said earlier that I would highlight some of the many cases that have been brought to my attention by my constituents, and I am sure that we could all raise such cases. The majority of the public, who have had no contact with or money invested in Equitable Life, would be forgiven for thinking that only those who had considerable investment in the company have lost out over recent years. The reality is different, as the examples will show. I have protected the names of my constituents by using initials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000201">Mrs. H of north Leeds told me that her modest &#163;200 a month income was reduced overnight to less than &#163;100 a month, although it is now back up to about &#163;120. She is 83 and was completely dependent on that &#163;200 a month. When it was reduced by more than half, she found it hard to cope financially. It was only the help of her ex-husband that kept her going. She still struggles every month because of the continued shortfall in her income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000202">At the other end of the scale, Mr. A is a retired solicitor who started investing in a pension policy with Equitable Life in his mid-30s. Given the record of the company and the projections for growth over succeeding years, that would have given him a fund large enough to pay a substantial income from the annuity that he would have started aged 65. He is now 61. Not only has he seen no growth in his fund over the past few years, but the annuity he was guaranteed is no longer possible. He lost out twice: first, when his investment failed to reach its promised level and, secondly, when he discovered that the guaranteed annuity rate had been abolished. The fund was far lower than he had planned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000203">Mr. A provided the following example. Say he had invested a total of &#163;100,000 in 1997. According to Equitable Life&#146;s plan, that sum should have grown to about &#163;133,000 by 2000. However, because the society had frozen all investments by that time, his fund would have remained at &#163;100,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000204">In order to halt the reduction in the value of his investment, Mr. A decided to move the fund to another company and paid a penalty of &#163;20,000 for the privilege. That is a high penalty, but is sadly not uncommon in the industry. In 1997 he had an investment of &#163;100,000, which he could have reasonably believed would have helped to provide part of an annuity that would have guaranteed him a good pension income. Three years later, he had only &#163;80,000 to invest&#151;a loss of &#163;53,000 compared with what he might have expected, or a reduction of just under 40 per cent. in the value of his fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000205">Dr. C is a retired consultant who lost more than &#163;25,000 after investing &#163;100,000 in Equitable Life. He spread his investments carefully, so although he is angry at his loss, he has not been left destitute. However, he blames the regulatory regime that allowed this to happen in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="09062511000206"><a name="90624h0006.htm_spnew0"><a name="09062511000547"><b>Miss Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove) (Con):</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right to say that some people have experienced considerable loss and that others have had less of a loss. Nevertheless, people have still lost an important income on which they were relying for their old age. The terrible thing about Equitable Life is that in seeking to look after themselves in their old age, the 1.5 million policyholders were doing the right thing by themselves and for society, yet they have been very badly let down. That is why Parliament has to act.</p>

 The hon. Lady is right. Later in my remarks, I shall address the points that she has made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000208">Why is the regulator to blame? Surely investors must have understood that their investments could decrease as well as increase. How could Equitable Life have maintained a rate of return and a guaranteed annuity rate that was way beyond any competitor in the market? Those are the questions that Ann Abraham addressed in her initial report of July 2008, which took four years to complete. Her answers go to the heart of the anger expressed by investors through the Equitable Members Action Group, or EMAG.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000209">At the core of the problem is the fact that Equitable Life simply could not meet the obligations that it had made for itself because it made no provision for guarantees against low interest rates on policies issued before 1988. It therefore declared bonuses out of all proportion to its profits and assets. Following the ruling of the House of Lords in July 2000, the society stopped taking new business in December of that year, which effectively spelt the end for Equitable. More than 1 million policyholders then found that they faced cuts in their bonuses and annuities, which caused a huge loss of income, on which many small investors had depended. After all, the average investment for the 500,000 individual policyholders was just &#163;45,000, which, according to EMAG, even at its height yielded no more than &#163;300 a month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000210">In July 2001, the new board of directors slashed policy values by 16 per cent.&#151;about &#163;4 billion&#151;and proceeded to effect a compromise scheme to deal with the guaranteed annuity rate issue. However, Equitable Life&#146;s problems were too deep-seated, so the scheme was not enough to enable it to ride out the stock market falls of 2001-02. In 2002, policy values were cut by another 10 per cent. and the society was forced to invest almost exclusively in fixed interest stocks. Almost none of its money was invested in equity shares, so it could not operate as a with-profit insurer and its policyholders did not benefit from the stock market&#146;s substantial rise between 2003 to 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000211">As I am sure we all remember, in 2004, Lord Penrose carried out an investigation into Equitable Life. However, he had no power to apportion blame or recommend compensation. He highlighted the society&#146;s unsustainable bonus policy and the</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="90624h0006.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000212">that it used to discourage action by the regulators. He concluded:</p>

In the small print, the apology, the ex gratia payments scheme and the Treasury&#146;s instruction to Sir John Chadwick were all restricted to those findings of the parliamentary ombudsman that the Treasury accepted.

In the document, he repeats that the Government accept the ombudsman&#146;s finding that the injustice suffered by policyholders should be looked at on an individual basis. He states that he is satisfied that his terms of reference do not require him to engage in any form of means-testing in relation to individual policyholders, but that they oblige him to disregard any of the ombudsman&#146;s findings of maladministration and injustice, which are not accepted by the Government.</p>

The state simply will not have sufficient resources to provide enough money in statutory pension payments. The problem will only become worse as the years pass and the proportion of younger people in work reduces in relation to those in retirement. It is already clear that my generation, now in our mid-50s, will have to work longer before retirement.

Webster had not heard of it, but it had the word &#147;ombu&#148;, which is a tree with a broad trunk that is isolated in the south American pampas. I thought that that was the origin of the beginning of the word because the ombudsman is isolated, on her own, works against many people, and has a tremendously broad base. But when I looked in Chambers and the Oxford dictionary, I saw that it is a Swedish word, which I am sure all hon. Members know.

They have simply done what they believed was right by making provision from their normal, average incomes when they were in work, so that they could support themselves when they were not in work.

should accept the ombudsman&#146;s recommendations to establish a compensation scheme to pay those who suffered the injustice. That injustice was caused by the failure of public bodies. The aim of such a scheme should be to put those who suffered a loss back into the position that they would have been in had the regulator&#146;s maladministration not occurred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000289">The ombudsman said that it would be reasonable to expect a compensation scheme to be established within six months of any decision by the Government and Parliament to establish such a scheme. Given the advanced age of many of the policyholders, it is important that the Government and Parliament should aim to meet that timetable. However, the remit that the Government gave Sir John Chadwick is utterly inadequate. It is greatly restrained by the fact that Sir John is allowed to take into account only those recommendations that the Government accepted. I believe that that breaks the link in the chain between maladministration, injustice and compensation.</p>

 I have been contrasting the approach that the Government have taken in the case of Equitable Life with the much better approach that was taken over the state earnings-related pension scheme disaster, which the hon. Gentleman may remember. One reason for the difference in approach was that, after the SERPS disaster, two Committees of the House&#151;the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Administration Committee&#151;received evidence and made strong recommendations. It was their thrust that made the Government spend some billions&#151;I think it was &#163;3 billion; the hon. Gentleman will remember, because he served on one of the Committees. A problem now is that Chadwick is reporting not to the House but to the Treasury, whose primary interest in the present economic disaster is saving money. The issue is a moral one, as all the speeches this afternoon have highlighted. Therefore, should not Chadwick report first to the House, not the Treasury? The House is the moral guardian in the matter of Equitable Life.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. It is important also to remember that the ombudsman is the parliamentary ombudsman, and not the Government ombudsman. Parliament, not the Government, should take the decisions. I hope that through the deliberations of the Committee that we shall set up tomorrow, we may get to a situation in which individual hon. Members can initiate motions in the House&#151;I believe that that used to be the situation, long before I entered the House&#151;as early-day motion 1423 on Equitable Life, which many hon. Members have signed, could then be debated and voted on in the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000292">In May, the ombudsman used what has been described as the nuclear option. She used her ultimate sanction of laying before Parliament a short report expressing her gross dissatisfaction with the Government&#146;s inadequate response to her original report. Like that original report, her follow-up report is accurately titled: &#147;Injustice unremedied&#148;. She used the phrase &#147;deeply disappointed&#148;, which is strong language from an ombudsman. I hope that the Government will reflect on it and implement the recommendations.</p>

Perhaps most importantly I congratulate the 272 Members of Parliament who have signed the early-day motion. That is practically a voting majority in the House, particularly if we take into account the number of hon. Members who simply do not sign EDMs. I think it is the No. 1 EDM, if one can calibrate them in that way. That carries through the incredibly important message that were the motion to be put to the House, which, it seems to me, should be the ultimate decision maker, it would almost certainly pass, and would uphold the ombudsman and her report, and the decision for compensation. I join the others who have argued that as we look, now, to reforming the House, a crucial message is being given, to drive us towards creating opportunities for the House to have its say on such crucial matters.</p>

Secondly, compensation is an essential discipline of the regulatory and governmental system. If no consequences follow from regulatory failure, either for the regulating body or the Government, there will be much more regulatory failure in the future. Just as the market has its disciplines, so must the regulatory system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000305">No one is suggesting that what happened is all down to regulatory failure. The ombudsman has provided the Government with a basis on which to proceed to an assessment of how far regulatory failure affected the savings and stake of policyholders, compensating only for regulatory failure, and even taking account of the fiscal position. The ombudsman has done a very careful and responsible job.</p>

The credibility of the ombudsman system is at stake&#151;that system that we recommend to people as a way of putting their case, which we take to the ombudsman on their behalf. With it the credibility of Ministers is at stake. It is not satisfactory to appear to be responding to ombudsman&#146;s recommendations, but not to carry them out, particularly when that affects those who have been so vividly described by hon. Members during the debate, whose vulnerability has been clearly set out, and who deserve a great deal better than they currently get.</p>

but also appropriate by offering my congratulations and gratitude to the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) on raising the topic. I welcome the Exchequer Secretary to her position. She is new to the Treasury. I hope that I do not sound churlish when I say that it would have been better had the Economic Secretary, who continues to serve in the Treasury, been present, because that would have offered greater continuity with the many previous debates in which he has given statements or replied on the Government&#146;s behalf. Nevertheless, we look forward to hearing the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000308">The background to this matter will be familiar to most if not all hon. Members present. The Government, through the then Department of Trade and Industry, the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary&#146;s Department, had responsibility for ensuring that the company Equitable Life acted properly and prudently. There have been no fewer than 13 reports on the failure of Equitable Life. The ones cited most often include those by Lord Penrose and by the FSA on its role from 1999 to 2000. Even the European Parliament issued a report on the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para14"><a name="09062511000309">However, the report that everyone concentrates on and that has been mentioned repeatedly during this debate is by the parliamentary ombudsman. It cost, I am told, &#163;3.5 million and took four years to bring to a conclusion. An extremely thorough report, it is entitled &#147;Equitable Life: a decade of regulatory failure&#148;. The report does exactly what it says on the tin. We almost do not need to read the report; the title itself tells us the verdict that was arrived at. Nevertheless, it is worth pulling out a few quotes. The ombudsman said that the Government&#146;s restrictions on earlier inquiries were &#147;iniquitous and unfair&#148;. The DTI&#146;s oversight of Equitable Life had been &#147;passive, reactive and complacent&#148;. The FSA&#146;s regulatory efforts had been</p>
<a name="90624h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="09062511000469"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;largely ineffective and often inappropriate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000310">The policyholders had</p>
<a name="90624h0008.htm_brev1"><a name="09062511000470"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a justifiable sense of outrage&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000311">The language is stark. We are used to reading official reports in which some of the criticisms are couched in more guarded terms, but the ombudsman&#146;s conclusions could not be more explicit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000312">I had the opportunity, from the exact position in which I stand now, to debate the situation, as it then existed, in this Chamber in November 2008, and many of the hon. Members present today were also present at that debate. We were assured by the Government and later by the Prime Minister himself that the Government would respond to the ombudsman&#146;s report by the end of 2008. I think that the Prime Minister said that it would be by Christmas 2008, rather than by the end of the year, but we would have been willing to grant him the extra week. In fact, the Government did not respond to the report within the timetable that they had promised, and when they did respond, the response was, by common consent, wholly inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000313">Since the debate in this Chamber in November 2008, there have been further contributions on the matter. The Public Administration Committee undertook an inquiry into the ombudsman&#146;s findings. Its report, entitled &#147;Justice denied?

It is a constant theme that the Government appear to be playing for time and dragging their feet. We heard earlier that that has consequences for all our constituents who are affected by this matter, who are dying on a daily basis without having the financial remedy that they rightly feel that they are owed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000315">The ombudsman published a further report on 5 May 2009&#151;very recently&#151;entitled, &#147;Injustice unremedied: the Government&#146;s response on Equitable Life&#148;. We have already discussed that to some extent. It made a number of points, all of which were critical of the Government&#151;no, to be fair, many of them were critical of the Government. The overall tone was critical of the Government&#146;s approach. Even the Equitable Life chairman, Vanni Treves, asked in relation to the Government&#146;s response,</p>
<a name="90624h0008.htm_brev3"><a name="09062511000472"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;why haven&#146;t our policyholders been treated as well as Northern Rock and RBS depositors have? At any other time this would have been regarded as an absolute scandal.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000316">The Government have put in place yet another review. There is a lot of frustration on behalf of Equitable Life policyholders. To use the familiar phrase, the matter continues to be kicked into the long grass. We have yet another review and more institutional delay. The review is under the auspices of Sir John Chadwick. By common consent, that review is inadequate. There is no definite timeline, unless the Minister can offer us one this afternoon. Very few resources are available to Sir John Chadwick to carry out the review in a way that many, including possibly him, would regard as desirable. The reporting process itself has been called into question. Ann Abraham, the ombudsman, said:</p>
<a name="90624h0008.htm_brev4"><a name="09062511000473"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Whatever the outcome of the work that Sir John Chadwick will undertake, it is clear that the injustice I have found to have resulted from maladministration will not be remedied.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para22"><a name="09062511000317">We could not have a more unequivocal response from the ombudsman than that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para23"><a name="09062511000318">The question now is what can be done, given that track record of reports and the Government&#146;s lamentable record in responding to them. It is worth saying first that the Equitable Life fiasco was caused by systemic failures that go back a reasonable way. To pre-empt what the Exchequer Secretary might say, the seeds of the problem, according to both the Penrose report and the ombudsman&#146;s report, date back to a period before Labour was in government. I do not want the debate to be unduly party political; I want the Minister to respond on behalf of the Government of the day, rather than us having a debate along party lines. On that basis, let me concede that the Labour party could say with some justification that the problem did not start on 1 May 1997, when it came into government, although the problem has mainly been apparent and has grown since that date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para24"><a name="09062511000319">It is imperative that the Government undertake a period of negotiation with policyholders. Why? We have just heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith) that many people sought to behave responsibly and Equitable Life was seen as the gold-standard saving option. It was seen as beyond a normal commercial decision with the inherent risks that such investments inevitably involve. It was seen by our constituents as the cautious, safe, prudent way to save for retirement. The point was made earlier  <br>

that we must incentivise people, as the population grows older, to save for their retirement, and it is precisely the people who are heeding that call and seeking to behave responsibly whom we should be seeking to assist, rather than deter from saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000320">More than anything else, we need to act with speed. The greatest frustration for most of the policyholders is the Government&#146;s inability to come to a speedy resolution. The money given to policyholders ought not to be means-tested, because that is not the nature of the arrangement. I say as a concluding note and in a conciliatory spirit&#151;I hope that the Minister will engage on that basis&#151;that no one or very few people are saying that they expect the compensation to be 100 per cent. There is recognition that improper or ill-advised judgments were made by those directly responsible within Equitable Life. There is also&#151;this is a mature contribution to the debate&#151;recognition that we are, as a nation, borrowing &#163;480 million every single day and that that backdrop must be taken into account when considering whether the Government can be expected to commit to additional public spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="90624h0008.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000321">Nevertheless, even with those two important caveats, the Government have a responsibility, as the regulator, to compensate for regulatory failure. The Exchequer Secretary must bring this issue to a head now on behalf of the scores of constituents that I and all hon. Members have whose quality of life has been severely affected at the most vulnerable time of their life, because of the loss of savings due in large part to the regulatory failure over which the Government presided.</p>

 My right hon. Friend makes an interesting proposal. The Government are seeking to renew the House to make it the centre for decision making, and to increase interest in Parliament. Using a long-running issue such as Equitable Life would be the ideal way for the Government to demonstrate their commitment to democratic renewal. I hope that Labour Back Benchers would encourage the Prime Minister, the Chief Whip and the Leader of the House to have the debate in Government time, to make the point that they want to see Parliament making such decisions.</p>

 I am sure that the debate will provide the Government with an opportunity to respond not only to that question but to questions on what has led to the delay in compensation to Equitable Life&#146;s policyholders.

The matter has not been properly debated on the Floor of the House in Government time in a way that would allow us to address that inconsistency of approach. It is time for the Government voluntarily to make themselves accountable, rather than us having to raise the matter in Westminster Hall in order to maintain pressure on them.</p>

They are not alone; constituents have been writing to me since I was elected in 2001, setting out their problems in coping with the financial problems that have arisen as a consequence of what happened at Equitable Life. They want to see justice. Like the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner), they cited the Prime Minister&#146;s statement on Barlow Clowes. The Prime Minister was as tenacious then in fighting for justice as he is tenacious now in trying to avoid giving justice to Equitable Life&#146;s policyholders. That attitude needs to change.

Conservative Government. At each stage, whether the regulator was the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury or the Financial Services Authority, those policyholders were let down. The ombudsman seeks to address that in her report&#151;to recognise that there was maladministration, that the maladministration led to injustice, and that payment must be made to reflect that injustice. It undermines people&#146;s confidence in the entire regulatory system that, where there is evidence of maladministration and injustice, payments to policyholders do not seem to flow from that. It leads people to question whether their money is safe, and to ask whether those institutions are well regulated. That important point needs to be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000334">Mention has been made of Sir John Chadwick. I believe that Sir John has been dealt a difficult hand. He was given terms of reference with a narrow focus, which restricted his ability to consider various issues. The Government have clearly set out the findings. However, Sir John produced his first issues paper last week. He hopes to receive conclusions in mid-July and to produce a further report in August. My understanding of what Sir John said in his report is that there will be many stages to the process before policyholders receive the justice that they deserve.</p>

During our last debate, it was suggested that Sir John was in the process of recruiting an actuarial adviser. Has that been completed? Is an actuarial adviser in place? If so, who is it? In the statement made by the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury in January, she suggested that Sir John&#146;s work would go in tandem with work that the Treasury had undertaken. Will the Minister outline what the Treasury has been doing since January?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000336">At the time of the previous debate, Sir John had had one brief meeting with Equitable Life. Will the Minister tell us how many more meetings Sir John has had with Equitable Life since then? Based on the work done by Sir John and the Treasury to date, does the Minister have a better estimate of how long it will take before the first policyholder receives the first compensation cheque? It is nearly a year after the ombudsman published her report, and still there is no sense of who will receive compensation, how much they will receive and when they will receive it.</p>

 It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Caton. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton) on securing this debate.

Having looked through them, I think that it is fair to say that we are not covering much new ground today. Many of the arguments have been heard many times in this House. However, I thank all hon. Members, all of whom spoke eloquently on behalf of their constituents, for their contributions this afternoon. The Government always welcome healthy debate and continuing scrutiny, but I must be clear from the start: our position has not changed. We have made our response to the ombudsman&#146;s main report and we stand by it. We explained our reasons behind every rejection of her findings, and we believe that we had cogent reasons for doing so.</p>

It was not permissible for her to consider the actions of Equitable Life or any other party within the private sector. The substantial report published by the ombudsman in July last year was the culmination of her four-year investigation. The factual and technical complexity of the issues that she investigated, which themselves contributed to the length of her investigation, are the reasons it has been necessary for the Government to take time to consider the report. Indeed, the Government would have been rightly criticised had they not considered the report carefully before giving their response.</p>

The ombudsman welcomed the Government&#146;s acceptance of maladministration and of the fact that some policyholders will have been adversely affected by regulatory failures. We have apologised for that&#151;and I do so again today&#151;on behalf of the public bodies and successive Governments responsible for the regulation of Equitable Life between 1990 and 2001.</p>

the guarantor of the regulated and the taxpayer does not stand as the insurer of last resort. The responsibility to minimise risk and to prevent problems from occurring in a particular institution lies, first and foremost, with the people who own and run that institution, as was pointed out in Lord Penrose&#146;s report. Lord Penrose also found regulatory system failures&#151;I do not disagree with him&#151;but concluded that they were secondary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000345">The ombudsman recognised in her report that the Government have to consider first the public interest and secondly their responsibility to taxpayers generally to balance competing demands on the public purse.

 Categorically not. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis), who is no longer in his seat, made an intervention on this point. We are not delaying our response, and did not disagree with the findings, in order to save money.</p>

 I, and many other hon. Members, accept that the Government&#146;s intention is not to delay simply to reduce costs. That would be an abhorrent allegation.

Friend and others said that Sir John should be able to consider all cases raised by the ombudsman, and not just those that the Government agree with. We have cogent reasons for accepting only those cases of maladministration and injustice set out in our response. However, we had equally cogent reasons for departing from others, and it would be irrational to ask Sir John to consider those. It is important that we get this process under way as quickly as possible where we have accepted maladministration and injustices. For those cases, we want Sir John to get on with the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000352">We all agree that this is a complex matter.

He has issued his document setting out his proposed approach and the issues to be addressed. He has asked interested parties to comment on those proposals by 17 July. That is quite a tight time scale, but we are trying to get the scheme under way as quickly as possible. If any hon.

When she announced the Government&#146;s response in January, the then Chief Secretary explained that there is no easy solution to the problems at Equitable Life and the faults that were found. She also made it clear that the Government believe that their response to the ombudsman&#146;s report is the right one. I agree with that.</p>

<h3 align="center">School Governing Bodies (Appeals)</h3>
<a name="time_20"><a name="90624h0009.htm_time1"><a name="09062511000499"><h5 align="left">4 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_93"><a name="09062511000358"><a name="90624h0009.htm_spnew6"><a name="09062511000595"><b>Rosie Cooper (West Lancashire) (Lab):</b>
 I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate the issue of procedures for appeals against school governing body decisions. The need for the debate arose from the direct and personal experience of my constituents. One case with which I have been involved concerned a child with special educational needs. Those educational needs were not being met and, over a number of years, contributed to the child&#146;s exclusion from school. The family as a whole was outrageously failed because of the fundamental flaws within the governing body system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000359">The focus of this debate is to demonstrate how existing complaints procedures for schools cannot offer independence and objectivity, how the very nature of governing bodies makes them reliant on educational professionals, and how the systemic flaws mean that parents are unable to seek an alternative redress for their complaints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para27"><a name="09062511000360">In one particular case, the child had been diagnosed with Asperger&#146;s syndrome. In year one of primary school, it was noticed that the child was displaying symptoms of &#147;unusual behaviour&#148;. His teacher had highlighted that the child was struggling in school, and, many years later, that was confirmed by a psychologist. The initial failure of the school was not to request an assessment of the child by that educational psychologist. Teachers often expressed serious concerns about the child&#146;s behaviour in class. Over a three-year period, the school failed to take appropriate and reasonable steps to meet the special educational needs of the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para28"><a name="09062511000361">The situation came to a head when the head teacher allegedly behaved inappropriately, which provoked an outburst that resulted in the expulsion of the child from the school. It was at that point that the parents sought redress from the school&#146;s governing body through a formal complaint. It took more than nine months from the submission of the original complaint for the chair of governors to report that his investigation was concluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para29"><a name="09062511000362">The contents of that final report failed to address the questions that were asked in the original complaint. Moreover, there is the question of how a governing body can be allowed to take nine months to complete an investigation. How can a simple investigation take that long? The length of time was due in part to the actions of the local education authority, which at best could be viewed as incompetent and at worst wilful misconduct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="90624h0009.htm_para30"><a name="09062511000363">Five months after making the initial complaint, the local authority had not replied to the parents. The following month, the parents received a letter stating that the local authority had written to them three months earlier, and, in the absence of a response to its letter, which had never been received by the parents, the LEA indicated that it had assumed that the parents had ended their request for an investigation. When the parents were provided with a copy of the original letter&#151;it was sent electronically&#151;it was clear that it had been created at the same time as the letter telling the parents that it was assumed that they no longer wished to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para0"><a name="09062511000364">When the complaints appeals committee met on the matter, the parents argued that it had based its decision on misunderstandings and misrepresentations. Anecdotal  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Jun 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 293WH</b><br>
evidence indicates that from the outset, the governors were dismissive of the complaint. The complaints appeals committee upheld the original decision of the chair of governors and cited that the original investigation was satisfactorily conducted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000365">From the outset of this case, there were clear warning signs that serious issues were not being addressed and that the system was not affording protection to the family. The issues included the initial failure to assess the child&#146;s SEN requirements, the actions of the head teacher, the decisions based on misrepresentations, the governors&#146; attitude towards the complaint throughout the process, the length of time it took to attempt to address those complaints, and, in the end, the failure to address all aspects of the complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000366">The parents of the child were both involved in the education system, so they knew what to expect and the result fell far short of that. How an ordinary parent would have managed against the system I do not know. At that point, I intervened and called a meeting of the parents, senior directors and cabinet members from the local education authority. Only then did the parents begin to get answers to their specific questions, but by that time, the child had moved schools for the sake of his well-being and his education. That is a wholly unsatisfactory situation. With help, it could have been avoided. The matter could have been resolved with the child&#146;s interests being paramount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000367">This is one of a number of cases that I could talk about, and it provides an insight into the experiences of individual families. I hope that those experiences serve to demonstrate that there are fundamental problems in pursuing complaints through governing bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000368">Let me briefly turn my attention to the systemic failures. The weakness of the current governing body system is that, as lay people, governors do not always have the knowledge, background, or skills to interpret a complex complaint such as that I have outlined. Independent research by the highly respected Joseph Rowntree Foundation has concluded that many school governors lack the time and the expertise to fulfil their role. It says that they are often overwhelmed by the demands placed on them and that a major reform of the system is necessary. It goes on to say that in many instances, governors and teachers may not really understand what they are facing. That is true in the case that I mentioned of the child with special educational needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000369">Many people who have suffered in a similar way would agree with the report&#146;s findings. I understand that under section 29 of the Education Act 2002, all governing bodies are required to have in place a procedure to deal with complaints relating to all aspects of the school. However, beyond the governing body&#146;s complaints appeals committee, there does not seem to be a further right of appeal. A ministerial response to one of my parliamentary questions stated:</p>
<a name="90624h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09062511000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The extent to which the governing body has complied with this duty is part of the school&#146;s self evaluation process which underpins the current Ofsted inspection regime.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 June 2007; Vol. 461, c. 1357W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000370">Therefore, it is clear that the only safeguard to this in-house process is a visit once every three years by an Ofsted inspector who will seek to validate the school&#146;s evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000371">There appears to be no consideration given to the minimum standards or probity in conduct that parents can expect when they make a complaint about or to the school. Such weaknesses are compounded by there being no alternative process through which parents can make a complaint. If they are dissatisfied with the governing body&#146;s decision, which they believe might rely too much on educational professionals at the school and therefore not necessarily be independent, wherever they turn is a dead end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000372">Section 160 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 makes provision for Ofsted to investigate certain qualifying complaints from the parents of registered pupils at a school. Unfortunately, such complaints are restricted to those matters in which there is no alternative statutory route other than the schools complaints procedure. That offers no recourse in the case under discussion as complaints must relate to the whole school, and not to an individualised matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000373">The local government ombudsman can investigate school admissions and how a local authority has acted but it cannot investigate how a school governing body has acted during an investigation, how the investigation was carried out and whether the child&#146;s interests were paramount throughout. Under sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996, any person can complain to the Secretary of State if they believe that the governing body or local authority is acting unreasonably. Once again, the Secretary of State is able to intervene only in limited circumstances, which makes it difficult for parents to believe that their complaints and their child&#146;s interests are paramount.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000374">The combination of a weak governing body and no alternative route for complaint means that education professionals could have a significant influence on the process. I believe that that happened in the case I outlined. The governing body had a co-dependent rather than an independent relationship with the head teacher, to the extent that the governing body did not want to be seen to challenge publicly the authority of the head teacher. However, the head teacher was at the very heart of the complaint, following the failure of teachers to heed warnings over the child&#146;s behaviour and the refusal to bring in an educational psychologist. Ultimately, the head was accused of provoking the actions that resulted in a child&#146;s expulsion from school. Given that outline of the details, how can any parent who complains to a school&#146;s governing body feel reassured that an investigation will be conducted fairly, objectively and unprejudiced by any outside influencing factors?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000375">We need to ask serious questions not only of the governing body, but of the local education authority, which is charged with providing help and support to governors. I am truly encouraged by the provisions in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is currently before Parliament, for a new parental complaints service to be operated by the local commissioner, and for that to be introduced as a pilot. I very much welcome Ministers&#146; comments in Committee that statutory guidance on the new complaints system will make it clear that complainants must not suffer discrimination. In the light of this debate, I implore the Minister to consider my local education authority area for the pilot scheme. Whatever the outcome, there must surely be, in this day and age, an independent assessment of the complaint and how it is handled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para12"><a name="09062511000376">The issues that I have highlighted during the debate need serious consideration and action, to ensure that a school&#146;s governing body helps and supports families, and offers them a voice when they need it. I must put on record my absolute respect for the work of governors. They give of their time and have local interests at heart. I encourage them to continue their vital work in their worthwhile roles, but perhaps with a more questioning edge when there is a dispute. I want them to approach such matters with the child&#146;s interests at heart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000377">There needs to be a greater focus on ensuring that minimum standards are in place so that parents know what they can expect when they make a complaint to a governing body. For example, perhaps a simple place to start would be a clear timetable for the completion of an investigation. I want a system in which parents are assured that they will get a fair and unprejudiced hearing and one in which there is independent support for governing bodies, to ensure that they have the skills  and information to deal with complex cases, so as not  to disadvantage children. Perhaps they ought to be  able to call in experts outwith their local authority to help in such instances. Finally, when parents are  dissatisfied with the governing body, there needs to be an option for an external body to review the substance of the complaint.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000380">Governance, leadership and strong lines of accountability are essential to making our schools a success. Parents should be able to send their children to school confident that they will receive the highest possible standard of education; that their health, well-being and safety are being cared for; and that any problems are dealt with by professionals in an appropriate and timely manner. There must be mechanisms in place for parents to express their concerns, secure in the knowledge that they will be dealt with quickly, effectively and fairly by all involved&#151;the head teacher, the senior leadership team and the governing body.</p>

investigation by the head teacher or the chair of governors when appropriate; and, finally, if the complaint has still not been resolved, a meeting of a panel of governors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000383">Governing bodies must act for the interests of the children in their school, which should drive any decision that they take. They must also rigorously ensure that those who serve on complaints panels conduct a fair and unprejudiced investigation. Of course, parents should be kept informed of progress and any decisions taken by the panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000384">Beyond the local level, when a parent remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the complaints panel, some local authorities may offer an independent review of the complaint, although that is not a statutory requirement. All complainants, however, have the right to refer the matter to the Secretary of State if their complaint cannot be resolved at local level. Under sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996, the Secretary of State has the power to investigate a complaint and to issue a direction about a decision made by a governing body or a local authority, but he is able to do so only in very limited circumstances, namely when there has been a breach of a statutory duty or when the governing body has acted &#147;unreasonably&#148; with regard to the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty under the Education Acts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000385">The Secretary of State is not at liberty to substitute his judgment for that of a local education authority or a governing body just because he might have reached a different decision in the same circumstances. Rather, he must be satisfied that a decision is unreasonable in the sense that no reasonable authority or governing body acting with due regard to their statutory responsibilities would have reached such a decision. I should add that &#147;unreasonably&#148; in this context has been interpreted by the courts as meaning acting in a way in which no sensible local education authority or governing body, acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities, would have acted. That is a narrow and testing definition. For example, it does not allow the Secretary of State to substitute his own judgment for that of the governing body, or to issue a direction because he would have acted differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000386">The Secretary of State therefore does not have the power to re-investigate matters that are properly the responsibility of school governing bodies; he can only consider whether the school governing body acted reasonably and within the law in handling and addressing the complaint. Taking that into account, he needs to weigh all the matters and decide whether it is expedient to issue a decision and whether there is a practical step under his powers in education law that he can use to direct the governing body to take action.</p>

they want their child to attend, or to make representations for a placement in a non-maintained special school or independent school. Local authorities must comply with a parental request for a maintained school unless the school is unsuitable to the child&#146;s age, ability, aptitude or special educational needs, or the placement would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children with whom the child would be educated, or with the efficient use of resources. If parents disagree with the school named by a local authority in their child&#146;s statement, they have a right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal on special educational needs and disability</p>

If they remain dissatisfied, they should then discuss the matter with the local authority maintaining their child&#146;s statement. If they still feel that there has been no satisfactory resolution, they can make a complaint to the Secretary of State through the SEN operations team in my Department. They should set out their concerns in writing, explaining what provision specified in their child&#146;s statement the local authority is failing to provide and enclose a copy of their child&#146;s statement.</p>

Where necessary, the Secretary of State will not fail to exercise the powers available to him under the Education Act 1996. There are, however, limits to those powers, and any direction that he might make must be expedient and commensurate with the issue raised.</p>

Friend the Minister for Employment led a working group in his previous role as Minister of State for Schools and Learners to consider how governance will need to develop to meet the needs of 21st-century schools. One of the issues being considered by the working group is improving the skills and training of governors. We will be enhancing training for governors so that it focuses on holding school leadership to account by effective challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para28"><a name="09062511000393">Parent governors also have an important role to play. They can engage actively with the school community to communicate the governing body&#146;s decisions and give parents more knowledge of how the governing body works. We will press ahead with our work to ensure that all governing bodies have the vision, capacity and skills to provide the best service possible for the children and parents in their communities. The working group is still conducting the review and will report later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para29"><a name="09062511000394">Work is also under way to strengthen the complaints system for parents, following a commitment in the children&#146;s plan to consider how to improve the  current arrangements. My hon. Friend referred to the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is in the Lords. We are doing two things in the Bill: legislating to enable the local government ombudsman to investigate complaints about individual school issues, and producing both statutory and non-statutory guidance to clarify the processes at school level. She was concerned that matters should be dealt with in a timely way, and I hope that that will be dealt with in the guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para30"><a name="09062511000395">The LGO will investigate complaints where there is no alternative right of appeal and where the complaint relates directly to a school&#146;s duty. In other cases, parents will still be signposted to other routes. For instance, complaints about permanent exclusions will still be heard by independent appeal panels, complaints related to admissions will still go to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator, and the first-tier tribunal will continue to hear complaints related to local authorities&#146; special educational needs provision. If my hon. Friend wants to write to me formally to say that her local education authority is interested in being a pilot area for the initiative, I will be happy to discuss it further with her.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para31"><a name="09062511000396">Most schools handle complaints quickly and effectively, but where they do not, I know that they can cause frustration and upset to parents and pupils alike. That is why we are reviewing the current system and improving it to ensure that it is as robust as possible. That is also why it is important to have checks and balances right through the system, with a clear process so that parents can be heard in the first instance and escalate their complaint if they feel that those handling their case have not given them a satisfactory level of service. We are not asking schools to do something extra. This is about a basic level of service that parents should be able to expect from every school, not just an elite few. Through our reforms, we will ensure that every school is a good school, working hard at the heart of its community to serve local children and their families.</p>

 I am grateful to you, Mr. Caton, and to the previous Speaker for allocating me this debate. It is good that we will have an extra five minutes. I welcome the Minister to his seat. Like me, he will know that we are a nation of animal lovers, which is a good thing, so the issues that we are debating will be of great concern to many of our constituents throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para32"><a name="09062511000398">I must confess that I did not know a great deal about the pet passport scheme until one of my constituents came to me a couple of months ago with a rather awful story about what had happened to her and her pet. I will say at the outset that officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have tried to be as helpful as possible to my constituent. I am grateful to them for that, but I believe that their hands might have been tied to a certain extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para33"><a name="09062511000399">By the end of next month, my constituent will have been parted from her much-loved pet for a total of 13 months. The dog has been outside the UK for two six-month quarantine periods. The total cost to my constituent of keeping her dog outside the country now approaches &#163;8,000. Many pet owners would not be able to afford that, so when such things go wrong, sadly, it can effectively be the death sentence of the pets concerned. I accept that the case is an unusual one, but having listened to what my constituent told me and done some research, I have realised that numerous people fall foul of the rules of the pet passport scheme every year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para34"><a name="09062511000400">Before I describe in more detail what happened to my constituent, it might be helpful if I run through the four general policy areas that that sad saga has illuminated, and I would be grateful if the Minister commented on them. I spoke to his private office early this morning, to be as helpful as possible so that our debate could be constructive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para35"><a name="09062511000401">The first general question is how much discretion the Secretary of State has in such matters. In the case of my constituent, I think that the DEFRA officials generally recognised that the dog posed absolutely no risk whatever to the health of anyone&#151;human or animal&#151;in the United Kingdom. The dog had had four different blood tests under two different microchips. It was a British dog and had originated in the UK, which is of course rabies-free&#151;a significant point. I am aware that the Secretary of State has exercised his discretion on at least two occasions to allow the strict requirements of the pet travel scheme to be waived. They were two distressing cases in which it was right for the Secretary of State to act as he did.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90624h0010.htm_para36"><a name="09062511000402">My constituent was told by the Minister&#146;s officials that her last hope was for the Secretary of State to authorise a risk assessment in her case. I pressed the Secretary of State hard to do so, but the letter that I received said that it was not possible. My constituent and I are a little unclear about how much discretion the Secretary of State has. As I said, it was recognised that the dog in question did not pose any risk to public health in the United Kingdom. I would be grateful if the Minister elaborated on that slight uncertainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para0"><a name="09062511000403">The second general point that I want to put on the record and make pet owners aware of is that, in a minority of cases, people will not be able to bring their  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Jun 2009">

<notus-date day="24" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>24 Jun 2009 : Column 300WH</b><br>
much-loved animals back into the UK, which could cause extreme distress and upset. In the vast majority of cases, there are no problems. However, according to Department figures, in 2007, about 4,800 pets fell foul of the scheme and had various problems. There were some problems with microchips, as happened with my constituent. Another 1,300 cases were listed as &#147;any other reason&#148;. People should be aware that, in recent years, the number of people who are faced with such problems has risen to just below 5,000 a year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para1"><a name="09062511000404">It is significant that pet insurance now covers the cost of quarantine for pet owners who are forced to pay huge sums like the &#163;8,000 that my constituent faced. That should alert us to the issue. I am pleased to put this matter on the public record, so that people are aware of the risk. Although the risk is small, some people may not want to take it if their pets are so important that they could not bear to be parted from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para2"><a name="09062511000405">The third area of public policy that I want to probe the Minister on is the six-month quarantine that we insist on for animals coming into the country. The helpful briefing on this debate that I received from the British Veterinary Association said that Nigel Gibbens, the chief veterinary officer, Professor Phil Craig of the university of Salford and Dr. Dilys Morgan of the Health Protection Agency have stressed the need for the current UK requirements to continue. Those requirements are exercised under a derogation from the European Union scheme. However, those people who are much more qualified on such issues than I am support the requirements only because of the problem of tapeworms, specifically the E. multilocularis tapeworm. Is that tapeworm the reason why the UK has a six-month quarantine and is not part of the general European pet passport scheme? We stand with only Ireland, Malta, Sweden and Finland in having a derogation that allows us to have tougher enforcement provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para3"><a name="09062511000406">The fourth and final general area of policy that this debate can usefully highlight is about United Kingdom dogs. The UK is thankfully rabies-free, and we must take the proper measures to ensure that we stay rabies-free. Dogs that originate from the UK will have had all the correct vaccinations, blood tests and microchips. When British originated dogs return to the UK from abroad, is there not a case for treating them slightly differently from dogs from the rest of the EU, where rabies is still a problem? It is principally a problem in Romania and Latvia, and is thankfully much less of a problem in the rest of mainland Europe. I wonder whether discretion could be exercised in that area, perhaps in relation to my first point on the general discretion that the Secretary of State is allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para4"><a name="09062511000407">Those are the four issues that I want to raise. My constituent&#146;s case was tragic. There were two errors, neither of which were her fault. They were innocent errors; they were not made deliberately. The first error was made by a vet after the dog&#146;s original microchip came out. A blood test was done after a new microchip was inserted. I understand that a revaccination should have taken place at that point. The dog was then moved to America and had a subsequent blood test there at a local reputable laboratory. However, I understand that the legislation states that the Department accepts only one laboratory in the whole of the United States of America as being valid as far as re-entry into the United  <br>

Kingdom is concerned. That situation caused the second six-month sentence for the dog, which is currently in Sweden. It is quite a well travelled dog; it has been half way around the world. I am informed that, on 29 July, the dog will be warmly reunited with its owner who has been resigned to waiting for the past month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para5"><a name="09062511000408">In essence, that is what happened to my constituent. She has done a lot of research on this general area, and she has pointed me in the direction of a written answer from the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), who responded on 26 November 2008 to a parliamentary question from my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton). It is wonderful that our constituents have all this information available through the internet, because they can see exactly what we are up to&#151;the questions that we ask and the answers given by Departments. The Minister&#146;s predecessor said:</p>
<a name="90624h0011.htm_brev0"><a name="09062511000477"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our current controls may no longer be proportionate to the risk of rabies entering the UK.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26 November 2008; Vol. 483, c. 1621W.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para6"><a name="09062511000409">The excellent officials who are sitting behind the Minister obviously advised his predecessor on that. I would be interested to hear his comments on the matter. I do not want to push the Department to do one thing or another. I am not scientifically qualified and I am not a vet, but I am aware of the rabies risk in this country, and I am here in an interrogatory mode to try to get answers to some of those questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para7"><a name="09062511000410">A final related issue is, again, of great significance to disabled constituents, particularly those who have difficulty with their sight or require assistance. I briefed the Minister on that matter this morning. I should like to express my appreciation of the work of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which contacted me to let me know about the difficulties with certain airlines and airports in relation to allowing assistance dogs to travel with their owners who need assistance within the stipulation of the pet passport scheme. I am informed that that issue relates to the European regulation on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, which was introduced in July 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para8"><a name="09062511000411">The regulation requires European airlines to carry guide dogs and other assistance dogs in the cabin of the aircraft with their owner at no extra charge, subject to national rules, such as the UK pet travel scheme. That all sounds well and good. In the United Kingdom, Birmingham, Bristol, Luton, Stansted, Doncaster, Glasgow, London Gatwick, London Heathrow and Manchester airports are all approved. However, that is not quite as good as it sounds, because I further understand that although Luton, Stansted and Bristol airports are approved, none of the airlines that have sought approval for their routes fly into them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para9"><a name="09062511000412">We seem to be stuck in a bit of an impasse, because people who quite properly should be able to travel with their assistance dogs face a two-stage hurdle: they have to get clearance from the airport and the airline. Will the Minister say whether he is making the airports and airlines feel the heat a little on this issue? Are they delaying in some way? Luton airport, which is close to my constituency and serves a large number of my constituents, has done the right thing. What pressure is  <br>

the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Transport putting on those airlines that fly in and out of Luton to make sure that they do the right thing? Edinburgh jumps out as being an airport that is not on the list of nine approved airports. Perhaps the Minister can tell me what he is doing to make Edinburgh airport do what the other airports have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para10"><a name="09062511000413">I shall draw my remarks to a close. Again, I express my gratitude to you, Mr. Caton, and to the former Speaker for allowing me to raise these issues in this land of animal lovers, and I look forward to the Minister responding as helpfully as he can to the various points that I have made.</p>

 It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Caton. I congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) on securing the debate, which draws our attention to the important issue of how the UK protects itself against diseases carried by animals, and to the burden that responsible pet ownership can place on people who want to travel with their pets. We need to maintain our protection against rabies and other serious diseases while allowing people to move as freely as possible with their pets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para11"><a name="09062511000415">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving my office advance notice of specific issues that he would raise. I hope that I am able to respond to all of them in the course of my remarks. Clearly, if I do not or am not able to, I would be happy to write to him in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para12"><a name="09062511000416">Rabies is a truly devastating disease and is almost invariably fatal once a patient exhibits symptoms. Across the world, it kills some 55,000 people a year, largely in India, south-east Asia and Africa. Apart from infrequent cases in quarantine, the UK has been fortunate to be free from rabies for many decades, and the situation in continental Europe has greatly improved in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para13"><a name="09062511000417">The risk of rabies, as well as the possibility of picking up other diseases, means that no owner should take the responsibility of travelling with their pet lightly. It is a serious business, as the hon. Gentleman said, and, although we have serious controls in place to mitigate the risk, a strong burden of responsibility falls on pet owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para14"><a name="09062511000418">For many years, quarantine was this country&#146;s main defence against rabies. All animals entering the UK had to be isolated for six months in approved quarantine facilities. That ended when we introduced the pet travel scheme in 2000. It was designed to offer protection against disease risks to animals and the public while allowing people flexibility to travel with their pets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para15"><a name="09062511000419">The pet travel scheme introduced a dual system: pets from high-risk countries still spend six months in quarantine, but pets entering from some lower-risk countries including European Union members and the United States, are, in effect, allowed to serve their quarantine period in the country of origin. Such animals now enter with a passport that proves that they have been microchipped and vaccinated, that their blood has been tested to check that the vaccine has taken effect, and that they have waited for six months. The six-month wait is to ensure that the animal had not already been infected with rabies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para16"><a name="09062511000420">There is a further requirement for owners to treat their pets against ticks and tapeworm. The treatment must be applied between 24 and 48 hours before travelling. The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about tapeworm. UK tick and tapeworm controls are in place to minimise the risk of certain diseases entering the UK as animals move under the pet travel scheme without spending time in quarantine. Tapeworm controls deal with Echinococcus multilocularis, which causes an extremely unpleasant liver disease in humans. It usually proves fatal if not treated, and even with treatment leads to dangerous chronic illness. Tick treatments aim to deal with a variety of ticks that have the potential to become established in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para17"><a name="09062511000421">The hon. Gentleman realises the significance of tapeworms. He asked about timing of the treatment. It must be given 24 to 48 hours before travelling, not six months. The 24 to 48-hour window ensures that animals excrete any tapeworm eggs before travelling to the UK, and that they have not had a chance to be re-infected in the country of origin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para18"><a name="09062511000422">The hon. Gentleman asked about discretion in the rules. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has no power to authorise exemptions from the requirements of the pet travel scheme. The rules are clearly set out in legislation, and, given what I said about the seriousness of rabies, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members would want the Government to maintain a robust approach to the controls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para19"><a name="09062511000423">As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, out of more than 500,000 pet journeys, there have been an extremely small number of cases in which, outside the pet travel scheme, Ministers have decided to exempt animals from the standard quarantine requirements. That has only happened when the owner was able to demonstrate the most extreme personal circumstances and needed to be reunited with their animal. Even in those cases, certain restrictions on the handling and movement of the animal were rigorously enforced. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not give specific details of those cases, but I can assure him and others that Ministers give all such matters the most serious consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para20"><a name="09062511000424">The hon. Gentleman also raised the problem of illegal imports. No system is perfect, and there will always be people who try to break the law. The nature of that activity means that it is difficult to specify the number of animals illegally imported. However, we enforce the law, and I can inform him that we detected 196 illegal landings in 2008. We factor illegal activity into our risk assessments. We consider the implications for enforcement of the scheme, and we have strong penalties in place for offenders. The existence of the pet travel scheme itself is an important incentive to comply; previously, all animals had to serve six months in quarantine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para21"><a name="09062511000425">The hon. Gentleman asked whether there should be different rules for British animals. The rules of the pet travel scheme are designed to protect human health, native pets, and animals that travel with their owners. Animals that comply and can demonstrate that they have been effectively vaccinated, whether they are from the UK or not, can travel freely between European member states and listed third countries, such as the United States, Canada and Australia. Only those that cannot fully demonstrate that they meet the rules are required to re-prepare for entry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para22"><a name="09062511000426">On the rights of disabled people, the hon. Gentleman raised a point about individuals taking dogs on to aircraft. I was previously aviation Minister, but no longer. On behalf of the Department for Transport, I signed the protocol to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which is relatively new and still working its way through. I am sure that is one of the reasons why there is no comprehensive endorsement from airlines or airports&#151;it is still being developed, and some are still trying to comply. There is a European regulation that sets out people&#146;s rights in that respect. It requires European airlines to carry assistance dogs&#151;including guide dogs&#151;in the passenger cabin of the aircraft with their owner at no extra charge. That is subject to any national rules that may apply, such as the pet travel scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para23"><a name="09062511000427">Under the approval scheme for carrying pets&#151;including assistance dogs&#151;into the UK, airlines will enter into a contract with our animal health agency to demonstrate that they have the means and facilities to check those animals on arrival. DEFRA, the animal health agency and the Department for Transport continue to work closely and meet with airlines, including no-frills operators, to advise on that process. Ultimately, however, it is up to the airlines to seek approval.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para24"><a name="09062511000428">As things stand, the derogation that enables the United Kingdom to retain our current pet movement controls comes to an end in June next year&#151;although the European Commission last week promised that the derogation could be extended until the end of 2011. As we consider future controls, we are in close discussion with the Commission and other member states about what a European system should be. We have to balance the evidence of risk from rabies, tapeworm and tick-borne diseases, which affect everyone, against the burden on pet owners who wish to travel with their pets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para25"><a name="09062511000429">I accept that it is particularly difficult when the law, which has safeguards written in for sound reasons, throws up unusual and distressing cases. The Government must continue to comply with European and national law as they stand, but as we consider the future of our pet controls, we have an opportunity to think about where more flexibility is possible. I will therefore carefully consider the issue of flexibility in our discussions with the European Commission and other member states on future pet movements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para26"><a name="09062511000430">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of his constituent, and has described how our controls may impose a burden on individuals in the name of protecting animals and the wider public. I sympathise and understand how frustrating the situation must be. It is unfortunate that it seems that mistakes, as he has outlined, by private veterinary surgeons meant that on two separate occasions the animal did not comply with the requirements of the UK pet travel scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para27"><a name="09062511000431">Let me explain why the pet was refused entry into the UK. The first time, as I understand it, the animal&#146;s microchip failed. If we cannot identify a dog at the border, we cannot be sure that it has been vaccinated against rabies, blood-tested and treated for tick-borne diseases and tapeworm, as I have described. The microchip is the key to the pet travel scheme and it is the most cost-effective and reliable means of identification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para28"><a name="09062511000432">On the second occasion, the blood sample that tested whether the dog&#146;s rabies vaccination had been effective was sent to the wrong laboratory in the United States. Between 2 and 5 per cent. of rabies vaccinations do not  <br>

work and a test is required to ensure that the vaccine has taken effect. The law states that the test must be:</p>
<a name="90624h0011.htm_brev1"><a name="09062511000478"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;carried out in an approved laboratory&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para29"><a name="09062511000433">That means a laboratory that has been accredited by the European Union. That gives us the assurance that we can trust the work that is done at laboratories and the assurance that that work follows a standardised process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para30"><a name="09062511000434">The hon. Gentleman said that there were 4,800 problems with animals in the last year for which we have figures. That is true, but that is out of 115,000 animals, and the problems mostly arose because of expired vaccinations. So we are talking about less than 5 per cent. of cases. Some might be small matters that do not require a great deal of activity and can be dealt with quite quickly. In the vast majority of cases, the scheme is clearly working very effectively.</p>

 I am most grateful to the Minister, not least for the spirit in which he is replying to the debate; what he has said has been genuinely helpful. There is just one area that I want to press him on. I want to take him back to the issue of assistance dogs. He said that it was up to the airlines to decide whether to take them. He and I both know that some of the airlines perhaps require some assistance themselves, shall we say, to move along a little faster. Given that he is a past aviation Minister, may I urge him to have a word with some of his former colleagues in the Department for Transport, so that they can have a friendly word in the ear of some of the airlines about the issue? Let me take the example of Luton airport again. The airport is ready, but none of the airlines there are ready. That does not strike me as being quite good enough.</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s frustration and I am sympathetic to the point that he makes. Clearly, the challenge is having to regulate to force people to do things. I know that the Conservatives, like the Government, want to have the lightest-touch  <br>

regulation for business, to try to encourage best practice. That approach is always more successful than forcing people to do something. I know that officials in my Department are meeting two of the low-cost airlines fairly soon and I am sure that they will raise the point that he has asked us to raise with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para31"><a name="09062511000437">It is certainly in the interests of airlines to be able to offer products that attract the majority of people to buy them. If one airline is offering a facility that other airlines are not, it gives them a competitive edge. The protocol that was signed within Europe for assisted transport was to encourage best practice and standards that everybody would aspire to. As the hon. Gentleman has described, and as I mentioned, we have clearly made a lot of progress in a relatively short period of time, but we obviously want to ensure that the coverage is as comprehensive as possible. I hear what the hon. Gentleman has said and I am sure that officials from my Department will be able to raise the issue with the airlines. If there is any information that comes from their meeting with the airlines, I will be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman to bring him up to speed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="90624h0011.htm_para32"><a name="09062511000438">To conclude, I again congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire on securing this interesting and timely debate. I also assure him that, although the Government&#146;s priority will remain the protection of human and animal health, we will continue to implement proportionate movement restrictions in compliance with European Union law. The pet travel scheme is something that we are very proud of. The numbers of people using the scheme demonstrate that it is very popular. More than 500,000 people in total have now used it. As I have said already, in the last year for which we have figures 115,000 people used the scheme. It is growing all the time. We need to be vigilant, we need to ensure that pet owners are looked after, and we need to be as sympathetic and compassionate in this area as possible.</p>
