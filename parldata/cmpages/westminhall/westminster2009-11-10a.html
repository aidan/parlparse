 It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Olner. The financial services sector, which is the subject of my debate, is extremely important to the British economy and is about to experience big regulatory changes that have not been adequately debated so far. We can all agree, I think, that the recent history of financial services regulation is not a happy one. When the Government took office in 1997, they gave interest rate decisions to the Bank of England but removed from it banking supervision, which then fell into a black hole between the Bank, the Treasury and what became the Financial Services Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para1"><a name="09111057000007">When some of us raised the problem during the passage of the Bank of England Act 1998, we were told not to worry because there was a memorandum of understanding between the authorities. That was fine when everything was going well, but the test of a system is in a crisis, and when the credit crunch hit, there was a great deal of confusion about exactly who was responsible, where accountability lay, who made the decisions and who enforced them. We will make the same mistake again if we sign up uncritically to a system of European financial supervision with exactly the same ambiguities about accountability and control. The Government do not like the impending European system of supervision, but they seem unable to block it and have been retreating from a number of earlier positions on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para2"><a name="09111057000008">I want to make it clear that I am not defending the status quo as regards regulation. The background is of much-needed regulatory change. I have no sympathy with the big banks that failed during the credit crunch. Many of them behaved like bandits, and some are still behaving badly, lending at extortionate rates to small businesses and others to pay for their casino-lending practices of the past, all of which are underwritten by the taxpayer. Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, is absolutely right to raise the question of moral hazard whereby if banks and others take risks and are justified, they receive riches and honours, but if the risks go against them they are left with the taxpayer. We must tackle that. Again, the Governor is right to advocate breaking up big institutions to generate real competition and to sort out those that are too big to fail&#151;they will be supported by the taxpayer in extremis&#151;from those that can be regulated in a different way. If institutions are too big to fail, they must be tightly regulated, but a different regime is appropriate for others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para3"><a name="09111057000009">I must declare an interest. I am a director of a not-for-profit health insurer in the south-west, which is extremely prudently run. If it failed, which is incredibly unlikely, it would of course be a disaster for the staff  <br>

and the policyholders, and the directors would have to resign, but it would pose no threat to the wider economy; there is no systemic risk. That firm and many others like it are nevertheless on the receiving end of a huge and growing volume of regulatory requirements from the FSA. The cost is enormous, and all of it must ultimately be borne by, in our case, policyholders, but in other sectors by borrowers or customers&#151;in other words, the public. So, we are building up an enormous national overhead here in a competitive global market. We must earn our way out of this recession; we cannot spend our way out. The question of international competitiveness is very important. If we turn the country into a nation of regulators, we will remain a low-growth, high-unemployment part of the world economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para4"><a name="09111057000010">Let me ask the Minister about the alternative investment fund managers&#146; directive&#151;another catchy title. The directive is aimed at the hedge fund and private equity market, which is not responsible for the credit crunch. The EU directive is only in draft, but we know from the present text that its terms are onerous, broad-brush and do not take account of the variety and diversity in the sector. It threatens to be disproportionate to the actual risk because, again, this sector does not pose a systemic risk to the British economy. It is also protectionist because in effect, it will keep out non-EU financial agents, which will raise costs and reduce competition.</p>

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="09111057000011"><a name="91110h0001.htm_spnew1"><a name="09111057000147"><b>Mr. Mark Field (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b>
 I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend&#146;s comments on the directive. Will he confirm in front of the Minister that the financial crisis of the last two years has never been a crisis of asset management, which is what is being proposed here? Furthermore, on international competition and protectionism, the biggest worry is that some of the brightest and best in Europe will go elsewhere, rather than staying, thus allowing Europe to take a larger slice of this increasingly fluid global market.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="09111057000012"><a name="91110h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="09111057000148"><b>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend. The EU has a habit of being obsessed with internal harmonisation. The real question, however, is whether Europe is competitive in the wider world. If such a directive has the effect of driving assets and firms overseas to non-EU jurisdictions, it will be very damaging. That is a particular concern to Europe. I am informed that about 80 per cent. of hedge funds are based in London, and 60 per cent. of European venture capital and private equity managers are based in the United Kingdom. So, the directive is aimed at this country. Will the Minister comment on that and tell us what she is doing to protect our interests? I have given her office the general lines of my debate so that she can prepare some answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para5"><a name="09111057000013">I am not calling for isolation here. We cannot regulate simply on a national basis. We are global and must, of course, talk to regulators in the United States, Europe, and the far east to try to align the rules, but supervision must remain national. Supervision is the application and enforcement of the rules, and that cannot be given to an international jurisdiction. I understand that that is the Government&#146;s position, but it seems to be under attack. Into this debate about how we improve our regulation and stop regulatory failures, there now intrudes the EU&#146;s ambition not only to regulate&#151;to make the rules&#151;but to supervise and enforce the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para6"><a name="09111057000014">There is a proposal for three new European supervisory authorities, or ESAs: one for banking, one for insurance and pensions, and one for securities. They would go very much further than the existing regulatory committees that have been meeting in the EU for some years. They would have wholly new powers and authority. They would be rule-making, they would have enforcement powers, they would have emergency powers over firms and national supervisors, and they would have the power to mediate and to impose solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para7"><a name="09111057000015">Unless the ESAs are stopped, they will go way beyond what the Government have said is acceptable. Lord Myners, the Treasury Minister responsible for this sector, gave evidence to the European Union Committee of the House of Lords, in which he could not have been clearer. He said:</p>
<a name="91110h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09111057000130"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government support regulatory and not supervisory powers at EU level.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para8"><a name="09111057000016">He also said:</p>
<a name="91110h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09111057000131"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government do not see how we could have EU bodies overruling national authorities where national taxpayers can be asked to fund firms that have failed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para9"><a name="09111057000017">He was also sceptical about what he called</p>
<a name="91110h0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09111057000132"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;binding mediation given the importance of aligning supervision and crisis management&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para10"><a name="09111057000018">He said very much the same thing to me and others when he gave evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para11"><a name="09111057000019">So that is the Government&#146;s position, and I hope the Minister can confirm that it remains an unaltered requirement of theirs, because the very name given to these authorities indicates the opposite. They are to be &#147;supervisory&#148; authorities and if they are called that they will probably do that, which contradicts the assurances that Ministers have given to both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para12"><a name="09111057000020">There are other questions to be asked about ESAs. How will decisions be made in these new authorities? The answer is, by majority voting. However, as we have already heard, the United Kingdom is by far the largest EU financial market. By some reckoning, including the Mayor of London&#146;s, the UK is now the biggest financial market in the world, so we must protect this market from unnecessary and burdensome regulation. The EU has a regulatory itch; it lives by expanding its jurisdiction, legal authority and regulations.</p>

 A week ago, in Treasury questions, I raised with the Minister&#146;s colleague, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms), the fact that the Tax Justice Network had created a financial secrecy index, which found that the City of London was one of the most secretive, opaque and impenetrable financial regimes in the world. Although it is important that we do not have burdensome and unnecessary regulation, surely there is still more to be done to provide the clarity, transparency and openness that markets often say they have but manifestly fail to deliver.</p>

information does not fall into the wrong hands, and there is a question mark about what will happen to the information that is given to these new European regulatory authorities. We need certain assurances about that, but I agree with the general thrust of his question. Nevertheless, my point is that, because of majority voting, we do not want other countries&#146; policy preferences imposed on what is by far the largest financial market in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para13"><a name="09111057000023">There is a rather doleful precedent in the artists&#146; resale right directive, which the Government fought against and voted against. It imposed a levy on the resale of art, supposedly for the benefit of artists and their descendents. However, because it does not apply in the rest of the world, it is having the unfortunate effect of undermining the attractiveness of London, which is the biggest art market, compared with New York, Zurich and other non-EU art centres. It was eventually imposed on us because of majority voting and the European Commission&#146;s determination to harmonise within Europe and to pay much less attention to Europe&#146;s competitiveness in the wider world&#151;a point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para14"><a name="09111057000024">We also need to know who will sit on these ESAs and who will appoint them. Lord Myners was asked when giving evidence about the question of appointment, and he said:</p>
<a name="91110h0001.htm_brev4"><a name="09111057000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I think that that is still open for debate and discussion.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para15"><a name="09111057000025">We now need to know who will appoint the members of the ESAs. Also, who will the ESAs report to? Who are they accountable to? Are they accountable to EU Ministers, the European Commission, the European Parliament, or all three? There is the danger of creating exactly the same confusion I referred to earlier, whereby regulation fell between the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA&#151;except that the same confusion would now occur at a higher level in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para16"><a name="09111057000026">Furthermore, there are doubts about whether the entire package of proposals is legal and whether the EU can establish these freestanding authorities. The European Commission is using articles under single market powers to establish the ESAs, but these authorities&#146; primary purpose is not to create a single market; surely, it is to stabilise and protect the financial system. Therefore, the Commission should not be using single market articles to establish the ESAs, but it is doing so because that brings in majority voting. Again, I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s commenting on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para17"><a name="09111057000027">There is perhaps an even more important problem, which is that it is an established principle that the EU cannot delegate or confer powers that it does not itself possess. In this instance, however, the EU is conferring powers on three supervisory authorities and giving them broad discretionary powers without clear or defined limits. That is an apparent abuse by the EU and it should be challenged legally. Again, I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s view on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para18"><a name="09111057000028">This matter is urgent because there is now a headlong rush to establish these ESAs. The European Council, which met very recently, has urged the Council of Ministers</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para19"><a name="09111057000029">These conclusions were agreed by unanimity, so the Prime Minister believes that, within a month, all this structure can be agreed.</p>

The Government&#146;s own guidelines on better regulation say that it is much better to carry out regulation properly than to carry it out quickly. Also, regulation must respect subsidiarity and proportionality, and there must be a careful assessment of the costs involved. Where is that cost assessment in this case? Where is the impact assessment for the ESA proposals?</p>

 Thank you, Mr. Olner. I am always aware that I am barely a householder in my own home, let alone anywhere else. It is a great pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who made a sensible contribution to the debate. As he rightly said, the issue of financial services regulation is of great importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para25"><a name="09111057000037">One concern in the midst of many people&#146;s continued lack of trust and confidence in our financial services world&#151;a situation that I fear will continue for some years to come&#151;is that we look on regulation as we do some sort of religion that holds sway, without thinking through all its implications. To be fair, that applies not only to the world of financial services but to much of the public sector. That is not to say that there is no place for regulation. Regulation is necessary, particularly in respect of financial products, in order to maintain confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para26"><a name="09111057000038">To go back two decades and more, I think we are all concerned that respect for the pensions industry and other categories of financial services products is so low in the public at large that all too often people do not save for their long-term future. People of my generation, in their 40s, have tended to put too much money into immediately stoking up the housing market, which obviously has negative effects. It is not just that the market might not be sustainable; we need to try to inculcate into the public mind the idea that people, for their own good, should invest for the longer term in a range of savings products, as well as the confidence that they can save in equities and other savings products. It is not an option, therefore, to suggest that there should be no regulation. Many of us have always promoted the idea of light-touch regulation, but I do not think the zeitgeist will favour that in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para27"><a name="09111057000039">As my right hon. Friend said, these are troubling times for the City of London and our hitherto booming financial services sector. The second enormous cash injection into the Royal Bank of Scotland last week, along with incendiary tales of the return of big banking bonuses, is making the general public question whether anything has changed apart from the size of the ballooning public deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para28"><a name="09111057000040">Whether we like it or not, bank lending is unlikely to return to anything approximating normality until probably the second half of 2011. A huge number of toxic assets remain on all banks&#146; balance sheets and have yet to be identified, and they will need to be removed. The times will be troubled, and I think there will be a lot of concern for a considerable time to come among the public as well as in this place about the state of our banking industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para29"><a name="09111057000041">My constituency houses the City of London and has hedge funds and alternative assets in Mayfair and St. James&#146;s. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the crisis has focused largely on the big banks, but it should not be forgotten that other elements of financial services and their products have remained relatively unscathed. Asset management&#151;hedge funds and private equity&#151;is one such industry, so it is perverse, to put it mildly, that we are going headlong towards signing up to the directive through the European Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para30"><a name="09111057000042">I praise the relevant Minister, Lord Myners, who has put in a sterling effort in recent months, along with Conservative MEPs, to make the case for ensuring that the damaging aspects of such directives are kept to a minimum. It is clear that there are two distinct schools of thought on the matter, even within the European Council. However, it is very much a work in progress. My constituency also contains a residential population of fairly wealthy global business folk and a service and entertainment sector in the west end that has blossomed from the disposable incomes of a busy London work force that has, to a large extent, received the benefits of the financial services boom, as has been particularly evident in the past two decades.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para31"><a name="09111057000043">The financial services industry also helps sustain a huge range of support industries, such as law, accountancy and consulting. It should also be said that the great global success of the City of London includes elements such as the insurance industry, many of whose difficulties arose through the near-collapse of Lloyd&#146;s two decades ago. There are some important templates in that for learning how a service industry that looks as though it is on its knees can recover its global pre-eminence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="91110h0001.htm_para32"><a name="09111057000044">As London is the engine of the national economy, getting financial services regulation right is vital not just for my constituents but for the nation as a whole. We must accept that a crucial ingredient in regulation of the industry is a public perception of fairness, as my right hon. Friend made clear in his comments. Without that sense of fairness, there is little doubt that we risk allowing the current crisis to discredit capitalism and herald a new era of corporatism and ever more restrictive regulation in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para1"><a name="09111057000046">Having learned from that, we must give the public greater credit and take them with us by explaining clearly how the taxpayer stands to gain or suffer from the regulatory choices that we make. One such way is to defend the UK&#146;s position as a global leader robustly against EU attempts to curb the hedge fund industry via the draft alternative investment fund managers directive. I spoke about that problem in this Chamber recently, and the Minister was also there, so I shall not go over the ground again other than to summarise the issue briefly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para2"><a name="09111057000047">Most hedge funds are exempt from much of the regulation applying to investment banks and mutual funds. As pools of highly mobile capital, they have fast developed the reputation of being able to move mountains in the financial market by anticipating future expectations. Hedge funds, which are largely limited liability companies, thrive on volatility, so the crux of the controversy surrounding them is the degree to which they either cause or affect fundamental shifts in financial markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para3"><a name="09111057000048">Alternative investment funds have accepted that in the new regulatory climate, they will be required to boost transparency and accept new curbs on disclosure and, most likely, on clearing, settlement and custody as well. The draft directive, however, goes a long way beyond that and may make it absolutely impracticable for funds owned by non-EU entities, which comprise a significant proportion of those operating in London, to distribute their products within the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para4"><a name="09111057000049">That, combined with other regulatory and fiscal burdens here, may persuade hedge funds to relocate to other financial centres such as Switzerland, or indeed to return to the United States or emerging centres in the Gulf or the far east. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, such an outcome would be in the interests neither of the UK economy, which fundamentally concerns us, nor of the EU. Such protectionism in a global market would be fatal. At a supranational level, it would diminish competition, restrict flows of liquidity into the single market and be seen as protectionist at a time when barriers need to be brought down rather than erected. At a domestic level, it would also significantly diminish London&#146;s critical mass as a financial centre and reduce individual and corporate tax revenue. At its most detrimental, it risks undermining London&#146;s competitive advantage in the market for the professional services to which I referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para5"><a name="09111057000050">The impetus for a European directive derives from panic in response to the economic crisis alongside a somewhat partisan vision of hedge funds and private equity as a wild west show of amoral speculators and asset strippers. However, I reiterate that there has been no crisis of asset management. Unlike the big banks that have been so troubled over the past two years, hedge funds did not leverage themselves to the hilt, having lacked the balance-sheet clout to do so even if they had wanted to. Whatever regulation exists should focus on the issue of leverage. Only in so far as it does so can it be justified.</p>
<a name="09111057000129">
<p>Nor did hedge funds run down adequate levels of liquidity. Indeed, those that have failed&#151;as of course some have done in the past two years&#151;have not threatened  <br>

the entire financial system in their failure. The public must be made aware of that or it will be harder to resist what may seem superficially to be reasonable attempts by the EU to curb reckless risk-taking, but are in reality dangerous moves that will undermine London&#146;s competitiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para6"><a name="09111057000051">Thankfully, since I last spoke on this issue in Parliament the Swedish presidency has drafted a compromise text on some elements of the draft directive to reconcile British concerns. The important issues are scope, delegation, valuation, leverage, capital requirements and transparency. The compromise proposal is an encouraging step forward. I give credit to some Conservative voices in the European Parliament for that, as well as to the Government, who are belatedly making progress. I hope that we will make significant progress in the coming months. The directive might be revised further because several member states, notably France, are said to be unhappy with the compromise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para7"><a name="09111057000052">I support the broad objectives set out by the European Commission in other regulatory areas, such as a more efficient framework for financial supervision, enhanced financial stability and greater safeguards of the interests of consumers and investors. As my right hon. Friend said, the crux of the matter is an increased competitiveness of EU financial markets and more integration within those markets. We must make it clear to the public and the EU that British policy makers and financial experts are not against efforts to regulate, but equally will not give all regulation the green light simply because public sentiment dictates it. In creating new regulatory structures, it is essential that policy makers across Europe remain focused on the outcomes and keep on track with the key objectives of open markets, increased competition and consistent arrangements globally, regionally and locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para8"><a name="09111057000053">The City of London believes that there is a clear and compelling case for the creation of a European systemic risk board to ensure that dangers to the stability of the financial system are caught early. The present crisis has demonstrated that monitoring risks at EU level is not enough. That should not deter us from closer co-operation and interaction with global organisations, such as the new systemic risk body in the United States. To have any credibility, such a risk board&#146;s membership and voting structures should reflect the financial industry. There is concern that the banking sector will be over-represented on the board and other sectors under-represented. Given that the current crisis originated in the banking sector, the next is likely to start elsewhere. It is therefore imperative that national supervisors from all financial sectors, from securities to insurance, participate in the meetings and in setting up the framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para9"><a name="09111057000054">On the chairmanship of the board, I support the European Council conclusions that require the post to be elected by the general council of the European Central Bank to ensure that it is viewed, and acts, as an independent body. Furthermore, the board should be able to raise concerns about financial stability stemming from across the EU financial system, including monetary policy, while respecting the independence of the central banks and the supervisors involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para10"><a name="09111057000055">I support the principle of promoting convergence to ensure a consistency of rules. However, the European system of financial supervisors should not overrule supervisory decisions made by national regulators. The demarcation of powers between national and EU  <br>

authorities must be clearly defined and any binding powers should be exercised only as a last resort. There is concern over the timetable envisaged for the development of all of the proposals, but the City recognises the pressure to deliver a workable solution for the future of the EU financial markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para11"><a name="09111057000056">To return to British shores, in the aftermath of the banking bail-out I was deeply disturbed by the creation of financial institutions that became too big to fail. That relates to the issue of moral hazard that my right hon. Friend raised. In forming such institutions, we recognised implicitly&#151;and explicitly in various Government statements of autumn 2008&#151;that they were too big to regulate and beyond the scope of prudential sanction. That in-built lack of competition will continue to result in a remuneration regime that means high rewards for investment banking employees. Nobody objects to people earning a lot of money when there is genuine flair and innovation, but it cannot be right to reward quasi-monopolistic practices brought about by Government policy and organisations working in cahoots with one another or as a cartel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para12"><a name="09111057000057">I am not naive about these issues. Unravelling the recapitalisation arrangements of the past year will not be a short-term affair. We should not rush to a solution because we should strive to gain the maximum value from what is put in place. I am concerned about the idea of stakes being sold off. That might be politically expedient in the run-up to a general election and would bring funds into the Exchequer, but we must ensure that assets on the Government balance sheet are sold at a time that maximises their value for the taxpayer. I suspect that it will take many years&#151;possibly as long as a decade&#151;to unravel the recapitalisation arrangements. The deal was done without full political scrutiny and perhaps elements of it had to be done in that way. However, it is dawning on the public that there has been, and continues to be, a more extensive nationalisation of banking assets than was envisaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para13"><a name="09111057000058">With the UK taxpayer propping up banks that are politically too big to fail and providing cover for many commercial enterprises that are part-owned by part-nationalised banks, our economy has a worrying dearth of competition. Given that the Serious Fraud Office has neither commercial nor industry respect, we lack a serious, tough and effective body to deter companies from engaging in fraudulent or market-distorting activity. It is critical that we put the restoration and promotion of competition and market fairness at the heart of future economic policy. Under any plan for sound banking, the SFO requires teeth alongside an all-powerful Bank of England, merged with the FSA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para14"><a name="09111057000059">The public will loudly demand more rigorous enforcement of regulation across business, particularly in financial services. Politicians need to demonstrate  a seriousness of intent by outlining robust plans for a tough, not-to-be-messed-with agency that values strong competition and clean business dealings as essential parts of an effective financial system. Such an agency should be linked to or merged with the Office of Fair Trading. Its work should be a top priority for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, rather than a minor one in a Treasury that has its hands and its ministerial inboxes full. The United States provides a blueprint for the new SFO regime with its whistleblowing culture, the ability for deals to be cut if businesses show  <br>

the willingness to change and a tough prosecutorial threat. The deterrents provided by healthy competition and stiff punishment must form the backbone of the brave new world of banking and business that lies ahead. Nothing less will restore the confidence of market professionals and the trust of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para15"><a name="09111057000060">We must accept that the spirit of the age favours greater, more stifling regulations. Unless those come about on a global basis, London and Europe risk being the losers. The public and political instinct today&#151;and for some years to come&#151;is to punish the banks. Everybody in the financial services industry risks being caught in the crossfire. Fund managers, insurers and other advisers risk losing out as Governments exert new control over the sector. It falls to those of us who recall London&#146;s historical role as a global trading city, including my right hon. Friend who was a distinguished Minister in the last Conservative Administration, to make the case for extending the reach and influence of measures in this sector to markets beyond Europe&#146;s shores.</p>

 I congratulate the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) on securing this important and timely debate. It is rather disappointing that so few hon. Members are here. Perhaps the matter should be discussed on the Floor of the House at some stage because, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, the ramifications of what is being proposed will probably affect every man, woman and child in this country, not just for a few years, but for a few decades. What might be done in our name in literally a few weeks&#146; time will have enormous consequences for the future of us all, whether we are retiring or just going out to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para16"><a name="09111057000062">During our debates and discussions over the past year or so since the commencement of what we now know as the global financial crisis, regulation has been the backdrop to much of the legislation that has been passed&#151;indeed, it has also been mentioned in relation to what different regulatory bodies have been discussing between themselves. The Treasury Committee, of course, has been engaged in some of that and I hope that its report on European regulation will be published in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para17"><a name="09111057000063">We have sometimes failed properly to identify what we want regulation to do. Some people want regulation to curb the size of financial institutions; some want it to curb the size of bonuses; some want it to turn the whole financial sector upside down; and some want it to split large international financial organisations into bodies that are smaller, more manageable and potentially more regulated. Those different opinions all have a part to play, but we have become more aware that, although the intentions behind regulation are often very laudable, the unintended consequences of the imposition of regulation are given less attention.</p>

well worn route of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The unintended consequences of ill thought out regulation would probably have more impact than the problems that we are supposedly trying to regulate in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para19"><a name="09111057000065">I agree that we need regulation, that it should be tuned to the current circumstances and that supervision needs to be changed and improved, but what do we really want regulation to do for us in this country? At the end of the day, the need for regulation really seems to stem from the problems surrounding debt, which is a fundamental aspect of all the problems that we are dealing with. The amount of debt that has been allowed to build up within the banks, within Government and within personal borrowing&#151;in fact, the whole weight of debt generally&#151;needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para20"><a name="09111057000066">We are only too familiar with the problem of banks being unable to lend to individuals and businesses to get the economy going; in other words, they are unable to support and allow funds to flow into what we know as the real economy. We have allowed the real economy to be forgotten and the financial sector has been the beneficiary. Long-term financial reform and regulation should be about directing lending away from expanding the ever-enormous financial sector towards funding the real economy, rather than loading it down with debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para21"><a name="09111057000067">Over the past 10 or 12 years, the era of cheap credit and regulation has encouraged all the banks to move away from the real economy, where they thought there was less profitability, towards lending against rising assets. That has created bubbles and false markets in property and derivatives&#151;a situation that continually feeds on itself. If we look at the banks&#146; balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, we see that they apparently benefit enormously from their clever investments. We know that the banks might have looked as if they were just lending to the real economy, but the macro-economic consequences of their actions are very different, and we are suffering as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para22"><a name="09111057000068">The credit flowing into those asset markets and the creation of debt overheads has meant that the real economy&#146;s capacity to pay that debt has declined. At the end of the day, it is the real economy that will service that debt, and we are beginning to see that already. Unless we generate real profitability within the economy, the assets themselves will not repay those involved because those assets have reduced in value. The idea of backing into assets is that they can be sold at a profit and that someone can repay themselves, but we have seen that the assets have declined. Derivative and property values have all declined and therefore the debt will have to be paid by the real economy. Sadly, that matter has been ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para24"><a name="09111057000070">There is obviously a need for change in the areas of domestic regulation and the supervision of the domestic banking and financial sectors. There are a great many ideas about how that might be done&#151;for example, whether it should be through the Financial Services Authority or the return of some supervisory powers and regulation to the Bank of England. However it was done, I suspect that the same people would simply transfer from one building to another. It is the culture of regulation, rather than the fact of regulation itself, that we need to address.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para25"><a name="09111057000071">On big banks being too big to fail, we have talked endlessly about whether we should split the banks up or whether we should create more solid Chinese walls, perhaps with differential licences for different activities or with different capital ratios and requirements in respect of the regulation of different activities. We have swiftly introduced protection for depositors to try to protect the taxpayer from having to provide guarantees for them, but that has not done very much. We may well have protected the depositor, but the taxpayer is still paying out, even though we have passed legislation this year to try to head that off.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para26"><a name="09111057000072">Can we ever get back to the idea of having basic old-style banks and perhaps even going back to re-mutualisation? Somehow, I do not think it possible to rein back and return to the position that we were in, recreating what we knew as the old basic banking system or reintroducing some mutualisation. However desirable doing so might appear, I wonder whether it is actually possible.</p>

The whole area of what might be called bonus and regulatory arbitrage now demands a more robust system of regulation and supervision. Gone are the days when individual nations and countries could regulate everything that happened within their borders in respect of their financial sector operations. We have an international banking financial sector with a huge scope, and where it decides to locate itself creates great benefits and great dangers for that location, as we have seen.</p>

European systemic risk board and European supervisory authorities is the way forward. I am sure that there is huge merit in the idea, and people with great expertise have come up with this particular framework, but the regulation that we are trying to create needs to look at both sides of the coin. Regulation must be adequate, but it must also be proportionate. That is not about being popular; it is about being appropriate. The regulations should seek not to stifle competition, but to promote it between financial organisations and financial sector companies, and also between markets. If we regulate out the competition completely, the consequences will be even more dire. Our approach needs to be sustainable and long-term, not short-sighted and subject to continual short-term amendment.</p>

We will have a short-term, continual need, and there will be disruption in the market.

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="91110h0002.htm_para31"><a name="09111057000077">To echo the right hon. Gentleman, I should say that I have several concerns about the European proposals. We probably have shared intentions regarding the proposals, and the intentions behind them should be welcomed and accepted, but there is great unease and concern about the potential unintended consequences, especially in respect of the speed with which ECOFIN wants to adopt the proposals&#151;in a few weeks&#146; time.

If we enter a situation in which we can be significantly outvoted on things that will have a direct effect on our industry and our country, we will need much better safeguards.

First, we are clearly still living with the consequences of the turmoil of the past two years within the financial markets and financial services sector. It is easy to underestimate the importance of financial services regulation in this area and how the failure of such regulation has contributed to the problems we have faced. Secondly, the debate is well-timed given the rush to create a new architecture of regulation for financial services at the European level. All those who have spoken have raised concerns about that rush, and I shall make several comments on that. This is a good opportunity to raise this issue, and I am sure the Minister will set out the Government&#146;s position on a number of the concerns that have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para4"><a name="09111057000085">Several speakers have made the point that financial services are extremely important to our economy&#151;perhaps too important. None the less, it is vital that we get the regulation of those services right. There has been regulatory failure. The tripartite system that the Prime Minister established in 1997 failed to spot the debt boom and the fragility within our banking system. An age of irresponsibility was allowed to occur in which UK banks became more leveraged than their US competitors, a credit boom built up and the Bank of England&#151;the monetary authority&#151;recognised some of the difficulties but had no powers to address them. Meanwhile, the Financial Services Authority, as the banking regulator, had no remit to monitor the entire picture. In addition, the FSA took a narrow approach to its responsibilities, focusing on conduct of business rules rather than prudential supervision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para5"><a name="09111057000086">The difficulties that we saw in 2007 and 2008 continue to live with us partly because nobody called time on the explosion of debt. When the problems occurred we saw a failure of co-ordination, and the question of who is in charge has never been adequately addressed. It is right that political parties think seriously about how to rectify that, and my party have set out detailed proposals on how to reform our financial services regulatory regime to ensure that there is no repeat of the problems of recent years, and we will do that by giving greater powers to the Bank of England, which must be in charge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para6"><a name="09111057000087">Several Members have referred to banks being too big to fail, and we have an ongoing debate on the divide within banks between utility functions and investment banking functions. The Governor of the Bank of England stated in Edinburgh on 20 October, only a few days ago, that there had been little real reform on that and that the system remains inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para7"><a name="09111057000088">I turn specifically to European regulation, which was the essence of my right hon. Friend&#146;s remarks. As we have heard, on 23 September 2009 the European Commission adopted legislative proposals aimed at addressing the regulatory weaknesses at the micro and macro-prudential level through the creation of a European system of financial supervisors and a European systemic risk board. The European system of financial supervisors will comprise a college of national supervisors and three entities collectively referred to as the European supervisory authorities: the European Banking Authority, The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para8"><a name="09111057000089">I debated many of those matters with the Minister in European Committee B on 29 June 2009. At the heart of the Government&#146;s approach is an acceptance of a greater European role at a regulatory level, but not a supervisory level, and the Minister rather helpfully set out the distinction between the two:</p>
<a name="91110h0003.htm_brev0"><a name="09111057000138"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Regulation refers to the making of rules. Supervision relates to the processes that implement the rules and how they are applied to individual firms and markets. While it is important that we have a harmonisation of the rules across Europe, we stick to our point that the supervision and application of those rules, and how they apply in different countries, is down to national Governments. That is why we did not support EU supervision...The main thrust of our argument in negotiation was that supervision should be at nation state level.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report, European Committee B, </i>29 June 2009; c. 5-8]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para9"><a name="09111057000090">I will explore further the distinction between the rule-maker and the supervisor. One concern that has been raised with us relates to the legal powers of the ESAs, a point my right hon. Friend touched on. Having received advice from a leading lawyer in that area, I understand that the ESAs will not have the power to take decisions or make rules because European law requires that those powers are reserved to the Commission, but they can issue guidelines based on their interpretation of the rules. Competent authorities will be obliged to make every effort to comply with those guidelines. The ESAs can also take action against national regulators that do not currently apply relevant EU legislation correctly. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s view on whether that interpretation of the ESAs&#146; powers is broadly correct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para10"><a name="09111057000091">There is a possible concern about the distinction between regulation and supervision. The ESAs have the power to settle disagreements between national regulators, which leads to a point that is similar to the issue of action being taken against national regulators that do not currently apply relevant EU legislation: whether ESAs will in effect make individual decisions on individual market participants. One can imagine a dispute on a particular matter between two regulators or between an ESA and a national regulator. When decisions are made on an individual market participant, that looks an awful lot like supervision of an individual institution, rather than regulation. The Government&#146;s position on that is clear, and ECOFIN agreed that decisions that are specific to individual firms should remain the exclusive preserve of national regulators. There is a degree of uncertainty on the powers the ESAs will have, and uncertainty in that area is a real cause for concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para11"><a name="09111057000092">Perhaps the most important red line the Government have identified is that the ESAs should not be able to take decisions that impinge upon the fiscal responsibilities of a nation state. The Governor of the Bank of England has said that banks are global when alive but national in death, because it is the national taxpayer who has to step in to bail out those banks. There is a concern that there would be no democratic accountability if an ESA took a decision that effectively required national taxpayers to step in, and the Government have rightly said that that should be resisted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para12"><a name="09111057000093">However, article 10 of the Commission&#146;s proposals allows the ESAs to step in in an emergency, and article 11 allows them to step in when there is a dispute between regulators. The measures proposed by an ESA in such circumstances might have a fiscal impact for a nation state. Article 23 sets out an appeal mechanism, although it is not clear how that would work. That might take too much time, and we know from recent history how quickly we must step in when a bank is failing. If we are to step in, we must do so quickly, as we saw during the events of 14 months ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para13"><a name="09111057000094">Also, the appeal mechanism set out in article 23 does not apply to article 21, which follows up on a recommendation made by the Economic and Social Research Council. The Government have said that it has been accepted all along that the fiscal position will be protected. If so, why has the Commission come up with proposals that seem simply to ignore what the Government claim has already been achieved in negotiation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para14"><a name="09111057000095">Regarding the Commission&#146;s ability to declare an emergency, thus giving the ESAs greater powers, on what criteria may an emergency be declared and how would the ESAs use that authority? With financial services we are in a global situation, not just a European situation, so it could be important for the UK supervisors to co-ordinate not only within the EU, but with US regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve. Could the emergency powers, if declared, prevent the FSA or the Bank of England from taking immediate steps to co-ordinate with other countries? The restrictions on communications, for example, could be significant. Could it prevent the FSA or the Bank of England from taking immediate steps with regard to a UK entity? Inevitably, European institutions are likely to move more slowly than national institutions, as is the nature of things, so if that happens the Commission&#146;s   <br>

proposals might slow down the ability of UK institutions to react and of UK financial regulators to co-ordinate with other institutions. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) spoke about unintended consequences, and there is a concern that an unintended consequence may arise here: in an attempt to strengthen prudential macro and micro-supervision, we may in fact inhibit regulators from taking effective action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para15"><a name="09111057000096">My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), as ever, spoke eloquently about the concerns of his constituents and of businesses located in his constituency. I am pleased that he discussed in some detail the alternative investment fund managers directive&#151;again, I debated that point with the Minister in June. The proposals were poorly drafted and protectionist in nature, and they demonstrated a lack of understanding of hedge funds and private equity funds, and their significance. My hon. Friend was absolutely right to state that such funds were not the cause of the difficulties earlier this year. I would be grateful if the Minister discussed what progress has been made in addressing the concerns she outlined to the European Scrutiny Committee in June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para16"><a name="09111057000097">Finally, it is right that we explore the issue of the wider cost to the economy of the banking system&#146;s failure in the past few years and its fiscal consequences. At the weekend, the Prime Minister set out four proposals to address that concern, one of which was a transactions tax, or a Tobin tax, about which we have heard nothing in Parliament. Over the years, the Prime Minister himself and the Treasury have been extremely sceptical about such a tax, but the <i>Financial Times</i> reported yesterday that, of the four options that the Prime Minister set out on Saturday,</p>
<a name="91110h0003.htm_brev1"><a name="09111057000139"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;UK officials had initially suggested the transactions tax was the prime minister&#146;s preferred mechanism out of the four options he had raised&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para17"><a name="09111057000098">The proposals were widely condemned by the US, the Canadians and the International Monetary Fund&#151;I believe that all but the French condemned them. Indeed, the Treasury has recently been briefing against the proposal, and the <i>Financial Times</i> reported that, before the end of the weekend, officials had stated:</p>
<a name="91110h0003.htm_brev2"><a name="09111057000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We&#146;re not that massively wedded to a transactions tax. We&#146;re not saying &#145;it&#146;s this or nothing&#146; &#151; we&#146;re saying we need a deal&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para18"><a name="09111057000099">Never has a Government proposal been withdrawn so quickly. I would be grateful if the Minister took this opportunity to clarify the Government&#146;s position. Was the Treasury even aware that the Prime Minister would come up with the proposal? I ask that because the <i>Financial Times</i> stated that the Chancellor was understood to be frustrated by the Prime Minister&#146;s promotion of a proposal that he knew the US would have no choice but publicly to oppose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para19"><a name="09111057000100">This is an important area. This is not the place for short-term stunts that will get headlines, as the Prime Minister attempted to do at the weekend, yet further damaging his credibility. It is important that we have a Government who take a long-term view as to what is necessary for the financial services sector. It is also right that they fight our corner and ensure that European Union proposals are right for the UK. I hope the Minister can provide some reassurance that the Government have at least some of those attributes.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I congratulate the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) on securing this debate. There could hardly be a better moment to discuss financial services regulation. I listened with interest to his speech and to those of the other hon. Members who contributed to this short debate: the hon. Members for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field), for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para20"><a name="09111057000102">As the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, this debate follows on from European Committee B on 29 June. The Transport Committee took evidence last week from my noble Friend Lord Myners, and on 10 November there will be a Lords evidence session and debate on the matter. I believe that a debate is timetabled on the Floor of the Commons on the subject, so there will be an opportunity for further scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para21"><a name="09111057000103">I do not believe that anyone would suggest that more regulation of financial services is not needed. We need action to produce national and global solutions, and most of that will be delivered through the European Union and international forums. We have begun to raise the quality of financial supervision and regulation globally, but we are not there yet. There is more work to do, and a need for more regulation. We support EU regulation in new areas, more harmonised standards and a greater role for EU authorities in enforcing regulation and improving the effectiveness of supervision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para22"><a name="09111057000104">However, the need for more regulation cannot be met by just any regulation&#151;it must be right. If we have regulation for the sake of it, we will suffer twice: from failing to remove systemic risk, and from increasing the costs to those who use the services, from small businesses to pensioners. We have to have high-quality decision making, and it is more important than ever to have an excellent evidence base, meaningful consultation and high-quality assessments of the impact on stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para23"><a name="09111057000105">The crisis has also taught us that regulatory arbitrage can introduce its own risks, so we must ensure that, wherever possible, there is global convergence of standards. We encourage the EU to play a greater leadership role in setting global standards. Many of the speeches and interventions by hon. Members have been concerned with the search for the right regulation&#151;that is, regulation that is necessary, sufficient and effective. That is why I am glad that we are having this debate. A part of it has focused on EU regulation, so I shall start with that and then move on to national regulation. I shall try to answer as many points as I can in the time available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para24"><a name="09111057000106">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire made a point about transaction taxes. In fact, the Prime Minister had raised the issue earlier, so I beg to differ with the hon. Gentleman. It was not a short-term stunt. The Prime Minister had previously raised an interest in such taxes and said that he was looking with interest at the French working party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para25"><a name="09111057000107">The Treasury&#146;s position has always been that imposing such a tax cannot be done by one country alone&#151;we all accept that&#151;and the US has said that it is willing to work with the International Monetary Fund as well. Nobody is saying that there would be an immediate solution, or that we will be able to come up with  <br>

something straight away, but it is something that is worth looking at. The Treasury&#146;s position is that this cannot be done by one country alone. It would have to be global, and that is why a great deal more work must be done on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para26"><a name="09111057000108">On European supervision, the Government strongly support moves to improve the quality and consistency of supervision, to ensure more effective rule-making and enforcement, and better to identify risks in the financial system. We strongly support proposals to establish the new European supervisory authorities, and to give them a strong rule-making role, a role in enforcing rules, a role in peer review to ensure high standards and an ability to settle disagreements between supervisors. We believe that such moves would improve the quality and consistency of supervision in the EU, and they are supported by the City and, in particular, cross-border institutions operating from London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para27"><a name="09111057000109">However, I am happy to reiterate that day-to-day supervision and crisis management arrangements must remain national, as it is only national Governments who can provide fiscal support to firms. That is why the Heads of Government agreed at the June European Council that the new framework should not impinge on member states&#146; fiscal responsibilities, and that day-to-day supervision should remain national. As a result, it is clear that there can be no direct European powers over firms.</p>

 I am grateful to the Minister for reiterating that point. Can she explain why the Commission came up with proposals in September that do not appear to respect the agreement made by ECOFIN earlier in the year?</p>

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="09111057000111"><a name="91110h0003.htm_spnew2"><a name="09111057000157"><b>Sarah McCarthy-Fry:</b>
 I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman that in some areas the Commission&#146;s proposals do not respect the agreement that was made in June, particularly where they propose European powers over firms, and European crisis management powers. We need to bring the proposals back in line with what was agreed by the European Council in June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="91110h0003.htm_para28"><a name="09111057000112">There is interest in the legal issues in these proposals and the Government are well aware of the complex legal matters here. I do not want to go into the detail, but I will be clear: regardless of the technicalities, the Government&#146;s overriding objective is that the new framework must be able to withstand legal challenge. We cannot have legal uncertainty and challenges before the courts; that could undermine financial stability. So we are working closely with other member states and the Council legal service to ensure that the bodies are on a sound legal footing. In particular, we are looking at areas where the supervisory authorities can exercise discretion and where the Commission is seemingly playing the role of the courts. Both those areas are problematic, but in both the issues can be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="09111057000113"><a name="91110h0003.htm_spnew3"><a name="09111057000158"><b>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</b>
 Clarity is essential here. Can the Minister assure us that the new supervisory authorities will not have powers of binding mediation over national authorities and, separate to that, that they will not have powers, even in an emergency, to tell national regulators and authorities what to do?</p>

 We do not support direct powers over individual firms. We expect the powers of mediation to be used where there are cross-border situations, but the overriding thing is that there are no powers where there are any fiscal consequences for Governments. That is the overriding principle here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para0"><a name="09111057000115">We know that there are outstanding issues and questions. However, this is a positive agenda for reform. The new framework will better protect consumers, help prevent financial crisis and improve efficiency for firms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para1"><a name="09111057000116">A question was asked about accountability. We believe that the ESAs will be accountable to national Governments through the European Council, but it is likely that they will also be accountable to the European Parliament. The Financial Services Authority will sit on the ESAs, so we will have a powerful UK voice there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para2"><a name="09111057000117">Members spoke about whether the EU response has been too hasty. It is important that we respond swiftly to the crisis, but I agree that such action should not be taken at the expense of high-quality regulation. That is why we are encouraging the Commission to adhere to best practice and conduct consultations and impact assessments on regulatory proposals for regulation of markets and firms. At the June European Council, the EC leaders gave a mandate for the proposals to be adopted swiftly so that the new framework could  be fully in place in 2010, which is why the legislative proposals were produced at the end of September. As I have said, we intend that our Parliament should have a full opportunity to debate this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para3"><a name="09111057000118">At times the Commission may have been too hasty in issuing a proposal. For example, it was too hasty in respect of the alternative investment fund manager directive, which we debated earlier at the European Scrutiny Committee. We agree that the Commission did not conduct a proper consultation or a robust impact assessment on that directive with stakeholders. We have made it clear that this is not an acceptable approach to drafting legislation, because it has resulted in a poorer-quality proposal that has led to more difficult Council negotiations. The European Parliament has said that it will carry out its own impact assessment on the proposal. I confirm once again that there is nothing to suggest that hedge funds or any other type of fund were a major contributor to recent market events.</p>

 I am glad that the Minister has confirmed what I said earlier: hedge funds and alternative assets played no fundamental part in the credit crunch and the financial problems. But the suggestion that the EU will now have much more international influence surely is undermined by what has happened, because it is clear that it was not economic or financial issues at stake, but the raw politics, particularly in respect of one or two of our continental partners who saw this as an opportunity to clip the wings of the City of London, rather than to focus on what would be good for consumers, both in the EU and globally.</p>

 Our position is that any regulation, as well as managing systemic risk, has to be good for consumers. There are aspects of the proposal as drafted  <br>

that could impose large costs and restrictions on fund managers, which is why we are engaging actively with stakeholders in the UK industry, with the Commission and with other member states to develop and make the case for amendments to the directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para5"><a name="09111057000122">Based on discussions so far in Council, we believe that many member states are keen to make the improvements. My noble Friend Lord Myners has personally committed a substantial part of his time to achieving a good outcome for the UK on the directive. He has had useful discussions with many of the stakeholders, including Members of the European Parliament, the Swedish presidency and his Spanish counterpart. Our overall impression is that most member states are approaching these negotiations with a positive attitude and a desire to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens. We expect the presidency to aim for a general consensus in Council for a redraft of its directive by the middle of December, so that negotiations with the European Parliament can start.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para6"><a name="09111057000123">On the UK and systemically significant firms, in our July 2009 paper, &#147;Reforming financial markets&#148;, we set out a number of measures for dealing with systemically significant and often complex financial institutions whose failure could represent a significant threat to financial stability. These measures include strengthened market discipline, better corporate governance, policies on remuneration to ensure that risk is better understood, and enhanced prudential supervision by the FSA. Those measures should go some way towards reducing the probability of firm failure. But we are not proposing to pursue a zero-failure regime, which would be neither realistic nor desirable. It is equally important that, where firms reach the point of failure, the authorities can intervene and, if necessary, resolve the situation with a firm in a way that does not damage the wider financial system and put the public finances at risk.</p>

This is crucial where a systemically important firm is allowed to fail. Secondly, we propose stronger resolution arrangements. Improvements have already been made to the regulatory toolkit for winding down failed firms, for example, through the Banking Act 2009. We will legislate, in the forthcoming financial services Bill, to ensure that firms themselves must make recovery and resolution plans to manage their own failure. Those plans will reduce moral hazard. The aim is to reduce the  <br>

The FSA supervises firms according to the risks they present to its statutory objectives. As in any risk management, risks are assessed in terms of their impact and their probability. The nature and extent of the FSA&#146;s supervisory relationship with a firm depends on how much of a risk it could pose to the FSA&#146;s statutory objectives.</p>

Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked about the regulation of savings and investment products and the worry about over-regulating small firms. The FSA&#146;s retail distribution review is addressing structural problems in the distribution of savings and investment products. We have welcomed the FSA&#146;s comprehensive review and its positive engagement with stakeholders. The aim of that review is not to over-regulate small firms that do not pose any systemic risk, but rather to address structural problems in the distribution of savings and investment products.</p>

First, it is difficult to do. Secondly, if it were feasible it probably would not be enough. Separating investment and commercial banks would not insulate pure deposit-taking institutions from the failure of a large investment bank: Lehman Brothers showed that that was so. Thirdly, it implies that all the risk lies in investment banking. However, we know that it is not just investment banks that involve risk. The recovery and resolution plans or the living wills are key tools with which to mitigate the risk and promote long-term financial stability.</p>

We have already seen the dangers of too little regulation, but in these times there is not enough confidence, and confidence can only build if the regulatory framework is sound. Too much regulation brings its own risks, not just of stifling the recovery, but of penalising some financial services that allow firms to manage their own risk. Only if we get this balance right will we succeed in our goal of making the single market the most competitive, efficient and stable financial market in the world.</p>

 A debate on Cyprus after a Friends of Cyprus visit to the island now seems to be a part of the House&#146;s annual calendar. I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#146; Interests for the visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para12"><a name="09111058000003">The fact that we are here, year after year, could imply that there has been no progress, but that would be wrong. However, such progress as there is is painfully slow, and the clock is ticking ever more quickly against the prospect of a settlement. During our visit, we saw more than 50 people and held almost 40 meetings. Those visits were to both sides of the green line, and we saw elected politicians, officials and civil society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para13"><a name="09111058000004">There is a clear lack of a pro-solution culture throughout the island, perhaps reflecting the media coverage, and pessimism abounds. Neither side has a strategy to prepare their people for a solution or to support the talks, but there are many initiatives, contacts and co-operative ventures, which are encouraging. We need more events such as the recent bi-communal evening in Pyla. There is a dangerous belief in the south that if the negotiations fail, another United Nations initiative will come along in due course, albeit starting from a worse position, rather than seeing this as the last sketo in the kafenio, which it certainly is, and may well be for many years if there is no success. We are already half a decade on from the failure of the Annan plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para14"><a name="09111058000005">There are &#147;nevers&#148; on both sides with very loud voices. Although they do not represent the majority view of either population, their influence is persuasive and in many instances malign. Although the talks do not have a timetable, there are natural deadlines in the immediate future, including the European Union review of Turkish accession and, more importantly, elections in the north in April 2010 when Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat will be up for re-election.</p>

 The presidential election in the Turkish-occupied north in April clearly shows that an artificial deadline would probably not be helpful. Does the hon. Gentleman accept, nevertheless, the imperative to get a fair settlement as soon as possible, because the massive movement of Turkish people from Turkey to settle in Cyprus without the language or Cypriot affiliations will make a settlement increasingly more difficult as time goes on? In that event, the main losers will be the Turkish Cypriots.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, but the deadline is not artificial; it is a natural deadline that comes with the normal electoral process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para15"><a name="09111058000008">Both sides have been issuing unhelpful statements that provoke each other, and rhetoric from the north can only magnify as the April elections approach. Positive statements from either side receive little coverage. There is a general decline in optimism throughout. Of those involved in the negotiations, the most optimistic person was Turkish Cypriot negotiator Ozdil Nami, but that was not saying a great deal. There is a general and accurate view from every independent commentator that if these two leaders cannot do it, no one can.</p>

Although Greece&#146;s fundamental policy of supporting the Republic of Cyprus&#146;s negotiating position will not change, we will see a more active foreign policy approach from Greece, including improving relations with Turkey, which is all to the good.</p>

 Does my hon.

It is critical that they take a more active engagement in the current negotiations.</p>

 I shall speak about the treaty of guarantee, but it is correct that both sides look to what they consider to be their motherland. I also believe that George Papandreou is right to say that Cyprus must be freed from the influence of the motherland, which has not been entirely beneficial throughout Cyprus&#146;s independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="91110h0004.htm_para19"><a name="09111058000014">Among Cypriots on the island, there is a generational problem. Research a few years ago showed that two thirds of Cypriots who are alive today were not alive in 1974, and know no bi-communal way of living. One of our visits was to the English school, which now admits Turkish Cypriot pupils, who account for about 15 per cent. of the total. It was rather depressing to talk to Greek Cypriot teenagers, who generally seem to be satisfied with the status quo, and not particularly enthusiastic for a solution. Although Turkish Cypriot students at the school are learning Greek, there is no take-up whatever of Turkish lessons by Greek Cypriot students. Turkish Cypriot students seem to be isolated. The school is working very hard to break that down, but there is a xenophobic undercurrent on both sides of the green line. There are no school exchange programmes across the green line because of recognition and passport issues. Heads could deal directly with schools across the line, but there is a likelihood of a parents&#146; backlash.</p>

Although not strictly a confidence-building measure, Stelios Haji-Ioannou of easyJet has offered &#8364;1 million in grants for joint bi-communal business ventures.

The joint proposal of the two mayors of Famagusta for restoration of the old city and the surveying of Varosha, which would be a welcome confidence-building measure, has fallen on deaf Turkish ears.

There could be other ways of guaranteeing a solution and security for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, but that is a very difficult one to bridge. One option suggested to us is for the treaty of guarantee to be phased out with Turkish accession to the EU, and for a treaty of implementation for the specific details of any settlement to be considered.</p>

It seems to me that there are three issues requiring guarantee in the event of a solution. I am referring to a political guarantee for the indivisibility of the federation, which the EU can provide, and a guarantee for the implementation of the agreement, which could be a UN Security Council resolution. The most difficult issue is the personal security guarantee, including the removal of Turkish troops and the future role of UNFICYP&#151;the UN Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus. UNFICYP&#146;s role could be a new mandate to support implementation and federal policy. To see what could be done and, equally, where UNFICYP went wrong from the outset in 1964, I recommend Martin Packard&#146;s diary of 1964, &#147;Getting It Wrong&#148;.

Particularly in terms of the villages of Agia Marina and Asomatos, there is a lack of access for the Maronites to worship, and it is important for confidence building that access is given.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is right. It is important to remember when we talk about a bicommunal island that in fact there are more than two communities in Cyprus. The Maronites, the Armenians, the Latins and even people from the UK form part of the community of Cyprus. The hon. Gentleman is right to remind us of the particular minority to which he referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para11"><a name="09111058000043">One of Ms Kaminara&#146;s initiatives is to take editors of newspapers and broadcast media from both sides of the green line to Brussels and encourage them to be better informed about the EU. One issue that we came across concerned the bicommunal Nicosia master plan and, in particular, the need for work in the buffer zone. EU grants for work for the north have to go through the enlargement directorate, and for the south through the regional development directorate. That means that it is virtually impossible to do anything useful in the buffer zone, because the two sources of funding do not seem able to talk to each other. For example, surveying work is needed to work out what could happen after a solution. That should be resolved within the Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para12"><a name="09111058000044">The key question for the EU, though, is its role in supporting the negotiations and, in particular, the attitude that it takes towards the December Turkish accession review. Lord Hannay, writing for the Centre for European Reform, commented that Turkish EU accession is inseparably linked to a Cyprus solution. I would put it the other way round. Although a solution should not depend on Turkish accession, a solution would undoubtedly help Turkey&#146;s EU hopes, and Turkey will not accede without a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para13"><a name="09111058000045">It seems inevitable that there will be the usual EU fudge, which will seriously anger Greek Cypriots who are expecting leverage on Turkey, which they believe gets away with everything, including non-compliance with international agreements such as the 2005 declaration and the Ankara protocol, on which there has been no progress at all. In that context, it is important to remember that the ports were open from 1974 to 1987, including four years after the TRNC&#146;s unilateral declaration of independence. We are therefore talking about an economic sanction, not a recognition issue; it was not a recognition issue during those four years. The offer from the Republic to Turkish Cypriots was that Famagusta port could be reopened under EU management and that they could  <br>

use Larnaca under EU control too, but that was not accepted. There has also been considerable harassment by Turkey of oil exploration vessels not flagged by the Republic but working under its licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para14"><a name="09111058000046">If the European Council decides to avoid standing up to Turkey, the least worst option would be for the EU to put the review on hold for six months, in the light of the negotiations, to see whether any progress is made by April, because if there is no progress by then, there probably never will be. At that stage, Turkish accession aspirations would in effect be in an indefinite limbo, as there would be inevitable blocks on further progress on acquis chapters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para15"><a name="09111058000047">Property issues are fundamental to the outcome of the negotiations. According to the most recent press statements from President Christofias, the sides are not ready to discuss the issue in depth, although some convergence has been achieved. The issue is inevitably linked to the territorial settlement, because the more territory that goes back to the Greek Cypriots, the fewer people would then have to consider living under Turkish Cypriot administration. The two sides are starting from diametrically opposed positions on property, but I suspect that in practice the net results of either proposal would not be far apart.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para16"><a name="09111058000048">The Turkish Cypriots expect a dirigiste system, with maximum numbers laid down as to, for example, the number of Greek Cypriots who would be allowed to return to live under Turkish Cypriot administration and the amount of property that would be owned by Turkish Cypriots as opposed to Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots would seek derogations from the acquis to institutionalise these, but it seems to me that any such derogations would be bound to fail, either because they were too rigid and would prevent inward investment or because they were too lax and would be easily avoided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para17"><a name="09111058000049">The Greek Cypriot position starts from the recognition of individual property rights and the fact that everybody should be able to make their own decisions. The hierarchy is: first, restitution; secondly, choice of exchange; and thirdly, compensation. It is for the state to provide for the current user. In theory, Mr. Talat accepts individual property rights, too, but he wants superior rights to be given to the Turkish Cypriot occupier, rather than the Greek Cypriot owner of a property. He wants no restitution, although he would accept an Annan-based formula.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para18"><a name="09111058000050">George Lordos&#146;s research and consequent proposals are interesting and worthy of further consideration. His view is that individuals should be allowed to make their own minds up during a three-year hiatus, but they could be influenced, for example, by tax concessions and speeded-up planning permissions to encourage them to exchange property north and south. That is based on the principle that few Greek Cypriots would in practice want to live under a Turkish Cypriot Administration. Furthermore, most Turkish Cypriots who were previously allocated Greek Cypriot properties in the north own homes and land in the south, although that would not, of course, apply to Turkish settlers. Some people would need to be rehoused, but bearing in mind the respective balance of property and the value of property in the north and south, the cost could be manageable. Compulsory denial of rights would be avoided or at worst minimised. Residential ownership rights could be ranked, for example, by reference to whether the claimant originally lived in the property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para19"><a name="09111058000051">The court cases proceed in the European Court of Human Rights, where Turkey has received a battering. The Court will consider the question whether the Turkish Cypriot property commission is a valid domestic remedy on 18 November, although the judgment is likely to be many months off. Over the past three years, Greek Cypriots have lodged 422 cases with the commission. Seventy-five cases have been resolved, including five with restitution. Generally, compensation is paid at between only 5 and 10 per cent. of the value of the property, with nothing for loss of use. So far, total compensation is of the order of &#163;35 million. The Orams case has obviously had an impact, but it has been misplayed by the Turkish Cypriots, who could have used it to illustrate that there was a real problem on property, which necessitated a solution, rather than to attack the judges for their findings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para20"><a name="09111058000052">There is also the question of the cost of compensation, should anything other than restitution or property exchange be the norm. The first question is where the billions necessary would come from; the second is what impact the huge sums that would be put into circulation as a result would have on the island&#146;s economy. If all the property in the north was subject to expropriation and compensation, the bill would be unaffordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para21"><a name="09111058000053">One issue that the UK should help to resolve is the Turkish Cypriot claim to 55 per cent. of Varosha, which is based on the fact that the land belonged to EVKAF&#151;the Board of Pious Foundations in Cyprus&#151;before independence. In 1960, however, the UK provided &#163;1.5 million to pay off that claim as part of the independence settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para22"><a name="09111058000054">The Turkish Cypriot economy is nothing short of a basket case and is heavily subsidised by Turkey. Over the past six years, according to Prime Minister Erdogan, it has been subsidised at an average of $523 million per year. In 2009, the figure was $815 million&#151;a huge drain on Turkey&#146;s economy. There is still little trade across the green line. Most of the money going north is made up of remittances from Turkish Cypriot workers who are taking their wages back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para23"><a name="09111058000055">There is unrecorded trade to evade tax, as well as illegal trade in prohibited items, such as animal products. There is Greek Cypriot consumer resistance to goods that many say are produced through the use of stolen property. Business sources in the north tell us that Turkish army base retail outlets undercut Turkish Cypriot businesses in the sale of consumer goods, including foodstuffs, at prices well below those in legitimate Turkish Cypriot shops. The Turkish Cypriot minimum wage is also undercut by businesses in Turkey&#146;s immediate southern coastal area, where there is no minimum wage. The construction boom, which was fuelled by post-Annan development on Greek Cypriot land, has ended, in large part because of the consequences of the Orams case and the world economic downturn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para24"><a name="09111058000056">There remain huge human rights issues in the north. Turkish Cypriot secular culture is clashing with settler culture. The CTP&#151;the Republican Turkish party&#151;did badly in the parliamentary elections last year as a consequence of its decision to try to implement the EU acquis in the north, which brought hardship to Turkish Cypriots, with no real benefits, as they saw it, from  the EU.</p>

That is now worsening and could be compared to the unrest that took place before the opening of the green line, although this time without the participation of the CTP. Hospitals, ports and even Parliament have been closed by strikes. That has partly been caused because Turkey&#146;s economic subsidy is under pressure, with the unjustifiably large number of public employees in the north being questioned. It also has a lot to do with the increasing numbers of people migrating from Turkey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para26"><a name="09111058000058">In the absence of a solution, things do not look good for Mr. Talat&#146;s re-election prospects. If Mr. Talat loses and Mr. Eroglu wins, it will be hard for President Christofias to negotiate with Mr. Eroglu, although Turkey will still have the final say. Even at a practical level, Mr. Eroglu does not speak English. On the policy level, he is much more hard-line than Mr. Talat on issues that make no difference to Turkey, but which are vital to achieve a workable solution. The general view is that if there is no settlement before the election and Mr. Talat loses, the negotiations will be at an effective end.</p>

None the less, the committee told us that it was not really practical to expand the operation. Altogether the bicommunal teams have exhumed 570 sets of remains from both sides of the green line and returned the remains of 179 people to their families&#151;135 Greek Cypriots and 44 Turkish Cypriots. They are perennially in the hunt for money, requiring between &#8364;2.2 million and &#8364;2.4 million a year to function. The EU has just given the teams &#8364;2 million for the next two years, but they are still &#8364;1 million short for next year. Since the committee started its work many years ago, the UK has given it $159,000, but it is a long time since we last gave it a grant, and it is time that we gave it another one.</p>

There was an outcry from some politicians in the south, although the bereaved families maintained a dignified silence. However, the political response led to a reaction from the Turkish army, which has withdrawn from its tentatively developing approach of permitting excavations on military land and reverted to its original non-committal wait-and-see position of proceeding after all civilian sites have been exhausted. Previously, the army said that it would consider a case if it had been documented, but there have been no excavations on military land  so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para29"><a name="09111058000063">There are strong rumours, which have been reported in <i>Kathimerini</i> and <i>Afrika</i>, that up to 1,000 Greek Cypriots from the Kyrenia area could be buried at a major military site at Lapithos. Journalists are investigating that military zone, which is apparently mined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para30"><a name="09111058000064">The European Court of Human Rights case of Varnava has been decided in the grand chamber. It was ruled that Committee on Missing Persons work is inadequate for an investigation into compliance with article 5, which requires a proper inquiry into deaths at the hands of the state, and Turkey will have to respond to that. However, the Court imposed a limitation block on any new cases, except those brought to it soon after remains are partially identified to families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para31"><a name="09111058000065">Relatives are agitating for more information about the circumstances of deaths. In addition to the missing, there are 1,000 known Greek Cypriot dead, including 500 in the north, and 30 Turkish Cypriot known dead whose bodies have not been recovered. Nowadays, such people would be classed as missing. The committee&#146;s total objective is therefore to deal with the cases of about 2,200 missing and known dead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para32"><a name="09111058000066">Any discussion about Cyprus inevitably raises the question whether Turkey is the key to a solution. The Greek Cypriots complain of Turkey&#146;s provocative statements, such as Mr. Erdogan&#146;s recent comments about two republics, two states and two peoples. Mr. Talat probably has more room to manoeuvre than is generally accepted in the south, although in the end Turkey will undoubtedly have to approve any agreements, particularly on security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para33"><a name="09111058000067">There remains, of course, the issue of the military occupation. Clearly, there have recently been rapid foreign policy developments in Turkey under Prime Minister Erdogan&#151;for example, towards Armenia and Israel and on broadcasting in Kurdish. Given that Turkey is not as yet an entirely democratic country, it can switch its positions fast.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para34"><a name="09111058000068">Some trade is taking place. In 2007, exports from Turkey to the Republic were worth $1.4 million, while exports from the Republic to Turkey were worth $8.6 million. However, that is only a tiny fraction of what would be possible if we had a solution that opened Turkish ports and markets to Cypriot trade. Turkey has said that it would like to see a solution by December, and we will have to see whether it makes any concessions by then, although it has now conceded that there will not be a settlement by the year end and it maintains that the negotiations cannot be open-ended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="91110h0005.htm_para35"><a name="09111058000069">One thing that I have not mentioned is the peace dividend, which would be substantial in terms of the island&#146;s economy and the income of individual families. The International Peace Research Institute in Oslo found that the benefit to the island of a solution would be &#8364;1.8 billion per year&#151;equivalent to &#8364;5,500 for every family every year. A solution would create 33,000 jobs and 3 per cent. GDP growth over seven years in real terms. The benefits of success would result in not only an economically thriving Cyprus, but wider regional stability.</p>

quo. However, the situation is not a status quo. It is changing in a negative direction, year by year, as more development takes place in the north and there are more settlers, and as more Turkish Cypriots emigrate and the demography changes, with an increase in the number of young people who have no knowledge of the other side, compared with those who lived bicommunally before 1964 and 1974.</p>

Martti Ahtisaari, the 2008 Nobel prize winner, writing for the Independent Commission on Turkey, also believed this to be the last chance. Failure will mean that Cyprus is likely to slide into hostile partition, with further strain on the EU-Turkey relationship, new frictions in the eastern Mediterranean, damage to EU-NATO co-operation, acceleration of Turkish Cypriot migration and continuing questions over the future of UNFICYP. Plan B for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus if the talks fail seems to be to press the EU to reopen issues of trade, and to seek recognition, probably in the first instance, from Islamic countries.</p>

Time is running out and surely now is the time, after so long, for the lasting settlement that is the birthright of all Cypriots, to enable them all to live in peace, security and prosperity.</p>

The fact that Cyprus remains partitioned after 35 years is nothing less than a tragedy. We should not forget, of course, that the wall divided Berlin between 1961 and 1989&#151;a mere 28 years, which is seven years less than the green line has divided Cyprus.</p>

I hope that they will recognise that although the international community&#151;the UN and the EU&#151;can help by facilitating and encouraging the finding of a solution by Cypriots, willingness on the part of Cypriots to negotiate is not enough. If Cypriots are to reach a settlement to reunite Cyprus, Ankara needs to give them the freedom that they need to make their own choices about their own country. If we are to achieve the goal of a peaceful and united Cyprus, we need to demilitarise the island.

Those issues were one reason for my writing to the Prime Minister and Chancellor Merkel this week, to ask them to use this week&#146;s celebrations as an opportunity to push forward with progress towards a settlement, and to put pressure on Ankara. They need to make clear to Ankara that it is vital for it to comply, first, with its obligations under the Ankara protocol to open its ports and airspace to Cypriot aviation and shipping; secondly, with the UN&#146;s repeated resolutions calling for freedom and justice for Cyprus; and thirdly, with the repeated resolutions of the European Court of Human Rights on Cyprus.

We need the truth quickly; sadly, many of the relatives of those who are missing will not be with us for much longer. They need the truth about what happened to their loved ones 35 years ago; that is a key part of pressing forward with a solution in Cyprus.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="09111058000083"><a name="91110h0006.htm_spnew5"><a name="09111058000173"><b>Mr. David Burrowes (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):</b>
 It is a pleasure to take part in the debate, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) for securing it. I welcome the new Minister for Europe to the debate. We have had a change of envoy and several Europe Ministers in a short period, which has not necessarily helped with our focus on the Cyprus issue, but I welcome the fact that the Minister, like previous Ministers, is committed to making an early visit to Cyprus. It is important that, among all the competing priorities, the concerns about the need to reach a solution should be heard loud and clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para8"><a name="09111058000084">I declare an interest, to the extent that I visited Cyprus last year as part of the Friends of Cyprus delegation; there is also a primary interest in my constituency, where I represent a large number of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, to whom progress is a matter of vital concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para9"><a name="09111058000085">Other hon. Members have mentioned the positive attitude of the leaders, and their engagement in talks. Their relationship is perhaps one of the best aspects of the situation as we look to make progress. Their personal commitment is no doubt sincere, and it is something that we should all support. It is important that all noises off, outside the negotiations, should be sensible and positive, and be built around the UN framework. It is therefore also important that Turkey should play its part. Noises off about confederation are not welcome in the context of pursing the bicommunal, bizonal federation solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para10"><a name="09111058000086">The report from the UN Secretary-General is also welcome. He welcomed the constructive dialogue between the leaders and made the point, mentioned in this debate, that the status quo, which is leading further away from a solution, is unacceptable. A settlement becomes harder with each day that passes without a solution. An increase in the frequency of talks is welcome, and the fact that they now take place twice a week is a sign of real progress, but it is also important to recognise the point made by the Secretary-General. He said that the need to rationalise the process to deliver results and bring negotiations to a successful conclusion is becoming more pressing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para11"><a name="09111058000087">Where can the results be seen? My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) mentioned the work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus. That is one of the lights in the darkness of the Cyprus problem. When I visited Cyprus last November, I saw the great progress that the scientists had made in that most welcome of bicommunal projects, and how hard they are working to ensure that the remains are identified and that families receive the truth that they need to enable reconciliation to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para12"><a name="09111058000088">However, the task is large. As the hon. Member for Hendon said, 2,200 Cypriots&#151;both Greek and Turkish&#151;are missing. The latest information is that 562 individuals have been exhumed, and 172 have been identified. It is a slow, difficult and painstaking task, but it is of absolute importance to achieve reconciliation and unity on the island. In political terms, we also need to see truth and reconciliation for the families; it is therefore important that information is passed on. Turkish authorities and the authorities in the north must recognise people&#146;s real concern about the remains that are to be found on military bases; we should ensure that access is provided  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Nov 2009">

<notus-date day="10" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>10 Nov 2009 : Column 36WH</b><br>
and that information is passed on. The many relatives who come to the House every July to campaign on behalf of their loved ones need to see the truth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para13"><a name="09111058000089">It is also important that there should be proper compliance with European Court of Human Rights rulings. Turkey should recognise the need for effective investigations, which goes beyond the work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus. It needs to carry out its own investigations and ensure that answers are given. That is a key element to building confidence. It is important that we reach a solution. It needs to happen for Cypriots, including my constituents, and for Cyprus itself. It is also important to secure regional stability. Turkey is interested in EU accession, but that can happen only if the Cyprus problem is solved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para14"><a name="09111058000090">Opinion surveys say that there is a great deal of pessimism among Cypriots and that it is increasing. It is increasing particularly among the younger generations, who have little knowledge of an undivided island. However, on the other side of the equation, opinion polls say that there is a wish and respect among people that the leaders should reach a settlement. The diaspora in my community also want to see a settlement. It is evident that they work and socialise together, and that they have the Cypriot identity and culture. That must be retained; it is part of the solution.</p>

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="09111058000091"><a name="91110h0006.htm_spnew6"><a name="09111058000174"><b>Mr. Love:</b>
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the air of pessimism evident in Cyprus could be turned around if only we could engage in confidence-building measures such as dealing with the missing people and opening a dialogue about the history of the conflict? If we were to do that, we could create the sort of atmosphere that would lead to more positive negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="09111058000092"><a name="91110h0006.htm_spnew7"><a name="09111058000175"><b>Mr. Burrowes:</b>
 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. On a cross-party basis, we very much share the concern that a solution should be reached for Cyprus. The amount of talking is increasing, but it is important that we see real confidence building. We talk about it a lot, but we need a real result. Confidence can come about only through dialogue and access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para15"><a name="09111058000093">I mentioned in an intervention that one important aspect of access is access to worship&#151;for those from Maronite villages, for example. It is extraordinary in this day and age that individuals cannot go to their own church to worship, but have to go through military zones, which are often restricted. It is important that measures are taken; if such matters are kept distinct from the other negotiations, real progress could be made. Over the next months, while the extra talks are in progress, we need to focus on aspects such as Maronite access and the missing persons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para16"><a name="09111058000094">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet said, we are remembering the fall of the Berlin wall. However, we still have a divided city in Cyprus; Nicosia is a city of great heritage, but it is impaired by the divisions that we see every day. Although the crossing has given us an opening, the city is at a great disadvantage and is scarred by division. We must ensure that, in 12 months, we return to celebrate a united city and a united island.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para17"><a name="09111058000095">When one considers the conflicts that are being dealt with by the United Nations, the Cyprus problem should not be seen as an irreconcilable conflict. It is important  <br>

that we recognise the need for sacrifice and compromise, but we also need proper integrity for the process that is based on the UN framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para18"><a name="09111058000096">Finally, the Economist Intelligence Unit says that the chances of Turkish and Greek Cypriots reaching a settlement are about 40 per cent. The reality is that that is a 40 per cent. greater chance of a settlement than there would be if talks were not taking place. We need to support those talks; it is the best option. The House should be 100 per cent. committed to seeking a solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>

 I had not intended to speak today, Mr. Olner, but as we have a modicum of time before you call the Front-Bench spokesmen, I wish to raise one or two important issues. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para19"><a name="09111058000098">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on his most comprehensive survey of the situation in Cyprus, based on his recent visit to the island. I join the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) and for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) in saying how appropriate it is that we should be debating the subject during the week when the international community is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the ending of the division of Berlin. However, we in the European Union still have a divided capital in Nicosia. The international community should focus more on what needs to be done to end the long-standing division of the island of Cyprus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para20"><a name="09111058000099">The Berlin wall was erected in 1963 after a long period of turbulence. That was when we saw the first divisions in the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot community in Nicosia. Both problems date back a long way. If we had the time, I suspect that we could debate for a significant period the opportunities over the years to find a resolution, many of them missed. I think of the high-level agreements of 1977 and 1979, when there was a real air of optimism that a solution could be found; I think also of the 1980s and 1990s, and even the present decade, and the opportunities that have been missed because of the failure of all concerned. I think particularly of the failure of the international community to give the problem the prominence and effort needed to find a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para21"><a name="09111058000100">That brings me to the role of the United Nations, which has been critical to all developments in Cyprus since 1974. It has conducted various negotiations which reached various stages. Indeed, it was successful in bringing together a plan that was put to both communities&#151;the so-called Annan plan. I do not want to rehearse everything, but simply to recognise that the UN has done a great deal and that it understands the critical issues involved. However, I am here today because I would like to see it do more; confidence-building measures are necessary if we are to create the atmosphere in which negotiations could be successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para22"><a name="09111058000101">There are many ongoing joint initiatives. Work is under way to address the long-standing issue of missing people, which goes back to 1974 and before. I welcome all such initiatives, but more needs to be done. For years we have talked about taking an initiative on Famagusta and on various other issues related to airports. Although I recognise that the situation on the island has changed remarkably and that progress has been made&#151;the green  <br>

line has been opened up and there is more interchange between the two communities&#151;we must do even more. The United Nations has a big role to play in creating an atmosphere in which negotiations can take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para23"><a name="09111058000102">Historically, the European Union has not had a central role in finding a solution in Cyprus, but Cyprus is now a member of the EU. Given that the EU recognises the continued division of one of its member countries, it must take on an important role. Such an issue, however, is tied up with the negotiations for Turkey, and I will not go into the Ankara protocol now, except to say that the EU must find some movement. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, there was a period when its ports were open to Cyprus shipping, so it is not impossible for such a thing to happen again. The European Union has a critical role to play in facilitating a solution. It may be that, in the future, it plays a role as a guarantor. It is a guarantor for democracy and for all sorts of human rights and the rule of law. Perhaps it could play a more prominent role as a guarantor of the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para24"><a name="09111058000103">That brings me to the guarantor powers themselves, namely Britain, Greece and Turkey. The guarantor powers have not played as central a role as they should. Although I accept the comments made by George Papandreou that perhaps Cyprus should be moving away from its connection with Greece and Turkey, that can only happen if both those guarantor powers facilitate the process. It is only with their help and assistance that that could take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para25"><a name="09111058000104">Finally&#151;I hope that the Minister will take this on board&#151;the United Kingdom continues to be a guarantor power. Historically, we have a legacy of involvement in Cyprus. There is a large Cypriot community&#151;both Greek and Turkish&#151;living in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom must play a more prominent role in the current negotiations. I know that the European Union looks to the United Kingdom as the country that has been critically involved over the years. We must exercise more influence and do so in a way that will help to build confidence between the two communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="91110h0006.htm_para26"><a name="09111058000105">Finally&#151;</p>

 Mr. Olner, you said that I had until 11.55, so I will exercise my right to say &#147;finally&#148;. There is a lot of talk about a settlement being further away than ever, and the general attitude is very pessimistic. As has been said earlier in this debate, the two leaders of both communities are very much committed to a settlement. Progress is being made, although it is slow. It is for the international community, and particularly the guarantor powers, to give fresh impetus to the negotiations. If that can be done, we can turn around the negotiations and perhaps reach agreement on the final date&#151;it will be around May next year&#151;when we can look towards a settlement. However, without that impetus, progress will not be made at sufficient speed.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)  <br>

on giving such a comprehensive introduction to this debate. He outlined areas in which progress has been made, and managed to cover a whole range of issues in this complex case. It has been very helpful to hear the experiences of hon. Members, many of whom have visited Cyprus. Some have spoken with constituents who have a link with that country and others have heard first hand from individuals&#151;relatives of the missing and others&#151;about the difficulties that they face. I always think that mention of such experiences brings something to the debates that we have in this Chamber.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para0"><a name="09111058000109">The hon. Gentleman held an Adjournment debate on this issue on 15 January. Sadly, his cautious optimism then about the prospects for reunification now needs further qualification, and that is a great shame. However, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) made the point rather well when he said that talks are happening and that there is political will on both sides. Therefore, despite all the difficulties, we must welcome such an attitude and hope that it will lead us to a peaceful solution with equality and rights for both communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para1"><a name="09111058000110">I echo the comments made by many hon. Members about the timing of this debate. We are discussing a divided island and a divided capital in the week of the 20th anniversary celebrations of the fall of the Berlin wall, which I hope will inspire a renewal of efforts in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para2"><a name="09111058000111">Obviously, the clock is ticking. As many commentators have noted, the presidential elections in the north in April are likely to see nationalists elected, and that will clearly seriously damage the ongoing negotiations. Progress, so far, has been slow, but we have a window of opportunity at the moment with both Governments being pro-reunification. The fact that such a view is liable to end in a few months means that there must be a renewed sense of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para3"><a name="09111058000112">The consequences of no solution have been pointed out by the International Crisis Group, which says that failure to reach a settlement could result in slow economic progress, greater defence spending and reduced international credibility for the Republic of Cyprus, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Turkey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para4"><a name="09111058000113">David Hannay, the UK special representative for Cyprus from 1996 to 2003, has said that the prominent role played by those outside Cyprus may have had a detrimental effect, allowing Greek and Turkish Cypriots to blame outsiders for the failure of the talks. The Cypriots on both sides must own the negotiations at every stage, or they are bound to fail. That does not mean that outsiders have no role, but that their role should be discreet, and aim to persuade, not coerce, Greek and Turkish Cypriots.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para5"><a name="09111058000114">The hon. Member for Hendon mentioned the natural deadlines, which obviously include the December assessment of Turkey&#146;s EU accession. I am very much in favour of Turkey joining the EU, not least for the symbolism of accepting a Muslim country into what is still perceived as a Christian club. However, the possibility of Turkey&#146;s accession to the EU presents a very curious Catch-22 situation. On the one hand, the EU is unlikely to agree to admit Turkey until a settlement is reached on Cyprus, and on the other, Turkey is unlikely to support a settlement   <br>

that is acceptable to Greek Cypriots if it feels that the EU is not sufficiently progressing its application. In September, David Hannay wrote:</p>
<a name="91110h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="09111058000145"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;So long as there is breath in the body of Turkey&#146;s EU accession aspirations, there will be some hope for a Cyprus settlement.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para6"><a name="09111058000115">The EU has an important role to play here. As we have seen in other parts of Europe, such as the Balkans, the prospect of accession can be used as a very effective incentive and negotiating tool. I am not saying that the EU has necessarily always been right about the way in which it has used such a tool in the past, but it is something that can be used positively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para7"><a name="09111058000116">Turkey is often blamed for the lack of progress on the Cyprus issue. People say that Ankara has not pushed hard enough for peace, but that assertion is not entirely true. The Turkish Government, under Prime Minister Erdogan, campaigned for a yes vote in response to the Annan plan in 2004, whereas the Greek Cypriot Government, under President Papadopoulos, campaigned for a no vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para8"><a name="09111058000117">[Hywel Williams <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para9"><a name="09111058000118">Having said that, Turkey could do more to progress the negotiations on Cyprus, especially by implementing the Ankara protocol and opening all its ports to EU trade. Furthermore, there is no reason for maintaining such a huge number of Turkish troops in Cyprus and movement has to be made on reducing that number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para10"><a name="09111058000119">However, Turkish Cypriots obviously feel very disillusioned, having voted yes to the Annan plan. They continue to be very politically isolated and economically disadvantaged, their young people cannot take part in the national sporting or cultural events and they look across the green line to the Greek Cypriots who enjoy the full benefits of EU membership and who are flourishing economically and socially. Obviously, that situation leads to genuine grievances. On both sides, property issues have also been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para11"><a name="09111058000120">We have heard in this debate some ideas about the types of confidence-building measures that could be put forward to make progress. It is not for us in the UK to resolve all the difficult individual issues that are at stake, but we should be an honest broker and take a neutral position, supporting Cypriot solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para12"><a name="09111058000121">I want to raise another point of concern with the Minister, which has been raised with me by the Liberal Democrat Friends of Turkey group. It has expressed a concern among Turkish Cypriots in the UK about the Prime Minister&#146;s decision to meet President Christofias tomorrow. Tomorrow is also the first day of a High Court hearing of the controversial Orams property case and as the meeting between the Prime Minister and President Christofias is on the same day, it could be interpreted as Britain possibly taking sides in that case. Obviously, it is not for us to become involved in international law in this instance, but we should seek to appear neutral. I would welcome it if the Minister reassured Turkish Cypriots in the UK that the British Government are not taking sides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para13"><a name="09111058000122">I also encourage the Minister and the Government generally to meet representatives of both Cypriot communities in the UK, to help to build consensus and confidence.

Government have met a particular group of Labour-supporting Turkish Cypriots but they have perhaps not met representatives from the whole mainstream of Turkish Cypriots in the UK. So I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para14"><a name="09111058000123">I would also like to pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Hendon in the debate on Cyprus in January about the &#8364;50,000 donation for demining to the UN Mine Action Centre in Cyprus. That demining work is obviously an example of something that is very symbolic; not only does it help to demine the buffer zone but it helps to build confidence. I wonder whether we could have an update on how that money has been spent. Furthermore, given the &#8364;5 million shortfall that was referred to, is there any possibility of convincing other EU member states to give more money to that important fund?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para15"><a name="09111058000124">In conclusion, I concur with the conclusion of pretty much everyone who has spoken today that the longer it takes to reach a settlement in Cyprus, the more likely it is that the division of the island will become permanent. Obviously, a permanent division would have huge negative consequences for regional stability and economic development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para16"><a name="09111058000125">As a guarantor power with strong relationships in Cyprus, the UK ought to have a significant influence on the situation there, although that influence should obviously be exercised discreetly. We should also be using our voice in the EU and the UN to push for a redoubling of efforts to use this window of opportunity to create conditions whereby these talks about the future of Cyprus can succeed, bearing in mind the imminent natural deadlines that exist.</p>

 It is a pleasure, Mr. Williams, to serve under your chairmanship today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para17"><a name="09111058000127">I must begin by congratulating the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on securing this important debate on Cyprus. It is right that we should devote time to this subject today, so that we can discuss it at Westminster in some detail. The hon. Gentleman went into considerable detail in framing the debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para18"><a name="09111058000128">We have also had a number of other contributions, beginning with that of my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers). She has a long-standing interest in the issue of Cyprus, first, Mr. Williams, as you may know, as a Member of the European Parliament before coming to this place. She has continued that interest since becoming a Member of Parliament at Westminster. She knows a great deal about Cyprus and has visited the island on a number of occasions. Today, she raised the issue of missing persons and I hope that, when the Minister replies, he can speak in some detail about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para19"><a name="09111058000129">We also had a contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes). He has significant Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities in his constituency, as he alluded to in his contribution. Unsurprisingly, therefore, he has also taken a close and strong interest in this subject. He spoke in some detail about the challenges facing Cyprus and the need for a settlement. I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to his contribution, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para20"><a name="09111058000130">We then heard from the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love), who used the time available to him to maximum effect. He also pressed the Minister on the point that there is still an opportunity to achieve a settlement, which all of us present today would agree with. We hope that that opportunity will not be missed. We then heard from the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), who spoke for the Liberal Democrats. She gave a very balanced contribution in outlining the challenges that Cyprus faces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para21"><a name="09111058000131">I want to begin my contribution by pointing out that British-Cypriot relations go back many years. Indeed, it could be argued that they began with Richard the Lionheart in 1191, when he visited Cyprus en route to the Holy Land. He stopped off in Cyprus long enough to marry his wife Berengaria in the Byzantine St. George chapel in Limassol. Coming forward to today, Cyprus is now a fellow member of the Commonwealth, having attained its independence in 1960. It is also now an important trading partner and, of course, a member of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para22"><a name="09111058000132">Beyond that, we should not forget the thriving Cypriot community in the UK. For the first time, I believe, it has now produced a British-Cypriot MEP in Marina Yannakoudakis. I am sure she will continue to raise the Cyprus issue in the European Parliament with the same persistence that her predecessor in that Parliament, my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet, demonstrated before her. We are very pleased that she can now be a voice for Cyprus in the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para23"><a name="09111058000133">As we have heard, the talks aimed at resolving the division of Cyprus are ongoing, the current series having resumed in September 2008. It is with that in mind that I visited the island in April on behalf of my party, to see for myself the state of the negotiations and to try to familiarise myself with some of the issues at stake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para24"><a name="09111058000134">On that visit to Cyprus, I had the privilege of meeting President Christofias and the UN&#146;s Special Representative, Alexander Downer, who has worked so hard to get a dialogue going between the two communities. I also had the chance to meet the Turkish community&#146;s chief negotiator, Mr. Ozdil Nami. That visit taught me a lot about the issues involved&#151;not least their complexity&#151;and which must be addressed in trying to find a settlement to the dispute. I also learned about the special role that Britain has played historically in Cyprus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para25"><a name="09111058000135">The current state of the talks is that some progress has undoubtedly been made. For example, Mr. Downer is quoted in yesterday&#146;s edition of the <i>Financial Times</i> as saying that he is still &#147;cautiously optimistic&#148; about a settlement. He points out that President Christofias and Mr. Talat, the two leaders of the Cypriot communities, are meeting regularly and have discussed key issues, including power-sharing and property ownership in a future settlement. He is quoted as saying that, after almost 50 sessions of talks, the leaders</p>
<a name="91110h0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09111058000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;have made significant progress&#151;though not equal progress in all the chapters&#151;but they have agreed on an enormous number of things&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para26"><a name="09111058000136">That is how Mr. Downer characterises the state of progress to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para27"><a name="09111058000137">The areas where the most progress has been made include the economy and European Union responsibilities. They are generally seen as being the least contentious of the six negotiating chapters. However, the Cypriot leaders  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Nov 2009">

<notus-date day="10" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>10 Nov 2009 : Column 43WH</b><br>
have also discussed the governance and power-sharing chapter that dominated their talks earlier this year. The talks have now entered into the detail of what is perhaps their most contentious section, on property. A meeting took place on Monday between the two leaders, and another is scheduled for Thursday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para28"><a name="09111058000138">As we have seen, some progress has been made. There are signs of concern that both the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities are beginning to harden their positions. In fact, a recent opinion poll demonstrates that about 60 per cent. of the Greek Cypriot population still have some reservations about a potential solution. A recent opinion poll published in the Turkish Cypriot daily <i>Kibris</i> showed that about 78 per cent. of Turkish Cypriots would prefer two independent states, and obviously, only a smaller proportion would say yes again to the Annan plan if it were put back on the table. It is a worrying trend, as Mr. Talat, the Turkish Cypriot leader, will be facing elections within the Turkish  community in April. It could lead to a new leadership that is less committed to bringing about the reunification of the island.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para29"><a name="09111058000139">At present, therefore, there is still an opportunity to make progress in finding a solution that could lead to the reunification of the island, but both sides should be aware that delay at this point will not create an environment for the talks to succeed, and could in fact have the opposite effect. Unless further signs of flexibility appear, a valuable opportunity to reach a lasting settlement could be lost, a point made by hon. Members from all parties in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para30"><a name="09111058000140">I have said that Britain should do all that it can to work for a peaceful settlement. That also applies to the other guarantor powers. Turkey, for instance, has a role to play in achieving a solution, and it would be beneficial if it showed greater flexibility in its relations with Cyprus in order to facilitate that solution. In that context, it is an interesting coincidence that the progress of Turkey&#146;s accession to the EU is due to be evaluated at the EU&#146;s December Council. It would undoubtedly be a good sign of Turkey&#146;s intent to pursue its European vision if, as a candidate country, it could demonstrate good will towards its potential future EU colleague, Cyprus, by showing some flexibility aimed at bringing about a solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para31"><a name="09111058000141">I would like to raise with the Minister an additional issue relating to British people living in Cyprus. There have been numerous problems with British and other people investing money in properties in Cyprus and discovering later that the title deeds are either faulty or retained by a developer who may then re-mortgage the property without their knowledge. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office website acknowledges the problem, estimating that up to 100,000 properties owned by Britons, Cypriots and others may be affected by faulty title deeds. I believe that the Cypriot Government are trying to make progress on the problem, but given the number of British people caught up in it, has it been raised with the Cypriot Government directly? If so, can the British Government do anything further to facilitate a quick solution?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para32"><a name="09111058000142">This week, we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall, as a number of hon. Members have pointed out. It is a cause for dismay that there is still no solution to the division of Cyprus. We hope   <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 Nov 2009">

that one can still be achieved, perhaps even before the next British general election, whenever that might be. However, if a final agreement has not been reached by then, a potential Conservative Government are ready and willing to do what we can to help the people of Cyprus find a solution to that long-standing problem, subject of course to the realisation that the future of  the island rests primarily in the hands of the two communities themselves.</p>

 It is a delight to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams;  I think that it is the first time that I have done so. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on securing what he referred to as his annual debate. It is not annual, as it happens more than once a year; there was another Adjournment debate earlier this year that lasted only half an hour. However, I congratulate him on securing this one. The issue is important not only to the many Cypriots living in the United Kingdom, who, as many constituency Members have shown today, take a direct and specific interest in it, but in terms of securing justice and economic opportunity in a key area of the European Union. It is also important because of Britain&#146;s historic links with Cyprus, to which the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) alluded, although I sometimes think that talking too much about history in discussions about Cyprus is part of the problem, and that we need to talk less about history and more about the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para33"><a name="09111059000005">I also congratulate my hon. Friend on the enormous number of parliamentary questions to me that he has tabled, and I congratulate myself on how many answers we have provided him with.</p>

 I am sure that my hon. Friend does not, and that he will table another set of parliamentary questions on any issue about which he is not fully satisfied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para34"><a name="09111059000008">Several hon. Members have referred to the irony of our debating this issue during the week when Germany is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the tearing down of the Berlin wall and the beginning of the process of German reunification, which I think everybody here welcomes. Of course, at the time, there was anxiety in the UK and some parts of the then Government about whether reunification was a good idea. I merely note that in 1948, the British Labour Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, made it absolutely clear that the Labour Government were wholeheartedly in favour of a united Germany, just as we are entirely in favour of a united Cyprus. I think that those who argue for a two-state solution in Cyprus are going down the wrong route.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="91110h0007.htm_para35"><a name="09111059000009">First I will refer to some of the specific issues raised and then I shall move on to more general issues. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) referred to the Maronite community. Obviously, we take a particular interest in that community. It is not large, but it is significant and its linguistic and cultural heritage is important. I do not want to refer too much to history, but ever since the Maronites arrived 1,200 years ago from Lebanon, they have played an important part in Cypriot life. We as a Government supported the Council of Europe&#146;s 2008 resolution calling for</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para0"><a name="09111059000010">It is crucial to bear in mind that we are not talking about just two communities. We are talking about a wide diversity, and the more we can embrace that in the eventual solution, whatever it may be, the better. Obviously, it is essential that any final settlement should include the freedom to express and enjoy one&#146;s religion and to worship, a right guaranteed within the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para1"><a name="09111059000011">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) mentioned the importance of bicommunal links. Notwithstanding the point that I just made about the fact that there are more than two communities, he is right that it is vital to provide support for any confidence-building measures. We are keen to do so, and the British high commission wants to take every possible opportunity to do so. We continue to support financially the Committee on Missing Persons, about which I will say more later, through the European Union. We also support the UN mine action centre, and I will also say more about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para2"><a name="09111059000012">It was encouraging to see Elsi Christofias and Oya Talat speaking together at an event in Pyla. It is good that the chambers of commerce, and commerce and industry, co-operate across Cyprus. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, we are encouraged by the fact that the founder of easyJet is producing a bicommunal business initiative. In many ways, it is economic opportunity that will take us forward into the future, rather than leaving us languishing with the problems of the past.</p>

 One of the greatest confidence-building measures that the Minister could undertake would be to visit the island. Does he have any plans to do so?</p>

 I would not overestimate the value of my visiting anywhere, but I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s confidence. I intend to visit Cyprus at the end of the month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para3"><a name="09111059000015">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) asked whether I have met people who are on different sides of the argument. I do not take any side in the argument; I am on the side of those who want to see a settlement. I am happy to meet people from a wide range of views when I visit Cyprus. The Foreign Secretary would also like to visit Cyprus. We will play as significant a role as possible, but, to echo the hon. Member for Rayleigh, there must be a Cypriot settlement. Although we can encourage people to talk, enforcing a solution would be counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="09111059000016"><a name="91110h0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="09111059000173"><b>Mr. Francois:</b>
 Since the Turkish invasion in 1974, there have been a range of complex issues on the island. One confidence-building measure that encouraged both sides was the opening of the Ledra street crossing in Nicosia. Both sides acknowledged that as a positive development. Does the Minister agree that the opening of other crossings, particularly in the near future, would build confidence on both sides and encourage momentum?</p>

 The more that the two communities are able to commune, the better. For that to happen, people must be able to travel between the two communities. I shall reserve my view on how many crossings there should be until I have visited the island; the hon. Member for Rayleigh has the advantage over me on that point. As all hon. Members will acknowledge,  <br>

physically seeing and experiencing the situation is more significant than reading any number of articles, even in such illustrious a publication as the <i>Financial Times</i>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para4"><a name="09111059000018">The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) referred to missing persons. I lived in Argentina briefly in the 1980s. From speaking to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who are named after the big square where they used to demonstrate, I know of the profound feelings of loss that are multiplied by not knowing what might have happened to the person concerned. That can be enormously toxic not only for the individual, but for the body politic. The hon. Lady is right that this issue is one of the most important things to get right so that history can be closed before moving forward. We have long supported the Committee on Missing Persons and I will meet with representatives of it when I visit Cyprus. Of the 562 sets of remains that have been exhumed, the remains of 128 Greek Cypriots and 44 Turkish Cypriots have been identified and returned to their families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para5"><a name="09111059000019">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire referred to the Liberal Democrat Friends of Turkey. That is an abstruse group. She seemed to develop a certain paranoia&#151;not uncommon among Liberal Democrats&#151;about the Prime Minister meeting Mr. Christofias tomorrow. There is no connection between the dates. There is a legal process and a political process. We do not take a side in either, except that we are in favour of a settlement. I am glad that the Prime Minister will see Mr. Christofias tomorrow and I look forward to meeting him in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para6"><a name="09111059000020">The hon. Lady asked about the UN mine action centre. We were delighted to give &#8364;50,000 of bridging finance this year and are delighted that the EU has given a commitment on the issue. I am sure that all hon. Members would acknowledge the contribution that the action centre has made and the tragic loss of one of its members of staff last week. By demilitarising and demining the island, it is playing a vital part in the process of reaching a settlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para7"><a name="09111059000021">The hon. Member for Rayleigh mentioned UK residents in Cyprus and I hope to meet representatives when I arrive there. He is right that there is a significant property issue, as there is in Spain. Many people raised such issues with me when I visited Spain earlier this year. Yesterday, I met with the Spanish Minister with responsibility for the matter and we are trying to find solutions. The issue is complicated in Spain because different autonomous regions have different powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para8"><a name="09111059000022">The British high commissioner has raised the issue with the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Cyprus and we have received assurances that the Government intend to introduce a Bill to address future cases. The issue affects a large number of people, as is stated on the Foreign Office website to which the hon. Gentleman referred. When British people buy property in other countries, they may come up against property and land laws completely different from those in the UK. It is an important element of the Foreign Office&#146;s &#147;Know before you go&#148; campaign that we ensure that British citizens have as much information as possible before undertaking such property transactions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para9"><a name="09111059000023">Several hon. Members asked whether we should be optimistic. I confess to being a natural optimist, so I am optimistic about the situation in Cyprus. There are reasons to be cheerful: in Mr. Talat and Mr. Christofias, we have two leaders who are committed to negotiation,  <br>

and in Greece and Turkey, we have two Governments who are committed to a settlement. We can all point to issues on which individuals from those four parties have not implemented fully what we would have liked. However, we must take at face value that they are committed to a settlement. Regular meetings are going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para10"><a name="09111059000024">Why is this issue so important? First, there is  a natural interest for Britain as we approach the 50th anniversary of independence. Secondly, it will not be possible for Cyprus to achieve its full economic potential&#151;in both communities&#151;until a lasting settlement is accepted throughout the island. Not only tourism, but a range of industries, could move forward dramatically if there was a lasting settlement. Thirdly, security in the eastern Mediterranean can be enhanced for the EU and the region only if there is a settlement in Cyprus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para11"><a name="09111059000025">Several hon. Members have referred to Turkey&#146;s accession to the EU. I am a passionate supporter of Turkey&#146;s accession. I believe that it would be good for Turkey to enter the EU as a secular Islamic state, that it would enhance our energy security and that it will be the Asian tiger of the European economy in the next 25 years. However, it is inconceivable that it will accede until there is a full and lasting settlement in Cyprus. People argue against Turkey&#146;s accession for many reasons, not least on the basis of migration. However, I believe that we must pursue Turkey&#146;s accession and, at the same time, a full and lasting settlement in Cyprus.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para12"><a name="09111059000026">We believe that Turkey must comply with its commitment to implement fully the customs union. Last week in Ankara, the Foreign Secretary made it clear that we believe that the ports should be open. We believe that the UN resolution calling on Turkey to give back Varosha should be fulfilled. At the heart of the issue is the fact that political will is needed to make that happen. As in &#147;Othello&#148;, which was largely set in Cyprus&#151;</p>

 While preparing to speak in this debate, I was approached by several charities, lobbyists and politicians, who represent a wide range of opinion and interest in the subject. What unites them is a desire to see the issue of funding for rape crisis centres given the greatest possible prominence&#151;both for the public and the Government&#151;and although they may differ in opinion on the means, the end of achieving sustainable funding for rape crisis is the same for them all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para13"><a name="09111059000029">The way in which victims of rape and sexual assault are dealt with by the voluntary and statutory sector has a huge impact upon the victims themselves and upon the services and volunteers who support them. Every year, 3 million women across the UK experience incidents of rape, domestic violence, forced marriage, human trafficking or other forms of sexual violence. In financial terms, the cost of that is estimated to be around &#163;40 billion. Quantifying that huge figure is extremely difficult, but it is near impossible to measure the long-term impact of the horrific sexual crimes that many women, men and children are subjected to each year. Out of an estimated 80,000 annual incidents of rape, Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary believes that up to 95 per cent. go unreported. Of those that do get reported, there is an 80 per cent. attrition rate of victims from the criminal justice system. We in this place must continue to ask ourselves why that remains the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para14"><a name="09111059000030">In common with many people around the UK, in my Stourbridge constituency, people who wish to report a rape or a sexual assault must go to the police in the first instance. People reporting a sexual crime that has just happened almost inevitably require examination by a forensic medical examiner. For people in Stourbridge, that can mean a wait for a police car to take them on the journey of up to 20 miles to the Sandwell sexual assault referral centre&#151;SARC&#151;which is the closest one to Stourbridge. Alternatively, the person concerned has to remain in what is often a busy police station, where it is difficult to find the privacy that is particularly needed after a horrific crime such as rape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para15"><a name="09111059000031">The victim is then treated as forensically hot, which often means they are unable to wash or drink, and sometimes they have to sit on blotting paper to preserve evidence of the assault. There is usually a protracted wait to see a doctor and, bearing in mind that 99 per cent. of sexual crimes are committed by men, it is possible that women victims of sexual assault may not be able to see a female doctor at all. That is particularly the case in the west midlands, where 85 per cent. of FMEs are male.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para16"><a name="09111059000032">The police officers who are involved in these cases are clearly managing the needs of victims of rape and sexual assault alongside their own immense work load. However, they are not necessarily mandated to have special training in how to deal sensitively with these victims. Through experience, many police officers are extremely adept at assisting people who find themselves the victim of rape, but it is not guaranteed that someone who is brave enough to come forward as a victim of a recent or historic sexual crime will have such a police officer dealing with their case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para17"><a name="09111059000033">Police officers do not always know that a victim of sexual crime can be told that they can have the assistance of one of the excellent, but all too rare independent sexual violence advisers&#151;ISVAs&#151;who provide victims and survivors with emotional support through counselling. They also provide practical support, such as by finding safe accommodation if it is needed, or assisting on the long route through the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para18"><a name="09111059000034">Inevitably, a victim&#146;s first encounter with the criminal justice system will be affected by the reception that they get. That in turn provides them with a perception of how the system will deal with their case and informs their decision and the further decisions they need to make about seeking an all too rare prosecution. Without specific training, it is possible that police might not have the skills, through no fault of their own, to recognise the particular sensitivity needed when assisting victims of rape at the initial stage. That is the case for people who have just been assaulted, as well as for people who may have been assaulted a long time ago, which requires a particular form of bravery to come forward and even more careful assistance as they enter the criminal justice process. The Home Office says that each rape costs &#163;76,000, but it is not uncommon for rape crisis centres in the west midlands to get just &#163;100 per victim in funding.</p>

 The hon. Lady is returning to the issue of funding and costs, which she mentioned at the start of her speech. We are fortunate in Croydon because we have a rape crisis centre, which has recently benefited from an additional grant of more than &#163;250,000 from the London Mayor. Croydon is unusual in that respect because there are really only two such centres in London. Does that not underline the need for additional resources, whether from Government, regional government or, indeed, some match funding from local government?</p>

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="09111059000036"><a name="91110h0008.htm_spnew7"><a name="09111059000178"><b>Lynda Waltho:</b>
 It does indeed. The matter is not just about one-off amounts of money, which are obviously very useful; it is about sustainability. Often people who should be counselling and supporting victims are filling in forms, chasing money and effectively finding their wages for the next year. Sustainability is the key to dealing with the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para19"><a name="09111059000037">In common with those around England and Wales, rape crisis centres in the west midlands face a constant struggle to achieve funding, whether from Government bodies or charities. Recently, in 2008-08, a rape crisis centre in the west midlands was given &#163;40,000 from the Home Office to provide services in that financial year. In 2009-10, as an emergency measure, similar to the previous year it was awarded &#163;50,000. However, to cope with an expanding work load, it had needed and had asked for nearly &#163;90,000. That could not be provided because funding had been capped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para20"><a name="09111059000038">When someone is accused of a sexual crime, from investigation to courtroom, funding is assured to see that the case is dealt with fairly. In comparison, funding for the provision of services to victims and survivors of sexual crime is not assured and varies by area. Of course, securing investigation and, where appropriate, conviction is in the public interest, but surely, the welfare of the victims of these horrific crimes is equally so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para21"><a name="09111059000039">What confidence can victims of sexual assault have in a system that offers them no guarantees about getting their case in front of a court? That problem speaks to an inherent distrust in people who make an allegation of rape or sexual assault. Demolishing that tendency requires institutional change, as does the process by which rape crisis centres, police, the health service and prosecutors work together to provide positive outcomes for victims of sexual crime. Local and national Government must take their place in limiting the bureaucracy imposed on rape and sexual violence support organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para22"><a name="09111059000040">This is a Herculean task, but we should not shirk from it. What would certainly make it easier is putting enough money into the process that victims go through to see their attackers brought to justice and ensuring that they are given help in recovering from the trauma of horrific attacks. The Rape Crisis network is the umbrella organisation for 38 groups in England and Wales that provide support to victims of rape and sexual assault. In doing so, they do an amazing job. The centres that are supported by the RCN have many things in common. They work tirelessly to support victims of sexual crimes, they rely on the good will of volunteers and they are under constant financial pressure to make ends meet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para23"><a name="09111059000041">Rape crisis centres and similar organisations form the backbone of support for victims of sexual crime. They support people who have had the bravery to come forward and ask for help after a traumatic experience. However, for the past two years they have been forced to apply for emergency funding because no sustainable funding exists to allow them to do their vital and admirable work. We all know of the pressures to reduce public sector spending, but we should increase funding for rape crisis centres, if possible. At the very least, we should sustain for a number of years the money that supports them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para24"><a name="09111059000042">When someone who has been sexually assaulted approaches the police, a doctor or a counsellor, they fear, among other things, a lack of dignity. But rape crisis centres that support them, such as Sandwell in my constituency and others like it, step in to help them through emotional trauma and through the criminal justice system, which is improving but could always do more. It is crucial that police, health care providers, prosecutors and rape and sexual violence organisations have enough confidence in each other&#146;s place in the system to give the assurance needed for victims of sexual assault to keep coming forward. That will happen only when rape crisis centres are recognised for their ability to support victims and survivors as well as for their skills in working, as part of the third sector, hand in hand with the statutory sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para25"><a name="09111059000043">I am sure that many who work across local government, the police, charities and health services to support victims of rape will welcome the Government&#146;s moves to improve the way that we handle this issue. There has been a 46 per cent. increase in convictions for rape since 1997, and the criminal justice system has been ever more responsive. There has been extra funding of &#163;1 million for rape crisis centres in the past 12 months, and there is now a team of advisers to help areas that do not have dedicated sexual assault referral centres to set one up. Those changes are all creditable and historic, because no previous Government have sought to provide them.   <br>

I hope that the Government will demonstrate how those groundbreaking measures can be extended to provide long-term, sustainable support for rape crisis centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para26"><a name="09111059000044">Sexual violence and assault can, among other things, strip victims of their dignity. The Government have gone a considerable way towards helping to restore it, but it is essential that they also dignify the organisations and professionals who support and care for rape victims with the sustainable funding that they need to continue their vital role, rather than commit them to a constant merry-go-round of short-term funding applications.</p>

 Let me begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho) on obtaining the debate and thereby allowing us to consider the serious and important issue of sexual violence. I pay tribute to the work of the third sector on sexual violence. Such organisations do vital work across the country to support those who have been subjected to what is one of the most horrible crimes. Rape and sexual violence involve violation of the most personal and intimate kind, and the situation is often made worse by the fact that the victim knows their attacker. The impact of those crimes can be devastating to victims and very difficult to deal with. Some people can and do recover, but many need or want support. Sometimes the impact emerges later&#151;in some cases, years later. As my hon. Friend has said, voluntary rape crisis organisations play a crucial role in providing a range of services such as counselling, therapeutic support and advocacy services. They work closely with victims, the majority of whom are women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="91110h0008.htm_para27"><a name="09111059000046">Far more rapes and incidents of sexual violence are not reported than are. British crime survey figures have indicated that only 15 per cent. of such crimes come to the attention of the police because so many victims do not tell anyone about their experiences. As my hon. Friend has acknowledged, however, there was a 50 per cent. increase in the number of convictions for rape in 2007 compared with the number in 1997. Reporting of rape has more than doubled since 1997. That increase is partly due to the systemic improvements that the Government have tried to make in the criminal justice system to facilitate victims of sexual violence and rape in feeling able to come forward to report to the police what has happened to them. In respect of sexual violence, improvements include the appointment of specialist officers and specialist rape prosecutors across the country, supported by much improved guidance and training for police, the Crown Prosecution Service and barristers. Other measures include supporting police forces in developing plans to improve the investigation of rapes, and ensuring that all forces are supported by a specialist team in implementing the plans.</p>

sexual violence advisers in 43 areas to provide advocacy and support for victims. My hon. Friend has talked about the excellent work that they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para1"><a name="09111059000048">This year, the Government conducted a wide-ranging consultation on violence against women, the responses to which will be published soon. My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General is working with the judiciary on cases in which defendants raise the issue of delayed reporting to undermine the credibility of complainants. They are working to ensure that juries are better advised and better able to understand the impact that the trauma of rape can have on victims and on their behaviour after the attack.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para2"><a name="09111059000049">As well as taking action specifically in relation to victims of sexual violence and sexual crime, the Government have taken general actions to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. Those actions have had a positive impact on the support that victims of sexual violence can obtain from the criminal justice system. I shall not argue that more could not be done or that we have turned the corner completely, because there is more to do. However, special measures are available to support vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, such as rape victims, in our courts so that they can give their best evidence in court without having to be next to the attacker or looked at by them. The victim personal statement can enable victims to have a voice in certain cases, such as where there has been a guilty plea. All that helps to ensure that the point of view of the person who has been attacked can be at the centre of the court&#146;s consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para3"><a name="09111059000050">I think that my hon. Friend requested this debate mainly to talk about funding the third sector, so I shall address her comments on that. The Government have done a lot on this issue. First, we have provided more than &#163;12 million of funding in the past five years, through the victims fund, for voluntary organisations that support victims of sexual violence. For a few years now, there has also been a special fund, as my hon. Friend noted, to top up the money that is available to support the work of the third sector on sexual violence. That is a &#163;1.6 million fund for members of the Survivors Trust and Rape Crisis to keep open local services for victims. As my hon. Friend rightly said, those charities provide invaluable support and specialist services such as counselling and advocacy to women and men who have been raped or who have experienced sexual violence. Another &#163;1.8 million has been invested in the current year for new and existing sexual assault referral centres, and there is a &#163;1.4 million fund for creating a national support team to bring together all the key agencies and to provide support to ensure that victims of sexual violence get the support they need in local areas to report crime. That helps to ensure that prosecutions succeed in greater numbers, where they are undertaken, and that those who rape and engage in sexual violence do not get away with it. Twelve million pounds of spending was provided over the five years prior to this year for specialist services for victims of sexual violence, and core funding was provided for Rape Crisis (England and Wales) and the Survivors Trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para4"><a name="09111059000051">We are looking at the issue of sustainability, which my hon.

in the sexual violence sector. We recently commissioned research and shared it with the stakeholder advisory group on sexual violence and abuse funding, a group on which officials from my Department and others and representatives of the sexual violence sector sit to look at how we can best sustain the work that those organisations do in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para5"><a name="09111059000052">One area we seek to address relates to cash. My hon. Friend said that many of the professionals and volunteers in the third sector organisations dealing with sexual violence spend too much of their time making applications for funding rather than continuing their work helping victims, so we are looking at trying to ensure that there is a more streamlined process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para6"><a name="09111059000053">We are looking at commissioning to see how that should be compact and compliant with equality duties, because one issue relating to the sustainability of funding for third sector organisations is that many local commissioners of services with mainstream budgets, some of which should clearly be used to support such voluntary organisations, have taken the view that those are too low down the list of priorities and, as they are women-only, do not comply with equality law. That is a misconception and incorrect, and it is something we need to educate local commissioners about more fully. We are looking at what more can be done on commissioning by those with mainstream budgets, whether in local authorities, health authorities or the criminal justice system, to ensure that it is properly understood that that part of the third sector should not be funded only by central Government from some central pot.</p>

 There is some central funding from the POPPY project, which comes largely through the Home Office, for those who have been trafficked into this country and subjected to sexual violence, so there is some specific funding aimed at helping those victims of sexual abuse who come to the attention of the authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para8"><a name="09111059000057">One of the issues with the sexual violence third sector is that it does not tend to be commissioned to provide services, as it would be perfectly possible for it to be, because those involved are specialists, such as those who deal with a particularly vulnerable part of society locally or local group. One of the strands of the work we are trying to do on sustainability is saying to local commissioners across public organisations that that area should not be ignore because it is covered elsewhere. It is an essential part of providing support for victims of crime and those who find it difficult to recover from their experiences.</p>

working together across those natural boundaries, which is always difficult but always a good thing to do, it ought to be possible to ensure better and more sustainable funding for those organisations that provide such vital services in many local areas. Indeed, one need visit only a few of those organisations to hear that referrals come from many statutory services but not necessarily with any money. The volunteers in those organisations are committed to their work, so they do not say, &#147;Oi, where&#146;s the money for these referrals?&#148; Instead, they get on with the job. We must find a way to ensure that money is attached to referrals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para10"><a name="09111059000059">We need to ensure that local services, whether local authorities or regional or local arms of central Government services, do not take the work that is done in those organisations as a free good that they do not have to pay for one way or another. I am convinced that the work we are doing should enable us, with good will on all sides and with a proper understanding across the statutory services of central and local government, to ensure that those organisations doing such vital work do not fall through the various gaps between the priorities of mainstream budget holders, because in many ways that is what has happened over the past few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para11"><a name="09111059000060">I want to say a few words about the Stern review, because several recent cases that have come to the public&#146;s attention illustrate that there is still a need to address head-on some of the myths, misperceptions and wrong attitudes surrounding the crime of rape. The Government are pressing forward with the agenda of trying to ensure that more is done to support better the victims of sexual violence. There is now a review into how rape complaints are handled, from when a rape is first disclosed until the court reaches a verdict. My hon. Friend gave some examples of the experiences that victims of sexual violence have immediately after what has been an extremely traumatic experience and a crime committed against them. One is not surprised that some of those women feel unable to report properly to the police what has happened to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para12"><a name="09111059000061">The review, led by Baroness Stern, will look in particular at how public authorities, including the police, local authorities, health providers, the Crown Prosecution Service and others, respond individually to rape complaints and interact with each other, as well as the attitudes of professionals to rape and evidence from the victims. It will take account of the emerging findings of the Department of Health task force on the health aspects of violence against women and girls, led by Professor Sir George Alberti, which is due to report early next year, and of the work done by Sara Payne, the victims&#146; champion.</p>

A subject that has been common to various meetings is the problems that are still encountered by many disabled people in accessing public transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para16"><a name="09111059000066">First, I should acknowledge that there has been some advance in accessibility for disabled people on public transport&#151;I believe we all recognise that&#151;and certainly things have improved with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, but it is obvious that there are still significant problems. It is not particularly easy to bring accessibility to transport quickly, but the situation is frustrating for disabled people. Mr. Simon Harris, who is in charge of DASH, and one of the other people who often raises this point, Mr. Allen Bergson, are appropriately forthright in trying to champion the cause of improving accessibility for the disabled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para17"><a name="09111059000067">I also acknowledge that in London, where my constituency is, we have Transport for London, and the Mayor and the Greater London authority have input. Although some of my comments will be about the UK generally, many of them will be directed by the experience in Hillingdon. However, they are relevant to many other areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para18"><a name="09111059000068">I shall not spend a great deal of time on the tube or the Overground, because it is evident to anyone who has any form of disability, particularly those who require a wheelchair, that the underground system is difficult to access.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="09111059000069"><a name="91110h0009.htm_spnew3"><a name="09111059000183"><b>Mr. Tom Clarke (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab):</b>
 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on introducing an extremely important debate, and I am grateful to him for giving way. One of my constituents who has a disability and uses a wheelchair lives on a bus route served by four different drivers. She said that three of them are excellent, but that the other one has told her more than once that she is a pest. Would the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a strong case for making disability awareness known to as many people as possible? I would not for one second disregard the importance of so many people in public life who are committed to a fair deal for disabled people, but perhaps we have to be a bit more robust in presenting a policy of awareness.</p>

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="09111059000070"><a name="91110h0009.htm_spnew4"><a name="09111059000184"><b>Mr. Randall:</b>
 I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that. I shall dwell on that theme later. It is one thing to pass laws and to talk about disability in this place and elsewhere, but we have to get through to the general public on a wider scale than we are doing at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para19"><a name="09111059000071">In my own case, having a disabled mother and, before he passed away, a disabled father, I suddenly became much more aware of the problems. Without drifting too much, too often one goes to a place and asks, &#147;Do you have accessibility for wheelchairs?&#148; and what we hear is, &#147;Yes, there are only three or four steps.&#148; There is still a mentality among many people, unless they have had to get a wheelchair in and out, that things are not as difficult as they actually are. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that access and fair treatment on any form of transport are important. He mentioned buses, which I shall discuss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para20"><a name="09111059000072">I do not want to be entirely negative. One positive thing that I have noticed over the years, going up and down on the underground and buses&#151;again, I am quoting from experience in London&#151;are the audiovisual announcements, particularly on the buses. Previously, it was sometimes difficult for a person to know where they were, even if they were fully sighted and able&#151;the bus could be crowded, or the windows could be misted up&#151;so they are an improvement for all passengers. But for those who have problems, they are vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para21"><a name="09111059000073">I believe that the Transport Committee recently produced a report on transport for the Olympics, and that it recommended that all transport should have such announcements. It is obvious that not just disabled people would benefit from them: they would be of benefit to locals and certainly will be important to the huge number of tourists who will come in. I would like that system to be extended to all buses throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para22"><a name="09111059000074">A problem with buses that I believe is probably common around the country is that many now have disabled space&#151;in effect, space for a wheelchair&#151;but it is limited, and those wheelchair spaces are sometimes taken up by other passengers, most obviously those with children&#146;s buggies or prams. I got a copy of a letter from TfL, which says that it encourages its drivers to ask people to move, but that they do not have powers to insist that people move. It is a matter of asking and trying to make people aware. Sometimes, the great British public are not as understanding as we would like them to be. Many people may have experienced this. People may be under pressure themselves&#151;it is not easy taking a buggy around with a lot of shopping, a kid screaming away and all the rest&#151;but we should try to ensure that space is available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para23"><a name="09111059000075">If the place on the bus is taken and a wheelchair cannot get in because there is no space&#151;this assumes that the ramp is working and so on&#151;the person has to wait for the next bus, and the next one if that one has no space. Interestingly, I noticed that a local person recently had an out-of-court settlement from a bus operating company&#151;I believe they got &#163;1,000&#151;because they could not access four consecutive buses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para24"><a name="09111059000076">For most of us, that situation rarely occurs, although sometimes a bus is too full and it speeds past, but for a disabled person sitting in a wheelchair and trying to get on a bus, it must be problematic. Again, I am speaking about London, where the bus services are quite regular. I would imagine that elsewhere this could be a real problem if the next bus is not for half an hour or so. These are problems for disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para25"><a name="09111059000077">As I said in response to the intervention by the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke), the public are sometimes surprisingly  <br>

unsympathetic to the needs of disabled people. As Members of this House, we are very much aware of them because people come to us with their concerns. There are awareness campaigns and courses for bus drivers, and most drivers are helpful, but unfortunately, as with most things, there will be one or two who are not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para26"><a name="09111059000078">Something that never occurred to me until it was pointed out, when it became obvious, is the problem at request stops for those who are visually impaired. We take things for granted&#151;we see a bus coming along, we see the number on it and we stick our hand out to stop it&#151;but that is a problem for someone who has problems with their sight. I do not think that we appreciate quite how difficult that is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para27"><a name="09111059000079">The Government&#146;s statutory advisory committee, the disabled persons transport advisory committee, has found that although disabled people travel a third less often than non-disabled people, they have a greater reliance on the bus services. That committee produced figures showing that, within the disability community, blind and partially sighted people use buses significantly more than other disabled people, with 50 per cent. taking the bus at least once a month compared with 43 per cent. of other disabled people. That is why request stops and announcements are so important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para28"><a name="09111059000080">We forget that the black cabs are a form of public transport. Disabled people can find them useful in getting from A to B, but one obvious problem is the expense. Mr. Allen Bergson, whom I mentioned earlier, told me about the real problems and how, in many cases, it is cheaper to fly to Spain and back than to get a black cab. For example, Mr. Bergson lives in Hillingdon and it cost him &#163;80.11 one way to go to the National hospital in Holborn for some drug trials. Without being too intelligent I can work out what the return trip would cost. Booking fees and credit card charges lead to a black cab costing more for disabled people than for able-bodied people because one with wheelchair facilities has to be booked. Although sometimes they can flag one down, the chances are that the first one that comes along may not be accessible. So the cost of what we might think is a relatively easy journey becomes hugely problematic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para29"><a name="09111059000081">In providing accessibility for people with disabilities, we want to try to enable them to lead as normal a life as possible, getting out and enjoying things and getting on with work. Work is another big problem, because transport is not that easy for disabled people to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="91110h0009.htm_para30"><a name="09111059000082">At our DASH meetings we have endless discussions about Dial-a-ride, which provides a useful service but also leads to many complaints. It is a patchy service. People from Dial-a-ride come along to the meetings to try to explain what is going on. There is so much frustration. For example, people can book an outward trip but are unable to book the return journey, which makes the whole thing pointless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para0"><a name="09111059000083">Having mentioned some of the obvious problems, I should like to mention that, having been granted this debate, I was approached by the British Lung Foundation, which wanted me to raise the problem of charges for oxygen on airlines. Although I told them that this debate was about public transport, that is still a problem. It may be something for another day, but I should just like to flag it for the Minister and say that that is just another problem that people face. There are other examples  <br>

in respect of airlines, including some not always being as sympathetic to wheelchair users as others. We should be concentrating on such things to try to let our constituents with disabilities enjoy as full a life as possible on as equal terms with ourselves as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para1"><a name="09111059000084">I should like to bring to right hon. Members&#146; attention the report on the findings of Trailblazers, which I am sure the Minister has seen, which involved 1,000 young people from the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, who became, as I would say from my retail experience, mystery shoppers, trying to see how easy it was to do things on the transport systems. Those findings are all pretty obvious, but perhaps we should highlight the fact that disabled passengers often feel like second-class citizens and that they cannot, as I have mentioned already, always access the first bus, train or taxi. The assisted passenger registration service on the trains needs 24-hour advance booking, making the possibilities for more flexible travel&#151;suddenly wanting to go somewhere on a train, for example&#151;much more difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para2"><a name="09111059000085">These are all problems that people face. As I said at the beginning, I acknowledge that things are and have been improving. Goodness knows that any of us could, and probably will, suddenly find ourselves with some disability. Although we can say that advances are being made, there is a need for urgency in respect of provision for disabled people, because their quality of life could be improved by improving disability facilities on public transport, and that would make a huge difference to them. As we come up to the Olympics and, more importantly, the Paralympics, we have a wonderful opportunity, all round the country, to ensure that we have some of the best public transport accessible to disabled people.</p>

 It is a pleasure for me, too, to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams. It is also my maiden voyage with you in the Chair and I hope that I do as good a job as the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall). I congratulate him on securing this debate on an important matter: access to transport by disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para3"><a name="09111059000087">On a personal note, I say to the hon.

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para4"><a name="09111059000088">The Department for Transport is committed to ensuring that we have an increasingly accessible transport system that works for everyone. Indeed, one of the Department&#146;s five goals is to promote greater equality of opportunity for all citizens to achieve a fairer society. This morning I addressed a disability conference at Sadler&#146;s Wells, where we discussed many of the issues that the hon. Gentleman touched on. The conference is going on as we speak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para5"><a name="09111059000089">The hon. Gentleman was correct to draw attention to the fact that many of us may be disabled one day. He mentioned his mum and his father. There are more than 10 million disabled people in the country and, with an increasingly ageing population, transport has a key role to play in delivering on many of the Government&#146;s social policies. For example, transport helps enable  <br>

people to access employment and services and to meet their friends and family; in other words, it helps them to lead independent lives. Nowhere is this more important than in the lives of disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para6"><a name="09111059000090">We will of course continue to meet the requirements of existing and planned legislation. The Equality Bill, which is currently passing through the House and will shortly reach Report stage, will streamline and bring together in one place much of our equality legislation. Existing provisions in the 1995 legislation covering the transport needs of disabled people will be included in the Bill. Not only will the Bill include the existing provisions; there is a plan for it to include new ones aimed at making taxis more accessible. I know that the House divided on the Bill on Second Reading, but I hope that colleagues will reflect and will support its passage when it returns to our House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para7"><a name="09111059000091">All new buses and trains have to be accessible, including to wheelchair passengers, and we have set end dates by which all buses and trains have to meet our accessibility standards. We have made good progress in recent years. So far, 46 per cent. of rail vehicles and 62 per cent. of the national bus fleet comply with the regulations. In fact, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that, as a consequence of the leadership shown since 2000, in London 100 per cent. of our buses are accessible. That shows what leadership can do.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="09111059000092"><a name="91110h0010.htm_spnew0"><a name="09111059000186"><b>Mr. Randall:</b>
 Of course, we acknowledge that that is a wonderful achievement. However, as I said earlier, one problem is that it is not just about vehicles being accessible; it is about ensuring that they are truly accessible in the sense that people can get on them, and about awareness.</p>

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="09111059000093"><a name="91110h0010.htm_spnew1"><a name="09111059000187"><b>Mr. Khan:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman is right. Getting to the bus stop or the platform is often the biggest challenge, and I recognise that there is still some way to go on this. It is not just about making buses and trains accessible. There is no point in having a new, accessible bus if people cannot get to the bus stop or board the bus. The end-to-end journey is what matters, and if there is a weak link the individual will not make the journey by public transport or, worse, will not make it at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para8"><a name="09111059000094">I welcomed the intervention from my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke). He knows from his own experience of moving private Member&#146;s Bills and his long time in Parliament the huge impact that small decisions by bus drivers or bus operating companies may have on the quality of life of people throughout the country. That is why we decided to invest in the access for all programme in 2006, with &#163;370 million ring-fenced until 2015 to make stations accessible for those with reduced mobility or who are disabled. Work has been completed at 30 stations, and a &#163;6 million small schemes fund is available each year for innovative and locally focused solutions to deal with access problems at stations. More than 1,000 stations have benefited from those innovations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para9"><a name="09111059000095">Although we understand that disabled people want improvements immediately, we must strike a balance between their needs and the operating constraints of the transport industries. Our largely Victorian railway system poses a challenge in providing 100 per cent. accessibility, so we must identify where we can achieve the most benefits from our investment, not just for disabled people but for all passengers, including older people and parents with babies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para10"><a name="09111059000096">The hon. Gentleman touched on an important point about finite places, and tension between mums and dads with buggies and people whose only form of moving about is in a wheelchair. He will be aware that legislation is in place to ensure that bus drivers and others understand the priorities if, for example, those with buggies do not understand, appreciate, empathise with or give space to those in wheelchairs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para11"><a name="09111059000097">In his excellent speech, the hon. Gentleman touched on the role of taxis, which are an important link in the transport chain. We have recently consulted on accessible taxis, driver duties to disabled people, and training. I announced recently that the Department intends to make regulations to impose a duty on drivers of accessible taxis, as well as private hire vehicles, to assist disabled passengers into and out of the vehicle, and to transport them in safety and comfort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para12"><a name="09111059000098">The Department will also invite bids from local authorities to participate in demonstration schemes or pilots to assess disabled people&#146;s needs and how to match the taxi fleet to those needs. He also touched on the Trailblazers report. I had the benefit of meeting the group recently and receiving its report, and as a result of the impression that it made on me, I have actioned a number of points. I will write to the hon. Gentleman to let him know exactly what I have done, because I know that he has a huge interest not only in DASH&#151;Decent and Safe Homes&#151;but in other such organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para13"><a name="09111059000099">We must think not only about local journeys. Disabled people should be able to travel further afield just like the rest of us, and to enjoy holidays wherever they want. We continue to monitor compliance with the European regulation that came into force in July 2008 on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air. We are also involved in negotiations on the European Commission&#146;s proposals, which were published in December 2008, for new regulations, including rights for disabled people and passengers with reduced mobility using maritime transport and international bus and coach services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para14"><a name="09111059000100">The issue is not just about physical access. We know from our research and as highlighted by Trailblazers and other groups for disabled people that other barriers prevent people from taking advantage of the improvements that have been made to the transport system, not least the attitude of operating staff. Since 2002, we have had regulations in place that make it unlawful for transport operating staff to disregard the needs of disabled passengers, including wheelchair users. For many operators, disability awareness training is now an integral part of staff training, but we must do more, and we are working with GoSkills on how awareness training can be incorporated into the certificate of professional competence for bus drivers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para15"><a name="09111059000101">The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that not only does Trailblazers have a mystery customer remit, but Passenger Focus will extend its empire from rail to bus. I have had a mystery tour around the country using buses, and he is right in saying that bus drivers can do simple things, such as parking the vehicle next to the pavement, using their mirrors to ensure that older or disabled people have sat down before moving off, braking gently, and other things to improve the quality of life for disabled commuters when getting on and off buses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para16"><a name="09111059000102">We recommend that both front-line and management staff are trained and that their skills are regularly updated. Last year, the Department&#146;s advisory body, DPTAC&#151;the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee&#151;published a training framework for use by those preparing and running courses. The Olympics&#151;this will please the hon. Gentleman, as a London MP&#151;will provide the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of that training when many disabled people come to London for the games. Crossrail will also ensure that all the facilities that it provides will be accessible to disabled people. Security and fear of crime are also barriers for many people, including disabled people. We remain committed to reducing crime, fear of crime and antisocial behaviour wherever it occurs on the transport system. The Department&#146;s secure stations programme is contributing to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para17"><a name="09111059000103">Another point raised by the hon. Gentleman was the need to know and to access information before making a journey. Later this year, the Association of Train Operating Companies will launch a new station journey planning website, and my Department has contributed &#163;500,000 towards that. The site will include access information for every station in the country. Transportdirect.info is the Department&#146;s website and offers free information for door-to-door, multi-modal travel around Britain. We are considering how to include more information on accessibility, and how real-time information can be provided direct to disabled passengers. In Reading, such information can be sent to a mobile phone; that will improve the quality of life for many people about whom the hon. Gentleman and I care passionately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para18"><a name="09111059000104">The hon. Gentleman referred to the cost of transport. Last year we extended the concessionary fares scheme to allow disabled people to travel free on off-peak buses anywhere in England. In addition, half fare discounts are available on coaches, and the disabled person&#146;s railcard offers one third off many rail tickets. To illustrate the scale, the &#163;1 billion for the concessionary bus fares scheme enables 11 million people in England to have access to free buses after 9.30 am and before 11 pm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para19"><a name="09111059000105">For those who cannot use public transport or do not have access to a car, community transport remains an important means of mobility, so we are encouraging collaboration with third-sector organisations, particularly in community transport solutions. Those organisations and local authorities have a critical role in targeting resources at local authorities&#146; needs. The Local Transport Act 2008 removes some of the restrictions on vehicles used for community transport, and allows drivers with section 22 permits to be paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para20"><a name="09111059000106">Delivering improved accessibility does not rest only with the Department for Transport. I accept that we must work in partnership with operators, manufacturers, delivery agents such as local authorities, and disabled people. Many accessibility barriers need local solutions, which is why we have introduced accessibility planning into the local transport planning process to allow a clearer and more systematic approach to ensuring that the needs of vulnerable groups in accessing jobs and key services are considered. We must not forget, for example, how important the pedestrian environment is for getting about. We are evaluating the accessibility planning process to see how that is working in practice.</p>

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="09111059000108"><a name="91110h0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="09111059000188"><b>Ms Gisela Stuart (Birmingham, Edgbaston) (Lab):</b>
 I had better start with an apology, because it is actually the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine. That error is entirely my fault. I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to speak about the work done by military and NHS clinical staff at the centre at Selly Oak hospital. Over the years, the centre has been mentioned in Parliament&#151;usually in response to ill informed comments, which have not always been confined to the press. I want to put on the record the centre&#146;s achievement, in its entirety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para22"><a name="09111059000109">The centre was formally opened by Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal in 2001. A year later, in 2002, it was given approval by Her Majesty the Queen and could use the title &#147;Royal&#148;. It was fitting that the Princess Royal performed the opening ceremony, as her husband, now Vice-Admiral Timothy Laurence, wrote the original Ministry of Defence report advocating the creation of the centre for defence medicine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para23"><a name="09111059000110">The first RCDM staff arrived at University Hospitals Birmingham in September 2000, when seven nurses joined the accident and emergency department. They have since been joined by almost 600 doctors, nurses, therapists and support staff, who work throughout the trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para24"><a name="09111059000111">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones) for allowing me to trespass slightly on her territory. I hope that I can justify that on two grounds. Incidentally, I am glad to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) is also present. The first ground is that the trust very much covers the south of Birmingham. The other excuse, which is probably much more important, is that I was in the Department of Health when the decision was made to restructure the way in which medical care was delivered to our armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para25"><a name="09111059000112">Setting up the centre was not uncontroversial. I remember participating in Adjournment debates that made me extremely unpopular in places such as Gosport. Military medicine has extra dimensions beyond the usual care for patients. Military commanders need advice on how to maintain the health of their troops and how to deal with injuries suffered on or away from the battlefield. They usually operate in extreme conditions&#151;extreme in terms of climate, terrain and personal security. Just to complicate things, there are tropical diseases and wound contamination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para26"><a name="09111059000113">There is now agreement that free-standing dedicated military hospitals cannot provide the best clinical care. Much of the criticism in the past was based on the mistaken assumption that unless there were dedicated hospitals and wards for servicemen, they would receive second-rate treatment. The opposite is true: what matters is the appropriate setting and clinically optimal care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para27"><a name="09111059000114">The British Medical Association, in response to today&#146;s debate, stated that</p>
<a name="91110h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="09111059000158"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;whilst the desire to build a separate, military hospital is understandable, the practicalities of providing up to date expert clinical care by well trained staff working in acute hospitals make this impractical as a solution&#148;.</p>

patients, using the best that the NHS has available but ensuring that the care is given in an environment with the appropriate military ethos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para29"><a name="09111059000116">I should like to remind the press and the media that they, too, have a responsibility, which goes beyond their daily circulation figures. Of course when things go wrong, they need to be highlighted. I am glad to say that most recently the press and the string of visiting politicians have acknowledged the excellent work done at Selly Oak, but some may wish to look back and reflect on some of the things that they have said and written in years gone by. Sad to say, we still get stories, such as that in <i>T</i><i>he Sun</i> on 24 September, that are simply factually inaccurate. They fail to understand that counting &#147;military beds&#148; tells us little. Misrepresentations of that type damage the morale of recovering injured soldiers and clinical staff, and morale is a component of fighting power. Stories such as those worry troops, staff and families alike.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para30"><a name="09111059000117">The Defence Medical Services is the collective term for some 6,500 trained regular uniformed medical personnel from the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air force. The hospital treatment of armed forces personnel is carried out through the use of NHS facilities under partnership arrangements. The Defence Medical Services staff are grouped into five MOD hospital units across the country. I am referring to Derriford, Frimley Park, Peterborough, Portsmouth and Northallerton, plus the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine. On average, the total number of military in-patients in NHS hospitals across the UK, for all illnesses and injuries, is about 60 to 75 personnel, although the numbers fluctuate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para31"><a name="09111059000118">The Healthcare Commission, which checks health services in England, reviewed Defence Medical Services earlier this year and found that rehabilitation services were &#147;excellent&#148; and that the system of regular reviews of best practice in trauma and rehabilitation services meant that care was &#147;continuously improving and innovating&#148;. Patient diaries, kept for personnel recovering from injury in hospital to help with short-term memory loss, were described as &#147;innovative&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para32"><a name="09111059000119">Most recently, the excellent work done by the RCDM, led by Brigadier Chris Parker, was recognised at the military and civilian health partnership awards in Edinburgh in November 2009. Moira Kane, from 202 field hospital, Birmingham, won the deployed health care award for her work as a senior nurse in the emergency department at Camp Bastion. Dr. Heidi Doughty, also from 202 field hospital, who is a colonel in the Territorial Army, won the reservist of the year award for her pioneering work on improving blood platelet donation by soldiers to injured colleagues. The ortho-plastic team at Selly Oak, led by Professor Keith Porter, won the team of the year award. Those who watched the BBC documentary &#147;Wounded&#148;, which followed the treatment of two seriously injured soldiers, will be familiar with the team&#146;s work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="91110h0010.htm_para33"><a name="09111059000120">Having been critical of the press, I can pay tribute to the Birmingham newspapers; the <i>Birmingham Mail </i>and <i>The Birmingham Post</i> have always been fair to the centre, acknowledged its achievements and drawn it to the public&#146;s attention.</p>

He has deployed frequently, recently in Afghanistan. In preparing for the debate, I asked where he is now and was told that he has just come  <br>

back. While in Afghanistan, he was the medical director of the field hospital in Camp Bastion. I am also told that during that time, the Danish provided half the staff for the hospital, with a quarter being British and a quarter American; apparently, Tim learned Danish before he was deployed. I mention all that because when talking about Afghanistan, we tend to think only in terms of the British troops. However, the contributions from other troops and how regularly we work with them are often not mentioned enough or underestimated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para2"><a name="09111059000123">and their wounds, like all war wounds throughout history, are likely to be heavily contaminated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para3"><a name="09111059000124">A study soon to be published examines the period from 2006 to 2008 and estimates that there have been more than 40 &#147;unexpected survivors&#148;, with the figure expected to rise. Unexpected survival or extreme recovery is largely due to three things. The first is rapid treatment on the ground in what is referred to as the &#147;platinum&#148; 10 minutes; by applying tourniquets or staunching blood with clotting powder, catastrophic haemorrhaging is avoided. The second factor is the rapid evacuation of the injured by medical emergency response teams using Chinook helicopters manned by a consultant, nurse and paramedic who are highly skilled in trauma care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para4"><a name="09111059000125">Thirdly, those whose combat injuries require even more specialist treatment are brought into Selly Oak. There are weekly case conferences between UK and Camp Bastion staff. Once in Birmingham, the injured have access to a hospital with more than 1,250 beds, 43 specialties, 30 operating theatres and 76 critical care beds&#151;that number will increase to 100 when the new hospital opens next year. Only last week, some of the soldiers injured in the shooting involving the Afghan national police force were flown into Birmingham International airport for transfer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para6"><a name="09111059000127">Incidentally, the skills and expertise acquired at Selly Oak when treating battle casualties and non-combat injuries ultimately benefit all patients treated in the NHS. Military care, medical care and support care, with the services and their families, come together at Selly Oak. When the injured arrive, their families are informed and cared for by the Defence Medical Welfare Service, with the support of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association. Families can be accommodated in specially designed flats, which are literally across the road from the hospital. Too often, we deal with extremely complex medical cases, but there are also very complex family situations.</p>

However, I would like to point out that in Selly Wick road, SSAFA has a home from home where family members can come so that they are close to their loved ones.</p>

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="09111059000129"><a name="91110h0011.htm_spnew1"><a name="09111059000190"><b>Ms Stuart:</b>
 I have seen the photographs of the accommodation provided there by the local SSAFA, which works really well with the military services. Despite the initial horror of the news that families receive, we do give them the best care and support once they are brought to Selly Oak. In that respect, families who are in a difficult situation are not helped when certain sectors of the press exploit people&#146;s vulnerability for their own purposes, rather than to get the best services for our servicemen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para7"><a name="09111059000130">We could not do what we do without the support of charities. Governments have always worked with charities, but the co-operation is more profound on this issue than on any other. There are established charities, such as the Army Benevolent Fund and the Royal British Legion&#151;today is, of course, the day before Armistice day, and we are all wearing poppies. However, there are also more recent charities, such as Help for Heroes, whose multicoloured wristbands have captured the imagination of a whole new generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para8"><a name="09111059000131">In last week&#146;s edition of <i>The House Magazine</i>, of which, I confess, I am the editor, the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)&#151;unfortunately, he cannot be here today, although I told him that I would mention him&#151;recounts meeting Stephen Vause, who had been injured in Basra while serving with the 4th Battalion the Rifles. That encounter in Selly Oak, and the awareness that we need much more support for the rehabilitation of our servicemen, eventually led to the creation of Help for Heroes. The charity is now one of the most successful of modern times and has raised more than &#163;32 million in just two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para9"><a name="09111059000132">There is a covenant between the Government and our servicemen, which makes it clear that we should look after our servicemen for as long as necessary. The defence medical rehabilitation centre at Headley Court in Surrey provides an excellent service. It has a staff of more than 300, including rehabilitation specialists from all sectors. Together with Help for Heroes, it will deliver a new rehabilitation complex, including a state-of-the-art swimming pool and a new gym.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para10"><a name="09111059000133">That brings me to my real question to the Minister. We have immensely improved the way in which we care for our injured servicemen&#151;the survival rates would not have seemed possible five years ago&#151;but that means that cases require much more complex and much more long-term rehabilitation. I would therefore like the Minister&#146;s assurance that the effort that has gone into ensuring that our medical treatment is the best will also go into rehabilitation. That is a question not just of years, but, in some cases, of the rest of someone&#146;s life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para11"><a name="09111059000134">In that context, we have decided that servicemen and ex-servicemen should have priority when receiving NHS treatment. However, I am not convinced that our record-keeping is sufficient to allow us to identify those who should be given priority. In addition to wanting to know more about our plans for rehabilitation centres, therefore, I think that it would be helpful if the Minister had discussions with his colleagues at the Department  <br>

of Health. The bottom line is that we will achieve full recognition only when literally every GP in the country, on first encountering a patient, asks them whether they have ever been in the services. That will allow us to ensure that servicemen and women get the treatment that they deserve and which we owe them.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) on securing the debate. She has given me an opportunity to celebrate the success at Selly Oak and to say thank you to the military personnel and NHS staff who work there. She rightly mentioned service charities, and I would also like to put on record my thanks for the dedication shown by the staff at SSAFA and other organisations that have supported the families of patients at Selly Oak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para12"><a name="09111059000136">As my hon. Friend said, Selly Oak came in for some unwarranted criticism a few years ago. I was privileged to be a member of the Select Committee on Defence when it did a report on the Defence Medical Services. When I first visited Selly Oak and spoke to the chief executive, I asked her about some of the more salacious comments in the papers. She had tried to rebut a lot of them, but what disturbed and astounded me was that some of them were completely untrue, and it was sad that they had had an effect on some of the hard-working staff. If people are going to report on our injured, we should tell them, &#147;Please report the facts.&#148; One thing that we hear all the time is that people in Selly Oak are not allowed to wear uniforms. When visitors walk around the Selly Oak military managed ward, however, all they will see is military uniforms, so such claims could not be further from the truth. It is important that we treat our most severely wounded in that military context, because that is part of aiding them on the road to recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para13"><a name="09111059000137">My hon. Friend mentioned the wider work of the Defence Medical Services, and I want to put on record my thanks for the partnership working that takes place between the military and the NHS. She rightly noted that last year&#146;s Healthcare Commission report said that the service was exemplary and that its work in areas such as trauma care could be taken up in the NHS. That is the key point, and the Defence Medical Services and the Surgeon General certainly see the partnership approach as the way forward. A couple of weeks ago, I was pleased to be in Edinburgh for the second Defence Medical Services and NHS awards, where Chris Parker and his team were rightly recognised; that was well deserved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para14"><a name="09111059000138">Some people still argue that we should have stand-alone military hospitals, but the Defence Committee came to the conclusion&#151;most of the professionals I have spoken to have reiterated this&#151;that what we have now is better at providing clinical care and ensuring that we provide the best. We simply do not have sufficient numbers going through our military units&#151;last week, the figure was about 32 individuals, some of whom were in Selly Oak, while others were in other military managed units throughout the UK. People often mention the US, and somebody did so again yesterday when I was speaking at a conference, but we have to recognise that the US has a very different system. It has larger numbers of servicemen and it does not have the health service that we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para15"><a name="09111059000139">We should take pride in the work done at Selly Oak. Not only is it leading to the discovery of new techniques, but it is at the leading edge of research into dealing with some very complex injuries and, as my hon. Friend said, with infections that servicemen and women unfortunately pick up when they are in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para16"><a name="09111059000140">My hon. Friend rightly pointed to the pathway from the front line, and a key point is that embedding medics right on the front line is making a real difference to the use of tourniquets and so on. As a result, people have survived who would not have survived even a few years ago. My hon. Friend is right to describe that pathway, including the medical evacuation teams that take servicemen and women back to Camp Bastion. I have visited Camp Bastion a number of times and seen the tremendous work that NHS and military personnel do there. They not only assist servicemen and women with their wounds, but treat Afghan civilians, and I saw them treat some children who had been injured&#151;there is that role, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para17"><a name="09111059000141">I want to put on record my thanks to the aeromedical evacuation team at Lyneham. I visited members of the team last year, and they are remarkable individuals. They are on constant 24-hour call. They fly into Camp Bastion and bring back severely wounded patients. Dealing with somebody in a critical situation in hospital is difficult, but doing it at 30,000 feet, while flying back to this country for 10 hours, is quite remarkable. On one occasion earlier this year, the team brought back three patients whose conditions required intensive care. We therefore have to thank the team.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para18"><a name="09111059000142">The partnership at Selly Oak works. Patients are received at Birmingham airport, and I should put on record my thanks to the local ambulance service and the police, who make sure that the transition to Selly Oak is as smooth as possible. We have come a long way and can be proud of what we have achieved. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston for giving me an opportunity to talk about what I see as the next piece of the jigsaw, which is what happens next&#151;an issue that she raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para19"><a name="09111059000143">There are now some young servicemen and women who have had terrible wounds that a few years ago they would not have survived. I was at Headley Court last week. On such occasions I am always humbled by the strength of the individuals and their families and their determination to ensure that those life-changing experiences&#151;and many have horrible wounds&#151;will not set them back. We are also pushing at new frontiers of rehabilitation at Headley Court, with respect to prosthetics and technologies for new limbs. It is not an accident that the individuals concentrating on that work in the limb department are RAF technicians: they use the latest computer technology to provide some of the most up-to-date prosthetic limbs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para20"><a name="09111059000144">To return to my hon. Friend&#146;s key point: what next? I think that we are doing the best for those servicemen and women now, but the question that concerns us is what will happen to them in 10, 20 or 30 years&#146; time. That is the big test for Government and for society: how do we look after those people? I am passionate about getting that right, and that is why I am undertaking some work with the Surgeon General and others to see how we can establish a care pathway for them. I shall announce that early in the new year, and it will involve working with not only our NHS colleagues but service   <br>

charities. I should like to nail once and for all the idea that Government should do everything. I do not believe that. Partnership working with the likes of Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion is the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para21"><a name="09111059000145">The idea that I am pursuing is to put what I should call a welfare bubble around the people concerned. Once they leave the armed forces, if they do, and make the transition to civilian life, some will be able to go into work, and it is important that we should put in place training for them, and support from employers. A number of employers are willing to work with us, and we shall be doing that. My hon. Friend is right to say that it is important for local authorities to recognise the uniqueness of the individuals we are considering. That is why last week I was pleased to launch with Kent county council what I have called the welfare pathway. It is not rocket science: it is intended to make sure that when local authorities develop policies they think about veterans&#151;and although it is Kent in the present pilot, I remind hon. Members that I am looking for other councils to take part. Kent, for example, has a one-stop-shop gateway, which will ask the simple question, &#147;Have you ever served in our armed forces?&#148; Secondly, and importantly, the council has a champion for veterans&#151;someone who will be championing this approach. I hope to roll it out with other councils and with my counterpart in Scotland later in the year. The idea is to join up services to ensure that those responsible think about veterans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para22"><a name="09111059000146">The most severely wounded will have a separate pathway, and we need to make sure that we look after those people for life. My hon. Friend has made a key general point. I was very proud that the service personnel Command Paper, launched two years ago by the Secretary of State when he was Minister for the Armed Forces, did it right. It was the first piece of work in which we looked across Departments to see how we could make priorities for servicemen and women and veterans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para23"><a name="09111059000147">One relevant issue, as my hon. Friend mentioned, is priority access. Have we got that right? No; I do not think that we have. At a national level there is a very good buy-in, and I thank my colleagues at the Department of Health, who are pressing the case very hard. However, we need to work on how we get the GP or service provider, such as a mental health trust, to recognise veterans. That is why I had a meeting a couple of weeks ago about our hope to be able to track veterans, once they leave, through the NHS system, so that it will become second nature for a GP or hospital to ask someone whether they have been in Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para24"><a name="09111059000148">I do not want to take up time by making all my announcements in advance, but I want to mention another announcement that I shall make in the new year, about local advocacy. It is important that veterans and servicemen and women should locally have someone, or a group of individuals, who speak up on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para25"><a name="09111059000149">I think that we are in an exciting time, because if we can marry the best that we have in NHS medicine and military medicine at Selly Oak with rehabilitation, and achieve a joined-up approach at local level, we shall be able to achieve what I want, which is that when people leave the armed forces after serving their country they will get all the support they want. As my hon. Friend knows, some of the people concerned have very complex health care needs that will require looking after for life.   <br>

It is no good to expect them to be passed from pillar to post between different organisations. I am determined to make sure that there is a pathway for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para26"><a name="09111059000150">The public mood and the media are rightly concentrated on those who are severely wounded, but many individuals are injured every year through training accidents and other illnesses. It is important that they should also be taken care of, because although they may not have been injured at the height of battle, they were serving their country. The Surgeon General and I are determined that the approach should be joined up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para27"><a name="09111059000151">Next year there will be an exciting milestone for Selly Oak, which my hon. Friend mentioned: the opening of the new hospital, which will have a separate, military-managed wing. That will bring in the most modern facilities anywhere in this country or Europe, and will also embed together the relevant culture and working practices. The other side of the issue&#151;and it is something else that has been worked on at Selly Oak, and about which I am passionate&#151;is the fact that as well as dealing with the physical scars that we can see, we need to make sure that mental health services are in place to support those who are severely wounded, and in some cases their families, who suffer from the trauma. If we can get that right we can have a centre of excellence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para28"><a name="09111059000152">I know that the Surgeon General is very proud of another aspect of his vision: research. It is important that we press forward on that. Selly Oak is becoming not just a national but an international centre of excellence for defence medicine. Work being done with Birmingham  <br>

university, among others, can help that to grow, so that our centre of excellence will be not just for complex injuries but for everything from mental health to the work of military anaesthetists. That is becoming internationally recognised, with co-operation between us and the US.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para29"><a name="09111059000153">Another important aspect of the matter is not to allow past negative stories to continue to dog the great work being done at Selly Oak. On the many occasions I have been there, I have been impressed by individuals and by the dedicated, caring nature of the NHS staff. They do not get too many thanks, and I should like to put on record my thanks to them. I also want to thank the management of the trust, who have been innovative and forward-looking in their approach and in taking some difficult decisions, which my hon. Friend alluded to. We have something that we can be proud of.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="91110h0011.htm_para30"><a name="09111059000154">I want to finish where I began. We should celebrate and be proud of what has been achieved at Selly Oak. It is very sad that it is needed for the young men and women who are returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, but we are providing the best medical services for them. We need to celebrate that and build on it. In closing, I want to say thank you once again to all those who work very hard. My final thought in this week of remembrance is to remember those who have been injured&#151;some in life-changing ways&#151;in the service of this country.</p>
