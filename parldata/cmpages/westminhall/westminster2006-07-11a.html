Stephen O'Brien (Eddisbury) (Con):</b> I am very pleased to
have secured this debate. As all hon. Members will appreciate from
their constituency activities, community services, and particularly our
local post offices and sub-post offices, are vital to our
constituents&#146; interests and quality of life. That applies
equally across town and country, and I say that because there is always
a grave danger in such debates that people think that we are talking
only about rural areas. We must emphasise, however, that community
services are crucial not only to rural areas and constituencies such as
mine, but to what might best be described as urban deprived areas,
which may be found in large towns and their outlying areas, and parts
of a town in my constituency could be described as urban deprived.
</p><p><a name="06071143000011">It is interesting
that we have had a number of debates on community services and
particularly on post offices. It is no surprise that they have been
supported by Members on both sides of the House, because the evidence
before our eyes in our own constituencies and the evidence from our
postbags is that there is a gradual, unremitting erosion of local
community services and a relentless anxiety about whether post offices,
in particular, can keep going. There has also been a loosening of the
localness of the provision of vital services. We can see that even from
rather informal sources, but it is even clearer to those of us who live
right in the heart of the communities that are affected in the middle
of our constituencies. We see neighbours having to arrange more lifts
to take people to various activities and more carers seeking time off
work.</p><p><a name="06071143000012">As Members of
Parliament, we are sent to the House to represent people, their
families and their communities above all others and we need to
challenge the Government&#146;s inevitable centralising
nature&#151;the Government always to seek to make decisions that
apply across the board, and that is an inevitable tendency. Coupled
with that are the economies of scale that are part of the natural order
of business, which seeks at all times to maintain the lowest possible
costs for the maximum amount of delivery to the maximum number of
customers. That all works against what we might describe as localism.
Coupled with that is the ease of transportation, with which we have
lived for many decades and of which the most notable example is the
car. That has given people access to services a long way from their
homes.</p><p><a name="06071143000013">There is
therefore an increasing recognition that there is a degree of
alienation and a dilution of the community to which people feel that
they belong, as well as of their sense of identity and what defines
them. 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 360WH</b><br>That is by no means all bad, and it brings with it plenty of
opportunities, because people want to enjoy participating in many wider
areas of activity. However, there is also a real sense of loss and
fear, and people worry that we shall miss the local community services
when they are gone.</p><p><a name="06071143000014">The problem is increasingly
being recognised in a really determined manner by the number of
petitions that have been brought together. That is true not least of
the petition initiated by the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters,
which I hope to find time to present on the Floor of the House on
another occasion. The signatures have been gathered by the local
community around the post office in Cuddington in the north of my
constituency. The post office has served that community well for many
years, but the postmaster is thinking of retirement, and there is a
struggle to find someone to replace him. Of course, anybody considering
doing so will say to themselves, &#147;Is it really worth it? Is it
worth the candle? Can I really make enough out of this business? Is
there enough sustained income to keep the post office viable and going
forward, even with a shop attached to it?&#148; That is a serious
issue.</p><p><a name="06071143000015"><b><a name="06071143000461">Sir
Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</b> I
congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing this subject back before
us. His point about someone trying to take over a sub-post office
explains why it is crucial that the Government come clean about their
agenda and where they see the future of the Post Office. The drift is
almost worse than having no strategy, because people who decide to
retire have no way of persuading the next person of what the business
has to offer.</p><p><a name="06071143000016"><b><a name="06071143000462">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, which very
much anticipates one of the themes that I shall seek to develop. There
is no question but that confidence about the future is the key to
whether we shall have any form of sustainable community services, not
least ones that are centred on local post offices.</p><p><a name="06071143000017">I hope that the Minister and
the Government will take note of the petitions that have been gathered.
Our concern today, however, is that it is just a pious hope that we can
preserve in aspic some kind of a golden age and what we have always
called our communities. Is there anything that we can do about the
problem? Should we even urge the Government to try? I think that we
must because, above all else, community services are the first line of
protection for the most vulnerable&#151;the very elderly, disabled
people, those who are out of work and other benefit
recipients.</p><p><a name="06071143000018">If we
look at the issue across the board, we see that today&#146;s
communities are characterised not only by the local post office. Of
course, post offices are important because about 75 per cent. of them
have a shop attached. There are community post offices not only in
rural villages, but in suburban communities, such as John
Winward&#146;s post office in Over, in Winsford, which is in my
constituency, and Helen Rimmer&#146;s post office in Ashton Hayes.
She has managed to hold on and to undertake new development, despite
the most appalling provocation and repeated attacks on her, not least
by gunmen. She has managed to come through all 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 361WH</b><br>that and she still provides a vital service to her local community, for
which she is much respected.</p><p><a name="06071143000019">Communities are also
characterised by the pub, which is also under pressure. The traditional
local is being taken over by pubs with a theme, and there is a sense
that it is perhaps best to attract people from afar who want to eat
rather than to drink. We might keep the newsagents and the corner shops
if those independent and family retailers&#151;those whose are not
part of the Post Office&#151;can hold on in the face of pressure from
the supermarkets. Recently, there has been a justified and important
campaign to seek recognition of the fact that the traditional practice
of demanding rents in advance is becoming deeply injurious to the
survival of newsagents and corner shops, and we need to see whether
that can be altered.</p><p><a name="06071143000020">There is also the rising
regulatory burden, which has been a theme for many years among those of
us who are deeply concerned about the survival and competitiveness of
those in the private sector and in business who must cope with it. The
regulatory burden falls hardest on the smaller enterprises. There are
also planning pressures, and somewhat draconian planning constraints
are often imposed on small enterprises that wish to make small
adjustments to increase their offering. Of course, there is the
ever-present worry about street and shop crime, which hits small
retailers particularly hard. They are often open all hours and they
come under real pressure when they become the target of what is often
more than petty crime, but they have no local
support.</p><p><a name="06071143000021"><b><a name="06071143000463">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend has brought an
important issue before us. He is talking about the fabric and structure
of our communities, and particularly our high streets. He mentioned
pubs, post offices and newsagents, but will he add pharmacies to that
list because they are also under threat? The primary care trust on
Canvey Island, for instance, is seeking to reorganise health care.
There will be two large centres off the high street and they will be
out of the way for vulnerable people, such as the elderly and the other
groups that my hon. Friend mentioned, as well as for young families
with prams who do not have two cars. Those health centres will have
full pharmacies, which will provide a range of retail products, but
they will destroy the eight community pharmacies that are run by small
retailers and which give a wonderful service on Canvey Island. That is
yet another threat to our high streets and community
services.</p><p><a name="06071143000022"><b><a name="06071143000464">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> My hon. Friend is entirely correct about
pharmacies. I take an interest in that issue in another role, and there
has been a campaign to preserve and maintain community pharmacies,
which has my wholehearted support. Interestingly, in Farndon, a village
in my constituency which is just on the River Dee with the Welsh border
the other side, the post office has been combined with the pharmacy.
That has been a useful and more profitable way of sustaining a vital
set of services to our local community. My hon. 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 362WH</b><br>Friend makes an entirely valid point; pharmacies are part of the list
that I am just beginning to get through, so I am grateful to
him.</p><p><a name="06071143000023">In addition to
pharmacies and the other services that I have mentioned, for some the
church represents the essence of their community. As we know, there
have been declining church attendances. I cite also primary schools,
which are surviving, although in my area and many others there are
falling school rolls. That puts terrible pressure on local education
authorities to make decisions about whether schools can survive. There
are also increasing pressures on bus services, which cater not only for
rural areas but for the outlying areas of towns. Where such services
are not being used, it is difficult to get a replacement to come in to
take over. All of us recognise that we must go much further these days
to fill up with petrol or diesel, and that there has been a decline of
the small local petrol station.Such petrol stations used to
provide an important community service.</p><p><a name="06071143000024">We are also aware of the
difficulty of maintaining in a viable way vibrant village halls, which
are often associated with playing fields next door. That becomes a
major source of concern when there is a decline in community
activities. There has also been a decline in the number of
butchers&#146; businesses in local communities. I suppose that that
has largely been the cost of the higher requirements of inspection
regimes. That decline is of grave concern, particularly for those who
have been dependant on the rural economy over the years. I cite also
mobile libraries and doctors in this context. Notwithstanding the
diminution in out-of-hours services and the diminution in the number of
NHS dentists in local communities, there has been a sharp fall in the
number of district and specialist nurses in our communities. Sadly,
that situation will become worse given the continuing financial
constraints which arise through the Government&#146;s financial
mismanagement of the NHS
budget.</p><p><a name="06071143000025">There is also
increasing pressure in our local communities given people&#146;s lack
of confidence in the fire service, with which the Minister has
particular familiarity, the ambulance service and the police. That
arises for different reasons but it all boils down to one issue: there
is a feeling that unless someone is right in the middle of a large
conurbation, most people&#146;s community services do not know where
they are. People are deeply concerned that when they need those
services in an emergency it will take longer for the service to get to
them. There is not the same confidence that comes from a service being
localised and placed in local area where people feel that they have
immediate access to it.</p><p><a name="06071143000026">I am pleased that the
Government, whether by design or accident, are now finding that their
plan to merge the Cheshire police force into Merseyside&#146;s seems
to be going rapidly backwards, because it would have further
exacerbated the lack of community support and direction. All of us are
aware of the importance of maintaining community hospitals and the huge
number of charities, voluntary sector bodies, and interest and hobby
groups that work in our communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000027">Above all&#151;I suppose that
this is the centre of the argument and the reason for the title of the
debate&#151;I was trying to understand from my own constituency 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 363WH</b><br>experience which is the one place where all these community activities
come together. Where do people find that they are talking to one
another? Where do they meet and find that there is a commonality of
their experience? Where do they find the strength of identity that goes
with it? As it happens, the answer is: in the post office. It is
difficult to think that the same is true of any of the other places
that I have mentioned. Of course, for a large village event there might
sometimes be a coming together in the village hall, but not everyone
will turn up. Almost everybody, at some point, has to go into the post
office, and they will find that that is where they come together. So,
it becomes vital to examine closely how we will maintain the local
community post office network. It is obviously a tremendous asset and
an opportunity. The question is: how do we keep what there
is?</p><p><a name="06071143000028">As we know, most
people still live within 1 mile of a post office&#151;the figure is
about 93 per cent. That is not the case in rural areas. Post offices
provide services in respect of communications and the receiving of
Government-related payments. There are currently slightly more than
14,000 post offices, and they serve 28 million customers. The current
Government have presided over 3,800 closures&#151;we have lost two
post offices in my patch and between eight and 10 in neighbouring
constituencies. There seems to be an average of about 18 post offices a
constituency in Cheshire.</p><p><a name="06071143000029">The chief executive of the Post
Office has a responsibility to run his business most efficiently. If he
were to reduce that figure to the number that he thinks that he needs
to run his Post Office, one could infer that there would be a
significant series of further losses of post offices. While rural areas
and the urban deprived ones will be the hardest hit, it is clear that
it is not our business in Parliament to tell the Post Office chief
executive how to run his business most efficiently. He has a duty to do
that. The question is: how do we make best use of that network and how
do we preserve it? It might be a partnership. There might well be a
need for Government and the Post Office to act together to recognise
that the network is something to be valued and that, once lost, it
cannot be revived.</p><p><a name="06071143000030"><b><a name="06071143000465">Bob
Spink:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that if the Government
were more helpful to the Post Office, they would enable it to provide a
much better service, for instance in terms of providing television
licences and proper bank accounts?</p><p><a name="06071143000031"><b><a name="06071143000466">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I shall come on to that briefly. As I am sure my
hon. Friend knows, it is quite a complex subject. It is important to
recognise that the Government made a promise to keep post offices open,
except in unavoidable circumstances. That was contained in the Labour
manifesto of 2001. The pledge was to last until March this year, and I
think it has now been extended until this autumn. That is important,
because it is still within a relevant period. After much argument and
urging the Government eventually made the welcome announcement that
they would contribute &#163;750 million&#151;&#163;150 million
per annum&#151;up to 2008 under the social network payments. The
money is to 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 364WH</b><br>support the rural and urban deprived community post offices and sub-post
offices. We do not yet know whether it will be renewed.</p><p><a name="06071143000032">That is important and goes back
to a point that was made earlier, because a sub-postmaster or
sub-postmistress is no different from someone in the rest of the
private sector. They are in the private sector, and have bank managers
to deal with and business plans to make. Most bank managers rightly
want to see a three-year plan. We are now in a period in which it is
impossible for a sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress to say confidently
what their income will be.</p><p><a name="06071143000033"><b><a name="06071143000467">Danny
Alexander (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD):</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an important point. Does he
agree that this is not only about the social network payment and the
money that the Government make available to support the rural network?
It is also about the level of commitment that they show to providing
their services through post offices, the most important example of
which so far highlighted is the Post Office card account. Next year,
the contract for people buying their car tax disc at the post office
comes up for renewal. There was an opportunity with both for the
Government to show a commitment to post offices by providing services,
not just by providing the funds for rural post offices, necessary
though those are.</p><p><a name="06071143000034"><b><a name="06071143000468">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman; indeed,
I shall recite that argument as part of what I think the opportunity is
for the Government to ensure that there is a sustainable future for
these vital community services.</p><p><a name="06071143000035">We were told by the Department
of Trade and Industry, as the Minister will no doubt confirm, in
November 2005 that it was planning a public consultation on the future
of the social&#151;that is the rural and urban deprived&#151;post
office network. That was originally planned to start in February and
report by the middle of this month&#151;within a few days, I suspect.
I am very much hoping that the Minister will have the opportunity to
put our minds at rest and say that he is now able to give us a
timetable and the expected time of this report. We have been waiting
for it with some anxiety. It is vital that it takes place, because it
has not yet been started. No announcement has been made about when it
will begin, despite the recent creation of a new Cabinet Committee. I
think we are all beginning to wonder whether we should be holding our
breath, because it will be chaired by none other than the well-renowned
Deputy Prime Minister, and will deal with Post Office issues. We hope
that it will be more joined-up across
Government&#151;</p><p><a name="06071143000036"><b><a name="06071143000469">Danny
Alexander:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06071143000037"><b><a name="06071143000470">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I shall give way, but I hope that the hon.
Gentleman has a serious
point.</p><p><a name="06071143000038"><b><a name="06071143000471">Danny
Alexander:</b> It is a very serious point. I want to report to
the hon. Gentleman that recent correspondence with the Deputy Prime
Minister about his Cabinet Committee implies that it has not yet met. 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 365WH</b><br>Perhaps the Minister could put our minds at rest about that. Given the
vital importance of the future of the post office network to our rural
communities and, indeed, deprived urban areas, that Committee should be
actively engaged in putting forward a strategy for consultation instead
of sitting on its hands.</p><p><a name="06071143000039"><b><a name="06071143000472">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman made a very serious point if
the Committee has not yet met. I would have thought that with new-found
time on his hands the Deputy Prime Minister would think that that is
one of the most urgent things he could get on with, given that there is
so much pressure and anxiety while we wait for the Government to
act.</p><p><a name="06071143000040">I have had
extensive discussions with many of my sub-postmasters and
sub-postmistresses, as well as the National Federation of
Sub-Postmasters, and have had the opportunity of briefings from Colin
Baker, to whom I am grateful. All our post offices have both a social
and economic role. It is well recognised that they provide a wide range
not only of postal, governmental, commercial and retail services, but
in rural and urban deprived areas they are often the only place where
cash can be obtained. They represent a vital service for local
businesses. Many rural businesses do not have a high turnover and it
matters to them that their payment transactions and mailings are dealt
with daily and promptly. It is not uncommon for those of us who
represent such constituencies to hear of people making the run to the
post office at 3.30 pm or 3.45 pm to catch the post because it is vital
to the survival of their small businesses. If that service were lost it
would be a major impediment to their
survival.</p><p><a name="06071143000041">What we as
Members of Parliament probably get most concerned about is that post
offices provide immense and vital support to the most vulnerable
residents in our constituencies: older and disabled people. For
example, the complexity of pensions is now so great that 1.7 million
people who are entitled to claim the pension credit fail to do so. It
is often the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress who can give advice in
a way that does not cause anyone to lose face and preserves the dignity
of confidentiality, which is vital. They have confidence and knowledge
and older people in particular value that and see the sub-postmaster or
sub-postmistress as having a degree of independence from the Government
as well as being knowledgeable and used by the Government as a channel
of information. That independence often gives people the confidence to
pursue that line of
inquiry.</p><p><a name="06071143000042"><b><a name="06071143000473">Julia
Goldsworthy (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD):</b> During the
previous debate in this Chamber on pension credits more than one hon.
Member, including me, raised concern about advisers on the telephone
telling people who were entitled to the pension credit that only the
first payment could be paid into the post office and that subsequent
payments would be paid into their bank account. Does the hon. Gentleman
share my concern that that is another stealthy way of trying to
undermine the service? Clearly that is not Government policy, but are
they aware of that practice and what are they doing to prevent
it?</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 366WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000043"><b><a name="06071143000474">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I have heard about that practice and the hon.
Lady raises an important issue. Guidance and encouragement to do the
right thing to sustain the relationships and incomes of post offices is
needed and it is for the Government to take action. It is in the
Government&#146;s gift to influence such matters and they should not
wash their hands of
that.</p><p><a name="06071143000044">The local post
office often becomes a community focal point. People often congregate
there and the police, local authorities and tourist organisations often
display and provide information in them. They are increasingly places
where people can go online if they are interested in doing so. Above
all, we all have a shared responsibility in our communities and they
are places where we can look out for one another. I am sure that we all
know of someone in our community&#151;perhaps an elderly
person&#151;who has gone to the post office when they were not well.
They may have wanted to remain in their own home but have struggled out
and the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress did not face that person
down with something that they would find embarrassing and difficult to
deal with, but waited for a friend to come into the post office and
alerted them quietly that the person they saw earlier might need
looking after. That is such an important and valuable part of what post
offices do in the centre of our communities. They help to preserve
dignity and independence. I know that that happens almost weekly at one
of the most enterprising small post offices in Wrenbury in my
constituency, which Neil and Janet Palmer run to great effect. They are
the centre of their
community.</p><p><a name="06071143000045">We should
not lose sight of the fact that there is a multiplier effect in having
a post office in the vicinity. Clearly, those who call into a post
office will spend money elsewhere, not least if they are able to obtain
cash because that is where the first, essential spends are
made.</p><p><a name="06071143000046">With incomes
declining, the trend to non-viability and the fact that it is becoming
increasingly difficult to make the idea of becoming a sub-postmaster or
sub-postmistress attractive for people, particularly young people and
young couples, to take over, the pressures of technology and the
greater mobility that we all have means that we tend not to walk to a
local service but to jump in the car. The question that then arises is,
&#147;What can the Government do about it?&#148; They have the
power to make decisions about state benefits and, particularly how
pensions are paid. Given the trend and the Government&#146;s efforts
to pay pensions electronically into accounts, there has been a
substantial reduction in income from encashments. The National Consumer
Council said in 2003:</p><a name="06071143000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The end to cash
benefits just hasn&#146;t been thought through
properly&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000047">and the new
arrangements</p><a name="06071143000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;take
little account of people&#146;s real
needs.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000048">As we
have heard, the Post Office card account was brought in in 2003 and it
was said at the time that it would not be restricted, but earlier this
year we found that it would be for only seven years. We have already
had an important discussion about the major effect that that will have
on the ability of businesses to plan, to receive investment support and
for confidence. What was amazing about the announcement in January was
that the Government said that that was always 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 367WH</b><br>intended. It cannot have been always intended if we knew nothing about
it. I certainly remember the announcement because I was sitting where
my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) is sitting now.
I well remember our hot debates to try to obtain a commitment that the
card was sustainable and would not be limited.</p><p><a name="06071143000049">Three years after its
introduction, we learn from written answers&#151;the information has
only just been revealed&#151;that the Post Office card account with
4.3 million users in the United Kingdom, providing 10 per cent. of the
post office income, will be axed by 2010 with massive loss of revenue.
No Post Office-based replacement has been announced. hope that the
Minister will be able to reassure us that there will a son or daughter
of POCA. The matter is important to us all and our constituents, not
least the 1 million people who have signed the NFSP&#146;s
petition.</p><p><a name="06071143000050">We heard in
interventions about the loss of the BBC television licence contract,
which, with other bill payments, represents 5 per cent. of Post Office
income. The encouragement to renew vehicle excise duty online has shown
a lack of commitment from the Government to encourage services to be
provided by post offices as part of the underpinning of their social
and community responsibilities and as part of a strategy that goes hand
in hand with the commercial activities of the Post Office, which must
run efficiently. There is the difficulty of gaining full recognition by
the banks that they should see post offices as an extension of their
network. That should be strongly encouraged, and I would have thought
that the Government could do something to encourage that recognition.
With rising costs, we are faced with the real possibility of closures.
I am sure that the NFSP&#146;s brief will be familiar to many hon.
Members.</p><p><a name="06071143000051">The problem
is not just the inconvenience, although that is a particular difficulty
for those with no transport or with mobility problems, and for older
people; the problem is also that, in this more environmentally
conscious age, closures will inevitably increase the use of the car, as
people will have to go much further to reach a post office Half of
rural residents currently walk to their post office. We will find that
increasing dependency on others becomes a feature of our communities,
but many older people will simply not look for the assistance that they
need, and they will often suffer quietly behind closed doors. We MPs
have a duty to take real note of that.</p><p><a name="06071143000052">Above all, community spirit
will be badly affected. A spirit is always difficult to define, but we
know when we have lost it. It is certainly difficult to rebuild. It is
not an exaggeration to say that the post offices in our communities
give strong evidence of community spirit. The loss of those facilities
would have a very negative impact. Of course, if there is a multiplier
effect, it will work both ways, including in a negative way.</p><p><a name="06071143000053">I hope that colleagues
throughout the House will join me in calling on the Government to
undertake an urgent examination of the social&#151;that is, the rural
and urban deprived&#151;post office network. I fully endorse what the
NFSP says: a strategy is needed to combine the commercial and social
activities. We have to accept that, as a matter of public policy, such
a strategy will not necessarily be funded purely by commercial
activities. It may need support, in which case we will 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 368WH</b><br>need a review, so that Parliament and Government can come to a decision
on the allocation of public resources to support a vital social and
economic network across the UK. In the meantime, the Post Office can
certainly encourage the use of services that can be delivered at post
offices.</p><p><a name="06071143000054">Communities
must be put first, and we insist that central and local government use
post offices as their primary outlet for information and services. We
recognise that people want the continuing ability to feel an identity
and belong to their communities, and want basic things, such as the
ability to run their finances with cash rather than a bank account.
That is a perfectly proper thing to do, and it can often be a much
better budgeting process for those who have the least. We should not
prescribe in either way, as there are plenty who would want a bank
account, but the unremitting trend of alienating cash from the way that
people think about managing their affairs is inappropriate and somewhat
patronising.</p><p><a name="06071143000055">Community value is strategic
and is in the public interest. Our community services, epitomised by
the local sub-post office, are the test by which we decide whether we
can call ourselves a cohesive society. I call on the Government to act
now, before it is too late. At the very least, I hope that the Minister
will today announce the dates of the Department of Trade and
Industry&#146;s public consultation on the future of the social post
office
network.</p>

David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I congratulate the hon.
Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on bringing this well-worn topic
back to Westminster Hall. It does not matter that we are going over old
ground; until we get clarification of exactly what the Government want
to do with the post office network, and of the plans on how to deliver
services in rural areas, we will retread the same
ground.</p><p><a name="06071143000057">I welcome this
morning&#146;s debates. I see this as a three-hour debate; I hope
that all hon. Members will stay for the second part, which is on the
future of affordable housing in rural areas. To me, the two subjects
are inextricably linked. It is no good talking about service provision
unless we consider who lives in rural communities, and how they can
afford to live in
them.</p><p><a name="06071143000058">I start by
laying down a challenge. Too many rural communities want to maintain
their services, but do not think about how they will do that. All rural
communities need to regenerate themselves. They either grow in a
sustainable way, or they
die.</p><p><a name="06071143000059"><b><a name="06071143000476">Bob
Spink:</b> The hon. Gentleman is a well known campaigner and
fighter for rural communities, but does he acknowledge that post
offices are important to urban communities, too? They have been hit
hardest over the past five years, with the number of urban post offices
falling from about 9,000 to only 6,500. They are just as important to
vulnerable
people.</p><p><a name="06071143000060"><b><a name="06071143000477">Mr.
Drew:</b> I take that as a slap on the wrist. I agree with the
hon. Gentleman, but I am here to talk largely about my experiences in a
semi-rural area. The way in which we look at the link between rural and
urban areas is absolutely essential.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 369WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000061"><b><a name="06071143000478">Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for being so
generous. I shall refer tangentially to the Sustainable Communities
Bill. The hon. Gentleman talked about the importance of rural
communities and their wider sustainability, in terms of supporting
services such as post offices. Does he agree that, unfortunately, rural
communities are often hamstrung and have no control over important
aspects of their future sustainability, such as over the growth in the
number of second homes? At the moment, there are no restrictions on
that growth, which is one of the key drivers in undermining the social,
economic and environmental sustainability of many rural
communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000064"><b><a name="06071143000481">Mr.
Drew:</b> I thank the hon. Lady for that; of course, I agree
with her. I shall push on and try to connect some of the points
made.</p><p><a name="06071143000065">I stress that in
the Sustainable Communities Bill&#151;I hope that the House will
treat that subject increasingly seriously&#151;there is at least the
idea of a strategy on how local communities can take back power and
responsibility, as they perceive, at least, that they have lost it. I
think that often that is a perception, rather than a reality, but of
course if a community has an out-of-town shopping facility, that is a
reality that it cannot escape from.</p><p><a name="06071143000066">There are three levels, and we
have to start at the level of the individual. Too often, individuals
complain about the loss of their post office, pub or village school,
yet they drive past that school with their children, or drive past
those facilities to the supermarket, or they work 200 miles away. That
may well be the nature of the world that we live in, but it is not a
good world, a sustainable world, or a world that will be fit for
purpose in this decade and beyond. The adage &#147;use it or lose
it&#148; applies, and too often we lose it, because people become
concerned about a facility only when it is about to close. That is sad
and reprehensible, but it is avoidable; we must start with the
individual.</p><p><a name="06071143000067">One of
the problems with the Post Office card account is that too few people
in the know have signed up to it. I have signed up to it; that is a
moral responsibility to which I have adhered. I hope that the
decision-makers see the value of it, and run it alongside bank
accounts. It was never supposed to be a pure alternative to the bank
account; it was supposed to be a different way for people to withdraw
money. I know that that is not the Minister&#146;s responsibility,
but he has to talk to the Department for Work and Pensions about what
plans it has for POCA. We just need coherence. A lot of people signed
up for POCA because it is easy and successful, but also because they
believed that that was how to keep their post offices open. Let us
build on that.</p><p><a name="06071143000068">Next,
we move on to the level of the community. I believe that the whole
community has a responsibility 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 370WH</b><br>to its service provision. I declare an interest: I am still a town
councillor in my town of Stonehouse. We were faced with the post office
not necessarily closing, but being moved from a specially built
building, and with a possibly deteriorating service. The town council,
because it had money, invested in that facility and took the whole
building on; now, the town council building abuts the post office. To
me, that is the best of both worlds. A lot of smaller community
councils do not have the money or wherewithal to do that. However, when
they produce their annual report for their parishioners, they should
state whether they have engaged with their post office and service
deliverers in order to determine whether there are things that they
could do better together, whether there is a mutual support mechanism,
and whether they should go out to their community and say, &#147;We
need to invest in those services.&#148; The idea of the common bond
and the monies that could be raised therein is not a fantasy. People
can sign up to the belief that their services are important, and they
can put their money where their mouth is.</p><p><a name="06071143000069">The Library&#146;s debate
pack provides an excellent run through the issues. I am featured on
page 3&#151;I hope that it does not go to my head&#151;in a story
about Paganhill in my constituency. Paganhill post office was situated
within a one-stop shop. There is a Tesco less than a mile away, but
Tesco took on the one-stop shop and announced that it intended to move
the post office out. Catastrophe! The community were up in arms, but
what could they do about it? It just so happened that the Maypole hall,
which was round the corner from the post office, was willing to
consider assimilating the post office. It was a long saga, but 18
months down the line, 10 days ago, the new, refurbished post office
opened in the Maypole hall.</p><p><a name="06071143000070">There were three heroes: Alan
Churchill, who chairs the Maypole hall committee, Robin Craig, who has
taken on two sub-post offices and is looking to take on more, and
Cyrsta Harris, who works for Stroud district council in its community
development department. They all worked hard to make the transfer
happen, and it is people like that who keep our services alive. Tesco,
the Post Office and others played a part, but that is what is vital:
people have to make things happen, otherwise services will be
lost.</p><p><a name="06071143000071">I was in
Oakridge yesterday, a small village on the outskirts of my
constituency. Mike and Kim Gorney live there, and she runs the sub-post
office. Two hamlets, Oakridge Lynch and Far Oakridge, came together to
keep a sub-post office going throughout all the recent
difficulties. She has run it for the past 12 years, but Mike
and Kim want to move in order to improve and extend the post office and
introduce longer opening hours. I do not want to pre-empt the planning
process, but I hope that they receive permission. Yesterday, they took
me through how they will fund the development, and they are
looking for help. One important aspect of the figure
of &#163;150 million is that it is supposed not only to pay
a pure subsidy to keep businesses going, but to reward innovation.
However, when the Gorneys look for funds, it always seems that the
funds are spent up or they are not the right ones.</p><p><a name="06071143000072">The last two pages of the
excellent debate pack refer to the different funding streams available.
The rural 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 371WH</b><br>capital start-up subsidy scheme has gone, to be replaced by the rural
re-start scheme. Interestingly, it has to be match-funded, and the
Gorneys made it clear how difficult that is. When one raises money to
buy a building and undertake much of the work, one has to pay for the
movement of counters, security and so on. The rural investment fund was
launched in October 2004, but it has only &#163;1 million. Against
the thousands of post offices that are trying to keep themselves going,
let alone improve, it is not a great sum of money. I hope that my hon.
Friend the Minister will explain how we can bolster it. Many post
offices are able to take advantage of the rural rate relief, but it
does not help when one moves a business. A small rural post office is
already likely to have drawn down that money.</p><p><a name="06071143000073">The Government need to be
clear. They cannot keep withdrawing services. The Post Office card
account is a classic case of worthy investment, and to announce that it
will be run down over the next couple of years and replaced with bank
accounts is not good news, because it is a psychological kick in the
teeth. People have invested a lot of money in their business and they
have run it not to make money. The submission that I think we all
received from the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters shows that the
average drawings are less than &#163;1,000 a month. There are some
bigger post offices, but as the submission says, it means that an awful
lot of people take substantially smaller sums than even two years ago.
They are minuscule. However, those people are heroes, and that is why
communities owe them an obligation. It is no good saying,
&#147;Isn&#146;t it terrible that they no longer want to carry on
and nobody wants to take this business on from them?&#148; One must
be slightly mad to take on those businesses, such is the level of
reward; however those people are true heroes and they should be
rewarded financially and because they are key people in their
communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000074">The
issues to do with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which the
hon. Member for Eddisbury highlighted, TV stamps and Saga all give out
the wrong signals. They may not be problematic as discrete decisions,
but collectively they are doing immense
damage.</p><p><a name="06071143000075"><b><a name="06071143000482">Sir
Robert Smith:</b> Those issues not only send the wrong signal,
but downgrade a service. In my constituency there are 41 sub-post
offices in which people can obtain a TV stamp, but there are
only 16 PayPoints. It seems rather sad that the two
organisations could not come together to work out how they could have
maintained a mixed system in rural areas. The Post Office could have
assisted people, as it has with banking, and reached further into the
rural community.</p><p><a name="06071143000076"><b><a name="06071143000483">Mr.
Drew:</b> I agree. I shall refer to the ATM issue, because I
seek clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister about
their&#151;and perhaps other services&#146;&#151;introduction in
rural post offices.</p><p><a name="06071143000077">The Post Office sold me on the
hub and spokes idea, whereby the main post office, which the Post
Office might own, becomes the hub and uses its delivery mechanism to
work in tandem with sub-post offices. As the hon. Member for Eddisbury
said, they can remain independent private businesses, but it does not
mean that they cannot co-operate. It is far better they do, 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 372WH</b><br>rather than compete against one another and fail, with all those
businesses suffering as a result.</p><p><a name="06071143000078">I make no apology for
concentrating on rural businesses, because they are under greatest
threat. We have been through the urban reintegration issue, but I hope
that my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify where the hub and spoke
idea has got to. It affects what we do in Stroud, but it seems to
happen by accident. Perhaps it happens by osmosis, but it does not seem
to happen by design. It is not as well planned as it could be, and I
want to know that sub-post masters and sub-post mistresses are being
given all the help that they require to keep their businesses going,
expand them and co-ordinate them with others.</p><p><a name="06071143000079">The hon. Member for West
Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) referred to banking and
financial services. It is a crucial issue, because the whole system
needs to hold together. Last week I received from the Post Office a
long press release about the installation of ATMs in more sub-post
offices. Even though my hon. Friend the Minister does not speak for the
Post Office, he can talk to the Post Office, and I read into the press
release that ATMs would be free of charge. We need to build up a bond
of trust with customers and keep them using post offices, and if there
are no banks easily accessible for miles around, they could be tempted
to use ATMs and allied services. Foreign exchange has been a huge
success story recently.</p><p><a name="06071143000080">I want the process clarified.
It is no good putting out press releases if we do not know what they
mean in detail. If the post office is to become the community&#146;s
financial hub, we want to know that it will be invested in properly,
and that it will be affordable, which means that we do not charge the
poorest people more than they would pay if they could get to a bank. We
have to make the process as easy as possible.</p><p><a name="06071143000081">The challenge exists, but it
will not be met by the Government alone. Communities and individuals
bear a responsibility, too. The Government must set the strategy
correctly and put the money in, and clearly &#163;150 million will
not be enough next time. We shall have to consider how we revisit and
rework what we are doing in the more urbanised areas, as we are now
considering the true urban centres, which face somewhat different
problems. That is the challenge. I hope that we can move forward, and
this debate has been a worthwhile opportunity to do
so.</p><p><a name="06071143000082"><b><a name="06071143000484">Mrs.
Joan Humble (in the Chair):</b> Order. Before I call the next
speaker, I want to point out to the two hon. Gentlemen who are trying
to catch my eye that I hope to call the speakers from the Front Benches

Chair, Mrs. Humble. I also want to congratulate the hon. Member for
Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on securing the debate, which is
important. The fact that we have had a series of debates, on both the
Post Office card account and the Post Office, shows how concerned hon.
Members from all parties are about the future of the post office
network.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 373WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000084">The Post Office has suffered
three blows this year: the announcement that the Post Office card
account will be withdrawn in 2010, the encouragement to motorists to
renew their car tax over the internet, and now the removal of TV
licensing. What strikes me is that we have in the Chamber today the
Minister from the Department of Trade and Industry who is responsible
for the Post Office, but those decisions have all been made by other
Departments, which seem to be under pressure to cut their budgets and
appear to be acting independently of the DTI.</p><p><a name="06071143000085">We have heard that the Deputy
Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Cabinet Committee that is
supposed to be co-ordinating Government policy on the Post Office. I
was extremely shocked to find out that the Committee has not even met
yet. It is easy to make jokes about the Deputy Prime Minister, but as
this is a serious debate I will avoid doing so. I simply point out that
the Deputy Prime Minister seems to have nothing to do other than chair
Committees, so if the Minister takes one thing away from the debate it
should be to go to the Deputy Prime Minister and say that the message
from all parties is that we want him to get on with the job of getting
the Committee up and running and to come up with a solution.</p><p><a name="06071143000086">The Post Office card account is
clearly an important part of the business. I shall not go into detail
on that subject today, because we have had plenty of debates on it
already. However, I stress its importance and the need for a Post
Office account to follow on from POCA and allow people to collect their
benefits and pensions from the Post Office and from their Post Office
account. Again, it is important that we have an early announcement on
that subject. To emphasise a point that has already been made, as
sub-postmasters and mistresses retire they will not be able to find
anyone to take on the business unless it is seen to have a secure
future. The most important thing that the Government can do is to make
an early announcement that there will be a Post Office successor to
POCA.</p><p><a name="06071143000087">The other issue
that I wanted to mention today was that the Government have taken away
TV licence renewals from the Post Office, which is taking away a
service from rural communities. The contract has been given to
PayPoint, and PayPoint tends to be based in Co-ops and Spar
supermarkets and nearly all the outlets are in towns. It rarely has
outlets in villages so the service is being removed from rural
communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000088">PayPoint
also seems to have an incompetent computer system that tells people the
location of their nearest PayPoint outlet. Most worryingly, TV
Licensing, too, is using that computer system to tell people where
their nearest outlet is. I have a licence renewal letter that was sent
to a constituent of mine in the village of Cardross, on the north bank
of the river Clyde with a population of more than 2,000 people. It has
a post office where people have been able to renew their TV licences
for many years, but it does not have a PayPoint outlet. The letter to
my constituent lists the local PayPoint outlets, and gives two, both in
Port Glasgow. The PayPoint website says that Port Glasgow is only 2
miles away from Cardross. That is all very well, but the only problem
is that the river Clyde is in between. The Minister knows the geography
well, and 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 374WH</b><br>if someone wants to get from Cardross to Port Glasgow they have to drive
10 miles up the north bank of the Clyde to the Erskine bridge, cross
the bridge and drive 10 miles back. Clearly, the computer system is
totally incompetent. There is a PayPoint outlet 3 miles away in
Dumbarton, but the letter does not point that out. How can the
Government possibly have given such an important contract to such an
incompetent company, which does not have outlets in rural
areas?</p><p><a name="06071143000089">Another
disadvantage of PayPoint is that because it does not have outlets in
rural areas it causes great difficulties in many of the islands in my
constituency. Seven of those islands&#151;Lismore, Iona, Coll,
Colonsay, Luing, Jura and Gigha&#151;have post offices where people
can renew their TV licences. There are no PayPoint outlets on any of
the islands, so how are people there supposed to renew their TV
licences? Clearly they can do so over the phone or through the post
with a postal order, which, if they do not have a bank account, they
will have to pay a lot of money to get, but they cannot take advantage
of the new card that is the successor to the TV stamp scheme. People in
those islands are being excluded from that important Government
service.</p><p><a name="06071143000090">If people on
the islands are not able to buy their TV licences, I have a solution:
we should simply make using a TV on the islands free from the
requirement to obtain a TV licence. If the Government are not prepared
to set up outlets for people to buy their TV licences, the quid pro quo
should be that a licence is not needed to operate a TV on any of the
islands. Those are my messages for the Government
today.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000441">10.26

Hall, because he has a majority of only 350, and tells the Chamber
about how the Government are cutting services in his constituency. The

listen to the hon. Gentleman because it is the seats such as his that

with the people? We hear a lot from the Prime Minister about enhanced
delivery of public services, but we are seeing a continuing alienation
and remoteness of government as more is done online. That is fine for
younger generations, who might be competent and au fait with being
online and using the internet, but for older generations that is not
always the case. We see the removal of services that gave people
face-to-face contact with government such as Jobcentre Plus, which has
disappeared entirely in a big town such as Bicester, one of the
fastest-growing towns in England. If one cannot get online, the only
other way to connect with the machinery of government is through call
centres and the infuriating process of having to press serial buttons,
which drives constituents and all of us completely crazy. We are
privileged with most of those systems, because the Government have
realised that they do not work, in having MPs&#146; hotlines so that
we do not all go mad with Ministers in the Division Lobby.</p><p><a name="06071143000095">The Government ought to see
Post Offices as a real opportunity where the state and the machinery of
government can interface with people and tackle some of the issues of
social exclusion that the Government talk about.</p><p><a name="06071143000096">The withdrawal of the Post
Office card account from 2010 is absolutely crazy. At a stroke, it will
undermine the viability of practically every village and urban sub-post
office. As my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) said,
it was also disingenuous, because when the scheme was introduced
everyone thought that it would go on for ever&#151;that there would
be a degree of continuity and substance. The Government&#146;s
withdrawal of the card account will undermine the post office network,
and once that has happened it cannot be replaced. Once the post offices
have been sold and the premises disposed of, they will never be
available again.</p><p><a name="06071143000097">I am
not surprised that the hon. Gentleman, desperate to hold on to his
majority of 350, should implore the Minister to throw him a lifeline by
maintaining rural post offices, but if Ministers do not start to listen
to the voice of England they will lose many more constituencies than
Stroud. People are fed up with a Government who have become
increasingly distant and remote&#151;a Government who simply do not
listen to those who want to see protection for the elderly, the
isolated and the
disadvantaged.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000442">10.31

my hon. Friends who were unable to speak because of time constraints.
The Liberal Democrats, like all parties, believe that this is an
important issue, but I shall be brief in my response to this
wide-ranging discussion, as we all look forward to many of our
questions being answered by the Minister.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 376WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000099">It seems to me that two forces
are pulling against each other&#151;the Government and the community.
Communities want control over their lives and their surroundings. The
Government have a tendency for centralisation, which they use in the
name of efficiency and standardisation.</p><p><a name="06071143000100">In Solihull, neighbourhood
policing has worked most effectively, as has community support. The
idea of localisation, of familiarity with one&#146;s immediate area,
has been extremely successful for Silhillians and, I am sure, for all
in the United Kingdom who have been able to enjoy its benefits. I
understand that an announcement will be made later today on the merger
of police forces into super-forces; I hope that the plan will be
shelved.</p><p><a name="06071143000101">Similar
things are happening to ambulance trusts, with 29 forces being reduced
to 12. Again, that is a removal from the local area and local
knowledge.</p><p><a name="06071143000102"><b><a name="06071143000488">Tim
Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):</b> On the merger of
ambulance services, I can tell my hon. Friend that in my constituency
recently, first responders&#151;they provide a remarkable service,
particularly in rural areas, by getting to critically ill people before
the ambulance arrives&#151;have not been called out because the
system has been changed. It is now more centralised and more automated,
and because the service covers a larger area peoples&#146; lives are
being put at risk. Does my hon. Friend share my concern about that
development?</p><p><a name="06071143000103"><b><a name="06071143000489">Lorely
Burt:</b> I do indeed. My hon. Friend gives an important
illustration of what can go wrong when over-centralisation takes
place.</p><p><a name="06071143000104">About 80
community hospitals are under threat. We have lost 1,400 beds since
1999. The idea of a market-driven concept does not sit well with a
community hospitals. It seems to be their fault if they cannot make
ends meet, and they have to close as a result. There is much concern
among local people; community hospitals is a hot topic in many
areas.</p><p><a name="06071143000105">Hon. Members
have already spoken about small shops, pubs, pharmacies and many other
organisations. I remind the House that 30,000 independent retailers
have closed during the past 10 years. We have often debated the
encroaching role of the supermarkets, whose non-food sales have doubled
in the last five years, and we have spoken of their predatory pricing
and their squeezing of suppliers, and particularly in rural areas,
those selling at the farm gate. That all gives rise to great
concern.</p><p><a name="06071143000106">As many as 20
per cent. of post offices have been lost in the past five years. The
Government&#146;s contribution to that, I am sorry to say, comes in
the withdrawal of tax disc renewals, pension book payments and the Post
Office card account. That all illustrates how much more difficult it is
for post offices to make a living. However, I am pleased that the
social network payments have been retained until
2008.</p><p><a name="06071143000107">I am pleased
also that other innovations are being explored that one hopes will be
implemented in many areas. One idea is the hub and spoke system in
which a major village has a post office with satellites in the
surrounding villages in pubs, village halls, mobile post offices and in
partnership with libraries, the police and 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 377WH</b><br>so on. Those are all innovative ways that could help support the vital
community link.</p><p><a name="06071143000108">It
has been alleged that members of my party and others who are extremely
worried about the sustainability of communities are clinging on to a
romantic concept of the village and the community as they used to be 50
years ago. We certainly cannot go back, but we can use what works. I
have already mentioned neighbourhood policing. Solihull is also
spearheading a care trust, a partnership between health and social
services working as one, which I am excited to see and which I hope
will have a good result.</p><p><a name="06071143000109">My hon. Friend the Member for
Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) has introduced the
Sustainable Communities Bill, and I understand that an early-day motion
supporting it now has the support of more than 50 per cent. of Members.
I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the issues dealt
with in that Bill. While speaking of private Members&#146; Bills, my
Local Government and Planning (Parkland and Windfall Development) Bill
seeks to ensure that local communities have some say in the planning
decisions that affect their lives.</p><p><a name="06071143000110">In control is where people want
to be. People want to be in control of their lives, their destinies and
their communities. When that control is taken away, the sense of
community breaks down and we see alienation in the countryside and the
town, where the need, particularly of the young, to assert identity
manifests itself in a plague of graffiti and other forms of antisocial
behaviour. We see elderly people alone, afraid to go out, with nowhere
to go, and with their shops and post offices shutting down; and we see
communities disintegrating as their character is changed beyond control
and beyond recognition.</p><p><a name="06071143000111">The psychological health of our
nation and our communities is at stake. It is worth more than a few
figures on the balance sheet. We want community services to be just
that&#151;services run by and for the community. We say no to ghost
town Britain. We say yes to sustainable villages and towns, which are
defined by thriving local economies, environmental protection,
community involvement and democratic
participation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000443">10.39

Hendry (Wealden) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on securing this important debate.
There is an element of Groundhog day about it; we regularly pop into
the Chamber to discuss the future of the Post Office network. We last
did so on 14 June, when I welcomed the Minister and said that we were
prepared to give him a small exemption because he was new to his post,
but that he had to come up with some answers soon. I went on to
say:</p><a name="06071143000416"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We are
watching the whole network crumble while Ministers simply wash their
hands of responsibility&#148;.&#151;[<i>Official Report,

293WH.]</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000113">That was an interesting
mixed metaphor; I hope that the Minister has now finished washing his
hands and that today he will break out of the Groundhog day tradition
to give us clear answers about the future of the Post Office
network.</p>

<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 378WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000114">The debate has been extremely
wide-ranging and has covered a tremendous number of issues of enormous
importance to our rural communities and others. My hon. Friend set
those out with great clarity and understanding. He made a particularly
important point in saying that we were not seeking to preserve
communities in aspic, but trying to find a realistic way forward to
bring new life, vitality and business into them. We are not trying to
preserve something for the sake of tradition.</p><p><a name="06071143000115">My hon. Friend outlined some of
the other issues that we are considering in this debate: the village
shop, the pub, the churches, the school bus services and village halls.
We have also heard about pharmacies and ambulance services. One of the
most startling points made to me by the excellent head of the Sussex
ambulance service, Paul Sutton, was that only 5 per cent. of people in
this country who have a cardiac arrest outside hospital will be alive
two years later. In Finland, a much more rural country, 10 times as
many&#151;nearly 50 per cent.&#151;will be alive two years later
because there are defibrillators in the local communities. The issue is
not only about relying on the local ambulance service, but how to put
new services into the communities that will help people, and improve
and save their
lives.</p><p><a name="06071143000116">Safety is a
further aspect that should be mentioned. If we had had this debate 10
years ago, none of us would have said that there was a problem of
antisocial behaviour in the communities that we are talking about.
However, such behaviour has now spread out of the cities and into the
big towns&#151;into large villages as well. One of the things about
which people are most concerned is the lack of a police presence in
those communities and the lack of a sense that crime is being brought
under control in
them.</p><p><a name="06071143000117">My hon. Friend
the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) was absolutely right to highlight
the extent to which Government services have been systematically
removed from our communities. Such services are becoming more and more
remote. My hon. Friend highlighted how, ultimately, they are moved to
call centres with no connection whatever with the people whom they are
supposed to serve. That process, of course, is part of the
Government&#146;s regional agenda, so beloved of the Deputy Prime
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071143000118">It was
intriguing to hear the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) criticise
those changes; the Liberal Democrats are also committed to the
Government&#146;s regional agenda. If the hon. Lady wishes for such
an agenda, she should know that the consequence is that increased
remoteness of services. The only way to break away from that is to
scrap that agenda and move decision making and power back to the
communities that are most
affected.</p><p><a name="06071143000119">This debate
is not just about whether Stroud, or a range of other marginals, will
continue to be a Labour seat after the next election; we take it for
granted that they will not. The issues are much more important. They
are about the whole range of facilities that people enjoy in their
communities and the survival of those communities. I hope that the
Minister will be able to give us some good answers
today.</p><p><a name="06071143000120">The Post Office
had declined dramatically; in 1999 there were 18,374 post offices in
this country. There are now 14,400&#151;a decline of 20 per cent. in
just five years. 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 379WH</b><br>In 1999, there were 43 post offices in my constituency. Now there are
28, a decline of a third in just five years.
</p><p><a name="06071143000121">Rural post offices
account for about half the network; there are, perhaps, about 7,800.
Nevertheless, they account for only 10 per cent. of the business. On
average, they have something like 350 consumers a week, but 1,000 rural
post offices have fewer than 50 consumers a week. We need to be
sensible; we cannot simply preserve a business that is not operating
well. Sometimes the postmaster or postmistress decides to move out.
However, we need a strategy and long-term vision for what role the Post
Office should
play.</p><p><a name="06071143000122">This
year, the Post Office network will lose &#163;2 million, and that
loss is expected to double next year. In the course of that, the
Government are withdrawing &#163;168 million in Government contracts
from the Post Office network. As we have heard, that will get worse.
There are the issues of the Post Office card account, the changes in
respect of renewing car tax licences online, and the moves, on
commercial grounds, not by the Government but the BBC&#151;although
the Minister was accused of being responsible&#151;to take the TV
licence away from the Post Office and to give it to
PayPoint.</p><p><a name="06071143000123">The chief
executive of the Post Office, Adam Crozier, has said that he can fulfil
his legal obligations with just 4,000 post offices. We have to be very
careful about how we interpret that; he is not saying that that is what
he wants. We should also pay tribute to the outstanding job done by him
and Allan Leighton in turning around the Post Office. However, we need
to understand that Mr. Crozier can meet his legal commitments with just
4,000 post offices. If we want more than that, it is up to the
Government to come forward with a strategy. The Post Office has a
business to run, but a Government strategy and vision is completely
lacking in this
debate.</p><p><a name="06071143000124">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Eddisbury said, current Government funding for
the Post Office network runs out in 2008. Decisions are being made now.
In the coming months, people will sit down to decide whether they
should close down or sell on their business. They may turn it into a
house because they simply do not know what the future holds.</p><p><a name="06071143000125">The Minister has to start
coming up with answers. We look particularly to him to give examples of
how we can bring new business into the Post Office network. Could post
offices be used as centres for storing undelivered parcels? Courier
companies often cannot deliver huge numbers of parcels. Rather than
taking them back to their bases, why should they not take the parcels
to the village post office, where they could be collected in due
course? Can more be done with what is called the first mile of the
postal network? Businesses in communities might bring their post to the
Post Office and send it to whatever postal service delivery network
they wished to use.</p><p><a name="06071143000126">What are the Government doing
about a successor to the Post Office card account? Ministers have to
take the lead on that issue. In the 14 June debate, I said to the
Minister that there had been too many examples of people being
instructed to move from Post Office card accounts to bank accounts for
that to have been happening by accident. Ministers must confirm that
they will send a message to every single agency stating that they
should put no pressure on people to move away from the POCA if they do
not wish to do so.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 380WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000127">In the months since then, has
the Minister had a meeting about the issue? Has he written or spoken to
his counterpart in the Department for Work and Pensions to make the
point clearly? Furthermore, has he told his counterpart that DWP
Ministers cannot simply stand back from the issue and say that it is a
matter for the Post Office? It is a matter for the Post Office and the
Government, and the banking community should be brought in as well. We
need the Minister to take a lead on the issue, and I hope that he will
give some more encouraging news today.</p><p><a name="06071143000128">In the light of what we have
heard today, will the Minister ensure that he has a discussion with the
Deputy Prime Minister soon? The Deputy Prime Minister has very little
else to do apart from sticking his tongue out at the media, so why has
the Committee that he chairs not met? We are debating one of the most
important issues, which affects every single constituency in this
country. If the Deputy Prime Minister, with his reduced responsibility,
has not found time to chair that Committee, that is a complete
scandal.</p><p><a name="06071143000129">There are
ways forward, but so many of them are in the hands of the Government.
We look to the Government and the Minister to give clear examples of
how to move forward. However, I want to finish on a positive note. At
this time of year, we go every weekend to village fêtes and to
see what communities are doing to make themselves vibrant, successful
and good places in which to live. We owe an incredible tribute to the
people who make that happen: those who write the parish magazines, put
on the village fêtes, run the local sports clubs and give
cricket, football or rugby training for youngsters.</p><p><a name="06071143000130">The communities in this country
remain incredibly special. The fact that our communities are losing
some of their economic vitality should concern us all. However, they
remain immensely special places because of the desire of so many people
who live in them to contribute to and improve their communities. We owe
a tremendous debt of gratitude to the many people in our constituencies
who make that
happen.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000444">10.50
am</h5><p><a name="06071143000131"><b><a name="06071143000491">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair
today, Mrs. Humble. I associate myself with the concluding remarks of
the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry). It was clear from the
response of other hon. Members that they also supported those
remarks.</p><p><a name="06071143000132">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr.
O&#146;Brien) on securing this debate. I shall keep my remarks to a
minimum but try to respond to as many of the points raised by hon.
Members as possible. However, I am not able to provide a definitive
timetable, so the outcome of the debate will not be to
everyone&#146;s
satisfaction.</p><p><a name="06071143000133">Let me
make it perfectly clear that the Government have heard
everyone&#146;s concerns and will take heed of them in their
continuing deliberations on the future of the post office network. If
it is to survive and have a sustainable future, it must adapt to the
changing circumstances and environment in which it operates. Many
sectors of the post office network lose 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 381WH</b><br>substantial amounts of money. The rural network loses some &#163;150
million a year, and the directly managed Crown offices have been losing
some &#163;70 million annually. The status quo is simply not
sustainable. Several important steps to restructure and revitalise the
Post Office have already been taken but the future of the network
rightly remains an issue of national
debate.</p><p><a name="06071143000134">I acknowledge
the generous comments of the hon. Member for Wealden about the success
of the chairman, chief executive and staff of Royal Mail in turning
around that service, which only a few years ago was losing &#163;1
million a day. It has moved back into profitability and is investing on
behalf of the taxpayer in a much more successful business. However, as
everyone acknowledges, that involved painful
changes.</p><p><a name="06071143000135">As the
Minister with responsibility for postal services, I have a
contradictory role, given the circumstances in which I find myself. I
want to help ensure the widest provision of services but also a
sustainable network. Just before the debate, the hon. Member for
Eddisbury and I discussed that contradiction in the corridor. There is
clearly a need for a community network, but it must have the bedrock of
a sustainable commercial
network.</p><p><a name="06071143000136">I appreciated
the tone of the debate. It would have been easy for hon. Members to
come here and criticise. I am not saying that there were no
criticisms&#151;clearly, there were&#151;but in the vast majority
of the contributions they were delivered in a constructive way. I
assure hon. Members that I and officials at the Department of Trade and
Industry are working extremely hard with officials and Ministers from
other Departments on the issues that were raised in the groundhog day
debate only a few weeks ago. Obviously, we will consider issues that
have been raised today that are separate from those, but I suspect that
all the bases have been covered in our considerations. We want to
arrive at the best possible strategy in our conclusions. As colleagues
would expect, I have also initiated discussions with Post Office Ltd
and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters in past
weeks.</p><p><a name="06071143000137">The hon.
Gentleman said that the number of signatures on petitions shows the
depth of feeling. Our response to that is straightforward: many people
express an affinity with their post office by signing petitions.
Unfortunately, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) said,
that does not mean that they use the services. There is an affinity
with rural services but translating such support into commercial usage
of the post office is obviously one of the challenges that we face. The
least used 20 per cent. of offices in the rural network average 40
customer visits per week, and the least used 10 per cent. average just
16 customer visits per week. At &#163;17 per visit, those figures
loom large in our
calculations.</p><p><a name="06071143000138">The hon.
Gentleman and other colleagues discussed the difficulty in selling on
sub-post offices because of the uncertainty of the future. We recognise
such concerns, but the sale of sub-post offices on a commercial basis
continues. In 2005-06, there were 1,243 successful transfers&#151;649
rural and 594 urban&#151;and an increase on the number for 2004-05,
which was 1,179.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 382WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000139">The hon. Gentleman suggested
that post office partnerships with stores such as pharmacies and with
churches ought to be considered. From our initial &#163;450
million support package, &#163;25 million was set aside for a
flexible fund to enable the Post Office to pilot new ways of delivering
services in rural areas in a sustainable
way.</p><p><a name="06071143000140">The hon.
Gentleman made some interesting suggestions about how other
partnerships and other business services could increase viability. The
Post Office is undertaking several pilot initiatives aimed at
increasing usage of rural post offices; for example, the pilot with the
police, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely
Burt), in which the local sub-postmaster or postmistress
handles simple inquiries in the community and can report crimes. Post
Office Ltd is also considering working with tourist information offices
to enable the local post office to offer
advice.</p><p><a name="06071143000141">Furthermore,
the Post Office is testing alternative means of service delivery. The
core and outreach model, which was mentioned by colleagues, is being
piloted by the company to expand the reach of the network to meet the
needs of outlying small communities. Typically, the core sub-postmaster
provides a service at locations such as the local village hall or pub
for several hours each week. The Post Office published its report on
the pilot trials in March. The lessons from the pilots will play an
important part in the consideration and informing of the
Government&#146;s longer-term decisions on the future of the
network.</p><p><a name="06071143000142">The hon.
Gentleman asked about Adam Crozier&#146;s comments about what he
would need to fulfil the licence obligations. He answered his own
question when clearly identifying them as a hypothetical
response.</p><p><a name="06071143000143"><b><a name="06071143000492">Sir
Robert Smith:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06071143000144"><b><a name="06071143000493">Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I am
trying to get through as many answers as
possible.</p><p><a name="06071143000145">The hon.
Member for Eddisbury said that 93 per cent. of people lived within a
mile of a post office, but that that was not the case in rural
situations. In rural areas, 85 per cent. of households are within 2 km
of a post office. That compares with 79 per cent. of rural households
that are within 4 km of a doctor&#146;s surgery. There are 8,000
rural post offices&#151;some 55 per cent. of the
network&#151;catering to only 19 per cent. of the population. That
clearly suggests an
imbalance.</p><p><a name="06071143000146">The hon.
Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) is not in his place, so I will pass
by his question. The hon. Member for Eddisbury said that the Government
were forcing people away from post offices. I do not want to be
partisan, but it was the previous Conservative Government who first
introduced direct payments. Not only this Government have changed how
benefits are
provided.</p><p><a name="06071143000147">The hon.
Gentleman said that the Government should use post offices as a primary
outlet for their services. I assure him that other Ministers and I
are

the Member for Stroud asked about fee-charging automated teller
machines in some offices. Post Office Ltd has changed its cash machine
strategy and is withdrawing from its contractual arrangements with the
existing ATM suppliers, which supply fee-charging machines. A new
partnership with the Bank of Ireland will result in the introduction of
1,500 Post Office-branded free-to-use ATMs across the network in the
next few years. My hon. Friend may take that message to his
constituents.</p><p><a name="06071143000149">The hon.
Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) asked whether the Government are
to blame for the decline in the post office network. I remind
colleagues that we cannot force people to use post offices. We ought to
do as much as we can to provide Government services through them, but
we also provide services on the internet, by telephone and by mobile
phone, and people readily access them through such means. We must work
within the context of that trend. I am sure that those who are

free use of TVs on islands and respond to them directly. However, I am
not sure that they will
agree.</p><p><a name="06071143000150">My final

and Opposition Members. Inevitably, suggestions for change in and

Areas)</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000445">11
am</h5><p><a name="06071143000152"><b><a name="06071143000495">Paddy
Tipping (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> I am pleased to introduce this
debate, particularly in the context of the Affordable Rural Housing
Commission&#146;s report that was published in May. I thank the
Minister for commissioning the report and congratulate the commission
on its work, but towards the end of my speech I shall press her on what
the next steps are, because affordable housing is a big problem in
rural communities. Although progress has been made, we need to make
further progress.</p><p><a name="06071143000153">From
my experience in Nottinghamshire, people have difficulty moving into
the rural villages that surround the Nottingham conurbation. I know a
family in Farnsfield, for example, three generations of whom live
together&#151;grandparents, parents and children. The children aspire
to live in the village, but there is no affordable accommodation for
them. There are similar problems in places such as Lambley, Lowdham and
Woodborough. They are attractive villages where house prices have
spiralled and young people have difficulty getting into the market. The
situation is difficult in Nottingham, but I am painfully aware that it
is far worse in other parts of the country, particularly the
south-west, most of the south and the national park areas.</p><p><a name="06071143000154">Everyone has a right to decent
housing, whether they live in the town or the countryside. It is
important to acknowledge that many people aspire to move out of the
town and into the countryside. The Countryside Agency suggests that
100,000 people a year move out of the town and into the countryside,
hoping for a better quality of life. We need to ensure that there is
not an urban-rural divide. Some people, including some politicians,
argue strongly that urban issues are different from rural issues, but
rural housing is one side of the same coin&#151;people move out of
the town because they are worried about poor educational standards,
high levels of crime and a decaying environment.</p><p><a name="06071143000155">We need to continue to work
hard as a Government to build on what we have achieved, to ensure that
our town centres are revitalised and become places where people feel
pleased and comfortable to live. The Government have a long history and
a good platform on that. We need to continue that work, but of course
we need to do things in the countryside too.</p><p><a name="06071143000156">That is why I was delighted
that our rural manifesto at the last general election contained a
commitment to establish a commission on rural
housing:</p><a name="06071143000417"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
will establish a Commission on Rural Housing and ask it to explore
measures to ensure that local residents and their families can have
access to affordable housing. The Commission will examine a range of
models&#151;such as cooperative ownership or shared equity&#151;to
see which work well in a rural
setting.</p></ul><a name="06071143000418"><ul><p class="tabletext">We are also
keen that they look at the place of government owned housing stock in
rural areas in addressing rural housing
need.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000157">The commission was
established shortly after the general election. It was chaired by
Elinor Goodman and produced a comprehensive and well inter-linked
report in May. The commission is keen to make progress with the report
and so am I.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 385WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000158">The commission has described its
report, saying that it offered</p><a name="06071143000419"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;practical solutions which would
improve access to affordable housing to rent or buy for those who live
or work in rural areas. They were to be evidence-based, draw on best
practice and propose action which could be taken forward across public,
private and voluntary
sectors.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000159">The commission
achieved that aim. Its report contains a range of measures that, taken
together, can be a move towards providing affordable housing.</p><p><a name="06071143000160">Before I come to solutions,
however, I want briefly to consider some of the evidence that the
commission gathered. The statistics tell a compelling story. There was
a 6 per cent. decline in rural new build as compared to a 29 per cent.
increase in urban areas between 1998 and 2005. Average house prices in
the countryside rose by 73 per cent., as compared with 68 per
cent. in towns, between 2000 and 2005. It is therefore not surprising
that, with rising prices linked to spiralling demand and falling
supply, house prices for first-time buyers are 12 per cent. higher in
rural districts than in towns and that the median house price in a
rural area is 6 per cent. higher than in the towns.</p><p><a name="06071143000161">If that was not problem enough,
the average earnings in the rural economy are &#163;17,400 a year,
compared with an urban average of &#163;22,300. The combination of
high house prices and low incomes in rural areas means that people
seeking to buy, even at the bottom end of the rural market, have to pay
seven to 10 times their earnings, compared with an average of 3.4 to
four times in urban areas. Rural dwellers, particularly young rural
dwellers who have low incomes, face a real problem in accessing the
housing market.</p><p><a name="06071143000162">The
consequence is that someone on such an income could probably afford
housing in 50 per cent. of urban wards, but in only 28 per cent. of
rural wards and 2 per cent. of rural wards in the south-east. Some 45
per cent. of newly-formed households cannot afford to set up home in
the ward in which they currently live. It is also important to note
that the public sector is not compensating for market sector failure.
There was a 22 per cent. increase in urban affordable housing
provision, but only a 3 per cent. increase in rural areas between 2001
and 2005, and only 5 per cent. of houses are social housing in rural
areas, compared with a national average of just over 23 per cent. Those
figures spell out the stark reality for people who are looking for
entry into the housing market in rural areas. There are problems of
market access not only in Nottinghamshire but across the south, and
particularly in the
south-west.</p><p><a name="06071143000163">What is to
be done? Clearly we need to build a lot more affordable housing, not
only in market towns&#151;important as that is&#151;but in villages
of less than 10,000. They make up 19 per cent. of the population but
receive only 10 per cent. of Housing Corporation grants. The commission
has calculated how many new homes will be necessary and suggests that
11,000 new affordable homes will be needed in rural areas each year,
which would be made up of 7,600 for rent and 3,200 for low-cost shared
ownership. No one doubts that that is a big task, but the
commission&#146;s recommendations are compelling. We are taking those
ideas forward, but we should do so much more firmly.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 386WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000164">Let me run through some of the
ideas. First, there needs to be a better analysis of rural housing
need. Our current methodology is not as robust as one might want. There
needs to be a debate, starting in the locality through parish councils
and in local authorities, to a regional and Government level, about how
we calculate housing figures, what we really need and what the
timetable is for delivering those
figures.</p><p><a name="06071143000165">I am
particularly keen to involve regional spatial strategies in the
process. The strategies of most regional planning forums are now well
under way. We could consider at an early stage what provision and
recommendation those spatial strategies make for rural housing. Some
strategies acknowledge the need, but some do not. There are some early
gains to be made in this
area.</p><p><a name="06071143000166">I am a great
believer in planning. Planning is a Labour concept&#151;a socialist
concept&#151;and we should aspire to a planned, spatial structure. We
should not be afraid of that, despite the waves in the water at the
moment. I am keen for local authorities to introduce plans for rural
housing through their local development frameworks. The exceptions
policy has served us well up to now, but by itself it is not
sufficient. In the new local development frameworks, local authorities
need to identify sites for housing. The threshold for affordable
housing in new developments needs to be brought
down.</p><p><a name="06071143000167">We need to
revise some planning policies. It is not possible at present to convert
outbuildings to housing on many farms in rural areas. We need to
consider that matter closely. Last week I visited Beecroft farm in
Bulcote, Nottinghamshire, where there was once a big piggery where pigs
were fed on swill. However, that business has gone and the buildings
are decrepit and decaying. In effect, it is a brownfield site, but our
current policy guidance does not allow us to convert the buildings to
housing. We should revisit that
guidance.</p><p><a name="06071143000168"><b><a name="06071143000496">Andrew
George (St. Ives) (LD):</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an
interesting point in arguing that planning has socialist origins.
Having said that, does he not agree that planning appears to be fuelled
more by greed than need and that when local planning authorities pass
permissions&#151;particularly unfettered permissions for housing
development in rural areas&#151;they effectively give away lottery
sums to landowners? Does he agree that we need to ensure that the
planning system in rural areas should meet the need for affordable
housing, not stuff the pockets of people who happen to be lucky enough
to have developable
sites?</p><p><a name="06071143000169"><b><a name="06071143000497">Paddy
Tipping:</b> I am not always sure that greed drives the
planning process&#151;clearly, landowners want to maximise the
benefit of their land&#151;but the hon. Gentleman is right that,
through their local plans, local authorities are in a position to drive
affordable housing. That is the commission&#146;s view and mine, too.
I hope that the Minister will continue along that line. Planning policy
guidance is already being revised. There are encouraging movements in
respect of planning policy statement 3 that will help affordable
housing.</p><p><a name="06071143000170">I have talked
about the need to know how much housing we require and to use the
planning process. 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 387WH</b><br>However, it is also important to retain the existing stock. One can
argue for new housing, but there is a strong case to revisit the right
to buy in rural areas where public housing is in low supply. I welcome
the movement on staircasing in rural areas, so that shared equity can
be released&#151;that is a step in the right direction&#151;but if
we are concerned about affordable housing, we must maintain the current
stock.</p><p><a name="06071143000171">We need to move
towards financing public housing&#151;affordable housing&#151;in
rural areas. I am pleased that in May the Housing Corporation announced
an extra &#163;230 million to provide 6,000 new houses in rural areas
between 2006 and 2008. That decision recognises that there is a problem
and progress has to be made. If the commission is right that we need to
create 11,000 new houses each year in rural areas, we need to revisit
the allocation from the Housing Corporation and at least double
it.</p><p><a name="06071143000172">I know&#151;I am
sure that the Minister will tell me&#151;that this is a matter for
the spending review. We need more money for rural housing. The
Government have set up a commission to recommend the way forward and
the Minister has considered the commission&#146;s proposals. I hope
that colleagues throughout the Government and in the Treasury will
reconsider, because given the scale of the market failure, we need to
provide more public support for rural
housing.</p><p><a name="06071143000173">We need to do
many more things. Let me canter quickly through some of the things that
the commission mentioned. We must continue to look at the public
ownership of land in rural areas. The Ministry of Defence and the
national health service, for example, are big landowners. A review is
under way, but we need to make more progress so that we can define land
in public ownership for rural housing. We must secure funding for rural
housing enablers, which do tremendous work in bringing together
proposals throughout the country, although their funding is not secure.
We need to resolve that
issue.</p><p><a name="06071143000174">If we are to
combat the elements who do not want to see more affordable housing in
rural areas, we must advance high-quality design proposals that are
sensitive to the environment. We need to consider new models of
delivery and ownership, such as community land trusts and land-swap
levies. We must also have a sensible discussion about second homes.
Some people argue strongly that second homes are the problem and
getting rid of them is the solution, but that is not my perception. I
accept that in parts of the countryside, particularly the south-west
and the national parks, second homes are an issue. However, we are
considering more systematic market
failure.</p><p><a name="06071143000175">I look
forward to reading the Lyons report at the end of the year, because I
presume that Sir Michael Lyons will comment on taxing second homes in
the countryside. Second homes are a problem, but we must not be seduced
into thinking that it is the major problem; the issue is much wider
than
that.</p><p><a name="06071143000176"><b><a name="06071143000498">Andrew
George:</b> It is a major issue in west Cornwall and the Isles
of Scilly, which I represent. Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern
that not only is it a problem, but it sets the tone for the market
price of housing, which is way out of reach of people on the 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 388WH</b><br>lowest incomes in the country, as is the case in my part of the
world? Does he share my concern that in an interview in the
<i>Financial Times</i> last week, the Minister said that the
Government did not intend to follow the affordable rural
housing commission&#146;s recommendation in that
respect?</p><p><a name="06071143000177"><b><a name="06071143000499">Paddy
Tipping:</b> I look forward to hearing what the Minister has
to say about the commission&#146;s recommendation and I shall
consider her comments
closely.</p><p><a name="06071143000178">I accept that
second homes are raising house prices to an exceptional level in
attractive parts of the countryside like the hon. Gentleman&#146;s,
but affordable housing in rural areas is a much wider
problem and is not just connected with second
homes.</p><p><a name="06071143000179">Real leadership
is necessary to deliver affordable housing in rural areas. We are not
talking about concreting over the countryside. The commission&#146;s
proposals would mean that to achieve its targets in population wards of
5,000, we are talking about six houses per community. I believe that
that is achievable and sustainable. We must move away from a notion of
sustainability in the countryside that focuses solely on landscape and
environmental issues. We want a living, changing countryside, a
countryside in which investment can take place, and in which investment
in new housing is investment in a new future for the countryside. We
have heard talk in this Chamber today about the post office network.
There are concerns about small village schools, shops, pubs and bus
services in rural areas. We must move towards younger, more vibrant and
more sustainable villages in our
countryside.</p><p><a name="06071143000180">The
commission has set out an agenda. I do not want it to be an agenda for
discussion; I want it to be an agenda for change. If we are serious
about a living, working countryside, we must take up the
commission&#146;s challenge and make the change. I am confident that
the Government, having set up the commission, will look closely at its
recommendation, follow some of its policy advice and introduce tools
and measures for
change.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000446">11.21
am</h5><p><a name="06071143000181"><b><a name="06071143000500">Mr.
Geoffrey Cox (Torridge and West Devon) (Con):</b> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) on securing
the debate, which is on an extremely important subject. The lack of
affordable housing used to be called the hidden problem in rural areas.
It is now much less hidden due to the efforts of the hon. Gentleman and
others in this Chamber and outside
it.</p><p><a name="06071143000182">My constituency,
rather like that of the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George), is a
south-west constituency. According to figures just published, Torridge
is the worst out of 408 English local authorities in terms of wages,
and wages in West Devon are almost as bad. The published figures for
Torridge and West Devon show that the average house price in Torridge
is &#163;186,000, and the average house price in West Devon is
&#163;235,000. That is 10.6 times average earnings in Torridge and
9.3 times average earnings in West Devon. No doubt the experience of
many hon. Members on both sides of the House who represent rural areas
is that their surgeries are filled 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 389WH</b><br>increasingly with young people, families and single people who find it
almost impossible to find a decent place in which to
live.</p><p><a name="06071143000183">That is why I
welcome the Affordable Rural Housing Commission&#146;s report. I
agree with much of it. I have questions about parts of it, but there is
no doubt that when I began to examine this problem and spoke to the
chief executives and the planning and the housing departments of the
local authorities, I found that the planning system was centre stage as
the main obstacle to the development that both those authorities wanted
to carry out. I congratulate West Devon borough council on its
pioneering approach in this area. It is doing wonderful things and has
recently produced a report that prioritises affordable housing in the
villages as one of its main targets and objectives. That must be a good
precedent; I hope that it will be
repeated.</p><p><a name="06071143000184">The planning
system, however, is a major problem, and I want to raise with the
Minister a specific example from my constituency of a pioneering,
innovative scheme, developed by the community. A village in my
constituency called High Bickington, which has received some national
attention lately, formed a community property trust. The Minister may
be familiar with the story. The village needed a new school. The
Victorian cramped conditions in which the children are taught have been
obviously inadequate for a long time, but instead of deciding to
address only the educational need of the village, those in the village
who were concerned about their community, of whom there were many,
devised a plan that would address not only the need for a new school,
but community woodland, affordable housing and the important
question&#151;I agree with the hon. Member for Sherwood&#151;of
design. If people are to accept the development of their villages, they
must be satisfied that the design quality is high enough for them to
feel easy and comfortable about the expansion in population and the
expansion in building that it
requires.</p><p><a name="06071143000185">The
community property trust in High Bickington worked for several years
and many hundreds of hours&#151;with the assistance, I must say, of
some Government money&#151;to devise a plan. It was recognised from
the outset that that would not be within the local development plan. It
was an innovative departure; it involved pioneering ideas. Several
Ministers visited the scheme and described it as inspirational. So did
the Prince of Wales. The trust&#146;s plans for affordable housing
were exceptionally good ideas. It devised a scheme whereby those whom
it had identified already to occupy the affordable homes that it was
building would receive back, when they handed over the tenancy to a new
family, a sum of money that represented a proportion of the rent above
cost that they had paid to the trust. They would pay their rent and, at
the end of their tenancy, the trust would calculate how much it had
cost it to maintain the building, and over and above that the departing
tenants would receive a sum of money that was small but sufficient to
enable them possibly to move on to a shared equity scheme or some other
form of house ownership. Those ideas were immensely precious
and valuable.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 390WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000186">The trust submitted its
application to Torridge district council, but that council was obliged,
because the application departed from the local plan, to pass it to the
Government office for the south-west. There it languished for many
months, until eventually a public inquiry was held and the planning
inspector decided to recommend against it on the ground that it
departed from the local plan. Imagine the disappointment of those
hundreds of villagers and members of the local community who had
received encouragement from the Government&#151;indeed, a senior
Minister had visited and said that the scheme was
inspirational&#151;only to be confronted with devastating failure.
That is despite their having received Government money for a
scheme&#151;I must make this clear to the Minister&#151;that would
always have departed from the local
plan.</p><p><a name="06071143000187">This is a case,
I would submit, of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing.
The Minister will know that I have written to the Secretary of State,
raising the case and asking for the Secretary of State&#146;s
comments. I hope that she will feel able to comment, because there are
still hundreds of devastated members of the local community, who have
found that when they take the initiative and show the drive and energy
necessary to devise a solution, they come up against the planning
system. They had identified the local families that would be involved.
They had measured carefully the local need. When they take into their
own hands the means by which to produce local and radical solutions to
the problems that they face, they come up against the rock of
bureaucracy and the planning
system.</p><p><a name="06071143000188">I respectfully
suggest that it is vital that the planning system be the subject, from
top to bottom, of a radical review as to whether it favours the
development of rural affordable housing. Only if we take that concerted
approach and have a radical review of the planning system in rural
areas&#151;I agree with Elinor Goodman and the commission&#151;can
we conceivably begin to address the problem that we
face.</p><p><a name="06071143000189">The hon. Member
for Sherwood talked about the need for imagination. The other day, I
was with a representative of South West Water&#151;not a very popular
company, I have to say, in the areas that I and the hon. Member for
North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) represent. I was being told about a plan
that South West Water had and I was shown a map. I invite the other
hon. Gentlemen here from constituencies in the south-west to make an
application for the same map, because it is extremely interesting.
Across the map of the south-west&#151;across Devon and
Cornwall&#151;there were literally hundreds of dots, which showed
brownfield sites. They were disused water processing or other water
sites. Many of them were on the edges of villages and would be ideal
for the development of two or three houses. There were about 100 such
sites in my constituency alone. At least some of those would present
potential opportunities for the development of affordable
housing.</p><p><a name="06071143000190">The company
was telling me that it would like to make the land available for the
purposes of affordable housing. It might be difficult for it to develop
it profitably and viably if it were not permitted at least one
market-priced house, but it does not, as I understand it&#151;some
hon. Members may be sceptical&#151;seek to make a substantial profit.
It wants instead to cross-subsidise, by the production of, say, one
market 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 391WH</b><br>unit and two, three or four other affordable homes. If there are 100
such sites on the edges of villages in my constituency alone, I ask the
House to reflect on what a difference they might make to the problem in
my constituency and other constituencies in the south-west. As the hon.
Member for Sherwood said, however, that requires will and leadership.
It requires a coherent and joined-up approach, which is what currently
seems to be lacking.</p><p><a name="06071143000191">The hon. Gentleman mentioned
farmers. There is no question that many farming families in my
constituency would like to build a bungalow or put up a building for
members of their own family on the farm, so as to be able to work the
farm. However, the planning system makes that very difficult. The hoops
that people must jump through and the hurdles that they must get over
are extremely rigorous. It should not be so, particularly if they are
willing to have an agricultural tie on any such building. I agree with
the hon. Gentleman that barns and redundant outbuildings are also
wonderful opportunities to develop affordable housing.
However&#151;and I say this merely to enter a caution&#151;it might
not be profitable to do that unless at the same time there was
permission to provide perhaps one market-price unit for the purposes of
cross-subsidy.</p><p><a name="06071143000192">I
shall conclude&#151;I know that other hon. Members want to
speak&#151;with an appeal to the Minister. It is critical that the
Government should show that what we are debating is a crucial priority
within their rural housing policy. It is vital that instead of a
regional spatial strategy that is always urban-focused in relation to
development, we should have a specific mainstream policy that will
allow villages to breathe. I know that there is concern about nimbyism.
There is no doubt that people who retire to villages or come to live in
them at other times feel uncomfortable about what they may see as a
threat to the precious way of life in which they have invested, which
was the reason they went there. It is not only retired people or those
who have arrived lately who feel that way. It is precisely those
concerns that can, I believe, be tackled by the concern for design that
the hon. Gentleman has spoken about.</p><p><a name="06071143000193">I ask the Minister seriously to
consider the sort of radical reform of the planning system, or at least
the kind of leadership and will, that the Affordable Rural Housing
Commission has spoken about. High Bickington was a classic example of a
community taking its future into its own hands. However, it was
confronted by bureaucracy and astonishing Government blindness to the
effects of their own policy. That policy both paid for the development
of the plan and then brought about its defeat, because of the
objection, which had been apparent throughout the three or more years
of the scheme&#146;s development period, that it would mean departing
from the local plan. We must have greater imagination and flexibility,
and I urge the Minister to take that message back. Nothing is more
important in the countryside at the moment than genuinely and urgently
tackling the housing
problem.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000447">11.34

David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I apologise, Mrs. Humble,
for the fact that you must listen to me again; but, as I said in the
debate on post offices and 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 392WH</b><br>community services, the debates this morning have a unified theme. They
are not only about how we deliver services but about how people can
live in the countryside and use them.</p><p><a name="06071143000195">I thank my hon. Friend the
Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) for securing a debate on this issue
now, and for explaining it so carefully and clearly, with numbers that
even I can understand, to show the depth of the current crisis and why
we must do something about it. I am pleased to follow the hon. and
learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox), if for no other
reason than that the Minister may hear his plaintive cry for the High
Bickington scheme. It is a brilliant scheme and one that needs to be
moved forward. I know that planning rules exist, but I have always
believed that rules are there to be broken if that would lead to a
better outcome; we sometimes have a negative way of turning things down
for reasons that are difficult to
understand.</p><p><a name="06071143000196">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Sherwood would expect me to say, one of the pleas
that needs to be made is for progress with the idea of community land
trusts, which feature prominently in the report. I hope that the
Government will sign up to the report lock, stock and barrel. It is
really very good and well written, and it is possible to read it and
think, &#147;This makes sense.&#148; Nothing less is to be expected
from a body chaired by Elinor Goodman, the political journalist. If she
cannot put the information across, no one can. However, its quality is
due also to other members of the commission, including our late
lamented colleague Peter Bradley, and Mark Shucksmith, who probably
understands more about rural communities than most of us would ever
claim to. There are people of real importance involved, and I hope that
the Minister is presently not just dwelling on the report but
considering the points for action.</p><p><a name="06071143000197">The report is a road map that
will take us forward. It contains ideas whose time has come, among
which are community land trusts. I shall quickly plug the Cashes Green
scheme in my community, which receives a mention in the report. It is
described as a model, but things seem to be somewhat more complicated
than they might. We need to unravel the complexities and recognise that
such schemes are a way to move forward in rural communities such as
High Bickington. The problem is often about locking the land away. If
it is possible to control the land, the equity value that can be taken
from it, and which people can share in, provides people with a reward.
The important things are the land, its ownership, and communalising
that.</p>

<p><a name="06071143000198">I am not here to
have a dig at the Minister, but perhaps we can clear some of the
history of local authority ownership of housing out the way. The
Government have a brilliant record on the decent homes standard. We do
not congratulate ourselves enough, but we are driving that forward and
it is almost certain that we shall reach our target by 2010. I feel
slightly argumentative about who should own the property in question,
but I do not want to get bogged down in that. The most important thing
is to recognise that social ownership of housing is a key
factor.</p><p><a name="06071143000199">The Minister
was at a seminar that I attended a couple of weeks ago. It was
interesting, because we examined some of the complexities in models of
social ownership across the domain, but particularly in rural 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 393WH</b><br>areas. I made the point that local authorities have a key role to play
and that leadership is sometimes lacking. It is too easy to abdicate
responsibility and blame the planning process. I expect local
authorities to be determined, and to make it clear that they will keep
coming back until they deliver the schemes in villages and market towns
as well as urban areas. That is their responsibility and what they are
elected to do. They must sometimes take on the nimbies. This is about
pointing out to people&#151;this is linked to the previous
debate&#151;that there will be no services in rural Britain unless
people of different ages, classes and, dare I say it, ethnic
backgrounds move in to regenerate those communities. That will have to
happen and will have to be encouraged.</p><p><a name="06071143000200">I have two more points to make;
I know that other hon. Members want to contribute. I hope that we can
agree across the parties that the commission is brilliant and is worthy
of full support, and that this is simply a question of pushing the
Government even further in trying to get more resources going in
faster.</p><p><a name="06071143000201">I was
interested to receive a paper from Shelter on this matter. Too often,
we think of homelessness as an urban and city problem. Purely by
chance, I was talking to a couple of people from a Christian group in
Stroud called Marah, which was set up four or five years ago. Its
initial aim was simply to offer a warm meal in the day, and it now
operates on at least three days a week, providing meals for people who
need them. One would think that we were talking about two or three
people, but the group regularly feeds 70 people, 50 of whom it believes
to be genuinely homeless, although not necessarily on the street. In
rural areas there can be a lot of sofa surfing and people are often
able to find residences for a while. Many such people have dependency
problems with alcohol and drugs and believe that they are forgotten.
Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence that they are. Inevitably, we
are talking about people who can speak for themselves and aspire to
some form of ownership or look to get some form of social rent, but let
us remember that there are people below that level in rural
areas&#151;as you well know, Mrs. Humble&#151;as well as in more
urban settings.</p><p><a name="06071143000202">My
next point is, perhaps, sometimes forgotten. One of the key reasons for
providing accommodation in rural areas is because a lot of jobs are
being created in such areas at the moment, but that cannot work if
there is no housing for people to live and work there. This is about
squaring a circle: we must be cleverer in market towns and villages. We
must recognise that if we are to provide for our older people, we need
the people who can provide such care to live and work locally, or that
will not happen. In the Cotswolds, and coming into my constituency,
there is a care problem. People simply are not able to live and work
there because they cannot afford to travel from Gloucester or
Cheltenham. That is a real problem.</p><p><a name="06071143000203"><b><a name="06071143000502">Alison
Seabeck (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab):</b> My hon. Friend makes
an extremely interesting point. In urban areas, we face demand
pressures from people who are coming from the rural hinterland because
they cannot afford to live in the market towns and villages. Indeed,
they are the very people who we need to take 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 394WH</b><br>up the employment that is now in those areas. In Plymouth, we now have
the third-highest-rising house prices in the country, and that is
partly because of the pressure on our young people to leave towns and
villages and go to urban areas where they can afford
housing.</p><p><a name="06071143000204"><b><a name="06071143000503">Mr.
Drew:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her comments, because I
have always believed that rural and urban problems are not separate,
but interlinked. Problems in different areas may have different
gradations and stresses, but they are essentially the same
problems.</p><p><a name="06071143000205">We should
not isolate housing from either service provision, which depends on
people coming and enhancing vibrancy in communities, or employment. It
is a myth that people want to live in rural areas and commute miles and
miles. If they do, they are wrong, and they may have to take slightly
less well-paid jobs so that their quality of life will improve, which
is, of course, why they moved to a rural area in the first place. The
sustainability which is so vital, and for which we must all change our
lifestyles, can be achieved only if people recognise that they have to
make some sacrifices. If they want to live in those communities, they
must work more locally. The good news is that, with the rolling out of
the internet, plenty of jobs are being created in the service sector in
rural areas; we simply need the houses there for people to live in so
that they can do those
jobs.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000448">11.45
am</h5><p><a name="06071143000206"><b><a name="06071143000504">Andrew
George (St. Ives) (LD):</b> It is, as ever, a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who speaks with
great articulacy on issues concerning rural communities, as well as
international issues. He is certainly known as a rural champion in the
House.</p><p><a name="06071143000207">I congratulate
the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) on having secured this
important debate and on having set out so accurately the issues before
us today. I am keen to hear the Minister&#146;s response to his
points, and will therefore do my best to keep my remarks as brief as
possible to allow the winding-up speakers to give the Minister as long
as possible to address the relevant issues.</p><p><a name="06071143000208">I congratulate also the hon.
and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) on his speech.
We are relatively near neighbours, although he represents an English
seat and I a Cornish one. Our constituencies are not many miles apart,
and we therefore share a geographical connection. Our constituencies
are both affected by many of the same issues.</p><p><a name="06071143000209">I return to a point that I
mentioned in my intervention on the hon. Member for Sherwood. The
Government&#146;s figures on second home ownership clearly show that
Cornwall has by far the highest level, proportionately, of second homes
anywhere in the country, followed by Cumbria, Dorset, Norfolk, Devon
and East Sussex. This is not simply about the politics of envy. I still
count among my friends many people who own second homes in my
constituency, despite all that I say about the impact that they have on
the local community. This is a question of the practical management of
the existing housing stock and the impact that it has on local
people.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 395WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000210">Given the way in which the
housing market works in areas such as mine in west Cornwall and the
Isles of Scilly, it is almost as though local people&#151;Cornish
folk&#151;do not have any right to live there. I can speak only about
my area, although I know a little about the housing market in other
parts of the country, having worked as a quasi-rural enabler in
Nottinghamshire, Devon and elsewhere. The only options available to
local people are to leave the area or live on low-cost reservations.
Surely that is not the way forward if we are to have a housing supply
that provides any sort of equity for the community who have been living
there.</p><p><a name="06071143000211">We know that
the market is dysfunctional and that house prices are high, having
doubled in the past five years in Cornwall. Figures on this are
regularly trotted out, and I could trot out more, but I will not, which
show clearly that the bottom rung of the housing ladder is now well
beyond the reach of local people. Last year, I undertook a survey of
local estate agents, which showed that twice as many properties in my
constituency were sold to second-home buyers as to first-time buyers. I
was surprised that any properties had been sold to first-time buyers,
because I could not believe that any properties in my constituency were
any longer affordable to local people. They must have benefited from
the recent loss of an aunt or other rich relative. It is certainly not
possible, on local wages, to get on to even the bottom rung of the
housing ladder.</p><p><a name="06071143000212">In
addition, the public rented sector is extremely small; it is well below
10 per cent. of the housing stock, compared with 15, 16 or 20 per cent.
in many urban areas. The private rented sector is smaller still. In
many urban areas, such as London, the private rented sector might be
expensive, but it is relatively healthy. The rents chargeable on
private rented properties in my area are well in excess of anything
that the housing benefit system is prepared to offer. Local reference
rents are entirely unrealistic, compared with what local people are
charged in the market. As a result, the situation is extremely
difficult.</p><p><a name="06071143000213">The hon.
Member for Stroud referred to the problem of homelessness, but where
does the problem go? It does not go on to the streets, but into
quarries, caravans at the backs of farms, garages and garden sheds on
the Isles of Scilly. People do not sleep on park benches quite so much
but they do live in lichgates outside churches and elsewhere.
Yesterday, in the Salvation Army hall in Penzance, I was a panel member
at a Cornwall independent poverty forum hearing, which was organised by
the diocese of Truro. Local young single men told us about people who
were earning a living, but who were unable to afford even to rent a
flat. We are talking not about people who are unemployed, but about
people who are actually earning and who cannot find a place to live.
That is happening in west Cornwall and, indeed, on the Isles of Scilly.
That is the serious nature of the problem that we face.</p><p><a name="06071143000214">Of course, simply building
homes is not the answer. People talk rather blithely about the Kate
Barker report and about the thousands of houses that are needed to meet
housing need in rural areas, but that is a simplistic response, which
will not address the problem. Over the past 30 years, Cornwall has had
one of the fastest growing populations in the country, as well as the
number of houses that have been built as a 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 396WH</b><br>proportion of the overall housing supply. However, it has one of the
worst housing problems&#151;if not the worst housing
problem&#151;in the country, so simply building houses is not the
answer.</p><p><a name="06071143000215">Although I
think that the planning system was set up with entirely honourable
intentions, it deals, sadly, only with the supply side of the
demand/supply equation, as I said in an intervention on the hon. Member
for Sherwood. It must be recognised that it is creating scarcity on the
supply side, which affects the market value of the land on which it
allows people to build. Sadly, human frailties being what they are,
that means that the system is fuelled by greed, rather than need.
Landowners go to extreme lengths to persuade the local planning
committee that they must have permission to build on their land. They
know that getting that permission will turn one acre of agricultural
land, which might be worth about &#163;3,000, into something that
could be worth &#163;500,000 or more. Planning committees are, in
effect, writing cheques for lottery sums for landowners, and we end up
with people not having to work terribly hard to gain a great deal of
income.</p><p><a name="06071143000216">What does
that do for local housing need? The answer is absolutely nothing if
there is no affordable element. Even if one uses the planning gain
approach, which I describe as the planning bribe approach, and builds
some affordable housing, that still multiplies the price of the land to
a large extent. We must therefore address the need to construct a new
rung on the housing ladder. The intermediate market is not there and it
needs to be constructed. Shared equity, mutual housing and other forms
of property semi-ownership clearly need to be created.</p><p><a name="06071143000217">In an interview in the
<i>Financial Times </i>on 3 July&#151;I think that the Minister knows
my views about it&#151;she said that second home ownership
was</p><a name="06071143000420"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not a significant
factor affecting
affordability&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000218">Well, it
is in an area such as mine and in many other parts of the country. It
might not be a significant factor affecting affordability throughout
the country, but in areas where it is an issue, it is very significant;
it sets the tone for the market price and has a tremendous impact.
</p><p><a name="06071143000219"><b><a name="06071143000505">Alison
Seabeck:</b> On the issue of second homes, the commission
discussed the option of tighter fiscal controls, and many contributors
felt that higher taxes on second homes and holiday lets might be the
way to go. Does the hon. Gentleman have a view on
that?</p><p><a name="06071143000220"><b><a name="06071143000506">Andrew
George:</b> There are only two ways to go. One is to make
second home ownership fiscally less attractive. The Liberal Democrat
tax commission has made it publicly known that we are looking at adding
further taxes to capital gains tax to discourage second home ownership
in certain circumstances. The other way is through the planning system.
The knotty problem has always been how to define second homes, and I
think that it can be defined through the taxation system. Once we agree
on the mechanism that we use to define it, we can describe second home
ownership as a separate and quite distinct use from permanent
occupation. Under the use classes order, such use would be subject to a
planning application that gave the local authority the opportunity to
constrain the 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 397WH</b><br>number or proportion of second and holiday homes in communities where
the scarcity of properties had caused housing problems.</p><p><a name="06071143000221">There are therefore two
approaches to addressing the issue of affordability. I should say in
parenthesis that my comments on second home ownership and planning
should apply only to the lifetime of the occupancy; otherwise, we would
have a stupid situation, in which we would all be applying to change
our properties from first to second home use because of the premium
market value that would apply to the property after the
change.</p><p><a name="06071143000222">My final point
relates to the intermediate market. Clearly, that is the direction in
which Government policy needs to go in rural areas where the mismatch
between very low earnings and very high house prices is creating such
tremendous problems. Although this sounds counterintuitive, one of the
best ways to make progress would be to start by saying that there will
be no further development in rural areas, but that, as an exception, we
will use planning policy statement 3 to constrain land prices. Land
prices are the big constraint on achieving any sort of affordable
housing.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000449">11.59
am</h5><p><a name="06071143000224"><b><a name="06071143000507">Mr.
Dan Rogerson (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> I should like to echo
the sentiments of other hon. Members in paying tribute to the hon.
Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) for securing this debate, which is
particularly important and timely, given that the Affordable Rural
Housing Commission report, to which he and other hon. Members referred,
was published some weeks ago, and we are now moving towards the recess,
so hon. Members will have a valuable chance to comment on it and seek
indications from the Minister as to how the Government intend to
respond.</p><p><a name="06071143000225">The hon.
Gentleman gave a clear indication of the size and nature of the problem
that is facing communities in rural areas. The housing dimension
interacts with other problems in rural areas where, in the past,
poverty has been concealed. The report by the Commission for Rural
Communities highlights the fact that one in five people in rural areas
is living in poverty, and seeks to show that these issues are
interrelated and that the unaffordability of housing has a great impact
on people&#146;s ability to exist on the income that they
receive.</p><p><a name="06071143000226">In many
cases, the examples of poverty do not show up because they are in small
pockets in what would seem to be wealthier communities. That reflects
the need for housing. As the hon. Gentleman said, we are not talking
about huge developments in villages; we are talking about the need for
one or two, or perhaps five to 10, houses in small villages and the
fact that they would have a huge impact in tackling the problem of
unaffordability.</p><p><a name="06071143000227">The
problem is getting worse in that the disparity between incomes and
house prices is growing. The nature of the right to buy has meant that
many villages now do not have any, or have very few, homes that are
still available in the conventional social rented sector. People are
forced either into staying on longer with 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 398WH</b><br>extended family, if they still have family in those communities, or into
relocating to other parts of the country or to urban areas, as we heard
in the contribution from the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)
and the intervention by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison
Seabeck).</p><p><a name="06071143000228">The
consequences of the shortage of affordable housing in rural areas
include overcrowding, where young adults, young couples and so on are
forced to stay on longer in the family home. That can have health
implications. I have seen in my surgery, as other hon. Members will
have in theirs, the genuine anguish that exists in families and the
impact on children who are growing up in inadequate housing. There can
be problems whereby relationships then break up because they cannot
cope with the strain. I saw a recent example where the number of
children in a family was not quite enough to secure a banding that
would have allowed the local authority to prioritise this particular
application under the homefinder system and choice-based letting. The
pressure of the circumstances in which that family was living was
great. The couple broke up and a new dimension was added to the
problems that they were experiencing.</p><p><a name="06071143000229">The issue has effects not just
on people as individuals and as families, but on the rural economy. If
people cannot afford to live in rural areas but they still work there,
they need to travel back into those areas, as the hon. Member for
Stroud pointed out. We hear about sustainable development being that in
the larger towns and on their edges, but that is not the case, because
people are being forced to commute, almost invariably by car, back into
the rural areas, and that has an effect.
</p><p><a name="06071143000230">The issue has an
effect on the rural economy in terms of local shops and businesses. If
younger families are not able to exist and to live in rural areas,
those business will be affected. In my constituency and those of many
other hon. Members in rural areas, small schools are a valuable part of
village life. They, too, are under threat. We are now entering a period
in which the change in the demographics might mean that a number of
small schools will face problems. That can only be exacerbated by the
lack of affordable housing in rural areas.</p><p><a name="06071143000231">The break-up of extended
families undermines the social network that exists to ensure that where
problems are experienced relatives are on hand to lend a
helping hand. In effect, some rural villages, particularly in the
south-east, are becoming dormitories and commuter villages.</p><p><a name="06071143000232">As with all problems of this
nature, the causes are complex; they are never straightforward. It is
clear that one dimension is the lack of supply. We need to build more.
The report that I mentioned discusses&#151;Shelter has supported
this, as we have heard&#151;the need for about 11,000 affordable
homes a year to start to meet the need. I understand that the Housing
Corporation has set aside the funding for about 3,000, so there is a
huge gap to be made up.</p><p><a name="06071143000233">We also need to examine the
issue of planning. The contribution from the hon. and learned Member
for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) was timely, and he gave a
heartbreaking example of how a community&#146;s hopes had been
raised, people had been invited to participate in coming up with
innovative solutions and 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 399WH</b><br>then the existing system had failed them at a crucial juncture. I look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s comments on the issues he
raised.</p><p><a name="06071143000234"><b><a name="06071143000508">Julia
Goldsworthy (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD):</b> Does my hon.
Friend agree that part of the planning issue derives from a lack of
flexibility for local communities to identify their own particular
problems and to find their own solutions. Does he agree that the
Sustainable Communities Bill, which has the support of more than half
the House in an early-day motion, might be one mechanism to allow local
communities to identify their own problems and solutions, and to get
Government support to help them overcome those problems? We could
overcome the problem of the unintended consequences of national policy
on the local community.</p><p><a name="06071143000235"><b><a name="06071143000509">Mr.
Rogerson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her contribution and
pay tribute to her work in support of the Sustainable Communities Bill.
I am a signatory to that early-day motion and have spoken at a public
meeting in my constituency&#151;I know other hon. Members will have
done the same in their constituencies&#151;in support of the
Bill&#146;s concept. The Bill will make a valuable contribution to
allowing local communities to take control of these issues, come up
with innovative solutions and, hopefully, put them into practice;
unfortunately, I have not been able to do so thus
far.</p><p><a name="06071143000236">There are also
problems in respect of the new regional spatial strategy, as the hon.
Member for Sherwood pointed out. The pressure to examine sustainability
in terms of public transport infrastructure, travel-to-work areas and
so on is having the effect of encouraging regional spatial strategies
to focus new developments almost completely within larger settlements
or on their edges&#151;on green belt land. We have heard that there
are examples of brownfield sites in the rural areas, and we need to be
examining those as well. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that
the regional spatial strategy process, as it moves forward, will also
include more support for small, appropriate schemes in smaller towns
and villages.</p><p><a name="06071143000237">The
problem is also caused by the issue of land pricing. My hon. Friend the
Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) made a valuable contribution when
he spoke about his area&#146;s experiences of development, the
attitude of some landowners to the planning process and how their land
might be used to meet&#151;or not to meet&#151;the problems that
their community is
facing.</p><p><a name="06071143000238">Local councils
do not always insist on enough affordable housing. There are examples
of councils that have taken a tougher line on the matter and I hope
that we will encourage councils to take the opportunities that exist to
deal with the problem. There are a number of indications in the
Commission&#146;s report of where it feels that Government policy
could expand that area to give more opportunities to local authorities
to tackle these problems. We also need to be aware that some guidelines
could be clearer and the message could be stronger for local
authorities to take advantage of existing possibilities.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 400WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000239">I will touch on the crucial
issue of second homes as a cause, which my hon. Friend raised. We have
heard about the league table that shows which counties that is a
particular problem in, and I speak not just as a member of my
party&#146;s team of spokespeople on this issue but as a Member of
Parliament for a Cornwall constituency. In North Cornwall it is a huge
problem. The parish of Crantoch in my constituency wrote to all the
parishes in Cornwall to ask them to come up with a figure for the
number of second homes in their parishes. Some appalling statistics
came back from some parishes and showed the distortion. I believe that
in Manaccan in my hon. Friend&#146;s constituency the figure was 80
per cent. That is clearly unsustainable. Sustainability in the round is
vital.</p><p><a name="06071143000240">For solutions I
refer hon. Members to South Shropshire where councils have taken a
robust line with developers to ensure every opportunity of providing as
many affordable homes as possible. We must look at methods of providing
council homes, whether through the taxation system or, more helpfully,
a planning category for second homes. The Government must make every
effort in their spending commitments to ensure that additional money is
provided for more affordable rural housing
schemes.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000450">12.11

Robert Syms (Poole) (Con):</b> As we are straying into
planning policy, Mr. Hood, I declare an interest as the director of a
property and building
company.</p><p><a name="06071143000242">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) on the
sensible and measured way in which he introduced the debate. With
housing matters, it is usually easier to identify the problems than to
identify the solutions, but, unusually for a debate in this place, a
number of good ideas have come out of our debate today. Some have come
from the commission&#146;s work and some from hon. Members&#146;
experience, which proves that there are solutions. However, I am not
sure that they are solutions from the centre; I think that they are
solutions that must be delivered in those communities with the greatest
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06071143000243">I shall
set the context. The number of affordable homes being built has fallen
over the past half a dozen years. In 1996-97, 32,489 were built and in
2004-05, 22,823 were built. Although the trend is now upward, we did
not expect that fall when a left-wing Government were elected. There
has also been a substantial collapse in the number of first-time
buyers. There were 503,000 in 1997, which fell to 320,000 in 2005. Some
of that fall is due to changes in the housing market and some to
lifestyle changes. Some people want to do their own thing in Kathmandu
and to buy a property in their 30s rather than in their 20s, which was
perhaps the case in the 1980s. Nevertheless, there is a real
problem.</p><p><a name="06071143000244">The hon.
Member for Sherwood set out clearly the problems in rural areas. A
statistic that I saw recently was that in 2003 37 per cent. of people
in rural areas paid more than half their income in mortgage payments
whereas only 26 per cent. in urban areas did so. Some of that is a
feature of lower wage levels, but certainly people are willing to gear
up to get their little corner of England. The result is that there are
real 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 401WH</b><br>burdens. Those who were born and grew up in an area face substantial
competition and
difficulties.</p><p><a name="06071143000245">I feel
that I should say something nice about second home owners, partly
because of the tone of the debate. I do not consider them necessarily
negative, negative, negative. I understand what Cornwall Members are
saying. We have the same problems in Dorset, and they cause particular
housing problems. The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)
mentioned some of the problems, not least definition. Second home
owners are often people who have grown up in an area but have moved
away to work and intend to return when they retire. They inject money
into the local economy. Second homes are sometimes rented to tourists
and tourism is very important in the south-west.</p><p><a name="06071143000246">It is interesting to note the
personnel who have taken part in the debate. Although they have changed
a little during the past hour and a half, two thirds of the hon.
Members in the Chamber are from the south-west of England. If one put a
pin in the area with the real pressure, it would be the
south-west.</p><p><a name="06071143000247"><b><a name="06071143000511">Andrew
George:</b> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman is
saying about second homes. With the benefit of hindsight, does he think
that it was a good or bad idea to spend hundreds of millions of pounds
through the council tax subsidy under Conservative legislation
subsidising wealthy people to have second homes when so many thousands
of people in areas like mine cannot afford a first
home?</p><p><a name="06071143000248"><b><a name="06071143000512">Mr.
Syms:</b> That has changed now, and they pay 90 per
cent. of the council tax. My party has accepted that, but when second
homes are sold they attract capital gains tax, which first homes do
not. Most Members of Parliament have a second home for their work and
face capital gains tax on either their property in London or their
property in their constituency. There are fiscal disincentives. Even if
a definition could be found, I am not sure whether two housing markets
could be created. That is possible in the Channel Islands, which have
special status, but I am not sure that it is possible
here.</p><p><a name="06071143000249">To return to the
tenor of the debate, if we focus heavily on second home owners, we miss
the point, which is finding land for development. The key point that
was raised by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and
West Devon (Mr. Cox) and the hon. Members for Sherwood and for
Stroud (Mr. Drew) is the difficulty of finding suitable sites
for affordable homes. Most of my experience of rural areas comes from
when I was a district and county councillor in Wiltshire. I was always
surprised that growth was pushed into towns and that the villages had
lines drawn around them that were so fierce&#151;they sometimes went
through people&#146;s gardens&#151;that it was almost impossible to
have any organic growth.</p><p><a name="06071143000250">The hon. Member for Stroud made
an important point about services and one factor is that unless there
is some organic growth in villages, a proper cross-section of people
and ages is not retained and services such as post offices, schools and
rural transport are not provided as the population becomes slightly
more 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 402WH</b><br>elderly and perhaps slightly better off, so the way in which the area
grows is distorted. The growth factor is
important.</p><p><a name="06071143000251">On the
question of farms, in my experience there are sometimes opportunities
for both light industrial use and housing growth on farms on the edge
of villages, but that tends to create strong emotions. When I was
leader of a district council, we made proposals for certain villages to
become local centres to allow more growth. I have never been faced with
such a large avalanche of letters and protests from people in those
villages who did not want them to grow. The difficulties are
understandable.</p><p><a name="06071143000252">The
solution is to give a lot more flexibility to local planners. If local
people are given the ability to vary local planning without an
inspector overruling them, they are in much the best position to create
local solutions to local problems. I know numerous examples of district
and parish councils signing up to schemes, but being overruled by
national planning policy. I hope that when the Minister looks at
planning policy statement 3 she will allow a degree of flexibility for
housing in rural
areas.</p>

<p><a name="06071143000253">We heard that
11,000 units are needed, which is not an awful lot, and it should not
be beyond the wit of people in rural communities to provide that. We
have heard today of water companies, the Ministry of Defence and a
number of public corporations that have sites in rural areas that could
be adjusted and used. The local solution is the best solution and some
sensible ideas have come up today. I understand the strong passions and
emotions about the second home argument, but I do not think that it is
the key. The key argument is to provide suitable sites for land so that
our villages can grow more organically.</p><p><a name="06071143000254">Design is terribly important.
Sometimes, the best way of getting the design that one wants is to
control the land, which Prince Charles has often done, particularly
with his developments in places such as Poundbury in Dorset. His
control of the land allowed him to do rather more with the development.
We must consider giving local planning committees more flexibility on
design. I am not sure that we want all housing to look the same,
whether it is in Warrington, Basingstoke or Plymouth. Local materials
and the local look not only adds diversity but can make our country
look more
attractive.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000451">12.20
pm</h5><p><a name="06071143000255"><b><a name="06071143000513">The
Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) on securing
the debate, and on raising the issue of the Affordable Rural Housing
Commission report, which is widely agreed to be extremely important and
weighty. The Government added to that report. We set up the commission
precisely because we were concerned about affordability pressures in
rural areas. Such areas face all sorts of additional challenges and
wider issues to do with affordability. We are looking to develop some
of the recommendations and to take forward the commission&#146;s
work. I shall try to give hon. Members a flavour of some of the work
now under
way.</p><p><a name="06071143000256">However, we
recognise that there is a wider problem of affordability that affects
both rural and urban areas; my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood is
right 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 403WH</b><br>about that. Housing supply is simply not keeping up with housing demand.
More than 200,000 new households are formed each year, but only about
160,000 new homes are built a year. The level of house building is
significantly lower than it was, say, 30 years ago. As long as there is
that gap between new household formation and the number of homes built,
there will be growing pressures on affordability across the country in
future. Our assessment and research suggests that if we simply carry on
at the current rate of house building, over the next 20 years the
proportion of 30-year-old couples able to afford their own home is
likely to drop from more than 50 per cent. to nearer 30 per
cent. That is simply unsustainable, given the aspirations of first-time
buyers and the next generation.</p><p><a name="06071143000257">My hon. Friend is right that
rural areas face particular problems, and hon. Members raised a series
of issues. Problems can include restrictions on areas in which homes
can be built, the planning system, and the quite proper need to protect
the countryside in rural areas. It is important to recognise that there
can be different levels of wages in rural areas; in particular,
agricultural wages can be much lower. We also have to recognise that
there are wide variations between rural communities. Small coalfield
villages that face regeneration challenges are different to affluent
commuter villages, which are different again to coastal villages. Rural
areas will face very different challenges, and we should not make the
mistake of assuming that there is a single answer for all rural
areas.</p><p><a name="06071143000258">Equally, we
need to recognise the challenges set out in the Affordable Rural
Housing Commission&#146;s report. The commission challenged the
approach to sustainability that was built into the planning system some
time ago. Often, the well- intentioned responseto the need to
protect brownfield development and to ensure sustainable development in
terms of transport, including public transport, has been to focus the
vast majority of new development around big cities and towns. However,
as the commission makes clear, the consequence is that some of the
wider issues around sustainability that affect rural areas have not
been considered.</p><p><a name="06071143000259">Hon.
Members have pointed out the challenges that result when young people
cannot afford to buy homes in the villages and rural areas where they
grew up. They move out, and local schools can become unsustainable as a
result. Just as there is an ageing population, there can be ageing
villages, as young people often cannot stay in the area because there
are no homes for them to move into. The approach taken by the
commission is right; we need to consider the idea of the living,
working, and changing countryside, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Sherwood said. That is why we have stated that we need to reform the
approach through planning policy guidance, and through our new draft
policy on planning for housing, planning policy statement 3. The
commission welcomes our approach to PPS3, and says that it builds in
the kind of flexibility that we need when approaching the subject of
rural areas. We need to allow them to grow where necessary, and to
respond to local
demands.</p><p><a name="06071143000260">The hon. and
learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) mentioned a case
in his constituency. He will be aware that I cannot comment on
individual 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 404WH</b><br>planning cases. I was not involved in the decision, and although I am
aware of the case, he will know that I cannot comment on its details.
However, I would like to address some of the broader issues linked to
it. He asked a question that was really about whether there should be
more flexibility for small sites in rural areas where needed housing
could be developed. I agree that there should be, and that is exactly
why PPS3 tries to incorporate that approach for the
future.</p><p><a name="06071143000261">The hon. and
learned Gentleman asked, effectively, whether it should be easier to
adapt to housing need and not to be bound by out-of-date local plans. I
think that it should be easier to update local plans, and that is why
we are changing the approach to planning to encourage local development
frameworks. Aspects of such frameworks can be updated much more easily.
Also, the change will mean that decision makers need not simply respond
to decisions that may have been made years ago about the housing needed
in a particular area, but could instead consider current need and
market demand, and so could be more responsive to market approaches.
That is our new approach as part of PPS3 and as part of the response to
the Barker inquiry.</p><p><a name="06071143000262">There are two ways for hon.
Members who face such problems in their area to deal with the issue.
First, they can think about what can be done in their area to update
local plans more rapidly and to take advantage of the changes that we
have made to the broader planning system; secondly, they can consider
how applications measure up against the new approach in PPS3. We hope
to publish the final version of the planning policy statement later in
the year; we have already published the draft for consultation. It is
useful to compare planning applications that are currently coming
through with the approach in the new
guidance.</p><p><a name="06071143000263">Hon. Members
mentioned the need for shared ownership and social housing, which is an
important subject. Predominantly rural districts account for about 23
per cent. of the population, and get about 21 per cent. of the
social housing budget. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood mentioned
smaller local areas. Some 19 per cent. of the population live in
settlements of fewer than 10,000 people, and just 10 per cent. of the
programme budget is spent on them. That suggests that, although a
proportionate share of resources goes to predominantly rural districts
as a whole, my hon. Friend is right that social housing is being built
predominantly in market towns and larger communities. My hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) asked what we would do to support
social housing, and asked whether we could use community land trusts. I
agree with him that we have an important opportunity to support more
social housing and shared ownership in smaller
communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000264">There are
particular opportunities for the use of section 106 of the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990, which the hon. Member for North
Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) mentioned. Nationally, 140,000 new
homes were built in 2004. Of those, 100,000 were built with no
developer contribution at all to either affordable housing or
infrastructure. That is not fair. As a result, rural areas in
particular can end up not getting their fair share of shared ownership
and social housing. Our assessment was that if all rural 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 405WH</b><br>communities could do as well as the best rural communities in getting
resources out of section 106 and the planning gain system, there would
be substantially more affordable homes being built in rural areas, and
we particularly support that.</p><p><a name="06071143000265">The hon. Member for St. Ives
(Andrew George) raised the issue of second homes. The <i>Financial
Times</i> asked me about the national approach, and we were talking
about the national economy. The fact is that second homes account for
about 1 per cent. of overall housing stock. There are plenty of rural
and urban areas in which second homes account for less than
0.5 per cent. of housing stock. The reality is that the national
housing market and the national affordability problem is driven by lack
of housing supply, not by issues to do with second homes.</p><p><a name="06071143000266">However, I recognise that in
some areas second homes create particular pressures. Some communities
do face particular pressures; we have always recognised that. We asked
the Affordable Rural Housing Commission to look into that because we
thought it such an important issue. However, the challenge faced by the
commission is one that hon. Members have long debated in this House: it
is the issue of what workable measures can be used to address the
problem. That is difficult, but we have to recognise that there are
broader issues, including the amount of affordable housing and new
supply. We have to do something to challenge that problem across the
country.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 406WH</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06071143000003">Charitable and Community

opportunity to raise a matter that concerns a great number of people. I
should like to bring to the attention of the House the way in which
local police authorities invoke section 25(1) of the Police Act 1996 to
charge charitable community events considerable sums for police cover.
It puts scores of events at risk by making them financially unviable.
In Devon and Cornwall alone, some 80 annual charitable community
events, which are a vital and cherished part of community life, may
disappear.</p><p><a name="06071143000269">Section 25
of the 1996 Act
states:</p><a name="06071143000421"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
chief officer of police of a police force may provide, at the request
of any person, special police services at any premises or in any
locality in the police area for which the force is maintained, subject
to the payment to the police authority of charges on such scales as may
be determined by that
authority.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000270">That
provision replaced an earlier, identical section, section 15(1) of the
Police Act 1964, which itself was based on common law established by
Glasbrook Brothers Ltd <i>v. </i>Glamorgan county council in
1925.</p><p><a name="06071143000271">Why am I
concerning myself with a well established and historical police power?
Until recently, the police did not exercise the power in relation to
charitable and community events, but the varying attitudes of police
authorities throughout the country have created an unequal and unfair
playing field. Community events flourish in areas where police choose
not to charge, while in others, community life grinds to a standstill
as police price events out of existence.</p><p><a name="06071143000272">The House needs no convincing
about the benefits of such charitable and community events. They bring
together communities, foster social cohesion, maintain precious
traditions and enhance our cultural life through the hard work and
dedication of altruistic volunteers who give up their time for the
benefit of the community. However, the current legislation draws no
distinction between charging for the charitable community event and the
commercial profit-making event. It also provides no clarification of
what constitutes &#147;special police services&#148; above and
beyond what the police are obliged to provide as part of their regular
service. It devolves the entire responsibility for setting the scale of
charges to individual police authorities. Yet again, we see a postcode
lottery. As in the health service, it is true of the police
service.</p><p><a name="06071143000273">The Notting
Hill carnival escapes any charge whatever for a considerable policing
cost that runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds, because the
Metropolitan police do not charge for such community events; but the
organisers of the Dart music festival in Dartmouth, which is minuscule
in comparison, were whacked with an initial bill of &#163;16,095.15.
As a result of negotiations, the bill was reduced to &#163;5,875, and
finally, after further negotiations, to &#163;2,742.35. I am not sure
whether the role of the constabulary in Devon and Cornwall is not more
like that of a car salesman. One haggles with the individual police
inspector over 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 407WH</b><br>how much one should pay for policing. It is not the way that I see
policing, and the public do not want to see it continue
either.</p><p><a name="06071143000274">One would
have thought that throughout the land, constabularies would wish to
promote good deeds and community enterprise. At least the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner recognises that each year the Notting Hill carnival
has helped to cement good race relations and bolster good community
spirit. In spite of massive police presence, he refuses to make any
charge whatever to the organisers in London. What is wrong with the
Devon and Cornwall constabulary? Why cannot it recognise the benefits
to the community of events such as the Dart community festival, and
soon the Dart regatta?</p><p><a name="06071143000275"><b><a name="06071143000515">Mr.

for attending the debate. If he catches your eye, Mr. Hood, I feel sure
that he will be able to develop that point. The whole House would
welcome hearing from him, as it always does. He highlights no more than
an anxiety throughout Devon and Cornwall. The police have suddenly
discovered that they have the powers, which are nothing new, as they
have been available since 1925, to squeeze more money out of a
hard-pressed community that already pays taxes, and pays council taxes
to the police. Communities will be charged even more if they do
anything socially useful.</p><p><a name="06071143000278">The question may well be asked,
will the police charge for antisocial behaviour? When they catch a
group of young people, will they send them a charge, too? Besides a
criminal charge, will there be a civil charge for the police time spent
apprehending them? That would be the natural result of such
thinking.</p><p><a name="06071143000279">The

Minister has taken note of that last point. The Minister knows, as I

West Yorkshire police authority, because there was no written contract
prior to the services provided to Reading festival, which is a large
profit-making event.</p><p><a name="06071143000283">My concern is related to the
operation of section 25 Act not in respect of large commercial events
such as music festivals&#151;Glastonbury, for example, has
a &#163;17 million turnover; it is a commercial
event&#151;or football matches, but in respect of the small,
charitable, local, peaceful events that are an established and
cherished part of the west country way of life. By their very
definition, they do not have the resources to fight expensive legal
battles that often hinge on obscure legal points. They are the quiet
martyrs of the legislation. It threatens to wipe them out without
recourse to appeal and without too much fuss.</p><p><a name="06071143000284">I would like to believe that
the relatively modest nature of such events is the reason why the
Government have failed to notice the reprehensible approach to police
charging which is creeping in throughout many parts of the country. We
would certainly hear about it if the Met landed the Notting Hill
carnival with a bill for hundreds of thousands of pounds. But small
events such as the Dart music festival, or Widdecombe fair, which has
been going for hundreds of years, can slip easily under the radar of
the public, the media and the Government. This is in no way a
reflection of their importance to the local communities and how
beneficial they are to our culture.</p><p><a name="06071143000285">I pay tribute to the <i>Western
Morning News</i>, the regional organ of our area, which has taken up
the cause wholeheartedly and exposed the number of shows, festivals and
carnivals that face new charges for policing. Its excellent leader on
30 May pointed out that public support for the police is essential to
help them uphold the law, and concluded
that</p><a name="06071143000427"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the force could do
itself a great favour and win a great deal of public backing by
announcing there will be no policing charges for such popular local
events&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000286">I fear
that the police are hitting at softer targets&#151;events with
limited resources but huge social, community and cultural
benefits&#151;to help pay for policing the real problems elsewhere.
That is not the way to foster good community relations and is not a
practice that should be allowed to continue on an ad hoc, incoherent
and inconsistent basis.</p><p><a name="06071143000287">I certainly do not wish to see
every decision of the local police authority prescribed by central
Government. I believe that it is absolutely right to keep decisions as
close to the people as possible, and I am for creating real and genuine
local accountability. 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 409WH</b><br>However, I fear that local police authorities are proving far from
accountable. I have still received no substantive reply to the three
letters that I wrote to the chief constable of the Devon and Cornwall
constabulary about the matter in April. That is not good news and does
not foster good relations between Members of Parliament and the
constabulary.</p><p><a name="06071143000288">As a
result of the tremendous impact that police charges are having and will
have on charitable community events in the west country and the
geographical disparity in applying the legislation, combined with the
opaque decision-making procedures through which charges are applied and
levied, I ask the Government to bring forward clear and fair national
guidelines that will ensure that charitable community events across the
country are not wiped out by surreptitious police
charges.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000453">12.42

Gary Streeter (South-West Devon) (Con): I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen) on securing the debate, and
thank him for allowing me to have two or three minutes to underpin his
remarks and to raise one specific case, which is that of Yealmpton
show, a show with which my hon. Friend will be extremely familiar as he
used to represent the part of my constituency that comprises Yealmpton.
It has been going on for well over 100 years and is a prime example of
what my hon. Friend is talking about.</p><p><a name="06071143000290">Yealmpton show is the biggest
show by far in my constituency and on a good day, when the weather is
right, it can attract up to 10,000 people, 20 per cent. of whom are
children. It is run by a registered charity and all the work is done by
hard-working volunteers. It is not profit-making and any surplus is
given away to charity. Ironically, recently it gave some money to the
constabulary widows&#146; and orphans&#146; fund, not knowing that
it would receive a bill for this year&#146;s performance.</p><p><a name="06071143000291">Last year, the show made a loss
because of bad weather. That is the sort of organisation that we are
talking about. It is a day when people from the countryside and
Plymouth come together and have a day of tremendous fun, which is
exactly the kind of things we should be encouraging. However, this year
the police have come to the organisers out of the blue and asked for
payment to cover half of the cost of police engagement in the show.
What does that engagement entail? It is not like Notting Hill carnival,
where there have been riots and difficulties in the past. It is not
about public order, but about a constable or two diverting traffic from
the public highway into Yealmpton show field and carrying out ordinary
police activities, which are obviously increased by the number of
people using the field on a particular day. The show has been asked to
pay nearly &#163;2,000, which is money it can ill afford as a
marginal activity.</p><p><a name="06071143000292">At
a time when the Devon and Cornwall constabulary should be seeking to
make friends rather than enemies in our part of the world, there will
be a huge public reaction, because the Yealmpton show is so popular,
when the demand for payment is realised by my constituents. People in
South-West Devon are entitled to ask what on earth they are paying
their taxes 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 410WH</b><br>for. If something like policing the show is subject to an additional
charge, what are we paying for generally through our taxes for the
police? I hope that the Devon and Cornwall constabulary will think
again. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes, I have written to the
chief constable and still not received a reply. I hope that the
constabulary will think again but, if not, I hope that the Minister
will listen seriously to the case and take action that will cause the
Devon and Cornwall constabulary to think
again.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000454">12.44

Geoffrey Cox (Torridge and West Devon) (Con):</b> I shall
raise two points. Hatherleigh carnival is an event that has been held
for many years. It has a particular attraction as it is one of the few
carnivals to have flaming tar barrels, which are wheeled down the high
street in Hatherleigh. When I first heard about the flaming tar
barrels, and when I went to see them, it caused me a degree of
discomfort, but it is only when one goes to see them and inquire into
how they are handled that one realises that at every stage the barrels
are under the close and tight control of people who know exactly what
they are doing and that there is no danger. The fire service is
consulted every year, and there have been no accidents or
injuries.</p><p><a name="06071143000294">Last year,
Hatherleigh carnival, which usually raises about &#163;1,500 to
&#163;2,000 for charity, was suddenly fixed with a bill of about
&#163;1,500 to &#163;2,000. That meant that my constituents would
have nothing left to give to charity after they had paid the police
force. The point that was made to me by my constituents and the
organisers of the carnival was that that would deter people from
participating in such important community events. They usually get
involved because they know that the proceeds will go to charity. The
chances of Hatherleigh carnival happening the following year were
remote.</p><p><a name="06071143000295">I am
fortunate because there are an excellent number of local divisional
inspectors and officers who, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for
Totnes (Mr. Steen) earlier, were embarrassed by their position. They
found themselves caught between the community that they were trying,
often with great care and diligence, to police and the ridiculous order
that meant that they were required to charge a small, charitable event
that encouraged the charitable activities of the community. With a
degree of good will and negotiation, we managed to get that charge
extinguished. Of course, the carnival now lives from year to year with
the threat that that charge might reappear.</p><p><a name="06071143000296">My constituents said to me,
&#147;How often do we use the resources of the police through a
normal year? We barely see a policeman in our village
communities.&#148; Insult has been added to injury because not only
are our rural beat officers and our neighbourhood beat managers fairly
infrequently seen in rural areas, but they are now being withdrawn to
be replaced by police community support officers. The rural communities
in which such charitable events are, as has been said, at the very
heart of community activity and feeling, are being deterred,
disappointed and depressed, not only by the absence of police but by
the fact that when they put on an event that takes a great deal of
initiative and hard work, they find themselves charged for
it.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 411WH</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000455">12.48

chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I begin by congratulating the hon. Member for
Totnes (Mr. Steen) on securing an important debate, not only
for his constituents but throughout the country. I will mention some of
the points that he raised about his locality, but to cover the terms of
the debate I shall need to draw widely and broadly on issues across the
country and raise a number of issues that might not be specifically
relevant to his part of the world.</p><p><a name="06071143000298">I also congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on the way in which he conducted the debate and the measured
tones in which he put forward his case. In addition, I congratulate the
hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) and the
hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) on putting forward
their points of view in support of their hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06071143000299">I understand the importance of
the issue, because only recently I met the Showmen&#146;s Guild. My
hon. Friends the Members for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) and for Chorley (Mr.
Hoyle) raised issues about travelling fairs and so on similar to those
that the hon. Member for Totnes raised about the Dart music festival.
It is an issue across the country, and we are seeking to address it and
to work with the police in dealing with it.</p><p><a name="06071143000300"><b><a name="06071143000521">Mr.
Steen:</b> One must distinguish between commercial events,
such as fairs, and charitable, social and community events. That is an
important
distinction.</p><p><a name="06071143000301"><b><a name="06071143000522">Mr.
Coaker:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. To a
degree, I accept what he says. I was illustrating the fact that there
is much debate about the matter in respect of commercial and community
or charitable
events.</p><p><a name="06071143000302">Section 25 of
the Police Act 1996 replaced a similar provision in section 15(1) of
the Police Act 1964. Prior to those statutory provisions, the practice
of lending constables has been recognised since the 19th century. There
are three key elements to section 25. First, anyone may ask the chief
constable of a police force to provide special services. Secondly, it
is for the chief constable to decide whether or not to provide those
services. In reaching a decision whether to provide services, the chief
constable is likely to take into account the overall resources
available and the impact of providing the special services on the
policing that would otherwise be provided to the community. The third
key element is that it is for the police authority to determine the
scale of charges. In practice, most day-to-day decisions are likely to
be delegated to the chief officer of the force.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060711/halltext/60711h0322.htm"/>


<p><a name="06071143000303">Section 25 clearly requires a
request for services to be made before the question of charging
arises&#151;an important point. The police cannot unilaterally impose
a charge. In some cases the request may be made by a person other than
the organiser or promoter of an event. For example, the owner of land
on which an event is to be held may ask for special police services to
be provided, and he may then pass on any policing costs to the
organisers of the event.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 412WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000304">Section 25 does not describe
what constitutes special police services. From time to time, there have
been disputes about whether particular services fall within the bounds
of section 25 or of previous provisions. Judgments in court cases
arising from such disputes provide the main guidance to the
interpretation of section 25. A judgment was recently given in the
Court of Appeal; the hon. Member for Totnes referred to that case, and
I shall say more about it later. First, however, it may be useful to
say more about the definition of special services.</p><p><a name="06071143000305">The broad definition set out in
case law is that special police services are those provided over and
above the general obligation of the police to maintain law and order
and to keep the peace. Examples of special police services include the
provision of policing at football stadiums, at concert venues and at
motor racing grand prix. In those examples, much or all of the policing
service is provided on private property, and the courts have identified
that as an important factor in deciding whether special police services
are being provided.</p><p><a name="06071143000306">Other events may involve the
provision of some special police services. For instance, special police
services may be requested for large-scale private parties or to provide
an additional police presence at funfairs. No central record is
maintained of the events for which charges are made under section 25.
However, figures published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy indicate that police forces in England and Wales
received income of about &#163;23 million from providing special
police services in 2004-05. The hon. Member for Totnes may be
interested to know that that is the latest year for which figures are
available. That sum represents about one quarter of 1 per cent. of the
net budgets of forces in England and Wales.</p><p><a name="06071143000307">It is clearly sensible for the
organisers of events at which special police services may be required
to discuss the likely policing requirements with the police, in
advance. It is evidently in the interests of all parties to reach a
clear agreement about what services are to be provided under section 25
and what the cost will be.</p><p><a name="06071143000308"><b><a name="06071143000523">Mr.
Steen:</b> Would the Minister think it wholly unconscionable
for the police to say to the organisers of a charitable event that if
they did not have special policing, the police would not support their
application to the local authority for an entertainment
licence?</p><p><a name="06071143000309"><b><a name="06071143000524">Mr.
Coaker:</b> As I said, those are matters for local
negotiation. Clearly, if negotiations take place, the local police will
have to make a judgment about what they think is appropriate, and they
will have to take account of what is appropriate for general safety and
for law and order in the area. I say again that it is for the local
police to work with the local organisers of such events, and for them
to come to an agreement prior to the event. Such agreements are made
and adhered to in the vast majority of cases. As I said, we need to see
good practice; we need to encourage people to come to agreements
locally.</p><p><a name="06071143000310"><b><a name="06071143000525">Mr.
Cox:</b> Why does the Minister think it is that, after all
these years, the police are suddenly starting to use these powers to
impose charges on small charitable events? Why
now?</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 413WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000311"><b><a name="06071143000526">Mr.
Coaker:</b> The power was available for a number of years
prior to 1996. It is important to remember that section 25 requires a
request be made for special police services. It is not only a matter
for the police; it is for the organisers of events to ask the
police.</p><p><a name="06071143000312"><b><a name="06071143000527">Mr.
Steen:</b> The police are approaching organisations that do
superb work in the community and implying that if the organisers do not
come to an agreement the police will block any request for an
entertainment licence that may be applied for to run the event. That is
not good practice; it is blackmail.</p><p><a name="06071143000313"><b><a name="06071143000528">Mr.
Coaker:</b> It is a matter for local negotiation. What
I have to say about the guidance published by the Association of Chief
Police Officers may help.</p><p><a name="06071143000314">In 2005, ACPO published
guidance on charging for police services. It provides forces with a
common and comprehensive charging methodology. It reflects the
association&#146;s recognition of the importance of taking a
transparent and consistent approach to such matters. ACPO recommends
that forces should seek to harmonise their methodologies with the
guidance over the three years following its publication in April 2005.
It is therefore rather early to assess the impact of the guidance, but
I would expect it to deal with some of the points raised by the hon.
Gentleman.</p><p><a name="06071143000315">The
guidance was, at least in part, a response to criticisms of the
diversity and inconsistency of approach taken by forces to charging and
calculating the cost of services provided. The guidance does not mean
that the cost of special police services will be identical at every
apparently similar event. The cost of providing services will vary, in
order to reflect the characteristics and requirements of particular
venues.</p><p><a name="06071143000316">For events to
which section 25 applies, the guidance sets out an approach to
calculating the full economic cost of services provided. That cost
includes all pay and allowances for the officers involved, usually at
overtime rates. It also includes pension and national insurance
contributions and the cost of other 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 414WH</b><br>overheads. As I said, I believe that the guidance will help tackle some
of the issues raised by the hon.
Gentleman.</p><p><a name="06071143000317">In the time
left to me, I shall say a little about the Dart music festival. The
hon. Member for Totnes will know better than me that the festival
brings a diverse range of musical entertainment to Dartmouth. I believe
that it has been an annual event since 1998, and that it is enjoyed by
residents and many visitors. I understand that 2006 is the first year
in which the question of a charge for policing the event has arisen;
that flowed from the constabulary&#146;s wish to follow ACPO
guidance.</p><p><a name="06071143000318">The Devon
and Cornwall constabulary advises me that the festival organisers
discussed the programme with it ahead of the event. The constabulary
identified a requirement for additional policing in Dartmouth during
the three days of the festival over and above that normally needed on a
Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The full economic cost of that additional
policing was some &#163;14,000. However, the force agreed with the
organisers that only about &#163;2,700 of the total related to
special police services in respect of some additional police officer
overtime.</p><p><a name="06071143000319">I further
understand that although the festival took place in May, the force has
not yet invoiced the festival for that amount. The force is still
considering whether the charge is appropriate. I believe that the
matter is to be discussed by the hon. Gentleman and the assistant chief
constable later this month. No doubt, what has been said this morning
will help.</p><p><a name="06071143000320">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Totnes on securing this important
debate, and I thank the hon. Member for South-West Devon and the hon.
and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon for their contributions.
It has provided an opportunity to consider matters that are important
both to the police service and to the many organisers of commercial and
community events.</p><p><a name="06071143000321">Section 25 of the Police Act
1996 provides a useful enabling power. Through it, the organisers of
events, or others with an interest, may request services that the
police are able to provide that go beyond what they are obliged to
provide as part of their ordinary
duty.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 415WH</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06071143000004">Television Licence

Mark Todd (South Derbyshire) (Lab):</b> I wish to raise the
issue of how the licensing authorities deal with those who choose not
to own a television&#151;or own one, but only to play videotapes or
DVDs, not to receive broadcast material.</p><p><a name="06071143000323">A TV licence is payable if a
set is owned and used to receive broadcasts. The Government decide the
proportion of the licence fee that goes to the BBC, which receives the
fee in its entirety, as far as I know. For that reason, the BBC has
recently been left to collect the licence fee, although the rate of the
fee and the principle behind it is established by Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071143000324">The BBC has chosen to contract
out collection to a third party called TV Licensing, which is linked to
Capita, the organisation that provides a range of public services for
private profit on behalf of a number of agencies, including parts of
the Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann),
who is here today, will be aware of Capita&#146;s role in dealing
with compensation for mineworkers.</p><p><a name="06071143000325">TV Licensing has a code of
practice on how to deal with collecting the licence fee. Among its
harmless provisions is that it should be courteous to customers, and we
all recognise that as an important part of any service agency. Unless
it obtains a magistrate&#146;s warrant, the organisation has no power
to enter someone&#146;s property without their consent to verify
whether they have a TV or whether a TV is being used for receiving
broadcasts.</p><p><a name="06071143000326">To some
extent, the organisation also propagates what is possibly an illusion
about TV licensing vans. From childhood, I remember adverts featuring
vehicles with discs on top of them that were supposed to identify where
a TV was in operation; a man would knock on doors to pursue the matter.
TV Licensing propagates the impression that such activity is a critical
part of prosecuting those who choose not to pay for a licence,
although, as far as I know, there has not been a case in which evidence
from such a vehicle has been produced in
court.</p><p><a name="06071143000327">I shall be
intrigued to hear what the Minister has to say. When such matters have
been raised in the past, the Government have sought to suggest that
responsibility for collection and policy is a matter for the BBC and
not for parliamentary concern. Indeed, a previous Minister, my hon.
Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson),
said:</p><a name="06071143000428"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
for the BBC, as licensing authority, to keep under review the
guidelines under which TV Licensing
operates.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 5 March 2001; Vol.
364, c. 87W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000328">That is wholly
inadequate; such activities are sanctioned by Parliament. The principle
of having a licence fee to pay for broadcasting is sanctioned by
Parliament, and to express no interest in how that fee should be
collected is an inappropriate dismissal of
responsibility.</p><p><a name="06071143000329">We all
recognise that some people who should have a licence choose not to pay
for one. It is difficult to estimate how many such people there are,
but it is reckoned that they make up about 5 per cent. of those who
should have licences. All of us would accept that if 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 416WH</b><br>we are to have a licence to pay for public service broadcasting, we
should attempt to make sure that people do not freeload and receive
such broadcasts for nothing.</p><p><a name="06071143000330">I turn to the group whom I want
to address in this debate. In our society, a small group of people
choose not to have a television. They do so for a variety of reasons;
for example, they may feel that the broadcast content is inadequate and
that they do not want it. A small number of people have moral
objections; only a couple of weeks ago, a constituent of mine told me
that he does not wish to have a television because of his religious
beliefs. It is not for us to be concerned about why someone should
choose not to have a television; it is entirely for them to
decide.</p><p><a name="06071143000331">Until
reasonably recently, an individual&#146;s clear statement that they
did not have a television was accepted by the licensing authorities.
People were taken at their word. Presumably, it was subsequently
decided for some reason that among those people were a reasonable
number of liars, or people who were forgetful and changed their minds
about having a television but did not apply for a licence, and that
those people were a concern.</p><p><a name="06071143000332">At the moment, the approach
taken is to assume that every household has a television. The address
database includes all addresses in this country. In some cases, it
includes commercial addresses; mailings sometimes go out to industrial
estates suggesting that TV licences are not being paid. The premises
involved are not only domestic. The assumption that I mentioned is
made, and there is therefore also an assumption that homes on the
database that do not hold a licence must be breaking the law. That is
backed at the moment by a further assumption that when
someone, replying to a TV licence inquiry, says that they do not have a
television or do not receive broadcasts, they are probably not telling
the truth&#151;or, at the very least, that the issue requires
verification. An agent will knock on the door and ask to inspect the
property to find out whether there is a TV.</p><p><a name="06071143000333">It seems that there is an
exception, which was raised by a constituent of mine. If someone is
over 75, they are not obliged to pay for a TV licence. If they can
show, by producing a birth certificate, that they are over 75, they are
left alone. I suppose that we should be thankful for small mercies,
although my constituent was very upset. I shall come in moment to the
mail that is sent out. A relative of the elderly lady concerned
contacted me to say that she had been very shocked to receive her
letter. The licensing authorities graciously responded to me and said
that they took my word, as a Member of Parliament, that the lady in
question was over 75. They said that they intended to leave her alone.
Their discretion on whose word should be taken as truth is interesting.
Anyway, that small exception applies: the authorities will not persist
with very elderly
people.</p><p><a name="06071143000334">The mailings
sent out are offensive in a number of ways. I have a number of examples
here, and unless I am a very unusual hon. Member, they are also drawn
to the attention of other MPs from time to time. One common feature is
that the envelope makes it perfectly clear what the matter is about. If
the letter were put through the letterbox of a multiple-occupation
block, 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 417WH</b><br>it would be clear to all one&#146;s neighbours that one was probably
not complying with the
law.</p><p><a name="06071143000335">One letter states
that TV Licensing officers would soon be visiting the address of the
gentleman who wrote to me. Another one, perhaps jokingly, refers to the
chance to own Britain&#146;s most successful anti-detection
device&#151;there is a picture of a van with radio equipment
inside&#151;and to avoiding a knock on the door, risking a fine,
millions sold, batteries not required, peace of mind guaranteed and so
on. Ho, ho,
ho.</p><p><a name="06071143000336">However, if one is
sharing a property with other people, such a letter gives the message
that they might be a fiddler. If it goes to an ordinary household, it
certainly gives a message to the postman who puts it through the
letterbox that he is dealing with someone who probably is not complying
with the law. The public disclosure of what the letter is about is
offensive to many
people.</p><p><a name="06071143000337">The tone and
accuracy of the correspondence are also offensive. Let me deal first
with accuracy. The gentleman who wrote to me provided a selection of
the 150-plus letters he received from TV Licensing at his address. He
has made it clear repeatedly that he does not own a television and does
not wish to own a television. To be fair, he does own a television but
only for the purpose of playing tapes. Nevertheless, in law he is not
required to pay for a licence. He received a letter that
stated:</p><a name="06071143000429"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;After
repeated reminders that this address is currently
unlicensed&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000338">repeated
reminders, certainly, but he had responded to them and made it
perfectly clear that he was not obliged to pay for a
licence&#151;</p><a name="06071143000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we have
still had no response from
you.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000339">The letter then
draws attention to some of the penalties that may
apply.</p><p><a name="06071143000340">Another letter
entertainingly
states:</p><a name="06071143000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;On
average, Officers from our Enforcement Division catch 70,933 people
every year.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000341">The
organisation achieves a remarkably precise average. In any case, I
would be interested in public disclosure of exactly how well the
activity is performed. The letter goes on to state
that</p><a name="06071143000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is no record
of a TV Licence at your address, and that you may therefore be watching
or recording television programme services without a valid licence. If
this is the case, you are breaking the
law.</p></ul><a name="06071143000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">Enforcement
Officers have been authorised by us to visit your address...to
interview you under caution in compliance with the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000342">To be
honest, that might not appear aggressive to a highly educated,
well-prepared individual, but to many people, waving legal penalties
and saying that they may be interviewed under caution is
extraordinarily aggressive, particularly if they have repeatedly made
it clear that they are not obliged to pay for a licence in the first
place. The process of recording who has said what and ensuring that the
database functions as a source of information for pursuing those who
have not paid for a licence clearly is not carried out satisfactorily
or efficiently by TV Licensing.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 418WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000343">What do constituents complain
about? First, they complain that there is an assumption that they have
a television. I suspect that they have to live with that, as the
overwhelming majority of households in this country do have a
television. The assumption is probably fair. People find it offensive
because they choose not to have a television, but we must accept that
it is probably
reasonable.</p><p><a name="06071143000344">People
certainly object to the refusal to accept their word, and I have a
great deal of sympathy with them. If a resident has made it clear that
they do not own a television and that they will not own a television,
the most that TV Licensing should do is to contact them, perhaps once a
year, to ask if that is still the case. They should be contacted
courteously with an appropriately phrased letter, not one that
aggressively implies that they are probably breaking the
law.</p><p><a name="06071143000345">People do not
like the aggressive tone of the letters. I gave some examples of the
kind of tone that is used. Again, I sympathise with their concerns.
They certainly do not like the public way in which that aggression is
delivered. To package such letters in what are, in effect, open
envelopes and indicate that people may be offenders is simply not
acceptable if someone is carrying out a perfectly lawful activity and
does not have to pay for a
licence.</p><p><a name="06071143000346">Lastly, we
must consider the impact on someone who is elderly or disadvantaged in
some way and who may readily become confused or made anxious by highly
legalistic mail. Again, that is not
acceptable.</p><p><a name="06071143000347">What
should we do? First, there are perfectly reasonable databases of names
and addresses in the UK that are updated regularly. If there is no
evidence of a change of occupier, a gentle and neutrally worded annual
inquiry would be appropriate. If a person says that they have no TV,
asking them to confirm that on an annual basis is
reasonable.</p><p><a name="06071143000348">Secondly,
a response from the resident&#151;as I said, in most cases my
constituents do respond&#151;should prompt a review of appropriate
actions. A response to one of my constituents
stated:</p><a name="06071143000434"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This
is an automatically produced letter and the wording may not be totally
appropriate to your individual
circumstances.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000349">It simply
is not acceptable or reasonable for a company to send aggressive direct
mail to an individual who has made their circumstances clear because it
cannot be bothered to change its records. I hope for an improvement in
performance in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06071143000350">Thirdly,
correspondence should be private. It is not appropriate to use a
variety of logos and messages on the envelope that indicate what is
inside. Fourthly, I would like to know about the performance of the
organisation. Does it provide a cost-effective means of collecting TV
licence fees from people who have chosen not to pay? What is the BBC
paying for this purpose, and with what result? I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000457">1.17
pm</h5><p><a name="06071143000351"><b><a name="06071143000530">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(Mr. Shaun Woodward):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend on
securing this debate. I appreciate not only from his remarks but from
those of other hon. Members the effect that correspondence or 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 419WH</b><br>a visit from officials of TV Licensing can have. They can cause anxiety
to those who are affected, not least those who are legitimately paying
their licence fee and may have been caught in the
system.</p><p><a name="06071143000352">However, it is
important to put on the record the fact that licence fee evasion costs
some &#163;150 million each year. From the surveys and work that we
have done with licence fee payers, the majority of the
public&#151;substantial numbers&#151;have huge faith and trust in
the BBC, but absolutely expect value for money. The sum of &#163;150
million a year is substantial, and it is right that the BBC has a
system to try to collect that money and drive down losses. My hon.
Friend asked about performance, and I shall come to
that.</p><p><a name="06071143000353">To set out the
Government&#146;s position, we all must recognise the need for
effective and efficient TV licence fee collection. In the charter
review White Paper, we confirmed that we consider the television
licence fee to be the best way to finance the BBC and that it should
therefore remain the main funding source throughout the 10- year period
covered by the corporation&#146;s new charter. In keeping with the
need to maintain the BBC&#146;s independence from the Government, we
have also confirmed that it will remain the responsibility of the BBC
to collect the licence fee and to ensure that that is done in a proper,
efficient and cost-effective
manner.</p><p><a name="06071143000354">On the
efficiency of licence fee collection, enforcement has rightly been the
subject of past scrutiny by the National Audit Office and the Public
Accounts Committee, and we expect it to be the subject of further
enquiries. The House of Lords BBC Charter Review Select Committee also
stressed the importance of cost efficiency in the collection and
enforcement of the licence fee, and sought improvement in that
area.</p><p><a name="06071143000355">The Government
acknowledge that licence fee enforcement must take place in such a way
as to maintain public support. Successive charter review public
consultations have reminded us of the public concerns about the impact
of the licensing system and the way it operates, particularly in
relation to the elderly and low-income households.</p><p><a name="06071143000356">My hon. Friend commented that
the BBC collects television licence fees on behalf of the Government.
That is absolutely correct, but it is not the same as saying that the
Government are&#151;to use his words&#151;expressing no interest in
how fees are collected. Parliament originally gave the BBC the
responsibility for collecting licence fee revenue in the Broadcasting
Act 1990, but endorsed that more recently in the Communications Act
2003, which contains additional safeguards in relation to the powers of
entry. As television licensing authority, the BBC has a statutory
responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the licensing
system. With that goes the responsibility to establish appropriate
procedures and guidelines for staff and collection agents.</p><p><a name="06071143000357">It is not the
Government&#146;s responsibility to administer that, but of course we
have a view on how that might be done if the system is abused. In the
light of concerns such as those that my hon. Friend has expressed, we
have included a provision in the BBC&#146;s new royal charter to make
the BBC Trust more directly accountable for the activities of TV
Licensing than has hitherto been the case under the board of governors.
Article 24(2) of the charter explicitly provides that the functions of
the new trust will include ensuring</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 420WH</b><br><a name="06071143000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that arrangements for the
collection of the licence fee are efficient, appropriate and
proportionate&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071143000358">and
I emphasise &#147;proportionate.&#148;</p><p><a name="06071143000359">We intend that that requirement
should give a clear steer to the trust to take a close interest in the
TV licence arrangements and satisfy itself that they operate in a way
that is efficient, yet without seeming unfair or oppressive to those
who come into contact with the system. There is a careful balance to be
struck. One the one hand, the BBC as enforcing authority has a
responsibility to ensure that every address that should have a
television licence has one. On the other hand, it should not turn its
back on significant evidence of licence fee evasion, which currently
runs at around &#163;150 million each year in lost licence fee
revenue, the cost of which is ultimately borne by those who pay their
television licence
fee.</p><p><a name="06071143000360">My hon. Friend
asked about performance. The BBC has so far been successful in reducing
the evasion rate, which stood at an estimated 4.6 per cent. in March
2006&#151;around one in 20 households, which is still staggering.
That was, however, down from 7.8 per cent. in March 2001. The trend is
downwards, which is significant in terms of the many tens of millions
of pounds of revenue that would otherwise be lost to the BBC or which
would constitute an extra cost to be borne by everybody else who
legitimately pays their licence fee. Given both the scale of the
problem and the amounts of money lost, it is correct that a rigorous
approach should be taken to maintain and improve on that
record.</p><p><a name="06071143000361">On the other
hand, efficiency and effectiveness should not be seen in isolation. The
public have a right to be treated with respect and fairness. It is an
absolute prerequisite that that should be seen to be the case in order
to ensure long-term support for the licence fee system. I am aware that
concern has been expressed about TV Licensing enforcement officers
visiting people in their homes or expressing an intention to make such
visits, particularly when the person in question has already indicated
that he or she does not have a television. However, home visits are not
a new practice to combat evasion. TV Licensing has long made a point of
making home visits to selected addresses for which it receives a
declaration that no television set is in use.</p><p><a name="06071143000362">The BBC indicates that the
underlying reason for the home visit policy is the scale of false
declarations. To give an idea of what we are talking about, in 2004-05
more than 50 per cent. of declarations received by TV Licensing that no
television was in use were false. For that reason, the BBC has a policy
under which TV Licensing now visits all addresses for which it has
received such a declaration. The purpose of the visit is to identify
genuine non-users of televisions, so that subsequent contact with them
can be minimised.</p><p><a name="06071143000363">If
one considers the volume of licence fee evasion&#151;&#163;150
million a year&#151;and the fact that 50 per cent. of declarations
that no set is in use are false, the case for a rigorous procedure to
stop licence fee evasion is absolutely justifiable. The fact that the
figures are coming down suggests that the policy is working. As I have
said, however, it matters that the procedure is fair and
proportionate.</p><p><a name="06071143000364">TV
Licensing officials may enter a person&#146;s home only with that
person&#146;s consent or if authorised to do 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 421WH</b><br>so by a warrant issued by a magistrate, as my hon. Friend will
understand. The BBC assures me that visits by inquiry officers follow a
strict set of procedural instructions and take a matter of minutes. I
understand that, following successful verification that no television
is in use at the premises, the policy of TV Licensing is now to exclude
the address from any further enquiries for an initial period of four
years.</p><p><a name="06071143000365">I also
acknowledge the concerns about the tone of TV Licensing&#146;s
advertisements and letters of inquiry. Although the BBC has assured my
officials that the contents of TV Licensing&#146;s letters are not
visible to a postman, it is clear that they come from TV Licensing, and
I can understand that some recipients are unhappy about that. I also
understand that it may sometimes appear that TV Licensing is out to
pursue people who choose not to own a television set.</p>

<p><a name="06071143000366">For the sake of clarity, it may
be helpful to point out that an estimated 1.19 million households have
a TV but no licence, as of March 2006. To give some perspective, that
is twice the number of households with no television. In their duty to
administer and enforce the television licensing system, the BBC and TV
Licensing take the view that there is a clear obligation to all licence
fee payers to investigate unlicensed addresses, to verify the status of
the premises and establish whether a licence is indeed
required.</p><p><a name="06071143000367">I
appreciate the need for TV Licensing to consider the
individual&#146;s privacy when corresponding, however. Although it is
not for the Government to become involved in the day-to-day operation
of the system, I will undertake to raise my hon. Friend&#146;s
concern about envelopes and logos with the BBC.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 422WH</b><br><p><a name="06071143000368">In conclusion, I hope that what
I have said, especially my references to the obligations on the new BBC
Trust in relation to the licensing system, will go some way to
reassuring my hon. Friend that the Government are alert to the concerns
that he has raised in this debate. We remain committed to the
television licence fee as the basis for funding the BBC. That requires
support for a collection and enforcement system that is efficient and
effective; but that system must also be seen as fair and proportionate
to those who come into contact with
it.</p><p><a name="06071143000369"><b><a name="06071143000531">Mr.

the scale of the evasion and the BBC&#146;s success in driving it

considerable amounts of money in order to support those who do not pay
their fair share. However, I am prepared to raise some of the issues
that my hon. Friend has mentioned with the BBC. I remind him of the
contents of the new charter, specifically the section that relates to
the collection of the licence fee now being the responsibility of the

Taylor (Truro and St. Austell) (LD):</b> I welcome the
opportunity to have this urgent debate on the devastating news that has
hit mid-Cornwall, and particularly the china clay community, not just
about some 800 direct job losses in Imerys, but about the loss of as
many knock-on jobs and, significantly, the fact that china clay will no
longer compete in a major sector of the market against overseas
competition. This is not outsourcing, which has been behind many job
losses in the past, but a real loss at the centre of one of
Britain&#146;s most impoverished
communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000374"><b><a name="06071143000534">Mr.
Colin Breed (South-East Cornwall) (LD):</b> My hon. Friend is
right. Some commentators believe that this problem is identified
directly with the clay industry in a relatively small geographical
area. In fact, it will have huge repercussions throughout my
constituency, which is adjacent to my hon. Friend&#146;s, and will go
wider into other sectors of the Cornish economy, much of which is
fragile and at a critical
point.</p><p><a name="06071143000375"><b><a name="06071143000535">Matthew
Taylor:</b> I agree. It is worth noting that this announcement
has also led to the lowest morale that I can remember, not just in the
clay industry, but in St. Austell and the wider community,
including Fowey, Par docks and the other affected areas in my hon.
Friend&#146;s constituency. I hope that the Minister will be able to
bring a glimmer of hope to that devastated
community.</p><p><a name="06071143000376">I do not
intend to make any political complaint. It has been obvious for some
years that there is a threat to the Cornish industry. Cheaply
accessible reserves of clay are opening up in Brazil. Those are cheap
not because of low labour rates, but because the clay deposits have
already been washed out of the hard rock. I visited Brazil and saw that
a digger and a lorry is all that is needed to produce clay there.
Cornwall has been relatively protected because it is near the main
paper markets and Brazil is a long way away. I shall return to that
issue.</p><p><a name="06071143000377">I thank the
Minister&#146;s colleagues at the Treasury, with whom I worked for
some years to find a solution to the climate change levy, which has
impacted on the clay industry. When I first raised that matter with
Ministers in 2003, the levy had already taken &#163;4 million out of
the industry and raised energy costs alongside others that were already
rising. The climate change levy was a clear threat to an industry in
which 20 per cent. of costs are energy related and 80 per cent. to 90
per cent. of production is exported. I was pleased that Ministers
acknowledged that the industry was potentially in the category that
should have help with the climate change levy. There was a rather
tortuous route to get help, but help has been put in place and, as a
result, climate change levy costs for the industry have potentially
been reduced by &#163;1 million or so a year. The industry has also
done a lot of work for itself, for example, by introducing combined
heat and power plant before any grants from Government to do so and
being innovative in reducing energy
costs.</p><p><a name="06071143000378">This is not a
complaint about Government in any sense; it is a plea for help,
particularly for Ministers to 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 424WH</b><br>understand the scale of the impact in a tightly defined community.
Sadly, the work done with Treasury Ministers and others to get the
reduction in costs has not been enough, given the pressures on the
industry from energy costs that have risen through the
roof.</p><p><a name="06071143000379">Figures given to
me by Imerys during a meeting on Thursday, when I also met trade unions
and local councils, show that over a three-year period its energy costs
have risen from &#163;15 million to &#163;40 million per annum.
That is a huge hit by any standard and is compounded by the dollar
exchange rate. The low value of the dollar has increased the
competitiveness of clay from Brazil, where both production and sales
are in dollars, meaning that it is cheap relative to Cornish-produced
clay. All those factors have hit the industry hard and the only
protection for Cornwall has been the cost of bringing clay from Brazil,
which is around &#163;35 a
tonne.</p><p><a name="06071143000380">It is a
significant, although not huge, factor that paper-coating clays sell
for $120 to $140 a tonne. Imerys is now pulling out of that market,
because that product is highly energy intensive to produce and not so
protected from shipping costs, because of its high value. Imerys is
saying that it will concentrate on filler clays, which are low
value&#151;the opposite of what is happening generally in
manufacturing and other goods markets in the UK&#151;and by selling
at roughly &#163;70 a tonne, the &#163;35 a tonne shipping costs
and low energy costs significantly protect Cornwall&#146;s clays
relative to Brazil. However, the company is still on edge. Later on, I
shall mention help that the Minister might be able to
offer.</p><p><a name="06071143000381">It is
interesting to hear the trade unions, which I met privately, and
workers in the company say that there is low morale and great
unhappiness with this decision by a French-based company. Nevertheless,
there is a degree of understanding of the pressures faced by the
industry and the strategy that it is pursuing. I thought that my
meeting with the company on Thursday was likely to be preparatory to a
pull-out from Cornwall on a fairly short-term scale. Imerys is making
some major investment to try to ensure that the filler clays will
continue, which makes sense strategically, but we need to be aware that
this industry will not be in Cornwall in the lifetimes of those alive
and working in the industry now. There is a limit to how far the clay
can be worked economically. Only three years ago, the company&#146;s
statements were talking about a 40-year life; it is now talking about
20 years-worth of reserves, even if things go well. They may last
longer than that&#151;there are potential new reserves to
work&#151;but the future for the industry is rapidly contracting in
an area where there is little other employment. That situation should
be viewed in the context of measures that the company says will cut its
operating costs by nearly a third. These are drastic
reductions.</p><p><a name="06071143000382">The clay
company has said that there are 1,850 directly employed jobs left. Some
reduction is already going on from a previous round of cuts, but
another 800 jobs are to go. The company also confirms, as does the
council, that because it will no longer be operating in this sector,
the present reductions are not like previous ones, when much work was
being outsourced. In this case, the outsource suppliers will be losing
jobs on a large scale as well. A minimum of 800 job
losses 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 425WH</b><br>are expected on top of the ones already announced, so we are probably
talking about a minimum of 1,600 jobs being directly affected by this
decision.</p><p><a name="06071143000383"><b><a name="06071143000536">Mr.

harder for the convergence funding that is coming to Cornwall to have
an effect, given that the playing field has been lowered even further
for people in mid-Cornwall, who will now have to work particularly hard
to achieve any level of
regeneration?</p><p><a name="06071143000384"><b><a name="06071143000537">Matthew
Taylor:</b> Convergence funding is important. We in Cornwall
are fortunate to have objective 1 funding, which is the highest level
of European support. That has been matched by the Government. We are
the only place in the UK poor enough to get convergence funding, but
there is a still a question about the match funding. It is difficult
for the Government to put that in place quickly, but we urgently
require some reassurance on that convergence funding matching from
Government, which is important and even more difficult to find,
especially when yet another private sector employer&#151;the biggest
one in Cornwall&#151;is
contracting.</p><p><a name="06071143000385">The net
effect of the china clay job losses impacts on nearly 7 per cent. of
jobs in the travel-to-work area. The concentration in the clay villages
is massive. Taking into account the direct and indirect effect of the
job cuts, more than one in three of the 3,700 working households in the
clay villages can expect one of their members to lose full-time
employment. One in five clay village household jobs will go directly
with the Imerys job losses. Within the clay communities, the impact is
absolutely enormous. We are talking about between 20 per cent.
and one third of all the employment in villages that are among the most
deprived communities anywhere in the country and where employment
opportunities are extremely scarce and, indeed, employment land has
been extremely scarce up to now because of the clay workings
themselves.</p><p><a name="06071143000386">To put
this in context, the Imerys jobs are relatively well paid. The incomes
average &#163;23,000 a year in a borough where local incomes average
only &#163;18,500 a year, so they are some of the high-grade jobs.
Despite the fact that they are sometimes relatively low skilled and
they are certainly very specifically skilled, they are full-time,
mainly male jobs in an area that has very little else and where other
jobs in the community are worse
paid.</p><p><a name="06071143000387">A study
conducted a few years ago&#151;so the figures are a little out of
date&#151;in St. Dennis, which happens to be the village I live in,
showed that the average household income there was only &#163;6,000 a
year. That is one of the larger clay villages, so these are very poor
communities indeed. Thirty-two per cent. of people in Restormel borough
as a whole&#151;the communities that we are talking about are the
poorest communities, so the figure for them is likely to be even
higher&#151;have no skills, compared with an average in the
south-west of 26 per cent., so there is a major issue about
skills as 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 426WH</b><br>well. The skills that people do have are mostly specifically orientated
on clay
communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000388">The
deprivation in these communities is among the greatest in the United
Kingdom. We are talking about a community that is regarded as one of
the poorest communities in Cornwall, which is poorer than anywhere else
in England. We need to bear it in mind that the only really equivalent
community is that in the Camborne-Redruth area, which lost its
heavy engineering and is now the target of very high levels of
Government support. If I can get one message across to the Minister, it
will be that the fear in St. Austell and the clay villages is that we
will end up in the same circumstances. Those of us from Cornwall
remember the way in which the shops went from Camborne and the shops
closed in Redruth&#151;everything went. Only now, after huge
investment, is the area showing signs of picking
up.</p><p><a name="06071143000389">In this case, we
know that the clay industry will go over the next 10 or 20
years&#151;whatever it will be&#151;at best. We know that there are
huge-scale job impacts now in villages that are best thought of as
coal-mining villages&#151;if the Minister is not familiar with clay
villages, she should think of coal villages. We need the kind of
support that coal villages received and we hope to receive it before
the full impact is felt. The Minister may well say that at least this
is not a closure; it is only a cutback. However, we know that closure
will come in time, and right now the cutback is huge for what are very
small communities.</p><p><a name="06071143000390">The
Minister may be aware of the closure at St. Mawgan on almost
exactly the same time scale. RAF St. Mawgan is shutting. There, we are
losing 920 military jobs and some 200 civilian jobs. It is the other
half of the borough, but I know that many of those people are located
in the clay villages, because it is that kind of employment. I meet all
the time military staff working at RAF St. Mawgan and civilian staff.
It is a relatively affordable area, a relatively low-cost area, so
there will be an impact there, too. Some 670 indirect jobs associated
with RAF St. Mawgan are also expected to go as part of the works
happening.</p><p><a name="06071143000391">We know
that the Minister and other Departments will offer a package relating
to training, skills and job seeking. That is one of the things that
will come through the action force that will be set up. A taskforce
involving the South West of England regional development agency, the
Government office for the south-west, the county, the borough, the
jobcentre and others is meeting now in St. Austell to consider the
issue. I know that a lot of work will be going on, but if there are no
jobs, there is a limit to what can be done. People cannot be retrained
for jobs that do not
exist.</p><p><a name="06071143000392">In those terms,
I also want to highlight the fact that Imerys is not the only clay
company. In particular, Goonvean wrote to me only last year, expressing
its concern about the impact of rising energy costs. I hope that we
will not see the same effects on that company. It is a specialist
company, a niche supplier, so it is a little more protected than
Imerys. Nevertheless, there is an almost palpable concern that this
issue runs right across the china clay industry at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06071143000393">What do we
want? First, I am not optimistic that we can save any of these jobs.
There is a clear reason for the changes, and the company is presenting
a strategy to meet that challenge. Nevertheless, there is an 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 427WH</b><br>ongoing threat to the remaining operations. I hope that it will be
possible to look again at the energy costs facing the company. The
company will be doing that. It is taking out the thermal driers, which
is the most expensive end, but if the Government could do anything to
help the company to work through the energy cost issue, that would be
helpful. I know that there is a limit. Nevertheless, work with the
company would be
welcome.</p><p><a name="06071143000394">Secondly and
fundamentally, I have talked in the past about the support given to MG
Rover when it shut during the general election. However, the impact of
MG Rover closing, in a much, much larger community, was not, frankly,
as big as the impact will be in clay communities. As I said, the best
way to think of them is as coalfield communities. I hope that I can
persuade the Minister to examine whether some of the support packages
given to the coalfield communities can be offered to clay communities.
That includes all the waste restoration issues. The company will have
an obligation to restore some of the areas, but there are no
obligations on the company to restore some of the older worked areas
that are no longer being worked. It now looks extremely unlikely that
those areas will be worked
again.</p><p><a name="06071143000395">We need the
Government agencies&#151;the Government office for the south-west,
the regional development agency, the county council and Restormel
borough council&#151;to work together through a 20-year strategy.
Some of that work will already have been initiated. Clearly, it must be
brought forward now, and the 20-year strategy has to include the
process of working out what the future is for employment in the area,
what the Government can do to help that, and what can be done to bring
it forward. Clearly, waiting is no longer an
option.</p><p><a name="06071143000396">I hope that
the Minister will look again at the A30-St. Austell link road: the
A391. That has just been deprioritised by regional
government&#146;s recommendations to the Department for Transport. It
said that it is not a regional priority, so it is unlikely to happen in
10 or 20 years. That link road is proposed specifically to help to
facilitate economic regeneration in St. Austell. I know that it is not
directly the Minister&#146;s responsibility, but I hope that she can
say today that she will talk to her colleagues at the Department for
Transport about it. Clearly, the decisions taken at regional level by
the regional assembly on the issue do not really apply in the current
circumstances. I hope that Ministers will consider the proposal in
terms of the specific needs of the
community.</p><p><a name="06071143000397">I hope that
we can also have an assurance that in terms of Government
funding&#151;I talked about match funding for objective
1&#151;there is potential for investment in a range of ways in the
community. I am thinking particularly of the closures at Par docks. The
complete cessation of use of those facilities by the clay company opens
up a big opportunity for marine-related industries or other kinds of
development. It is important that the Government work through that with
the local councils to ensure that it is based on employment
opportunities, not simply a quick profit for developers. I hope that
the Minister will ask officials to work with the company and the local
councils to ensure that any land disposals and asset 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 428WH</b><br>disposals take place in the context of job regeneration, rather than a
quick payback to the company. The company has given some reassurance on
that, but it is easy to say it; it is often harder to do it in
practice. We need employment opportunities to come out of these events.
I hope that the Minister will work with colleagues to seek to ensure
that we can have some reassurance about the match funding needed for
the next round of European
funding.</p><p><a name="06071143000398">There is no
underestimating the impact of these events in the communities affected.
We really ask just two things of the Minister, and these are the
biggest points of all. First, we must not wait for absolute catastrophe
in order to start prioritising the St. Austell and clay village area in
the same way as the Camborne, Redruth and Poole area is the subject of
some prioritisation at the moment. That will require a change in policy
to be made by the regional development agency and by Government, but it
is important that we do that now, rather than waiting for catastrophe
to
strike.</p><p><a name="06071143000399">Secondly,
we ask that the Minister give some reassurance to the community that
she is aware that the impact of what is happening is far bigger than it
may seem on paper to a Government who are used to dealing with
thousands of jobs. In the community in question, one in five households
is set to suffer a direct loss of full-time employment, and the number
is probably one in three when the knock-on effects are taken into
consideration, even without RAF St. Mawgan. That is a very big
impact.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071143000459">1.50
pm</h5><p><a name="06071143000400"><b><a name="06071143000538">The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)
on securing the debate so quickly after the news that we received
towards the end of last week. I am very conscious of the importance of
the china clay industry to Cornwall, and to his constituency in
particular. I understand entirely the disproportionate impact that such
events can have, especially in a rural constituency. I know the area
quite well and have been there a number of times, with various
ministerial hats on, to try to tackle some of the problems with
employment opportunities&#151;particularly, in the first instance,
when the tin mines were closed. I know that such closures create
devastation for individuals, families and communities, and we all need
to work together to ensure that we build a sustainable future by way of
jobs for people who live there.</p><p><a name="06071143000401">My analysis of the future of
the china clay industry is the same as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, but
I am not as pessimistic as he is. We should grasp the opportunity of
the &#163;25 million that Imerys is putting in to maintain a presence
in the area, and work with the company. We shall do
that&#151;probably through the regional development agency, which is
our vehicle for ensuring delivery of many of our tools of support to
companies. However, we will work hard to ensure that we do the most
that we
can.</p><p><a name="06071143000402"><b><a name="06071143000539">Matthew
Taylor:</b> It is an important point; I do not want to give
the impression that I think the company is about to pull out overnight.
I think that it has a 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 429WH</b><br>strategy in place, and I hope that that will retain jobs, but there is a
limited resource. The company is under continued pressure. However, I
agree that it is important, for the sake of morale, for the community
to understand that there is work, and to try to preserve the 1,200 jobs
that remain.</p><p><a name="06071143000403"><b><a name="06071143000540">Margaret
Hodge:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have established
the taskforce, and I and other Ministers will be examining its work.
That provides immediate support to the individuals affected and their
families, and provides retraining. I hope that it will be able to
organise some job fairs and similar events, such as we have used
elsewhere in comparable circumstances, to try to link individuals who
have just lost their jobs with employers in the region who have
vacancies to fill.</p><p><a name="06071143000404">I
am conscious that I have little time to answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions. The Cornwall economy is one of the
poorest; for that reason it always gets access to many of the European
funding mechanisms that are available, in recognition of the challenges
that it faces in sustaining jobs and developing enterprise and growth.
However, figures are much better than they used to be. The growth rate
for 2002-03, with respect to total gross added value, shows that
Cornwall added 6.8 per cent., outperforming the rest of the UK
by 5.5 per cent. and outperforming all other objective 1
areas, where the average was 5.9 per cent.</p><p><a name="06071143000405">Employment has grown in
Cornwall since 1999, although, interestingly enough, it is a
depopulating area, and many of the traditional jobs have gone. Clearly,
new industries are settling there. Other key initiatives are important.
One of those is the combined universities in Cornwall, which I was
involved in helping to establish when I had responsibility for higher
education. The hon. Gentleman spoke about new marine-related
industries, for example. If the right relationship can be established,
involving the university and its research capacity, and if ideas
arising from that knowledge and research development can be translated
into practical enterprise opportunities in the locality, that will be
the best way to ensure sustainable long-term job opportunities in the
area. I always saw that combined university development as central to
the attempt to regenerate.</p><p><a name="06071143000406">We all take great joy in
visiting such places as the Eden project or Tate St. Ives. The Eden
project now employs up to 600 staff during its busy period. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman accepts that that is a positive development in the
area. We reckon that it brings about &#163;100 million of local
economic benefit. I understand that there is also a major redevelopment
project in St. Austell.</p><p><a name="06071143000407">Yesterday I announced the new
map for assisted area status. Cornwall has full status and will also
benefit from full convergence funding. I hear what the hon. Gentleman
said about match funding; it is down to the local players&#151;the
regional development agency and 
<br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 430WH</b><br>the local authorities, including the county council&#151;to look for
that match funding, but they, and the RDA in particular, have the
necessary resources and I hope that those concerned will benefit from
them. If the hon. Gentleman has a problem, he should come back to me
about it. Substantial resources are thus available in the area in
question, and assisted area status, for example, could be of help to
the company if it has a sustainable project. Perhaps the company should
work with the RDA to see whether, on matters such as energy costs, a
proper case could be put, through assisted area status, for state aid
to support its continuing endeavour in the area.</p><p><a name="06071143000408">Many of the issues that the
hon. Gentleman has raised are now dealt with locally. We have
decentralised, and his party should be in favour of that. I was
surprised&#151;it was news to me&#151;that the A391 had been
deprioritised locally. I had seen it as a quite important way to open
up those very poor communities to job opportunities. It is a decision
that has been taken regionally, however, and I am in some difficulty. I
do not mind talking to my colleagues in other Departments, but if it
has become a lower regional priority, that is difficult for us at the
centre to override.</p><p><a name="06071143000409"><b><a name="06071143000541">Matthew
Taylor:</b> It is a matter in which the region advises, but
Ministers dispose, so the Minister&#146;s colleagues at the
Department for Transport take the decision. Also, the issue has arisen
in the consultation exercise at regional level. I hope that the
Minister will raise it. We shall have a much better idea by the time
Parliament returns in the autumn, and perhaps the Minister will be
willing then, if we feel the need, to meet local representatives if
issues need to be dealt with.</p><p><a name="06071143000410"><b><a name="06071143000542">Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am certainly happy to meet representatives, and I
undertake to do so. I also undertake to write to my colleagues in the
Department for Transport, if that decision was taken before the Imerys
redundancies. I completely understand, also, the impact of the supply
chain in relation to jobs. However, land and asset disposal are really
matters for the locality, through the RDA and the relevant local
authorities. It is not a matter for Government, and I urge the hon.
Gentleman to work closely with those bodies, as I am sure he already
does.</p><p><a name="06071143000411">The hon.
Gentleman asked me to show an understanding of how devastating the
impact of the closure is locally. I understand totally, and tried to
express it last week in the responses that I gave to the situation. Our
job, in working with the hon. Gentleman and all the relevant agencies
locally and nationally, must be to give the area a future, and to close
the gap in prosperity and job opportunities that still exists across
England. It is our intention and policy aim to tackle that
gap.</p><p><a name="06071143000412"><i>Question put
