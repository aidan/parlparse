Russell (Colchester) (LD):</b> I
congratulate the United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen's Association,
which is based in Nepal, on the excellent campaign that it has
conducted, with others, to get a better deal&#151;a fair and just
deal&#151;and recognition and appreciation from Britain, the country
which hundreds of thousands of brave citizens from Nepal have served
with such courage and distinction over many decades, for those Gurkha
veterans who have not been treated as they should have been after
giving up active service. Having praised the association&#146;s
campaign, I would also like to thank its members for providing so much
background information in order to justify a successful
conclusion.</p><p><a name="06060755000010">The
participation of other Members in this debate is welcome, but I trust
that ample time will be left to enable the Minister to
respond&#151;hopefully with encouraging news for the Gurkha
veterans.</p><p><a name="06060755000011"><b><a name="06060755000408">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am
grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I am happy to call him that,
but by convention I should refer to him as the hon. Gentleman. He
mentions the campaign. He and I have met good numbers of Gurkhas here
in the Palace of Westminster today. Does he agree that the fact that
the campaign has been quiet, restrained and dignified has, to an
extent, led to protracted negotiations, when the situation might have
been resolved rather earlier? Unfortunately, the meek do not always
inherit the earth. Nevertheless, people have been very
effective.</p><p><a name="06060755000012"><b><a name="06060755000409">Bob
Russell:</b> I appreciate that contribution. It is fair to say
that the Gurkha veterans have been dignified in the extreme in their
campaign. It is a tribute to them that they have been able to maintain
that attitude. I hope that their courage and due diligence will pay
dividends.</p><p><a name="06060755000013">A
review of the general issues has been carried out, and its publication
by the Ministry of Defence is eagerly anticipated. Perhaps
today&#146;s debate is pushing at an unlocked door, but how far will
the Government open it? Shortly after coming into office, the Labour
Government rightly took action towards putting serving Gurkha soldiers
on an equal footing with the rest of the British Army, which is to be
both welcomed and applauded. However, I seek the Minister&#146;s
assurance that the 3,000 Gurkhas currently serving in the British Army
have equal terms and conditions of service, in all respects, to their
British counterparts.</p><p><a name="06060755000014">Today&#146;s debate relates
to veterans who retired before July 1997. It will no doubt be claimed
that it is not possible to make amends for the unfair way in which 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 78WH</b><br>serving Gurkhas were treated by successive Governments prior to then,
but I trust that no one will defend the continued unfairness that
Gurkha veterans who retired prior to that date have experienced over
many decades. That shameful legacy tarnishes British military history
and must be ended without further delay. Those veterans were
short-changed when they served in the British Army, and they and their
families must not be short-changed in retirement.</p><p><a name="06060755000015">I declare a personal interest.
I once served with the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles. Admittedly it
was while I was on the armed forces parliamentary scheme, and it was
for only four days, but those days on a live exercise in difficult
terrain in Kenya are ones that I shall never forget, and I have the
T-shirt to prove it.</p><p><a name="06060755000016">Two weeks ago
I had the honour of welcoming about 50 members of the Nepal-based
United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen&#146;s Association to the House
of Commons, after which I accompanied them to the Gurkha memorial off
Whitehall where wreaths and tribute ribbons were laid, and the last
post and reveille were played. We then went to Downing street, where a
detailed appeal was handed in calling on the Government to put right
the many years of wrong, and to treat Gurkha veterans in the same way
as others who have served in Her Majesty&#146;s and, in some cases,
His Majesty&#146;s armed forces. The oldest veteran there had served
in Burma in the second world war. Another was the holder of the
Victoria cross from a conflict 40 years ago. That medal was one
of13 Victoria crosses to be awarded to Gurkhas among more
than 6,500 decorations for bravery.</p><p><a name="06060755000017">Gurkhas have frequently been
portrayed as the bravest of the brave. They are renowned for their
valour on the battlefields and for being exceptional soldiers who are
loyal to those they serve. Their tenacity, strength, fearlessness,
courage and ferocity are without equal. To Britain&#146;s shame,
however, there is a parallel history of discrimination in the 190 years
in which successive generations of Gurkha soldiers have served the
Crown.</p><p><a name="06060755000018">The United
British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen&#146;s Association, which was formed in
Nepal in 2003, is an umbrella group of six different Gurkha
ex-servicemen&#146;s associations in Nepal. It is a non-profit
organisation dedicated to the welfare of Gurkha veterans and to
highlighting the problems faced by them and their families. That
unifying organisation has been lobbying both the British and Nepalese
Governments for equal rights for Gurkhas in relation to pay, pension
and other facilities. The association&#146;s background briefing
tells me:</p><a name="06060755000368"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;That
the Ministry of Defence has discriminated against the ex-Gurkhas is a
fact, which needs no further elaboration. There is no need to further
justify this grave injustice perpetrated &#145;to a friend by a
friend&#146;.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000019">The
briefing goes
on:</p><a name="06060755000369"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Gurkhas have fought with utmost bravery and loyalty for the British
Crown and its citizens for the last 200 years. They have made enormous
contributions towards the British colonial expansion and have
safeguarded the British Empire across the Globe. They fought in both
World Wars. They have continued to serve British interests in
subsequent conflicts. They have proved to be the most trusted and loyal
friends of the British in the most difficult of times...As a
reward the Gurkhas are left destitute today. They live a life of misery
and shame back home. They are forced to sell their medals of bravery to
make their ends meet and many have been forced to beg on the streets of
their own villages.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 79WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000020">How can we ignore such a situation?
Something must be done. I trust that the Minister will say that urgent
action will be taken to answer this cry for help. We should
collectively hang our heads in shame.</p><p><a name="06060755000021">The
Minister might suggest that the tripartite agreement between the
Governments of the United Kingdom, India and Nepal, which was signed in
1947, or thereabouts, prevents Britain from improving the lot of Gurkha
veterans, but I am advised that the Indian Government have written to
the association refuting that, and saying:</p><a name="06060755000370"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is an issue
between the UK and
Nepal.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000022">The
pension is arguably the most important and contentious issue, and needs
to be resolved immediately. Pensions paid to Gurkha veterans need to be
brought into line with those paid to British
veterans&#151;proportionate to years of service. The same should be
done for the pensions paid to widows of Gurkha veterans. There is no
social welfare policy in Nepal, and the widows of Gurkha veterans often
suffer extreme financial difficulties. Gurkhas who were discharged
without any pension should be considered for a preserved pension, like
British soldiers.</p><p><a name="06060755000023">The medical
expenses of retired Gurkhas should be borne by the Ministry of Defence
in full. The current system, in which the Gurkha Welfare Trust coughs
up funds for veterans&#146; medical expenses, is totally
unacceptable. The GWT is a charitable trust and the moneys in it were
raised by the Gurkhas themselves or were donated. Rather than allow the
current situation to continue, the MOD should bear the full costs of
ex-servicemen&#146;s medical
treatment.</p><p><a name="06060755000024">Compensation
is another important issue which needs to be addressed. I have been
given details of the discrimination in relation to the pay and
conditions of Gurkha soldiers while serving in the British Army. I
invite the Minister to respond positively to the following point put
strongly to me on behalf of the veterans:</p><a name="06060755000371"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is only logical that
the post-1947 Gurkhas are awarded compensation for the loss in pay and
allowances during their entire
service.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000025">Another
issue of great importance that, because of time, I shall address
briefly is that of discrimination against Gurkha veterans who left the
British Army before July 1997 regarding the granting of indefinite
leave to remain in the UK. The Minister need not necessarily respond
today; he could do so in writing later. I am advised that veterans who
retire after that date are granted leave, and I agree with the
association that</p><a name="06060755000372"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
morally and legally important that the British Government allow all
Gurkha Ex-Servicemen and their families, regardless of when they
retired, to enter, work and live in the UK with
dignity.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000026">Does the
Minister agree? If not, why not?</p><p><a name="06060755000027">Another issue that needs to be
resolved is the citizenship status of children born to mothers who
accompany their Gurkha soldier husbands who serve in the British Army,
whether in the UK or overseas. Why cannot they have British
citizenship?</p><p><a name="06060755000028">In
conclusion, I shall quote from the heartfelt appeal made last month by
the association when it sent a special delegation from Nepal to
London:</p><a name="06060755000373"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As
Gurkhas, we feel that the current Review is a wonderful opportunity to
address and solve all the aforementioned problems affecting the retired
Gurkhas in a just and fair manner, 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 80WH</b><br>with all sincerity for once and all, acceptable to both the Gurkhas and
British Government, thus ensuring that the state of dissent and
conflict that now exists between them is resolved forever. It would
also ensure that the Ministry of Defence position would be beyond
reproach, both legally and morally. Additionally, we feel this will
enhance, even more, the warm and friendly relation between the two
countries.&#148;</p></ul><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000388">9.40
am</h5><p><a name="06060755000029"><b><a name="06060755000410">Mr.
Roger Williams (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</b> First, I
should apologise to hon. Members and to you, Mr. Cook, because I may
have to leave the debate later to attend to other parliamentary
duties.</p><p><a name="06060755000030">It is a great
pleasure to take part in this debate. I pay particular tribute to my
hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) for the work that
he has done on behalf of Gurkha veterans, and to other hon. Members in
that regard. In his speech, my hon. Friend displayed his depth of
knowledge and his commitment to putting right many of the difficulties
that afflict Gurkha veterans after they finish their service with the
British Army.</p><p><a name="06060755000031">Nobody
can doubt the loyalty and bravery with which the Gurkhas have served
this nation. I, too, have experienced service with the Gurkhas, in the
jungle in Brunei, albeit for only two days. It was an experience that I
shall never forget. Although my jungle warfare skills were not of the
highest order, they said that after those two days I was
&#147;improving&#148;.</p><p><a name="06060755000032">I have a particular interest in
the Gurkhas in relation to Derring Lines, where company and platoon
commanders of the infantry in the British Army are trained, and
Sennybridge ranges, which is another infantry training facility.
Probably every infantryman in the British Army has experienced it. A
Gurkha captain told me that although the Arctic is cold, it is dry, and
although the jungle is wet, it is at least warm, but Sennybridge is
cold and wet and the highest level of personal organisation is needed
to survive there, so it is a test for people wanting to serve in the
British Army.</p><p><a name="06060755000033">Before
I talk about the veterans, I must say that things are improving for
currently serving Gurkhas. I pay tribute to the fact that accompanied
service for married Gurkhas has now been extended from the minimum
three-year period of service. They now have the same conditions as
apply to other members of the British armed forces, as long as they
have served three years. It is fairly traditional for Gurkhas to get
married after their second period of Nepal leave, which is probably
after six years. In Brecon, the number of Gurkha soldiers who have
their family with them has increased from about 27 to approximately 34.
Those Gurkhas serve with the Mandalay company, which is a demonstration
company of Gurkhas that helps with the training of platoon and company
commanders in the Brecon area. Their contribution to that training is
second to none.</p><p><a name="06060755000034"><b><a name="06060755000411">David
Taylor:</b> The hon. Gentleman is describing the welcome
improvements that have been made in recent years. As the hon. Member
for Colchester said, there is a serious problem in relation to the 1997
cut-off date, and we must not lose sight of that. Some 32,000 Gurkhas
in Nepal are adversely affected by the failure 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 81WH</b><br>thus far to address the problems that he referred to in his opening
speech. That is the key issue of this debate, is it
not?</p><p><a name="06060755000035"><b><a name="06060755000412">Mr.
Williams:</b> I agree, but I was hoping to
make the point that things are improving for some Gurkhas who will
retire from the British Army in future. Their conditions will have been
addressed, but the circumstances of Gurkhas who left the Army before
1997 will not be dealt with until the Government take action. We
understand those issues, which were well set out by my hon. Friend the
Member for Colchester. Gurkhas who are currently serving, as well as
those who left the Army before 1997, are still concerned about
nationality and indefinite leave to remain.</p><p><a name="06060755000036">Although
conditions in Nepal have improved to a certain extent and the
commitment to democracy which is now emerging will enhance living
conditions in that country, the Government must address the fact that
Gurkhas who have retired to Nepal do not have sufficient pensions to
enjoy their retirement and to ensure that their families are maintained
so as to give them security and peace of mind in their remaining
years.</p><p><a name="06060755000037">My
contribution this morning has been relatively short, but my involvement
with the Gurkha troops is an ongoing concern. The Minister was kind
enough to arrange a visit to Derring Lines, where the Gurkhas are
based, so that I could talk to their commanding officer and to some of
the soldiers. They have concerns about the people who retired before
1997, some of whom they served with, because they know that the retired
soldiers will not have the same conditions and the same enhancements as
they will enjoy.</p><p><a name="06060755000038">We
look forward to the Minister being able to announce at some stage, if
not today, that Britain will at last repay the great debt that the
nation owes to the Gurkha soldiers, who have made such a huge
contribution not only to the defence of the country, but to promoting
British interests abroad.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000389">9.47
am</h5><p><a name="06060755000039"><b><a name="06060755000413">Dr.
Ashok Kumar (Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland)
(Lab):</b> Thank you for calling me to speak in this important
debate, Mr. Cook. I had no intention of taking part, but I am happy to
say a few words.</p><p><a name="06060755000040">First, I
congratulate the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) on securing
the debate. The topic is an important one, and I am sorry that some
hon. Members are otherwise engaged. Had I not been delayed on the way
here, I would have heard all of his speech, but I caught some of it,
and I agree with the spirit of his
remarks.</p><p><a name="06060755000041">I have
followed the subject from a distance, always listening and watching
what was going on. Over the years, our Government have made an immense
effort to tackle discrimination wherever it exists. We have made a
start, and although there is still a long way to go, I praise my
Government for their record in that respect.</p><p><a name="06060755000042">I must say to
the Minister that the treatment of the Gurkhas is an issue of
discrimination. I welcome him to his new post. I am sure that he will
take the issue up as one of his causes in his Department and he may
become renowned for dealing with it. I agree with what was said earlier
about the contribution that the Gurkhas have made as part of the
British armed forces; I have never 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 82WH</b><br>heard a single person say anything different: people recognise the
bravery of the Gurkhas and the contribution that they have
made.</p><p><a name="06060755000043">Discrimination
interests me. For the Gurkhas, the important issue is their pensions
and how they compare with the pensions given to British soldiers. There
is no quick fix or immediate answer, but we must work towards a
solution. The Government are carrying out pensions reform elsewhere, so
we can take up the matter as part of the reform process if we want to
do so. That represents an opportunity for us, although we might be
looking a few years down the line. Nevertheless, an acknowledgement by
the Minister that there is discrimination in that respect would be a
step forward.</p><p><a name="06060755000044">I agree with
the spirit of what the hon. Member for Colchester said. We have had
many debates on the topic in the House, and it is important that it be
kept alive. As long as discrimination and problems relating to
nationality, citizenship and so on exist, it is important that the
Labour Government&#151;I hope that people will endorse the Government
at the next election&#151;work to eliminate them. I know that we
cannot do everything at once, but we must at least take steps to remedy
the situation. I have always championed all that my party has done to
tackle discrimination and injustice. I joined the Labour party because
it gave hope to young Asians like me. The Labour party cares and fights
against injustice and discrimination. The great Governments of Harold
Wilson, Callaghan and others introduced race legislation and I see this
debate in the same light.</p><p><a name="06060755000045">The heroism
of the Gurkhas is well documented. Given the contribution that they
have made, the injustice must be put right. I believe that in the
Government and among Labour Members, there is the spirit to do that. I
have known the Minister for almost a decade, since before he entered
the House. He gave me a lot of support when I was trying to be elected
for my constituency in the north-east and I know that he cares
passionately about alleviating injustice. The Gurkhas&#146; situation
must be put
right.</p><p><a name="06060755000046">I
am sure that the Minister will tell us all that we have achieved, but I
would like him to go a step further and to offer a few words of hope,
because hope is important. I am sure that there will be all-party
agreement among Front-Bench Members, but we as a Labour Government are
in a position to do something and to build on the progress that we have
made.</p><p><a name="06060755000047">I
reiterate the importance of the debate and congratulate the hon. Member
for Colchester again on securing it. I know that he has been interested
in the subject for a long time. At various times in the voting Lobby,
often with him walking on one side and I on the other, we have
discussed various topics, including the Gurkhas. It is a great credit
to the hon. Gentleman and the passionate way in which he has argued
this important case that we are discussing it today. As someone who
cares that the Labour Government does something about it, I look
forward to the day when a debate such as this is not
needed.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000390">9.54
am</h5><p><a name="06060755000048"><b><a name="06060755000414">Willie
Rennie (Dunfermline and West Fife) (LD):</b>
I, too, offer my congratulations to my hon. Friend
the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) who has set out his case in his
usual passionate, humorous, colourful and casual manner. He is a great
asset to the Liberal 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 83WH</b><br>Democrat Benches and I am sure that all hon. Members agree that he has
made a great contribution to today&#146;s debate. I am sure that the
Gurkhas are delighted to have him on their side.</p><p><a name="06060755000049">Fairness and
justice; recognition; dignified; equality; destitution; short-changed;
begging and discrimination. These are words that have been used in the
Chamber this morning and I think that they sum up the
debate.</p><p><a name="06060755000050">As
we have heard, the Gurkhas have served the Crown since 1815. In 1947,
the tripartite agreement set out their terms and conditions of service.
While their numbers have decreased over the years, the Gurkhas still
play an important role, having been deployedin Kosovo, East
Timor, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Afghanistan and many other conflicts
throughout the world. In nine years, the Gurkhas will have served this
country for two centuries&#151;200 years of dedication, protecting a
country that is neither their birthplace nor their nation.</p><p><a name="06060755000051">One of the key principles of
the tripartite agreement was that soldiers in both armies should serve
under broadly the same terms and conditions of service. That is an
important principle and was an enlightened one at the time. I repeat
that soldiers in both armies should serve under broadly the same terms
and conditions of service; that is a principle to which I shall return,
because it is
important.</p><p><a name="06060755000052">I
like to give credit where credit it is due, and the Government deserve
some credit on this issue. Since they came to power, there have been
three important developments, which are rooted in the principles of the
tripartite agreement. First, in 2000, the increase in death gratuity to
rates comparable with those for British soldiers was a welcome step.
Secondly, the introduction in 1997 of married accompanied service for
Gurkhas serving in the UK is worthy of praise. Two months ago, all
married Gurkhas with three years&#146; service became entitled to
married accompanied service. They are also entitled to accommodation
for their families, which is charged at the same level as for British
servicemen.</p><p><a name="06060755000053">Finally,
until recently, Gurkhas could not get indefinite leave to remain in the
UK when they were discharged from service. In 2004, the then Liberal
Democrat defence spokesperson, my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford
(Mr. Keetch), said:</p><a name="06060755000374"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Citizenship should not
be something that former Gurkhas should have to apply for. It should be
given as a
right.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000054">That
plea was backed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), the leader of my party. Shortly
after, our call to allow Gurkhas to have British citizenship was
finally granted by the Government, albeit upon completion of four
years&#146; service and only on application. However, those new rules
apply only to those discharged on or after 1 July 1997&#151;the date
on which the Brigade of Gurkhas moved its headquarters from Hong Kong
back to the UK following the handover to China. It was a step in the
right direction, but the situation today is unacceptable and is still
discriminatory.</p><p><a name="06060755000055"><b><a name="06060755000415">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman is new to his post
and that he is probably on as bewildering a parliamentary journey as I
am, so I do 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 84WH</b><br>not want to put him too much on the spot, but can he confirm that it is
Liberal Democrat policy to agree to the demand of the hon. Member for
Colchester (Bob Russell) for retrospective pensions for
Gurkhas?</p><p><a name="06060755000056"><b><a name="06060755000416">Willie
Rennie:</b> My understanding is that we are pressing for full
citizenship for Gurkhas, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for
Colchester.</p><p><a name="06060755000057">Many
Gurkha veterans and their families are still affected by discrimination
in relation to citizenship. About 400 Gurkhas are resident in the UK,
of whom 100 are not eligible under the new rules, and there are
thousands&#151;32,000, we have heard today&#151;back in Nepal. I
urge the Minister to consider changes in this area.</p><p><a name="06060755000058">I also urge
the Minister to re-examine the pensions issue. We continue to hear
worrying reports from Nepal about Gurkhas living in poverty because
they fail to receive sufficient pension payments. I would welcome a
report from the Minister detailing his knowledge of the problem, with
estimates of its scale. I would also welcome an estimate of the cost of
introducing pensions equality between British soldiers and Gurkhas.
Unless we have an idea of the real cost, it is difficult to get an
exact handle on the
situation.</p><p><a name="06060755000059">A
further review of Gurkha terms and conditions of service was announced
in January 2005, but it has not yet reported back. A considerable
period has elapsed&#151;sufficient to allow an effective and
professional review. I look forward to hearing from the Minister about
progress to date. I urge him to use the opportunity to institute
changes to the rules of citizenship and to introduce the necessary
changes to the pension arrangements.</p><p><a name="06060755000060">To sum up, this has been a
short but good debate. It has allowed Members to reflect on the
contribution that the Gurkhas have made to the security of our country
and our interests abroad, to praise the Government for the improvements
to the Gurkhas&#146; situation that have rightly been
made&#151;even if they are long overdue&#151;and to encourage the
Minister to take another step along the Gurkhas&#146; road to
equality in citizenship and in pensions. It is the least that they
deserve for 200 years of service to our
country.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000391">10

Mark Harper (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> I, too, congratulate
the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) on securing this debate
and on the way in which he presented his case. Noting the
ever-decreasing length of hon. Members&#146; service with the Brigade
of Gurkhas, with the hon. Gentleman having undertaken four days and the
hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) two, I have to
say that having been in my post for only a short period, I have yet to
do any.</p><p><a name="06060755000062">I should like
to pick up on a point that the hon. Member for North-West
Leicestershire (David Taylor) made about the dignified way in which the
Gurkhas have presented their case. He questioned whether it has been to
their detriment compared with those who present their case loudly.
Speaking for myself and for other hon. Members, I respect those who
make a well argued and logical case, and I tend to pay more attention
to people who make their case in that way than to those who shout from
the rooftops, and I hope 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 85WH</b><br>that the Gurkhas, who have campaigned in the former way, have not
disadvantaged themselves. As far as my party and I are concerned, they
have not, and I urge all who campaign for change in policy to do so in
that way, so that we can engage in a logical and sensible debate,
rather than yell at each other.</p><p><a name="06060755000063">I, too, pay tribute to the
service that the Gurkhas have provided to the Crown since 1815 and in
the British Army since 1947. The British public understand and respect
that service. That is why the Gurkhas are held in high esteem, and one
of the reasons why the subject has been raised in the House on numerous
occasions.</p><p><a name="06060755000064">When thinking
about the history of this issue, it is worth thinking also about the
way in which we approach it and from which end of the telescope we look
at it. If we consider it in the context of today&#146;s circumstances
and conditions, we can understand why people use such terms as
&#147;discrimination&#148; and &#147;injustice&#148;. However,
if one considers how the current arrangements were arrived at, when the
British Army took in some Gurkha regiments, the Indian army took in
others and the tripartite agreement was signed in 1947 in a different
world and in different conditions, one can see why the arrangements
were made in the way that they were.</p><p><a name="06060755000065">The Liberal Democrat spokesman,
the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie), drew
attention to the tripartite agreement and the fact that it set down
that Gurkhas serving in the British Army should serve under broadly
comparable terms and conditions to those under which Gurkhas serve in
the Indian army. It is one of the principles that was established at
the beginning. The tripartite agreement has not been revised since
1947, although it is true that when British Governments have made
changes, they have made them in accordance with the its original
principles.</p><p><a name="06060755000066">It is
worth welcoming the several changes that the present Government have
made since they came to power in 1997, but it might be sensible also to
recognise that piecemeal change might not be the way forward. That is
why in January 2005 we welcomed the then Secretary of State&#146;s
announcement of a comprehensive review of Gurkhas&#146; terms and
conditions of service. That is probably a better approach than making
changes incrementally and without thinking through the whole package.
We welcome a comprehensive review. It is disappointing that it has
taken a good deal of time, but I know that the Minister will say more
about it today. I understand that he hopes to complete the review and
make an announcement later this year.</p><p><a name="06060755000067">Frustrating
though the delay might be, having considered other issues during my
time in my present post, I have concluded that it is greatly to be
preferred to take the time to get the review right and investigate all
complexities at this stage, so that when the Minister comes to the
Dispatch Box later this year to announce the results of the terms and
conditions review, it is comprehensive, well thought through and
results in a change that endures. It should not be rushed, so that we
end up returning to the matter every year to put right issues that were
not thought through properly. One has to spend only a brief period
considering the issues and the complexities that might arise to
understand that. I welcome the review, and I am glad that the Minister
is taking the time to undertake it
properly.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 86WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000068"><b><a name="06060755000418">Bob

either.</p><p><a name="06060755000072">When the

been done yet and without having seen the review, however, I do not
want to commit us in advance to whatever it may propose.</p><p><a name="06060755000073">As part of
the review, it would be wise to ensure that we discuss with the
Government of Nepal the review&#146;s implications and any impact
that it may have on the situation in Nepal. It would be useful if the
Minister could confirm whether that will happen. I am conscious that we
must consider the impact of our changes on those areas of Nepal from
which Gurkhas have been traditionally been recruited. In making changes
in Britain, we must ensure that there are no unfortunate effects in
Nepal. Despite what hon. Members have said about the terms and
conditions of service under which Gurkhas serve, and notwithstanding
the questions that the hon. Gentleman has raised, if we consider the
number of Nepalese who apply to join the Brigade of Gurkhas, which is
about 100 for each available place, it seems that in their assessment,
serving the Crown and serving in the British Army is attractive and
rewarding. We should take the review forward in consultation with the
Government of Nepal.</p>

<p><a name="06060755000074">Without wishing to broaden the
review, I ask that when the Minister is undertaking it, he considers
this final point. There are more than 7,000 other foreign nationals
serving in the British Army, and it may be worth him considering
whether any changes need to be made in relation to them. The last thing
that we want to do is change the terms and conditions of service for
the Brigade of Gurkhas, and then find that a significant number of
other issues
arise.</p><p><a name="06060755000075"><b><a name="06060755000422">Bob
Russell:</b> The figure that the hon.
Gentleman gave for the number of foreign nationals serving in the
British Army is, I think, somewhat greater thanthe figure in
reality. However, the big difference is that the Gurkhas serve in their
own units and regiments, whereas other foreign nationals who join Her
Majesty&#146;s armed forces serve in British Army regiments,
battalions and other units. In terms of pay and conditions and, as far
as I am concerned, all other respects, they are immediately treated as
though they were British. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the
significance is that the Gurkhas serve not in British Army units but in
their own regiments?</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 87WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000076"><b><a name="06060755000423">Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I have the
latest figures, and there are just over 7,000 foreign nationals serving
in the armed forces, most of them in the British Army. I am simply
saying that if the comprehensive review considers indefinite leave to
remain and the appropriate qualification for British citizenship and
the Minister makes decisions on Gurkhas in those areas, another set of
questions will be raised about what expectations those serving in the
British Army should have in relation to indefinite leave to remain and
becoming a British citizen. It would be sensible to think about that
while resolving one set of issues, so that we do not create another set
of issues and end up coming back to this place to debate them. I am
conscious that if we do not think about the overall position, we could
make changes that, although welcome in themselves, create a whole set
of other perceived unfairnesses. I urge the Minister to think about
that.</p><p><a name="06060755000077">In drawing my
remarks to a close, I reiterate my congratulations to the hon. Member
for Colchester and to those who participated in the debate. I look
forward to what the Minister has to
say.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000392">10.10

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Tom
Watson):</b> I commend the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob
Russell) for securing the debate. He had kind words for me on my first
run-out in the Chamber a few weeks ago, but I suspect that he will not
be as happy with my response this morning. However, I hope that I can
give him some reassurances on the points that he raised. He will know
that although I am new to this job, I am not new to Gurkha policy; he
and I have often sat in on Adjournment debates on the issue just for
the fun of it, not least those in which the right hon. Member for
Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) made contributions in 2003
and 2004.</p><p><a name="06060755000079">I
acknowledge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s service of four days in the
Gurkha battalion. I can just about beat my hon. Friend the Member for
Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar), in that I managed
to spectate&#151;but not serve&#151;for two hours in Catterick last
week, when I saw the Gurkhas training. After those two hours, I was not
unapprised of their worldwide, fearsome reputation. I hope to spend
more time with them in
future.</p><p><a name="06060755000080">On a serious
point, my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David
Taylor) talked about the quiet, restrained and dignified way in which
many of the Gurkha ex-servicemen&#146;s groups make their point. The
United British Gurkhas Ex-servicemen&#146;s Association is one of
many Gurkha ex-servicemen&#146;s groups that put their point to
Government day in, day out, and the hon. Member for Colchester has been
a powerful advocate for them this
morning.</p><p><a name="06060755000081">What amazes
me about Gurkhas is the journey that they take as individuals. The
brigade starts with 15,000 potential recruits in the hills of Nepal.
Rigorous pre-selection training narrows it down to 200 recruits, who
make a journey from Kathmandu to Manchester and then on to Catterick,
where they undergo 39 weeks of training. I have been lucky enough to
witness that training. We have all been impressed by their quality and
the commitment with which they take up service in the Army.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 88WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000082">One thing that
I would like to talk about this morning is the journey that the
Government have taken since the tripartite agreement in 1947 to try to
target and change policy to fit the changed circumstances of Gurkhas,
in the military context. I have a number of detailed points to make in
answer to issues raised by the hon. Member for Colchester. He will have
read the report, &#147;The Gurkhas: The Forgotten Veterans&#148;,
as have I, and I am considering it at the moment. I will respond
formally when I have the opportunity to do so thoroughly. However, I
want to honour the commitment made by my predecessor, my hon. Friend
the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), to meet the authors of that report.
I am trying to ensure that I see them as soon as possible. Also, I am
meeting the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald to talk about
her concerns about the terms and conditions that apply to our Gurkhas;
the hon. Gentleman will know that she has made a large and lasting
contribution on the
subject.</p><p><a name="06060755000083">Let
me give some reassurances about the current terms and conditions of
Gurkhas, and then I shall try to explain the veterans&#146;
situation. We believe that successive British Governments have treated
Gurkhas fairly, in the context of the time in which they served, and we
have already introduced significant improvements to their terms and
conditions, as has been acknowledged by Members of all parties today.
The review of their terms and conditions of service that is in hand
will definitely lead to an even better deal for modern Gurkhas. The
Government deeply appreciate the contribution that Gurkhas have made
over more than two centuries to our Army and, in more recent years, to
the life of this country as their presence here has increased. As part
of the British Indian Army, they served in numerous campaigns,
culminating in the two world wars, in which thousands of Gurkhas
participated.</p><p><a name="06060755000084">The British
Brigade of Gurkhas is an important element of our defence capability
and now numbers some 3,300 men. It includes two battalions of infantry,
the Royal Gurkha Rifles, and specialists in signals, military
engineering and logistics. They are stationed in 14 locations across
England, Wales and Scotland. A battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles is
stationed in Brunei under our defence agreement with the Government of
that country, and over the past 12 months, Gurkhas have been deployed
in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Iraq, where they served&#151;as
ever&#151;with great
distinction.</p><p><a name="06060755000085">We
have not forgotten Gurkha veterans or the debt that we owe them. We pay
more than 26,000 Gurkha service pensions to retired soldiers and their
dependants, and last year that amounted to some &#163;33 million.
Even a retired Gurkha private soldier&#146;s pension is comparable to
workers&#146; salaries in Nepal and is almost 10 times the national
per capita income. On that point, I shall try to answer some of the
questions raised by the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife
(Willie Rennie)
later.</p><p><a name="06060755000086">Nepal is a
developing country, recently torn by internal strife, which we
fervently hope is coming to an end. Retired Gurkhas living there are
Nepalese citizens living in their own country, and it is not surprising
that some heart-rending instances of hardship can be found there. The
Government and the British public support the valuable work of the
Gurkha Welfare Trust, which aims to ensure that no such case goes
unaided. The hon. Member for Colchester mentioned medical
costs; 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 89WH</b><br>we doubled Gurkha service pensions in 1997 so that retired Gurkhas could
use some element of their pension to pay for their medical
costs.</p><p><a name="06060755000087"><b><a name="06060755000425">Bob
Russell:</b> Can the Minister give the figure that was
doubled?</p><p><a name="06060755000088"><b><a name="06060755000426">Mr.
Watson:</b> Not off the top of my head, but I will write to
the hon. Gentleman and will go through the figures with him, if that is
okay.</p><p><a name="06060755000089">As I said, we
support the aims of the Gurkha Welfare Trust, and in addition the
Department for International Development will pay &#163;30 million in
aid to Nepal. We pay tribute to the Gurkhas&#146; courage and
commitment on operations, and their hard work as valued members of our
community in peace. In return, over the years, British Army service has
afforded many benefits to thousands of Nepalese citizens&#151;to
Gurkha soldiers and to their families. In modern times, that mutually
beneficial relationship has been possible only because of the unique
status of the Gurkhas, in terms of their role in the British Army.
Nepal has never been a member of the British empire or the
Commonwealth, and Gurkha service to the British Crown has been enabled
only by a succession of agreements with the Government of a sovereign
and independent Nepal. That remains the case, and those agreements, to
which the hon. Gentleman referred, date back to
1815.</p><p><a name="06060755000090">After the
Gurkhas&#146; distinguished record of service in the Army of the
former British Indian empire, at the time of Indian independence in
1947, an unparalleled arrangement between the British, Nepalese and
Indian Governments allowed Gurkhas to continue their service to the
British Crown while remaining Nepalese citizens. On 1 January 1948, the
predecessors of our current Brigade of Gurkhas transferred to the
British Army on terms based on that agreement, which is the tripartite
agreement that we have talked
about.</p><p><a name="06060755000091">The unique
status of those who transferred means that they joined the British
Army, served, and then retired as Nepalese citizens. As my predecessor
said in an Adjournment debate secured by the right hon. Member for
Maidstone and The Weald&#151;which I think the hon. Member for
Colchester and I both sat in on&#151;it would have been irrational if
Gurkha terms and conditions of service had not taken account of that.
We were committed to discharging Gurkhas in Nepal where, with pensions
that were very substantial by local standards, and often with valuable
skills, they settled in retirement and made an important contribution
to the economy of one of the world&#146;s poorest countries. We
employed the Gurkhas on the same terms on which they came to us: those
of the Indian army of the day. Therefore, many of the terms and
conditions were different from those of the wider British
Army&#151;for example, pay, pensions, soldiers&#146; terms of
engagement and the officers commissioning rules.</p><p><a name="06060755000092">Originally,
many of these differences came about because the Indian Government, who
continue to employ many Gurkhas, wanted equality between their Gurkhas
and ours. In those days the Gurkhas were one of a number of forces
serving under the British Crown but enlisted and based overseas, whose
terms and conditions of service reflected this. British Gurkhas
continued to serve as they had in the old Indian army: in formed 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 90WH</b><br>Gurkha units consisting entirely of Nepalese soldiers and officers,
except for a few British officers and specialists. That has always been
considered essential to maintaining the Gurkhas&#146; formidable
fighting spirit.</p><p><a name="06060755000093"><b><a name="06060755000427">Bob
Russell:</b> Does the Minister know what the
position is of those Gurkhas&#151;whole companies on
occasion&#151;who serve in British units? A few years ago in
Colchester, the Royal Scots were about 180 short and the gap was
plugged with Gurkhas. Would those Gurkhas be treated as Nepalese
volunteers or British soldiers in terms of pay, conditions and
subsequent
pensions?</p><p><a name="06060755000094"><b><a name="06060755000428">Mr.
Watson:</b> I think I shall answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question as I continue my speech. If I do not, he can pull me up on it
again.</p><p><a name="06060755000095">The Nepalese
Government were, and remain, rightly sensitive to any suggestion that
British Gurkhas were mercenaries, as has been said in other areas of
this discussion. They saw exclusively Gurkha units serving in the
British Army with their Nepalese identity preserved as reflecting on
honour and prestige on the reputation of Nepal. Even now, Gurkhas
usually serve as members of formed Gurkha battalions, squadrons or
companies within the Brigade of Gurkhas, although there are notable
exceptions. Although the working language of the Brigade is English,
the structure enables the Nepali language to be spoken, and provides
religious and cultural support to every Gurkha family.</p><p><a name="06060755000096">There have been improvements in
the intervening years. For example, in 1972, Gurkhas serving in the UK
received a cost of living allowance that, added to their Indian army
rate of pay, gave them broadly comparable take-home pay to that of
their British counterparts, and when they served in Hong Kong they were
paid an allowance that reflected prices there. Over time there has been
a constant review of and improvement to support and services for
Gurkhas.</p><p><a name="06060755000097">However, the
presumption has always been that Gurkhas would retire in Nepal, and
their terms and conditions, particularly their pension arrangements,
continued to reflect that understanding. When the time approached for
the UK to hand over Hong Kong, through a gradual process, the Gurkhas
were withdrawn from that country. The hon. Gentleman will know that
that process ended on 1 July 1997, when what had hitherto been a force
enlisted and based overseas was now predominantly based in the UK. It
was only natural at that point that Gurkhas and their families would
increasingly regard the UK as an alternative home to Nepal, and that
their expectations and aspirations would develop accordingly.</p><p><a name="06060755000098">In my view,
it was inevitable that the terms and conditions appropriate to a force
based in the far east would have to adapt to that change in
circumstances. In evolving these terms and conditions, we have always
sought to protect the unique identity of the Gurkhas and their
relationship with their homeland, which the hon. Member for Colchester
has talked about, and the presumption of their retirement in Nepal has
remained.</p><p><a name="06060755000099">Worldwide
parity of take-home pay was brought in as part of a package of changes
introduced in that great year of 1997. It included a new universal
addition, which brought a Gurkha&#146;s take-home pay&#151;wherever
he was serving&#151;up to the same level as that 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 91WH</b><br>of his counterpart in the wider British Army. Gurkhas were allowed to be
accompanied by their families in UK, as was already the case in
overseas stations such as Brunei, although under the tripartite
agreement, that was limited to 25 per cent. of all personnel. At the
same time, Gurkhas retained some privileges not available to other
members of the Army, such as the traditional &#147;Nepal long
leave&#148; of five months every three years at the public
expense.</p><p><a name="06060755000100">Some
differences stemming from the original Indian army terms and conditions
were retained because they were seen as more suitable for the
Gurkha&#146;s unique status as a Nepalese citizen. The Gurkha soldier
was virtually guaranteed 15 years of service, which earned him a
pension for life immediately on discharge&#151;often at the age of
32, 33 or 34&#151;and after that for his dependants. The Gurkha
pension scheme provided pensions that are modest by UK standards but
represent a substantial income, annually updated for inflation, in
Nepal. Such an early payment of pension is not available to other
members of the British armed forces. Over 80 per cent. of ex-Gurkhas,
if they had been members of the armed forces pension scheme, would have
returned to Nepal with only a preserved pension payable at age
60.</p><p><a name="06060755000101">The
Gurkha&#146;s expectation of service depends on his progress through
the ranks. A corporal would have to retire after 15 years, whereas a
warrant officer class 1 would serve for 22 years. The 22-year notice of
engagement in use for all ranks in the wider Army is only manageable
because in recent years British junior ranks have tended to leave
voluntarily if not promoted, sometimes after four or five years.
Traditionally, Gurkhas serve for as long as they can, and it would not
have been possible to offer them all 22 years&#146; service because
that would have resulted in a stagnant, unmanageable manpower structure
in the brigade&#146;s exclusively Gurkha units, and it would have
denied to many Nepalese citizens any opportunity of British Army
service.</p><p><a name="06060755000102">I
believe our predecessors tried hard to get the balance right between
the maintenance of traditional Nepal-facing terms and conditions and
their assimilation, where appropriate, into those of the wider Army.
However, since the move of the Gurkhas&#146; base to the UK and the
progressive alignment of their roles with those of their counterparts
in the wider Army, the differences between their respective terms and
conditions of service have increasingly come under scrutiny, as they
have today. The Government have responded to that in order to ensure
that fairness is at the heart of how we treat the modern Brigade of
Gurkhas.</p><p><a name="06060755000103">Improved
arrangements for Gurkha married accompanied service were announced in
August. In 2003, seven Gurkha veterans had challenged many of the
differences in their terms and conditions of service, particularly
their different pension arrangements, by way of judicial review. The
judges accepted that the differences were still justified because of
the Gurkhas&#146; unique status, and that a full like-with-like
comparison with the wider Army could not be made. The courts dismissed
all complaints and subsequent appeals, although they did,
exceptionally, warn that the 25 per cent. limit on married accompanied
service should be reviewed. 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 92WH</b><br>We have done that, and from 1 April this year, all Gurkhas with at least
three years&#146; service will have the same entitlement to be
accompanied by their families at their duty station as soldiers in the
wider Army.</p><p><a name="06060755000104">The
immigration rules were changed in 2004 to make it easier for Gurkhas to
return to this country on discharge from the Army. Successive
Governments have maintained the policy that British citizenship is not
automatically given in return for military service, but granted on
grounds of residence, towards which such service might not
count.</p><p><a name="06060755000105"><b><a name="06060755000429">Bob
Russell:</b> I appreciate that this is not a matter for the
Minister&#146;s Department, but for the Home Office, and I had
discussions with his predecessor about it, but will he assure me that
the Ministry of Defence is of the view that service to the Crown should
count as residence, even when the soldier is serving
overseas?</p><p><a name="06060755000106"><b><a name="06060755000430">Mr.
Watson:</b> I think I can. If I cannot, I will clarify that by
letter. I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman an assurance on behalf
of another Department, particularly the Home Office, dare I
say.</p><p><a name="06060755000107">Both Gurkhas and
Commonwealth citizens usually serve in our armed forces while
maintaining their own nationality. Although the presumption of
retirement in Nepal has been accepted by the courts as part of the
unique arrangements for Gurkha service, ex-Gurkhas had always been able
to apply to return to this country under normal immigration rules, such
as under the work permit scheme. I think that that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point.</p><p><a name="06060755000108">In 2004, we accepted that from
the time the Gurkhas became based in the UK in 1997 they should be able
to apply for settlement here in the same way as Commonwealth citizens
leaving our Armed Forces. On discharge, they could count four years of
their military service towards the residential qualification for
indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom and, subject to entry
clearance, could settle here with their families. They could
subsequently apply for British citizenship, if they wished to do so,
under normal rules.
</p><p><a name="06060755000109">The
Prime Minister announced the new Her Majesty&#146;s forces
immigration rule on 30 September 2004. We understand that virtually all
Gurkhas discharged since the rule took effect have applied for visas to
enter the UK. Those discharged since 1 July 1997 have until October of
this year to apply. It became clear that more serving and retired
Gurkhas and their families would be living in the UK than ever before
and the Government determined that the remaining differences in their
terms and conditions of service, especially the Nepal-facing ones,
should be reviewed. That is what we are doing now.</p><p><a name="06060755000110">The hon.
Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) made a point about the remit of
the review. I shall give a bit of the context. The former Secretary of
State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), asked
in January last year for a comprehensive review of Gurkha terms and
conditions. It is by far the widest-reaching review since 1948 and is
examining every remaining difference between Gurkha and UK terms and
conditions. Much of what I have said, inasmuch as it refers to
Gurkhas&#146; current terms and conditions, may be affected by the
review.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 93WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000111">We have
consulted serving Gurkhas through surveys and focus groups, and we are
in close touch at official level with the Nepalese Government. We have
tried to be as inclusive as possible and have invited other interested
parties, including groups representing Gurkha veterans, to express
their views. The complexity of the review has proved even greater than
we expected, and I welcome the support that we have had in ensuring
that we have time to ensure that the review is comprehensive and
wide-reaching. I hope to be able to report back to the House with the
outcome of the review as soon as I can, and I take the matter very
seriously. I want to be able to give good news to the House that will
satisfy some of the aspirations that have been expressed
today.</p><p><a name="06060755000112">Meanwhile,
I am pleased to say that we have been able to introduce some
improvements in advance of the review&#146;s final report. In
addition to the immigration concession and improved facilities for
married accompanied service, which were the two main concerns that were
raised by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald, as
everyone knows, the Gurkhas have been included in the national
insurance scheme so that they can qualify for national insurance
benefits, including the state retirement pension and the state second
pension. From April this year, collective settlement of their income
tax and national insurance contribution liability by the Ministry of
Defence and the provision of free food and accommodation, offset by
corresponding abatements of their universal addition, ceased, and
Gurkhas will now see full details of their pay, tax and charges and be
eligible for rebates of food and accommodation charges when appropriate
in the same way as any soldier in the wider Army. Those improvements
were widely welcomed by serving Gurkhas and the groups that represent
them.</p><p><a name="06060755000113">I have to
emphasise that the review is focused on the terms and conditions of
service for serving and future Gurkhas.</p><p><a name="06060755000114"><b><a name="06060755000431">Bob
Russell:</b> I am getting a bit alarmed. Did
the Minister say that the review is not historical and applies only to
current and future Gurkhas? If it is not historical, the campaign that
is being waged will have to be
reinvigorated.</p><p><a name="06060755000115"><b><a name="06060755000432">Mr.
Watson:</b> I ask the hon. Gentleman to hear me out and let me
make my point. If he is not satisfied, he should come back to me
again.</p><p><a name="06060755000116">As part of
the review, the Department is looking again at the pension position of
Gurkhas back to 1 July 1997, when the Gurkhas first became a UK-based
force. We remain of the view that the position of Gurkha 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 94WH</b><br>veterans discharged prior to 1 July 1997 remains exactly as it was when
the judicial review reached its conclusions. We maintain that their
terms and conditions may have been different, but that they were not
discriminatory. On the issue of veterans&#146; pensions, I remind the
Chamber that it has been the long-held policy of successive Governments
not to make retrospective improvements to public sector pension
schemes.</p><p><a name="06060755000117">The hon.
Member for Dunfermline and West Fife asked whether we had estimated the
cost of adding a retrospective element to the scheme for the time
before 1997, back to the tripartite agreement of 1947. It would cost
many billions of pounds if we were to do that, even before we accept
that it would have repercussions in terms of precedent for other
pension schemes in the public sector. There are good reasons for our
not making retrospective changes for those who have already left under
earlier pension rules, as that would make future improvements
unaffordable. To depart from that rule for one group would inevitably
cause others to demand the same treatment.</p><p><a name="06060755000118">I recognise that that will
disappoint the hon. Member for Colchester and those who retired before
1 July 1997, particularly those distinguished former Gurkhas who handed
in a petition to Downing street on 22 May. I acknowledge the strength
of feeling that this subject and other veterans&#146; issues generate
among certain Gurkha ex-servicemen&#146;s groups, although we have
tried hard to explain the situation to them, including by sending MOD
officials to hold briefings in Nepal.</p><p><a name="06060755000119">I hope that I have provided
some reassurances that the Department continues to treat Gurkhas with
the significant respect that they earn and deserve. To reflect on the
more recent period, in 1997 the brigade became a UK force, in 2003 we
reviewed the responsibilities for Gurkha families and later in 2004 we
changed their immigration status. I hope to align their terms and
conditions further with those of the British Army. We are on a journey
with their terms and conditions and I hope that it is a positive
one.</p><p><a name="06060755000120">I know the hon.
Gentleman will be disappointed with my last point. There will always be
people who think that we should do more and that we can do more, but I
believe that our treatment of Gurkhas, Gurkha veterans and their
dependants has been and remains both fair and reasonable under the
circumstances.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000393">10.38

Gateway</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000394">11
am</h5><p><a name="06060755000122"><b><a name="06060755000433">Mr.
Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) (Con):</b> I am
delighted to have secured this debate and to have an opportunity to
shine a light on and raise the profile of the corridor from Hull to
York&#151;often known as the 1079 corridor because of the A1079,
which unfortunately is famous more for its accident record, congestion
and failure to support a powerful and dynamic growth area than for any
other reason. I am grateful to the Minister for being here today and I
am glad to welcome her to her new
post.</p><p><a name="06060755000123">The issue is of
growing importance to many of my constituents in Beverley and
Holderness, in respect of not only car transport but transport of
freight and public transport. First, I plan to discuss the economic and
social transformation that has taken place in the region over the past
decade and the growing demand for a viable, expanding transport
infrastructure that is commensurate with and supportive of that growth.
I plan then to concentrate on two specific issues: the A1079, which
runs between Hull and York; and the proposed reopening of the Hull to
York railway line, including the section that no longer exists between
Beverley and York. I shall then focus on the relatively poor funding
that the East Riding of Yorkshire receives from central Government for
local transport and conclude by making a plea to the Minister to work
on correcting all those
injustices.</p><p><a name="06060755000124">The East
Riding of Yorkshire is performing strongly. The local economy is doing
well, business investment has increased significantly in recent years
and more people are moving to the area than ever before. Population
growth in the region is now the second fastest outside London. People
are attracted to the area by its relatively high standards of living,
excellent leisure opportunities and an education system which, despite
being one of the lowest funded in the country, continues to achieve
year-on-year improvements under the guidance of the East Riding of
Yorkshire
council.</p><p><a name="06060755000125">Meanwhile,
the two cities of Hull and York remain powerful economic regional
players. Hull is currently one of the largest cities in the country,
with a population approaching 330,000. It hopes to take strides towards
becoming one of the country&#146;s top 10 cities. It is recognised as
an international leader in telecommunications and is an important
gateway to mainland Europe, with a successful port that caters for more
than 1 million passengers a year. The port of Hull on the north side of
the River Humber is a regional priority and has had more than
&#163;94 million-worth of investment in the past 15 years alone. It
is the leading timber port in the country, and it is estimated that up
to 16,000 jobs have been generated in Hull directly from the operation
of the port itself or from the presence of local businesses that have
established themselves in the area because of relatively easy access to
the continent.</p><p><a name="06060755000126">It
would be fair to say that Hull is a sleeping giant. Like many of the
great football teams that languished in the old second division or the
current championship but year after year hoped for life and premiership
performance to come their way, Hull is working to 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 96WH</b><br>make that happen. In fact, this year the people of Hull showed at the
ballot box their preparedness for change. Whoever is in power, it is
hoped that Hull city council will provide fresher and more dynamic
leadership. There are real prospects for future premiership performance
for the city of
Hull.</p><p><a name="06060755000127">That strong
regional performance has been achieved in spite of, not because of, a
regional transport infrastructure that has grown increasingly
inadequate. The cities of Hull and, in particular, York continue to be
let down by the sorry state of local transport links. At present, there
is no direct rail link between Hull and York. Instead, rail passengers
must travel three sides of a triangle via Brough and Selby, which can
take the best part of 90 minutes. The main road linking the two cities,
the A1079, is certainly not fit for purpose. It runs through the urban
centres of Beverley, Market Weighton and Pocklington and is
predominantly rural in nature. It is used by an estimated 15,000-plus
vehicles a day. That number increased by 9 per cent. in just four years
up to 2003. However, only 4.5 km of the road is dual carriageway, with
the remaining 39.5 km single carriageway. As hon. Members can imagine,
journey times can be long indeed, especially in the morning and evening
rush hours.</p><p><a name="06060755000128">We all
recognise the progress that has been made in reducing road casualties
and accidents over the past years, but that road has a dreadful safety
record. According to Government figures, there have been more than 275
accidents in the past five years alone. Sixteen people have lost their
lives, including three people in a single incident in November 2004.
That is undoubtedly an issue of major concern to my constituents. As
one local resident said in a recent local authority consultation
exercise, there is almost no margin for error when driving on the
A1079. Martin Ward, a Market Weighton resident, was involved in two
accidents on the road last year. He recently
stated:</p><a name="06060755000375"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There
are too many junctions without slip-roads that are opposite one
another, which leaves every motivation for people to dash across the
carriageway.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000129">For
motorcyclists such as Mr. Ward, the road is unacceptably
unsafe.</p><p><a name="06060755000130">Put simply,
the road is crying out for a major programme of improvement. The East
Riding of Yorkshire council, which prepared a position statement to
assess congestion levels on the A1079, concluded that the road is
operating</p><a name="06060755000376"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;near to its
theoretical capacity for a single carriageway of its width and
characteristics.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000131">It is
simply not sustainable in the long term to promote significant
migration into a region without taking steps simultaneously to invest
in local infrastructure, especially transport
infrastructure.</p><p><a name="06060755000132">Realistically,
we must start thinking about widening the A1079 to cope with the
growing demand. However, that will not come cheaply. For example, the
published target cost for widening the A453, which is predominantly a
rural road, is &#163;90 million for a 12 km stretch. That is based on
an estimated cost of some &#163;8 million per kilometre. Given that
the A1079 currently has 40 km of single carriageway, widening it
clearly will involve a major investment and almost certainly will
require significant Government assistance.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 97WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000133">The Yorkshire and Humber
regional transport strategy identified the A1079 as an important link
and a main public transport corridor. The analysis deals with the
importance of Hull and the port, but the assessment of local transport
links is focused too much on improving the M62-A63 transport corridor,
which, as Members may be aware, is the main route into Hull from the
west of the city. The strategy goes no further than to acknowledge
that</p><a name="06060755000377"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Access
between Hull and York is also
poor&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000134">which is an
understatement if ever there was
one.</p><p><a name="06060755000135">Moreover, the
Minister may be aware that the Department for Transport de-trunked the
A1079 in 2003 and handed it over to the local authority to maintain.
With growing traffic on that road, it is easy to understand why local
people believe that that was a cop-out. An important regional road that
was already running over capacity was de-trunked and, most
importantly&#151;I shall return to this issue&#151;funding was not
provided to go with that de-trunking. In effect, the Department left
the road to the local authority without offering support. I would be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on that point. If she
cannot offer a guarantee that the Department will review the local
funding arrangement, will she pledge to consider taking the road
back?</p><p><a name="06060755000136">Serious
attention should also be given to the proposed reopening of the Hull to
York railway line. The Hull to Beverley line is still in existence, but
the extension from Beverley to York was axed in 1965 as part of the
Beeching cuts and has never been reopened. Recently, however, there has
been growing political pressure&#151;people pressure, from the ground
up&#151;for its return. A local interest group, the Minsters Rail
Campaign, was set up two years ago to put pressure on local council
leaders and others to consider reopening the line. As a result, East
Riding of Yorkshire council responded in March 2004 by appointing a
consultancy group to carry out a feasibility study. The results were
positive.</p><p><a name="06060755000137">The group
estimated that 2004 passenger figures would total 395,000 journeys per
annum, based on the running of one train an hour; 584,000 journeys per
annum for two trains an hour; and 622,000 journeys per annum for two
trains an hour, with one journey extended to and from Leeds. A point
worth making in that context is that transport in the region,
particularly at the northern end of the A1079, is about not just
reaching York but accessing Leeds and other areas. Any changes and
improvements should recognise that, by providing east Yorkshire with
access to other places and other markets.</p><p><a name="06060755000138">Moreover, basing its analysis
on a series of roadside interview surveys that took place in March
2004, the consultancy group Carl Bro estimated that 15 per cent. of
users of the A1079 would be likely to switch to the train if a decent,
reliable service linking Hull, Beverley and York were provided. That
could result in the removal of large numbers of vehicles a day from the
A1079, which would undoubtedly help to reduce congestion on the road,
meet Government targets on reducing the use of the car, and reduce the
number of accidents from the current unacceptable
level.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 98WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000139">The sticking
point is cost, which was estimated in 2004 to be in the region of
&#163;239 million. That included a &#163;28 million risk allowance
and a 15 per cent. optimism bias allocation&#151;an excellent idea to
put into the funding of any project&#151;as required by the
Department for Transport. Carl Bro considered a number of different
scenarios, including the running of the line as a community rail
project&#151;again, in line with Government thinking&#151;which,
according to that expert transport consultancy, would increase revenues
and reduce costs. As a result, the economic assessment over a 60-year
period shows a benefit-cost ratio of between 1.26 and 2.04, with the
non-revenue benefits boosting the economic situation to provide a
positive net present value in all cases.</p><p><a name="06060755000140">Despite
taking that into account, however, the initial assessment based on
current costs and fares is that the operation would not be financially
self-supporting from fare income alone and would require ongoing
financial support. That is one reason for this debate. It has become
increasingly clear that if East Riding is to sustain current growth and
investment levels and establish a transport infrastructure that will
allow it to compete with other regions, it will require a level of
Government support far higher than it currently receives.</p><p><a name="06060755000141">There is growing evidence of a
systematic lack of investment in integrated transport in the Yorkshire
region as a whole and specifically in East Riding. The <i>Yorkshire
Post</i> recently launched a campaign, &#147;Road to Ruin&#148;,
which aims to highlight the huge discrepancy between regions in funding
for transport. It has pointed out that, for example, Yorkshire receives
just &#163;224.21 a person in transport funding overall, as compared
with the staggering &#163;667 a person handed out to transport
projects in London.</p><p><a name="06060755000142">Like other
Yorkshire MPs, I recognise the special case of London and would not
suggest that the comparison is entirely valid. None the less, the
discrepancy cannot be justified. According to research by the passenger
transport executive group, Yorkshire receives just 7.6 per cent of the
total transport budget for England, while London receives almost 34 per
cent. That is a huge discrepancy, especially when one takes into
account population growth in Yorkshire and the Humber, where nearly 5
million people now reside.</p><p><a name="06060755000143">The unfairness of the current
funding system can be seen more clearly at an even more local level.
Recent data from East Riding of Yorkshire council show that the area
receives just &#163;9.12 a person a year from central Government to
spend on integrated transport. That compares with a regional average of
&#163;14.47 a person and with the &#163;19.13 a person that is
distributed to York. That level of underfunding could have a
devastating impact on local businesses, stop the regeneration of the
area and prevent the effective meeting of Government targets and
aims.</p><p><a name="06060755000144"><b><a name="06060755000434">Mr.
John Grogan (Selby) (Lab):</b> I have listened with interest
to the hon. Gentleman. On regeneration and links between Hull and York,
does he agree that one of the main drivers of that regeneration is the
increasing collaboration between the two universities on projects such
as a joint medical school, but that that is increasingly hampered by
the transport situation that he has
described?</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 99WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000145"><b><a name="06060755000435">Mr.
Stuart:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right and speaks from his
constituency perspective. There are growing connections, but
unfortunately the Hull-York bid for the dental school was not
successful. However, that effort and the way in which the bid was put
together, which was widely praised, was symbolic of growing work
between the universities and the cities. The hon. Gentleman is right to
focus on that work, which forms one of a number of strands that link
the two cities together, involving local communities along the route,
so I am grateful for his
intervention.</p><p><a name="06060755000146">The
level of underfunding could have a devastating impact on local
businesses. Terry Hodgkinson, who was chairman of Yorkshire Forward,
the regional development agency, said
recently:</p><a name="06060755000378"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am
very optimistic that our region&#146;s future is bright, but
ultimately, how well we do will depend on our success in securing these
improvements&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000147">meaning
the infrastructure improvements necessary to deliver. As the new chief
executive of Yorkshire Forward also said recently, it is not regional
development agencies that create wealth, but businesses. The
fundamental role of Government is to create a framework and an
environment that is conducive to entrepreneurialism and success, if we
are to deliver Government aspirations and those of the people whom we
represent.</p><p><a name="06060755000148">To conclude,
East Riding of Yorkshire is the second fastest growing region in the
country outside London. Its economic, social and environmental
performance depends on the strength of its transport infrastructure.
Critical to that is the corridor between Hull and York, but it is
simply not up to scratch. The main road running between the two cities
is running at above its design capacity and has a bad history of
accidents. The old railway line is for the most part still available,
and according to a local consultancy&#151;if Leeds counts as
local&#151;can be reopened and, although requiring some support, be
run at a passenger subsidy well below that needed for many other lines,
while offering a positive cost-benefit ratio that could be supported by
the Government.</p><p><a name="06060755000149">The
region has been systematically underfunded for too long. I urge the
Minister to look into the matter and to come forward with funding to
support the dualling of the A1079 road and the proposed reopening of
the Hull to York rail link, which has the support of a number of MPs in
the region. I am glad to the see the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)
in the Chamber and I have spoken at length to other hon. Members,
including my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr.
Knight), who supports the main arguments that I have put
forward.</p><p><a name="06060755000150">East Riding
has taken great strides forward in recent years, but that development
is at serious risk because of a transport infrastructure that remains
unfit for purpose in this new century. I and other hon. Members from
all parties recognise the pressures on Government funding and, although
I might be optimistic in hoping for a positive response in all respects
to this debate, I hope at least that the Minister will take on board
the arguments. I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the issue
and hope that this debate can play a part in our long-term analysis of
how to deliver improvements for the benefit of constituents and the
country.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 100WH</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000395">11.18
am</h5><p><a name="06060755000151"><b><a name="06060755000436">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Gillian
Merron):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness (Mr. Stuart) on securing this debate, to which I have
listened carefully. I also thank him for his kind remarks welcoming me
to my new post.</p><p><a name="06060755000152">Before
dealing with the specific concerns raised, I shall make some general
but important points to give some context to my response to the hon.
Gentleman. The Government and my Department certainly recognise the
importance of good transport links for economic and social
regeneration, and for improving access to jobs and key services. Better
access to and from urban centres such as Hull and York, whether by bus,
rail or car, is crucial to achieving that.</p><p><a name="06060755000153">The pressures on the transport
system are well known and familiar to us all. We have a legacy of
under-investment that goes back decades, and as our economy has grown
and prospered, that has brought further pressures on all modes of
transport. That is why the Government are committed to sustained
long-term investment in transport and have doubled transport spending
in the past few years.</p><p><a name="06060755000154">Our transport strategy is about
reducing social exclusion, tackling congestion and pollution and
enhancing people&#146;s quality of life by improving all types of
transport in ways that increase choice and as an investment for the
future. In all of this, however, there is a need for realism. We cannot
satisfy every demand for transport infrastructure enhancements, whether
road or rail, as the hon. Gentleman said. Major infrastructure
improvements are expensive, which he acknowledged, and they take time
to deliver. Our job is to prioritise and to be
realistic.</p><p><a name="06060755000155">Partly
because of that experience, we have introduced a much more transparent
system for seeking the regions&#146; views on their transport
investment priorities within regional funding allocations. Regional and
local bodies now have a much clearer picture of the resources that are
likely to be available to their region in the next 10 years, and we
have given them the opportunity to advise the Government on how they
believe those resources should be allocated to best serve the
region&#146;s needs and objectives. That advice, which included the
Beverley integrated transport scheme, was received from the regions at
the end of January, and we plan to respond to it
shortly.</p><p><a name="06060755000156">I
agree with the hon. Gentleman that good local transport is fundamental
to building thriving and prosperous communities. However, I should like
to clarify for him the truth of the financial situation. Since 2000-01,
we have more than doubled the funding to local authorities for
transport in every region, taking it up to more than &#163;1.6
billion in 2006-07. Funding for local transport in the Yorkshire and
Humber region has increased from &#163;75 million to &#163;160
million in 2006-07. The East Riding of Yorkshire alone will benefit
from &#163;11 million for local transport this year&#151;a
significant increase from &#163;2.9 million in
2000-01.</p><p><a name="06060755000157">The
hon. Gentleman raised two specific issues. I shall deal first with the
question of highways investment in his area and, in particular, the
A1079. That road provides 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 101WH</b><br>a regionally significant link between Hull and York and the urban
centres of Beverley, Market Weighton and Pocklington in between. On 1
April 2003, the remaining sections of the A1079 between Kexby Bridge
and Barmston drain were detrunked, and the responsibility for
maintenance was taken over by East Riding of Yorkshire council. The
full route, between the York city boundary and the Hull city boundary,
is some 44 km in length and is now part of the authority&#146;s
primary route
network.</p><p><a name="06060755000158">I
advise the hon. Gentleman that, contrary to his suggestion, the local
authority wished to take on that responsibility. I can assure him and
his constituents that, as part of the detrunking agreement, the
Highways Agency made a settlement of more than &#163;500,000 per year
to East Riding of Yorkshire council to fund works that otherwise would
have been undertaken by the agency. In addition, since detrunking, more
than &#163;4m has been provided for carriageway maintenance and
&#163;1m for bridge maintenance on the A1079 in recognition of its
status as an important corridor on the primary route
network.</p><p><a name="06060755000159"><b><a name="06060755000437">Mr.
Graham Stuart:</b> Obviously, all funding that has been
provided is welcome, but does the Minister accept that the funding is
still inadequate and that the number of fatalities that have occurred
on the road&#151;16 in five years&#151;is not good enough on a road
such as that? As she says, East Riding of Yorkshire council is happy to
look after the road, but only if it is provided with sufficient funds,
and the council&#146;s opinion is that the funding is not sufficient
to provide the quality of road and the safety standards that both the
council and the Government
want.</p><p><a name="06060755000160"><b><a name="06060755000438">Gillian
Merron:</b> In its second local transport plan, East Riding of
Yorkshire council has considered further dualling of the A1079 north of
Hull to address the safety issues that arise, particularly when drivers
are overtaking. It is exploring the prospects of dualling schemes for
the highway between Killingwoldgraves roundabout and Dunswell and
between Shiptonthorpe and Pocklington. My Department will consider
those ideas if and when firm proposals are made and they receive
regional support through the regional funding allocations
process.</p><p><a name="06060755000161">Without a
doubt, safety on the A1079 is a major concern. I am pleased to say that
the Humberside safety camera partnership is installing six safety
cameras on Market Weighton&#146;s Arras hill. A further seven cameras
will be installed on Beverley bypass by the end of this month. Judging
by the record of the Humberside safety camera partnership so far, that
should, I would hope, halve the number of accidents and save the pain
and misery suffered by many families each
year.</p><p><a name="06060755000162">In
view of the time, I shall now discuss the York to Beverley railway
line. Before its closure, the line served a number of settlements, and
in recent years there has been interest in reopening the line. The most
recent local transport plan refers to the potential for reopening,
bearing in mind the need for careful evaluation and the realities of
funding constraints. I am aware of a study commissioned by the
Countryside Agency and published in 2003, which examined the
possibility of reopening 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 102WH</b><br>disused railway lines in Yorkshire and the Humber. The study identified
a number of potential benefits of reopening the line in question, but
it also highlighted several major obstacles in the form of development
across the track bed. It suggested that those might be dealt with
through new alignments, but it also noted that at Stamford Bridge and
Market Weighton, creating new alignments would be more difficult due to
the level of development that has occurred. The study concluded that
although the York to Beverley line should be considered for reopening
in the longer term&#151;10 years or more into the future&#151;it
should be protected from further development in the
meantime.</p><p><a name="06060755000163">As the hon.
Gentleman said, a further study was undertaken by the consultants at
Carl Bro for East Riding of Yorkshire council, and I was pleased to
have the opportunity to consider it. As he also said, it reported that
the operation would not be financially self-supporting from fare income
and would require ongoing public
subsidy.</p><p><a name="06060755000164">The decision
to protect a section of railway is a matter for local planning
authorities, in line with national, regional and local planning
policies. I would expect such decisions to be based on discussion with
relevant stakeholders, including Network Rail, and consideration of the
costs involved.</p><p><a name="06060755000165">It is
important to note that, although the railways are growing faster than
ever and we have not closed our mind to the expansion of rail, the
Government&#146;s investment priorities must be driven by an
objective assessment of where the greatest benefit, economic and
environmental, is to be delivered. Generally, that follows strong
patterns of established
demand.</p><p><a name="06060755000166">For
that reason and because of the poor historical performance of a range
of branch lines and experimental services, it would be unfair of me to
suggest that consideration of the proposal outlined by the hon.
Gentleman is likely to be a realistic priority for the Government in
the immediate future. Of course, it is always open to local planning
authorities to produce their own proposals on the basis of their own
committed funding, but such a proposal must also be subject to rigorous
scrutiny, starting with consideration of whether it offers the most
effective transport option. The production of a business case involves
a considerable investment of time and resources, and any authority
would consider carefully its own priorities in the context of local,
regional and national plans, just as central Government
do.</p><p><a name="06060755000167">This
year, the Government are spending &#163;110 million every week to
improve the railways. That commitment to our rail network is helping to
bring in further substantial investment from the private sector. In
addition, there have been significant improvements in the railways in
recent years, which have led a considerable increasein the
number of rail passenger journeys. For example, in 2003-04, for the
first time since 1961, more than1 billion rail journeys were
made. Importantly, the Government recently announced &#163;370
million to deliver access improvements to stations across the network
in line with the new provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act
1995.</p><p><a name="06060755000168">I confirm that
we are working to improve transport connectivity in east Yorkshire as a
whole. The local transport plan system has provided more certainty
of 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 103WH</b><br>funding for local authorities, so that they can tackle local issues. We
are making progress on improving transport and we are committed to
continuing to do
so.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000396">11.30

point out that the debate is very well attended. Six hon. Members have
already indicated that they want to catch my eye, and there are also

brief.</p><p><a name="06060755000171"><b><a name="06060755000440">Mr.
Iain Wright (Hartlepool) (Lab):</b> I thankMr.
Speaker and your good self, Mr. Cook, my parliamentary neighbour, for
giving me the opportunity to discuss the vital issue of the middle east
peace process. This is a crucial time, and 2006 could well be seen as a
key year in the peace process. Of course, every year could be seen as
key, given the frustrating nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and the wider middle east peace process. I could, for example, mention
1993, when the Oslo accords were signed, 2000, when the Camp David
summit was held and the second intifada started, or 2003, when the
international Quartet&#146;s road map was published, Prime Minister
Sharon commented that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories
must end and the Israeli disengagement policy was unveiled. However,
2006 seems to be emerging as a landmark year in the peace process, with
the removal of Sharon from active Israeli politics on 4 January, the
Palestinian elections, which brought Hamas into government, and the
Israeli elections in March. I shall first discuss those two hugely
significant elections&#151;one in Israel and one in
Palestine&#151;and then, if possible, widen the scope of the debate
to encompass the security barrier and the behaviour of Iran.</p><p><a name="06060755000172">The middle east peace process
remains full of problems, paradoxes and controversies. Last week, I was
privileged to introduce Ambassador Dennis Ross at a meeting of the
Labour Friends of Israel, which I chair. As right hon. and hon. Members
will know, Ambassador Ross is a distinguished expert on the middle
east, who played a leading role in the first Bush Administration and
the Clinton Administration and who has dealt directly with Israel and
the Palestinians. At last week&#146;s meeting, he stated:</p><a name="06060755000379"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;today we are not in the
peacemaking
business&#148;.</p></ul><a name="06060755000380"><ul><p class="tabletext">Instead, there
is a pressing need to control and improve the situation on the
ground.</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000173">The
Israeli elections in March saw the formation of a new coalition, led by
Kadima, with the Israeli Labour party as senior partner. I congratulate
the Labour party leader, Amir Peretz, on that success. I met Labour
Members of the Knesset when I led an LFI delegation to Israel and
Palestine in February and I was impressed by the party&#146;s
domestic social agenda, which had a familiar ring. The party was even
using footage from the British Labour party&#146;s 1997 and 2001
election broadcasts to promote their key policy&#151;a minimum wage.
That is incredibly encouraging. The success of the Labour party in
March demonstrates a willingness among Israelis to debate what sort of
society they want theirs to be, and it is clear that that society will
be more socially inclusive and embrace a greater redistribution of
wealth.</p><a name="06060755000381"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Israeli
Labour party is also progressive and innovative on security matters. It
is committed to a two-state solution and a negotiated final status
settlement. It has emphasised the importance 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 105WH</b><br>of sustaining talks with President Abbas&#146;s office and is
determined to heighten his status. The appointment of Mr. Peretz as
Minister of Defence is also a positive development, and I hope that the
Labour party&#146;s leading role in the coalition will see a greater
push towards negotiation. In his own words, Peretz is committed to
a</p></ul><a name="06060755000382"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;policy to continue
waging war on terrorists while trying to ease restrictions on the
Palestinian
people&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000383">wherever
possible.</p><p><a name="06060755000174">There is much
to support elsewhere in the coalition. The new Israeli Prime Minister,
Ehud Olmert, will visit the Palace of Westminster next week for an open
meeting with Members of this House and the other place. At that
meeting, I hope that he will explain how he will implement the clear
mandate that the Israeli people gave him in the March elections to
continue withdrawals from the west bank. What is known as the
convergence plan involves withdrawing from all settlements east of the
fence, dismantling illegal outposts and potentially resettling 70,000
settlers from the west bank. The policy, which is still in its
formative stages, would establish provisional borders in accordance
with the road map and would not deviate wildly from the map drawn up
under the Geneva accords.</p><p><a name="06060755000175">Right hon. and hon. Members
would be right to have reservations. Obviously, a unilateral plan is
far from ideal, and we should continue to strive for negotiation, but
we are where we are, and in the absence of a partnership for peace,
unilateralism remains the only option. If we are to keep the peace
process moving, we should recognise that fact and reluctantly and
cautiously welcome that unilateralism. Concessions on the Israeli side
could, I hope, catalyse similar developments on the Palestinian side to
produce a state of what some commentators have called, perhaps
oxymoronically, parallel unilateralism.</p><p><a name="06060755000176">That brings me to the
Palestinians and specifically Hamas. On the one hand, the fact that
there were free and fair elections in January&#151;an event matched
in the region only in Israel&#151;is to be welcomed and is a cause
for optimism. On the other hand, the fact that Hamas was the victor is
a setback. Clearly, the Palestinian Authority, whatever its political
complexion, needs to address severe domestic challenges, such as severe
economic hardship, the need for social, education and health care
improvements and the need to tackle corruption. When I was in Palestine
in February, it was evident that it would take time for Fatah really to
come to terms with the fact that Hamas was simply better organised
politically on the ground, with a shrewd and sophisticated awareness of
the simple need to get out the vote. There are domestic challenges, but
perhaps parallel unilateralism will allow progress to be
made.</p><p><a name="06060755000177">However, the
election of Hamas remains extremely worrying. The organisation
unequivocally calls for the destruction of the state of Israel, which
is simply unacceptable in a governing
party.</p><p><a name="06060755000178"><b><a name="06060755000441">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I congratulate the
hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate and on his speech so
far. Are not the Israelis absolutely right to concentrate on doing
their best to support President Mahmoud Abbas and ensure that his view,
even if he takes it directly to the people through a further
referendum, prevails over that of Hamas, which, as the hon. Gentleman
rightly says, cannot be part of the solution to this difficult
situation?</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 106WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000179"><b><a name="06060755000442">Mr.

has had Adjournment debates in Westminster Hall about this very issue
and has spoken eloquently and decisively about it. I shall talk about
the referendum in a moment.</p><p><a name="06060755000180">The
international community, which provides &#163;1 billion a year in
funding to the Palestinian Authority, has asked Hamas to meet three
basic conditions for the funding to continue, and I know from reading
the report of one of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Adjournment debates
that he mentioned this very issue. The three conditions are that Hamas
should recognise Israel, renounce terror and respect existing
international agreements. In the past 24 hours, President Abbas has
extended by a number of days the time that he has given Hamas to accept
his offer implicitly to recognise Israel, which is part of the 18-point
prisoners&#146; document.</p><p><a name="06060755000181"><b><a name="06060755000443">Richard

but Hamas has yet to make any moves towards meeting
them.</p><p><a name="06060755000184"><b><a name="06060755000445">Mr.
James Clappison (Hertsmere) (Con):</b> I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for giving way, because time is short. Would it not
represent some progress if Hamas recognised the right of Israel to
exist at all, given that its charter calls explicitly for
Israel&#146;s
destruction?</p><p><a name="06060755000185"><b><a name="06060755000446">Mr.
Wright:</b> I agree absolutely. As I said, time is running
out, not only in this debate, but on that wider, more fundamental
point.</p><p><a name="06060755000186">When a
suicide bomber attacked the busy streets of Tel Aviv over the Passover
holidays in April, killing nine people and injuring nearly 100 others,
Hamas leaders condoned the attack. What could possibly be gained from
that? However, I am struck by the recent comments by Rashid abu Shabak,
a Fatah leader whom President Abbas appointed in April
2006&#151;against Hamas&#146;s wishes&#151;to the post of
security director for the West Bank and Gaza. He
said:</p><a name="06060755000384"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Hamas is
acting as if it is isolated on the moon and can keep two identities,
government and opposition. Hamas jumped overnight from being the group
that attacked Israel to the government that has to arrest people who do
that.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000187">In the meantime,
the Palestinian people have the most to lose. Regimes that are
committed to religious fundamentalism have dangerous consequences for
the populations over which they rule&#151;not least for women,
minorities and political activists.</p><p><a name="06060755000188">Furthermore, there has been the
danger that the necessary sanctions may lead to an economic crisis. The
international donor community has had to tackle a serious dilemma
because of the need to continue to provide aid and assistance to
ordinary, decent and innocent Palestinians while bypassing, at the
moment, the Palestinian Authority.</p><p><a name="06060755000189">A way has
been found to do that. On 9 May the international Quartet agreed on a
new funding mechanism to be administered by the EU, whereby money can
go directly to humanitarian causes such as schools and hospitals.
Individual state donors have also increased 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 107WH</b><br>their humanitarian budgets. That includes the UK, led by my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for International Development, whose
Department has pledged an extra &#163;15 million to the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for humanitarian funding.</p><p><a name="06060755000190">I
draw right hon. and hon. Members&#146; attention to the document
&#147;Aiding Peace&#148; produced by Labour Friends of Israel,
which was submitted to the Treasury as part of the consultation on the
economic aspects of the peace process, led by my right hon. Friend the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary
to the Treasury. It details other crucial elements needed for peace,
including political stability; improving access to markets and
supplies; stimulating employment and building up the Palestinian
private sector; and establishing microfinance for Palestinian small and
medium-sized enterprises, thereby strengthening the business
environment and improving economic competitiveness.</p><p><a name="06060755000191">Arguments
persist that economic improvement cannot be addressed until Israeli
security restrictions are addressed too. I urge understanding, however,
that such restrictions are a consequence of the conflict. At last
week&#146;s meeting, Ambassador Ross made the point that Israel daily
faces about 60 security threats; I shall return to that point shortly.
The reason why there are so few suicide bombings is that the Israeli
defence force pre-empts many of them. I hope that the reduction in
Israeli security restrictions and an increase in Palestinian economic
activity and prosperity can, with the right leadership, occur in
tandem.</p><p><a name="06060755000192">The
debate on security must now take in Hamas as well. It may have come to
power by democratic means but it has not embraced the democratic
tradition and responsibilities of a democracy. Hamas has allowed the
streets of Gaza, which was fully evacuated by Israel last year, to be
controlled by militant factions engaged in running battles. Members of
the Palestinian press reporting on those clashes have received death
threats from Hamas because of their critical reporting of the
Government and their sympathies with Mahmoud Abbas&#146;s office.
Meanwhile, rocket attacks from Gaza on civilian targets in small
Israeli towns have continued. Those attacks are crude and relatively
inaccurate and therefore, thankfully, unsuccessful, but crucially they
add to the Israeli sense of insecurity, especially because of the fear
that a hit on the Ashkelon industrial zone, with its fuel and chemical
depots and power station, would cause a major disaster. The attacks
have provoked retaliation from Israel and the re-spinning of the cycle
of violence.</p><p><a name="06060755000193">I believe
that those daily rocket attacks by Palestinian militants are the
biggest short-term obstacle to peace. The Israelis fear that if the
attacks cannot be stopped in Gaza, from which they have withdrawn, they
will spread to the west bank, from where every major town and
population centre in Israel will be a
target.</p><p><a name="06060755000194"><b><a name="06060755000447">Mr.
David Burrowes (Enfield, Southgate) (Con):</b>
Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern about
something that is one of my abiding memories of Israel, from a visit
earlier in the year with the Conservative Friends of Israel&#151;a
Hezbollah terrorist guarding the border of south Lebanon and presenting
the organisation as the legitimate authority in Lebanon? Is that not an

<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 108WH</b><br>example of a dangerous precedent: a terrorist organisation seeking
legitimacy as a political party when it is responsible for the murders
of innocent
citizens?</p><p><a name="06060755000195"><b><a name="06060755000448">Mr.
Wright:</b> I agree with those points, and although the hon.
Gentleman and I did not go on the same visit, we probably stood in the
same place and witnessed the same sort of thing.</p><p><a name="06060755000196">Against the background that I
have been describing, the new coalition Government in Israel face big,
but not insurmountable, challenges as they build their governing
momentum following the election. Perhaps the most immediate challenges
are domestic security and the barrier, which I shall discuss next, and
the wider context of regional security and the threat from Iran, which
I hope to mention later.</p><p><a name="06060755000197">The security
barrier is an unfortunate but sadly necessary consequence of the
conflict. Its route and the impact that it has on Palestinians are
contentious and the Israelis are conscious of that, but please let us
remember why it is there. A few years ago, no one in Israel wanted it.
The left opposed it on humanitarian and political grounds. The right
opposed it on ideological grounds, fearing, as the Palestinians do,
that it represented a border in contrast to their territorial dreams.
For many, the financial cost also seemed prohibitive. Then in March
2002, in a single month, there were 37 suicide bomb attacks, claiming
135 lives. The frame of the argument changed dramatically, and changed
again when the barrier proved so effective and suicide bombings dropped
down the graphs. There has been a 90 per cent. reduction in attacks by
terrorists and a 70 per cent. decrease in the number of Israelis killed
per year.</p><p><a name="06060755000198">I am not
going to say that the barrier is welcome. I have seen it myself and
have experienced in a very minor manner some of the discomfort and
frustration of waiting for hours trying to cross the security barrier.
I had to endure it only for an afternoon, so I fully sympathise with
those people who have to endure that situation for hours,
daily&#151;twice a day&#151;to go to work, take goods to market or
see their families. I have seen at first hand the disruption that it
causes to people&#146;s lives.
</p><p><a name="06060755000199">One cannot dismiss
fears about the barrier&#146;s status. The international community
needs to understand its physical and psychological importance. I
mentioned earlier that the Israeli defence force is pre-empting many
attempted suicide attacks. The primary reason for that success is the
barrier. It slows attackers down, aids their detection and deters their
attempts.</p><p><a name="06060755000200"><b><a name="06060755000449">Roger
Berry (Kingswood) (Lab):</b> The location of the barrier,
which seemed to me during an Inter-Parliamentary Union visit in
November to be more like a very large wall, is the contentious point.
Why must it be drawn so as to confiscate so much Palestinian
land?</p><p><a name="06060755000201"><b><a name="06060755000450">Mr.
Wright:</b> It would be wrong to say that no consideration has
been given to Palestinian territorial claims or human rights.
Israel&#146;s Supreme Court, for example, which is open to Israelis
and Palestinians alike, has taken a major role in determining the route
of the barrier. Israeli judges made a landmark ruling in
2004&#151;this is, I think, the crucial point in response to my hon.
Friend&#151;that the fence is legal only if the courts determine it
to be proportionate in balancing Israel&#146;s responsibility to keep
its people safe with its 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 109WH</b><br>responsibility to safeguard the rights of Palestinians. In Jerusalem,
which is, I accept, where the barrier is at its most controversial,
construction is on hold in many areas, pending further rulings from the

David Anderson (Blaydon) (Lab):</b> Does my hon. Friend agree
that both the Labour party and the trade union movement in Israel have
taken the clear view that, for reasons of security, the wall should
stay, albeit that they want it within pre-1967
borders?</p><p><a name="06060755000203"><b><a name="06060755000452">Mr.
Wright:</b> My hon. Friend and I went on the same visit and
saw together, at first hand, the wall and its ugliness&#151;in all
senses of the word, but we also saw how it provides security and
reassurance to Israelis. I certainly accept my hon. Friend&#146;s
point.</p><p><a name="06060755000204">In effect, the
Israeli courts have had a veto over the route of the fence, and as a
result, since February 2005, the proposed route has run for much of its
length along the 1967 border, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and is much
closer to that line than it previously was in other areas. Where the
fence deviates from the green line its aim is as a tactical restriction
to fulfil the aims of hindrance, detection and deterrence.</p><p><a name="06060755000205">Let me be
blunt. In the end, armies can be negotiated to armistice and walls and
fences can be negotiated back or down. The victims of terrorism cannot
be negotiated back to life. It is the success of the barrier and its
halting of the cycle of violence that created the political space for
the Gaza withdrawal to take place and, from that, for the concept of
territorial concessions to become the consensus approach to the peace
process.</p><p><a name="06060755000206">The
checkpoints and road blocks around the west bank have made it extremely
difficult for Palestinians to travel in and around towns in the west
bank&#151;a reality that has, as I have said, had a detrimental
affect on their trade and business. Israel continues to assess its road
blocks policy but has found it hard to reduce restrictions when armed
Palestinians are stopped on a regular basis and terrorist networks
continue to operate. Similarly, Palestinians have found the Gaza-Israel
border crossing at Karni closed for, so far, nearly half of 2006, which
means that they have lost millions of dollars in wasted agricultural
exports that were unable to leave Gaza. Peretz has promised to try to
seek a solution to keep that area open more frequently, but there is
apprehension from the security forces, which continue to thwart
potential terrorist attacks from militants who hope to use the area to
gain access to Israel.</p><p><a name="06060755000207">I stress that
Israel needs to ensure that all its security measures are proportionate
and in accordance with the rights of ordinary, decent and innocent
Palestinians. We should continue to press for that, but that pressure
will be more effective if there is greater acknowledgement of the
concerns of both sides, of the dilemmas Israel faces, and of the
effectiveness of constructive, contextual, case-by-case criticism
rather than the sometimes hysterical and uniquely disproportionate
commentary that the conflict often receives.</p><p><a name="06060755000208">Practical work can also be
done. The deal agreed in November 2005 on the Rafah border between the
Gaza strip and Egypt is an example of how the international community
can make a difference not only in wide and impersonal regional politics
but in humanitarian issues.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 110WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000209"><b><a name="06060755000453">Barbara
Keeley (Worsley) (Lab):</b> I would like briefly to draw
attention to the relaunch on 3 May 2006 of the international
women&#146;s commission for a just and sustainable peace between
Israel and Palestine, which is welcomed by many. I understand that
women have been meeting across the political divide for many years,
even when there was no discussion and debate elsewhere and talks had
completely stalled. All women Members of this House, particularly the
new ones, hope to work with women elected to both the Knesset and the
Palestinian Authority to support them as they move forward with the
commission.</p><p><a name="06060755000210"><b><a name="06060755000454">Mr.
Wright:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. She
is far too modest to tell the Chamber that she plays a leading role in
this House in creating awareness and co-operation between women MPs
here and those in Israel and Palestine. I pay tribute to her in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06060755000211">The
international community has a role to play. It is hugely important that
the situation is not allowed to stagnate into entrenched positions. The
newly formed Israeli Government plan further withdrawals to ensure that
that does not happen. The UK Government should support that initiative
and ensure that the plan is executed in consultation with Mahmoud Abbas
who remains in control of Palestinian security policy.</p><p><a name="06060755000212">The
international community must remain engaged in the conflict. The role
of honest broker remains crucial. The UK has embraced that role in the
past and must do so again. The London meetings on Palestinian reform in
March 2005 were forward-thinking and totally opened the debate into
Palestinian self-governance, security and economic policy. The UK also
enjoys a fruitful relationship with Israel. As I said, the Israeli
Prime Minister will be in London next week, when he will meet my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister. No doubt they will engage in an open
and productive dialogue.</p><p><a name="06060755000213">The UK Government have firmly
shown their commitment to the road map and the peace process, but when
considering the middle east peace process, we must be careful not to
look at the conflict only through the narrow prism of Israel and
Palestine. The dispute is being played out on a regional and
international stage. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is
largely determined by the actions of neighbouring countries. Finally,
and perhaps most ominously, I move to the issue of Iran.</p><p><a name="06060755000214">Iran&#146;s contribution to
the conflict comes in the form of state-sponsored terror, existential
threats against Israel, holocaust denial, rhetorical incitement and
nuclear proliferation.</p><p><a name="06060755000215"><b><a name="06060755000455">Jeremy
Corbyn (Islington, North) (Lab):</b> Will my hon. Friend

and that it has nuclear weapons and a delivery system with which to use
them?</p><p><a name="06060755000216"><b><a name="06060755000456">Mr.

advances the argument, but I can confirm those
facts.</p><p><a name="06060755000217">The regimes in
Iran and Syria continue to support, fund and train terrorist
organisations that operate in the middle east and threaten regional
security. Groups 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 111WH</b><br>supported, bankrolled, armed and, in some cases, even controlled by Iran
and Syria include Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas.
State-sponsored terrorism undermines prospects for peace in the middle
east peace process, the UK's commitment to regional reform and
threatens the UK directly where there are troops stationed in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Hezbollah, which the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate(Mr. Burrowes) mentioned, receives most of its
funding from Iran. It continues to threaten Israel&#146;s security
along its northern border, and only last week it launched attacks
against Israel.</p><p><a name="06060755000218">Iran&#146;s rhetorical
attacks against Israel together with its attempted procurement of
nuclear weapons pose an existential threat to Israel. There have been
calls from right hon. and hon. Members for a nuclear-free middle east,
but there have also been calls for a middle east stabilised by nuclear
deterrence. I suggest that neither is possible when the president of
one nation is unrelenting in his call for another to be wiped off the
face of the map.</p><p><a name="06060755000219">Once
again, the UK has led the international community with patience and
innovation, led first by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House,
and lately by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign
and Commonwealth Affairs. The latter carries with her, in her first few
weeks in the job, the support, wishes and hopes of this House and all
hon. Members&#146; constituents in her current endeavours with our
European and international partners.</p><p><a name="06060755000220">Over the years, we have all
seen the ebb and flow of progression and setback which has
characterised conflict in the middle east. With each progression, it is
easy to become over-optimistic, and with each setback, it is all too
easy to slide back into pessimism. I have tried to demonstrate to right
hon. and hon. Members that whatever stage we may find ourselves at in
that cycle&#151;as I said at the start, 2006 is a key year in this
process&#151;the overall trend is and always should be towards
democratic negotiation, resolution and
peace.</p><p><a name="06060755000221"><b><a name="06060755000457">Frank

Malcolm Rifkind (Kensington and Chelsea) (Con):</b> I begin by
congratulating the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) on securing
the debate. The sheer attendance illustrates the importance of this
issue.</p><p><a name="06060755000223">It is easy for
people here and in the middle east to get depressed about the situation
given that the state of Israel has existed for 60 years and it has been
90 years since the Balfour decoration. It is almost like a
new100 years&#146; war that never comes to an end. However,
when one looks beyond those bald statistics, one sees that there has
been enormous change in that period: the Israel-Egypt peace treaty,
which has held; an 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 112WH</b><br>exchange of ambassadors and a peaceful relationship; the Jordan-Israel
peace treaty, which is an equally important treaty with Israel&#146;s
second neighbour; and, most significantly, both Israel and the
Palestinians have accepted that there should be a two-state solution.
That would have been inconceivable for the Palestinians and many
Israelis until relatively
recently.</p><p><a name="06060755000224">What
made those things possible? One should not underestimate the
significance of national leaders. It is rather like the situation in
South Africa with the end of apartheid: it needed not only Mandela, but
de Clerk&#151;two leaders from each community who were able to look
to the future, not just the past. In relation to the middle east,
considerations such as Anwar Sadat&#146;s flight to Israel to address
the Knesset, King Hussein&#146;s courage with the Jordan treaty, and
Yitzhak Rabin becoming a peacemaker having been a warrior all show what
can be achieved. The challenge is whether Olmert and Abbas can both
come up to those important standards.</p><p><a name="06060755000225">Clearly, a
negotiated solution is the best way forward. I almost hope that Hamas
will reject what has been put to it so that a referendum can go ahead.
I can think of nothing more important and significant than a referendum
of the Palestinian people endorsing Abbas&#146;s call for a two-state
solution, so that thereafter discussions and negotiations could take
place with that clearly being the will of the Palestinian people, and
Hamas being clearly sidelined on that issue at least. If that turns out
not to be possible, for whatever reason, we should not reject out of
hand the Israeli commitment to a unilateral approach, because it
reflects two fundamental changes that have taken place in Israeli
thinking among those who are traditionally on the hard-line right of
Israeli politics.</p><p><a name="06060755000226">The
first change is the recognition that, giventhe demographic
changes taking place, Israel as a democratic society simply cannot hold
on permanently to the whole of the west bank and Gaza. In a sense, the
Israelis have concluded that in future the state of Israel will not be
the same as the land of Israel. The land of Israel may be a biblical
concept, but the state of Israel will have to have more modest
aspirations.</p><p><a name="06060755000227">The
second change in Israeli thinking is strategically very important. For
many years Israel said, and reminded anyone who went there,
&#147;Security requires us to occupy the west bank. Look how small
Israel is; look how quickly we could be overcome if a conflict broke
out&#148;, but the reality is that it no longer has any fear from
conventional Arab armies. Egypt and Jordan are at peace with Israel and
there is no Arab state that could conventionally defeat it, and the
Israelis are comfortable with
that.</p><p><a name="06060755000228">Israel
faces two kinds of threat. The demographic threat if it holds on to the
whole of the west bank and ceases to lose its Jewish identity, and,
perhaps more important, a missile threat. Whether nuclear or otherwise,
missiles can attack Israel, which is not protected from that simply by
holding on to the west bank. For that reason, even those on the right
of Israeli politics are now prepared to contemplate a unilateral
withdrawal from the west bank, should it prove necessary. That offers a
major new opportunity for a peaceful solution to the crisis, which we
have not had in the past.</p><p><a name="06060755000229">Given the
time limit, I shall just make some brief points. I hope that the
Israelis will take them on board should the negotiations go forward, or
should they not 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 113WH</b><br>and a unilateral solution is required. The first is that they should not
feel too guilty about the wall or fence. It is not aimed at keeping
people in, like the Berlin wall was; it is to keep terrorists out. That
is a pretty fundamental distinction. However, as part of any ultimate
agreement, unilateral or otherwise, the fence will have to go, because
the economic future of the region requires close economic co-operation
between Palestine, Israel and Jordan. Such co-operation is not possible
with the long-term existence of the wall.</p><p><a name="06060755000230">Secondly, the
1967 boundaries cannot be an absolute determinant of where the new
frontier will lie. If the Israelis want, for understandable reasons, to
hold on to some settlement areas, they must be willing to contemplate
exchanges of territory, so that the overall Palestinian territory is
not seriously diminished as a consequence.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0142.htm"/>


<p><a name="06060755000231">Thirdly, nobody in their right
mind wants a new barrier through the middle of Jerusalem. There are
solutions to this. The Vatican-type status in Rome does not detract
from the sovereignty or security of Italy any more than recognition of
the holy places in east Jerusalem as non-Israeli territory would in any
way damage any fundamental interest.</p><p><a name="06060755000232">Fourthly, the
right of return is very important from the point of view of Hamas and
some Palestinians. The Israelis cannot be expected to concede that, but
they can be expected, perhaps with American help, to offer generous
financial compensation as part of an overall package. The current plans
of the Israeli Government appear to envisage holding on not just to
settlement areas, but to a whole section of the Jordan valley. I do not
see any military need from them to do so. I believe, and hope, that
that is simply a negotiating ploy so that they will have something
extra to concede as part of an overall peaceful solution. They cannot
expect to hold on to the Jordan valley; it has to be part of a
Palestinian state, although a demilitarised valley should clearly meet
Israeli requirements.</p><p><a name="06060755000233">Given the time pressures, I
should just like to make one final point. Although Israel and Palestine
can be a source of deep worry and depression, we should never lose
sight of the fact that there is a fundamental difference between the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute, despite the length of time that it has
existed, and other disputes, such as those over Kashmir and Cyprus or
the Tamil problem. The difference is that we already know what the
final structure will be: the Israelis and Palestinians will each end up
having their own state. Therefore, the problem is not what kind of
ultimate structure there will be; it is exactly how we get there and
what the details should be. That is different from any of the other
problems that bedevil the world as a whole, and it is a source of hope
and confidence rather than one of worry and
depression.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000399">3.3

Burden (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</b> I shall be as brief
as possible. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool
(Mr. Wright) on securing the debate and the right hon. and learned
Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) on his
contribution.</p><p><a name="06060755000235">Although I am sure there will
be differences of opinion on the substantive issues involved,
today&#146;s attendance indicates something. This has been one of 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 114WH</b><br>several Westminster Hall debates on this subject in recent months, but
we have not had one on the Floor of the House for as long as I can
remember. It is time that such a debate was held. I think that we all
agree that it should take place.</p><p><a name="06060755000236">My hon. Friend mentioned that
we need to examine the situation on the ground and keep it in mind. He
is right about that. Although this is an area where statistics hit us
from all angles, we must understand, at this stage more than at perhaps
any other time, the grinding poverty that is affecting the
Palestinians. We are talking about unemployment levels of 31 per cent.;
in Gaza the figure is 40 per cent. Poverty levels are rising. Food
insecurity has risen by 14 per cent. in the past 10 months, and the
United Nations is predicting that it could reach 51 per cent. this
month.</p><p><a name="06060755000237">Access for
Palestinians in the occupied territories has got worse in the past 12
months. Three ambulances were attacked by Israeli troops in the last
week in May. There were 376 road blocks and checkpoints prior to
disengagement from Gaza in September and there were 515 by mid May this
year. Karni, which is a lifeline of goods going in and out of Gaza, has
been closed for44 per cent. of the time since the start of
2006.</p><p><a name="06060755000238">I give those
statistics not only because they are part of the reality on the ground
that we need to bear in mind, but to say to my right hon. Friend the
Minister that, while I understand and have a good deal of sympathy with
the international community&#146;s demands on Hamas, it is not a
simple thing to say, &#147;Cut off assistance from the Palestinian
Authority and somehow you can protect the Palestinians anyway.&#148;
The Palestinian Authority runs 75 per cent. of all schools, and 62 per
cent. of primary health care clinics are run by the Ministry of Health.
We are talking about hitting essential operations: water, maintenance
of refuse services, sewage collection, and so on. When the Minister
sums up this debate, will he say how the alternative mechanisms that
will somehow get assistance through to the Palestinians, while
bypassing the Palestinian Authority, will work? The statistics that I
cited are not from February or March; they are published in a United
Nations report from the end of May, after the Quartet&#146;s
announcement of the alternative
mechanisms.</p><p><a name="06060755000239">This
week, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian President, engaged in a brave
proposal. I believe that Hamas should recognise Israel. I do not say
that Hamas should accept the two-state solution, because one thing that
my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool should understand is that, to
all intents and purposes, it has already done so. There are legion
comments from its spokespeople&#151;most recently, the BBC reported
one such comment yesterday by the parliamentary speaker&#151;saying
that Hamas accepts the two-state solution. Recognition is a different
issue, and it has some way to go on
that.</p><p><a name="06060755000240">If
we are to ask Hamas to recognise Israel, the point that I made to my
hon. Friend about which borders was not one simply of academic
significance. It is of real significance. People are living under
occupation. If at this stage there are no guarantees about what their
state will be and what the Israelis will recognise, what are we asking
them to recognise? The deal might be to recognise the 1967 borders,
although there needs to be negotiation about whether that ends up to be
the final settlement. Let us accept that international law is the
kernel of a settlement. Such a deal would mean that Israel withdraws 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 115WH</b><br>from land it occupies and it means that the Palestinians accept the
internationally recognised borders of Israel based on the 1967 borders.
That would be something real, but it is not the situation that we are
in.</p><p><a name="06060755000241">This
issue is of more than academic significance, because if we are to say
vote for recognition to Palestinians, who are suffering the poverty
that I was describing, we must be as clear as possible that when the
referendum or whatever is used comes, they will vote for that. They
should not see, one more time, the international community adopting one
set of standards for them and another set for the Israelis. If they
were to get that impression, given that they are faced with that
grinding poverty, we will probably be heading not for an acceptance of
the two-state solution but for greater conflict, with all the tragedies
that that will mean for Palestinians and
Israelis.</p><p><a name="06060755000242">I
ask the Minister again to clarify whether, when he is asking the
Palestinians to recognise Israel, he is saying that they should
recognise Israel within its internationally recognised 1967 borders or
within somewhere else? If he is saying the former, does he accept that
it is only reasonable also to say to Israel that it should recognise a
state of Palestine on those 1967 borders? For good measure, if we are
asking the Palestinians to have a referendum, perhaps there could be
one in Israel as well.</p><p><a name="06060755000243">Will the
Minister clarify a couple of other things? The first is about the
dividing up of the west bank. It is being split into different
&#147;Bantustans&#148;&#151;to use a term that some
employ&#151;which are segregated from each other, with no proper
transport continuity let alone territorial continuity. That is a real
barrier to a settlement. That process, through settlements and the
wall, is almost complete. One area is standing in the way of that
happening: the E1 area, which is part of the so-called Jerusalem
bubble. Israel has said that it will build on E1, but it is illegal and
is regarded so by the United States, the British Government and the
European Union. Does my right hon. Friend the Minister attach the
significance that I attach to the E1 plan and what will Britain do to
ensure that it does not go ahead?</p><p><a name="06060755000244">I want to
make two further points. First, while we demand, rightly, that the
Palestinians end the violence, will we make the same demand on the
Israelis? Can we at least suggest to them&#151;or perhaps more than
suggest&#151;that it might be a good idea if they committed
themselves unambiguously to abiding by the provisions of the fourth
Geneva convention in the occupied territories, because they are not
doing so at the moment? In that context, can my right hon. Friend
update the House on what is happening in the Hurndall and Miller cases
following the decisions of the coroner
here?</p><p><a name="06060755000245">Secondly,
on the humanitarian crisis, I have asked my right hon. Friend to
clarify the alternative mechanisms, but will he also explain how
Britain intends to respond to the UN appeal? It is estimated that the
emergency needs of the Palestinians require approximately$385
million extra. Are we going to respond to that and, if so,
how?</p><p><a name="06060755000246"><b><a name="06060755000460">Mr.

<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 116WH</b><br>concerning Palestinian aid. Can my hon. Friend tell us from his
perspective what the Israeli Government, the international community
and the United Kingdom Government are doing about negotiating with,
aiding and dealing with a Government who will not recognise the
existence of the state of Israel and will not renounce terrorism? How
do we deal with
that?</p><p><a name="06060755000247"><b><a name="06060755000461">Richard
Burden:</b> When I was in Gaza three or four years ago with my
hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), we met a
number of Palestinian groups and happened to meet the person who is now
the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority and a member of
Hamas. Most of the discussion involved us saying why suicide bombings
were morally wrong and why they did no good for the Palestinian cause.
That discussion led to a dialogue. I am not suggesting that we should
say anything other than that Hamas should recognise Israel and give up
violence, but my experience indicates that fostering a dialogue would
be much more effective than pushing Hamas into a corner. I think
Mahmoud Abbas would agree with
that.</p><p><a name="06060755000248">The final point
that I would like my right hon. Friend to address is Karni, and the
customs dues and levies that Israel is still withholding and the
restrictions on trade to the Palestinian Authority that Israel is still
imposing. What are we going to do about
that?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000400">3.13

Stephen Crabb (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con):</b>
I congratulate the hon. Member for
Hartlepool(Mr. Wright) on securing this timely debate. He is
right to say that this is a crucial time for the middle east and an
appropriate moment to consider what steps Her Majesty&#146;s
Government can take to help to resuscitate and support the peace
process involving Israel and the Palestinians&#151;the conclusion of
which would, of course, send a powerful message to the wider region
that peace and democracy are the future, as well as providing the
conditions for safety and prosperity for their own populations. In
recent months and years it has been difficult to identify any clear
chinks of light in a rather gloomy scenario, but they are there and I
want to focus on a few of them in my brief
contribution.</p><p><a name="06060755000250">It is
important to recognise that although unilateral disengagement by
Israel, including withdrawal from certain settlements, the continuation
of the security fence and the fixing of its borders, will not amount to
a peace settlement, it does represent a courageous and vital attempt to
achieve some lasting security for its citizens and an end to occupation
of the Palestinian territory. In the current scenario, that is a
logical course of action and deserves the active support of the
international community, but it is not a peace settlement. Even more so
than in the final years of Yasser Arafat's leadership, which was
characterised by broken promises and missed opportunities, Israel does
not currently have a partner in the peace process, and it needs one. If
there were any doubt about that, the election of Hamas in January
settled
it.</p><p><a name="06060755000251">In
no sense can Hamas be described as freedom fighter turned statesman. It
is a terrorist organisation that speaks the language of bloodshed, both
against Israel and within the occupied territories. Between 1989 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 117WH</b><br>and 2005, Hamas was deemed responsible for murdering 579 and wounding
more than 3,200 Israeli men, women and children, 93 per cent. of whom
were innocent civilians. The Hamas leadership condones that record and
refuses to condemn the attacks that have been carried out since its
election. In fact, all the signs are that it sees no incompatibility
between being a democratically elected Administration and encouraging
terrorist atrocities.</p><p><a name="06060755000252">Indeed, Hamas
has set up a new 3,000-strong security force led by a former commander
of the popular resistance committee. The violent clashes in Gaza city
in recent days between Fatah-dominated security forces and Hamas forces
have again left the Palestinian leadership with innocent blood on its
hands. The United Kingdom and the EU cannot and must not do business
with Hamas. Yet we cannot turn our backs on the Palestinian people. We
must do everything we can to isolate Hamas and encourage a strong
constituency for peace and democracy within the occupied
territories&#151;a constituency that will recognise the fundamental
need for peaceful co-existence with the Jewish state.</p><p><a name="06060755000253">The
Palestinian elections represented something of a paradox. On one hand,
they brought about the election of an anti-democratic terrorist
organisation and, on the other, it must be recognised that they were
something of a victory for democracy. They reaffirmed the overwhelming
commitment by the Palestinian people to determine their political
future by democratic means. In a region where Israel has traditionally
stood out starkly as the only real democratic nation, the relatively
trouble-free elections sent a signal that there is a strong appetite
within the troubled Palestinian territories for democratic solutions.
That represents an important chink of light that we must do all we can
to foster.</p><p><a name="06060755000254">Having
read the European Union election observation mission&#146;s report on
the January elections, one cannot fail to be impressed with the
exercise of democracy in the Palestinian territories. As the report
concludes, the elections amounted to</p><a name="06060755000385"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an open and fairly-contested
electoral process that was efficiently
administered&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000255">by
the Palestinian Central Elections Commission. I strongly encourage the
Minister to read the recommendations in the report to see what extra
support his Department can give to improving electoral arrangements for
Palestinians in future.</p><p><a name="06060755000256">Another significant chink of
light is President Mahmoud Abbas&#146;s intention to call a
referendum on Palestinian statehood that would implicitly recognise
Israel's right to exist if Hamas will not directly accept his two-state
proposal. His dialogue with Hamas on the matter seems to be failing,
but all the opinion polling in recent days seems to suggest that if he
takes his call for a referendum directly to the Palestinian streets he
will win, and that support for Hamas is declining. I have huge sympathy
with the powerful point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) who wants
Hamas&#146;s destructionist view to be buried by popular
opinion.</p><p><a name="06060755000257">The
border plan drawn up by Palestinian prisoners from Fatah, Hamas and
Islamic Jihad, who are being held in Israeli prisons, forms the basis
for the Abbas proposal, but may not represent a final peace settlement 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 118WH</b><br>with Israel, However, it could at least provide the bedrock for a united
Palestinian approach which is committed to peaceful co-existence and
which can engage with a meaningful peace process. The Israeli
Prime</p><p><a name="06060755000258">Minister said again at
the weekend that his country wants to talk with Abbas and to restart
the peace negotiations, but that will bear fruit only when Hamas
accepts the three conditions set out by the Quartet.</p><p><a name="06060755000259">I am conscious that I have
focused overwhelmingly on the Palestinian side of the peace equation,
because I believe that the next substantive steps towards peace must
come, and can only come, from the Palestinians, whose people have been
impoverished and betrayed yet again by bad
leadership.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000401">3.19

other right hon. and hon. Members can speak. I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) on securing this debate,
but I note that he was unable to reply to the intervention from my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) about the
final borders of the state of Israel. Clearly that is the kernel of the
issue.</p><p><a name="06060755000261">Many
Members of the House have visited Israel or Palestine or both at
various times. No one can go there without realising that the disparity
of wealth and power between Israel and Palestine, the sheer misery of
daily life for Palestinians and the sense of being in an open prison by
merely existing in Gaza must be a cause for concern and must drive
people into Hamas and other such organisations. Crossing from Israel
into Gaza means crossing from the first world to the third world or
worse. It means crossing from tarmac roads to potholes, from cars to
donkeys and from prosperity to utter misery.</p><p><a name="06060755000262">It is not as if that is a
recent phenomenon. Talking to older people in Gaza, I found that their
whole life has been one of either getting driven out of their own homes
when Israel was established in 1948, or, if they are slightly younger,
growing up in refugee camps and relying on the United Nations for food,
water and work all the time. If they are lucky enough to be able to get
out of Gaza daily to work in Israel, they are required to get up at
literally 3 o&#146;clock in the morning to queue at the checkpoint to
get through into Israel to do a day&#146;s work on a building site.
They then have to go through the same performance again to get home
late at night. Is it surprising that the ordinary people of Palestine
get very angry about what goes on in their
lives?</p><p><a name="06060755000263"><b><a name="06060755000464">Dr.
Julian Lewis (New Forest, East) (Con):</b> I agree that that
situation has been ongoing ever since the foundation of the state of
Israel, but will the hon. Gentleman explain to the House why rich Arab
states have not done more to alleviate the poverty in the Palestinian
lands?</p><p><a name="06060755000264"><b><a name="06060755000465">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> I cannot explain that and I do
not intend to. The reality is that Palestine is imprisoned by Israel.
It is imprisoned by a wall around the west bank and by border
checkpoints all around Gaza, and as my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Northfield said, there are now 500 checkpoints and their
number has increased in the past few months. It is simply not 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 119WH</b><br>acceptable to assume that the struggle is between equals and that Israel
equals Palestine. It does not. One side has nuclear weapons and F-16
jets, and is high-security in every sense, while the other has very
little indeed. Is it surprising that some people are driven to
terrorism?</p><p><a name="06060755000265">I remember
very well a discussion that my hon. Friend and I had when we visited
Gaza a few years ago. I have been there since, but on that visit, we
put it plainly that we thought that suicide bombing was crazy,
counter-productive, immoral and wrong. We then launched into what
turned out to be an interesting discussion between various Palestinian
groups and ourselves. All felt a sense of isolation, because they were
not being taken seriously by the rest of the world. If Israel wants to
achieve a long-term peace, it must do a number of things. First, it
must recognise the state of Palestine, and secondly, it should decide
what its borders proposal actually is. Israel has never done that.
</p><p><a name="06060755000266">As to the idea that
the security fence is a benign fence between neighbours, it is at least
25 ft high, it has razor wire on top and surveillance cameras all along
it, and it has been built beyond the 1967 borders, taking a further 10
per cent. of Palestinian land. How many more concessions do the
Palestinians have to make? Every time talks come around, the idea is
that the Palestinians must give up more land. They have suffered enough
poverty and they have had enough land taken away from them, and
although it is true that there has been unilateral withdrawal from
settlements in Gaza, there has been an increase in many illegal
settlements in the west bank and Israel has made it clear that it will
not halt the settlement policy
there.</p><p><a name="06060755000267">The Palestinian
Authority have tried with great difficulty to run affairs in Palestine.
They rely on aid, trade and tax income. Who is Israel to decide that
the tax income, to which the Palestinian Authority are legally
entitled, should be withheld?</p><p><a name="06060755000268"><b><a name="06060755000466">Mr.
Mark Harper (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> On that point, the tax
revenue is due according to agreements that the previous Palestinian
Authority and Israel entered into. If the current Palestinian regime
will not even recognise Israel or those agreements, it can hardly
expect the Israelis to hand over money in compliance with
them.</p><p><a name="06060755000269"><b><a name="06060755000467">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> Frankly, that is utter nonsense,
as the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well. If the money is due to
Palestinians and has been collected by Israel, it should be paid to
them. What are the political consequences of not paying them, and what
is the likely reaction? Does it benefit anybody to increase
unemployment in Gaza from 40 per cent. to 70 per cent., or to increase
yet further infant mortality and all the misery that goes with it? I
think
not.</p><p><a name="06060755000270">We
need Israel and those outside to continue the aid to ensure that the
Palestinian people can live a reasonable life, and we need to move
forward to try to achieve a long-term, permanent peace settlement. That
requires a recognition that Mahmoud Abbas was democratically elected in
difficult circumstances. Along with my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Northfield, I was an observer at that election, and I chose
to be an 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 120WH</b><br>observer in Rafah in Gaza. It was a strange election, because we had
great difficulty getting through the settlements to the polling
stations for the Palestinian people, and on one occasion, the Israeli
watchtowers decided to shoot at the polling stations in Rafah. That was
hardly a recognition of an independent, democratic process.
Nevertheless, the election took place and Mahmoud Abbas was elected to
the presidency.</p><p><a name="06060755000271">We
have now seen the election of a majority of Hamas members to the
Palestinian Authority. I do not agree with suicide bombings or
violence, and rapid steps must be taken towards a two-state solution.
However, one does not engender a sense of safety or security by not
talking to the people who are elected. We must talk to people even if
we do not agree with or like them. We must have that debate.</p><p><a name="06060755000272">I hope that
through the Government&#146;s approach, we can maintain the aid that
is essential to the Palestinian people, put as much pressure as we can
on the United States and others to promote a peace dialogue and
process, and above all, recognise that a democratic process is alive
and well in Palestine. We must consider what will happen if we allow
the policy of Palestinian impoverishment to continue. We should put
ourselves in the position of a young Palestinian whose grandparents
were thrown out of their homes and whose parents have lived in refugee
camps, and for whom life is security checkpoints, barbed wire, walls
and the inability to travel anywhere. What attitude does that place in
somebody&#146;s mind? What benign feelings does that give them
towards the rest of the world?</p><p><a name="06060755000273">If we want peace and we need to
get on with our neighbours, that will be best achieved not by building
a wall with barbed wire on top, but by talking to them, understanding
them and working with them. Israel must remember that it is part of the
middle east. It is not an extension of the USA or western
Europe.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000402">3.27

Mark Harper (Forest of Dean) (Con):</b> I shall be extremely
brief and pick up on two points. First, I agree with my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm
Rifkind) and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard
Burden) about the importance of the economic difficulties. It is simply
impossible, however, for Israel to have free economic relations if that
is at the expense of the killing of hundreds of Israeli citizens. The
fence is a reaction to that security situation, and it has been
effective. It can be removed only when the security threat is
removed.</p><p><a name="06060755000275">My
right hon. and learned Friend made his most important point when he
spoke about the importance of political leaders. The tragedy of the
Palestinian situation and part of the reason why it has gone on so long
is that for many years, the Palestinians were led by someone who had a
singular skill in missing every opportunity that was presented to him.
He let down the people whom he was supposed to lead. The Palestinians
now have an opportunity with their new leadership under President Abbas
and the Israelis have elected a new Government, which presents them
with an opportunity. What we need to do, and what I hope the Government
will be able to do, is to give those two leaders the best support from
outside the area in order to take the brave 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 121WH</b><br>and imaginative steps that will allow a two-state solution to succeed.
That is the single most important way in which we can help to deal with
the security situation and move forward the economic situation, which I
agree will help to enable the two sides to live together in
peace.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000403">3.28
pm</h5><p><a name="06060755000276"><b><a name="06060755000469">Mr.
Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b> I start, as is obligatory
but highly appropriate on this occasion, by congratulating the hon.
Member for Hartlepool(Mr. Wright) on securing the debate.
This is the highest attendance I have ever seen for a debate in this
Chamber, and it reflects not only the interest in the subject, but,
regrettably, the entrenched views in this House, which perhaps mirror
the entrenched views of people in the area that we are
discussing.</p><p><a name="06060755000277">It was a
privilege to listen to the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington
and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), who drew on his expertise as a
former Foreign Secretary and, before that, Defence Secretary. In six
minutes, he encapsulated the kernel of our entire debate.</p><p><a name="06060755000278">Drawing on the contributions, I
want to touch on four subjects. First, my party and I strongly believe
in the necessity for a two-state solution. The right hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s most telling point was that this conflict, unlike
others, has an end point, on which almost everybody, regardless of
their opinion, can agree. For the Israelis, that end point is security
and being seen as legitimate by their neighbours, by people across the
middle east and by the world. To balance that, for the Palestinians, it
is having a viable state.</p><p><a name="06060755000279">Politicians can be so immersed
in conflict resolution, especially in troubled areas of the world, that
they lose sight of what much of day-to-day politics is about. I was
particularly struck by what the hon. Member for Hartlepool said about
the minimum wage in Israel and about the elections, in which some
slogans and themes of Labour&#146;s 1997 and 2001 campaigns were
drawn on, perhaps unwisely&#151;well, given the success of the
outcome, perhaps it was wise. Relating politics to people&#146;s
day-to-day concerns is extremely important; politics needs to address
people&#146;s concerns. Ultimately, politicians should not be judged
solely on their ability to strike poses and negotiate settlements in
protracted disagreements that have lasted for many decades. They also
have to be able to bring tangible economic and social benefits to the
people whom they
serve.</p><p><a name="06060755000280">My second point
is on Israel&#146;s place in the wider middle east. It is extremely
welcome news that Israel continues to enjoy cordial relations with
Egypt and Jordan. That points the way forward for mature relationships
with other parts of the middle east. Everyone would agree that the
Iranian president&#146;s rhetoric about the existence of Israel is
alarming, but there is some cause for optimism even there, although I
do not want to exaggerate it. We should not underestimate the leap that
the Americans have made in the past week or two in offering to have
dialogue with the Iranians. Also, interestingly, the Iranians have
shown imagination&#151;something that is not always
displayed&#151;by at least engaging in that process. I do not wish to
overstate the progress made, but nor do I wish to understate
it.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 122WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000281">My third point is about the
security wall, which has been touched on in nearly every contribution
so far. People disagree on how to describe it, but let us call it a
wall for the time being. I well understand the reasons why that wall
was built. We need only go back to events in London just under a year
ago to understand the threat and the terror that suicide bombers pose
to people going about their normal business, and we should never lose
sight of that concern and that menace. However, it is also reasonable
to observe that the wall is aggressively placed, and that it divides
communities both economically and socially. I do not particularly wish
to make a judgment, other than to say that no wall has ever offered a
lasting solution to a political problem, whether it is in Northern
Ireland, Berlin or elsewhere. Some people may take the view that it is
necessary in the short term, but I caution anyone against thinking that
it is anything other than a short-term
measure.</p><p><a name="06060755000282"><b><a name="06060755000470">Jane
Kennedy (Liverpool, Wavertree) (Lab):</b> I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for giving way because I am conscious of the pressure on
time. It is precisely on that point that I wanted to speak. Does he
accept that people who comment on the security fence or wall that has
been developed in the middle east ought to visit Northern Ireland to
see precisely the same abomination in Belfast? No matter where a wall
is put, it is an aggressive intrusion into communities, but in Northern
Ireland, where both Conservative and Labour Governments have built
these abominations, the experience of communities on either side is
that the immediate relief that a wall brings from snipers, bombs and
stonings means that people can begin to refocus on their economic
circumstances, on their education and on local well-being. It allows
breathing space. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a wall is short
term. In Northern Ireland, they have been there too many
years&#151;</p>

the short
term.</p><p><a name="06060755000285"><b><a name="06060755000472">Mr.
Browne:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, because it
essentially, and eloquently, reinforces the point that I was seeking to
make, which is that one can understand why the wall is located there.
If one puts oneself in the position of someone who feels under threat,
one can understand that even more; but also, if we take a step back, we
can see that there is no long-term viability in a political settlement
that includes literal barriers between
people.</p><p><a name="06060755000286">My final point
is on Hamas and the government of Palestinians. People can interpret
the result of the elections differently, but I would like to think that
some of Hamas&#146;s support&#151;perhaps even the bulk of
it&#151;was more the result of a social cry than a political
statement. By that I mean that one should never underestimate the
desire of people voting in elections to concentrate on the
basics&#151;on jobs, prosperity and the future of their families.
That is a point that I tried to make earlier, and that the hon. Member
for Hartlepool also made. Sometimes, people feel the need to make a
dramatic statement in order to underline their desire or
desperation.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 123WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000287">To draw on a point made by the
hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) and others, it is
important that we continue to recognise that there is huge social
deprivation in the Palestinian territories, and it is potentially
perverse for us to make that worse, or to cause ourselves greater
difficulties, by making the situation more problematic. Even if we see
that as a potential political solution, the likelihood is that it will
turn out to be quite the opposite, and that it will lead to greater
militancy and a greater desire on the part of rank-and-file
Palestinians to seek more radical solutions to their
problems.</p><p><a name="06060755000288">My party
and I agree that Hamas should renounce violence against the Israelis
and should recognise Israel as a state. Indeed, it is in the
Palestinian interest to do both those things; it is not just of benefit
to the Israelis, because the scope for politics and a political
solution is very limited until the Palestinians put themselves in a
position with which the Israelis can more reasonably negotiate. They
will inevitably find that easier if both those concessions are
made.</p><p><a name="06060755000289">In summary, my
party and I&#151;and, I think, people across the parties in the
House&#151;favour negotiation. Imposed solutions are likely to be
short-term solutions, particularly with regard to borders and land.
Although there is not often cause for optimism in that part of the
world, we hope that at least with the rapid political change that is
taking place there, there may be more reason for being optimistic
looking forward, than there has been looking
backwards.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000404">3.37
pm</h5><p><a name="06060755000290"><b><a name="06060755000473">Mr.
Keith Simpson (Mid-Norfolk) (Con):</b> I congratulate the hon.
Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) on securing the debate. He has
spoken in similar debates over the past six months with great eloquence
and commitment. The one thing on which we can all agree is that, in a
period in which so many political commentators&#151;and, indeed,
political leaders&#151;in the United Kingdom say that politics is
dead and that it is all about packaging, spin and a feel-good factor,
one need only come to Westminster Hall for a debate such as this to
hear real issues being debated with real passion by people who believe
in what they say and take a line that may not be consensual, because
this is not a subject on which it is easy to find
consensus.</p><p><a name="06060755000291">In
this debate, I am struck, as was my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind), by the
historical anniversaries: this year is the 90th anniversary of the Arab
revolt and the 50th anniversary of the Suez operation. The point about
that&#151;and we can draw other historical analogies&#151;is that
Britain had, and still has, a deep, important role in the middle east.
At least some of the things happening today are a direct consequence of
actions taken by previous Governments, so Britain has an interest and,
to a certain extent, a
responsibility.</p><p><a name="06060755000292">Another
point that I draw from this debate has already been made by a number of
Members. I suspect that the actions of the Israeli Government, in terms
of their security policy&#151;what they refer to as defendable
frontiers&#151;and the election of Kadima, have bought a period of
negotiations. The Israelis believe that they 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 124WH</b><br>have established security against terrorism in the short term, and that
they have placed themselves in a strong negotiating situation. I agree
with Members who say that those who have suffered terrorist activities
within their borders will feel a powerful motivation for anything that
can prevent those activities. However, that is not a long-term
political solution. Israeli security officials tell us, as my right
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea said,
that people will undoubtedly find other ways of directly attacking
Israel in the medium term. A political solution is likely to be the
only answer.</p><p><a name="06060755000293">Several
hon. Members referred to the plight of the Palestinians&#151;I and
many people in this Room have seen it&#151;and brought it graphically
to life. There is no doubt that the plight of the Palestinians is not
just related to the fact that, compared with Israel, they appear to be
a poor people, as the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)
said. Their plight is not just a result of actions taken by the
Israelis, the United States of America or any of the other western
powers. It is also a direct result of a failure of their own leadership
and corruption on a scale that makes that in many other parts of the
world look puny. When I went to Palestine, I was struck by the large
number of people wandering around wearing designer clothing and driving
modern cars. There is a lot of money in Palestine and the ordinary
people are being cheated, not just by outside organisations but by the
Palestinian
authorities.</p><p><a name="06060755000294"><b><a name="06060755000474">Dan
Norris (Wansdyke) (Lab):</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06060755000295"><b><a name="06060755000475">Mr.
Simpson:</b> I will not because I have very little time, and I
want to keep my comments short so that the Minister has time to
speak.</p><p><a name="06060755000296">The crucial
question that I draw from the debate and similar previous ones is
simple, but it is the most difficult one to answer&#151;I do not
expect the Minister to answer it. What is Israel, and what is
Palestine? It is almost impossible to agree immediately on what the
definable borders of Israel and Palestine are. That will be the most
difficult problem to resolve. The question the Minister has to face is
what role the British Government have in keeping those negotiations
open and persuading the two sides to come together. I suggest that we
do so in the following way. We have a responsibility in the historical
context. We also have one because we have been&#151;and still
are&#151;directly in contact, both formally and informally, with a
wide range of those involved in the conflict. We still have tremendous
influence among the bordering states, and I would like more action to
be taken by the neighbours of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
Many of them stand on the sideline criticising what is going on, but
they could make a much greater effort. It is a question not just of
providing money, but of political support for dialogue as
well.</p><p><a name="06060755000297">In addition,
we have influence on the United States of America. It seems that the
United States is sometimes very heavily engaged in this area, but at
other times, it seems totally disinterested and not engaged at all. We
have a responsibility and duty to encourage the US, whatever the
Administration, to continue direct engagement, showing the sort of
imagination it has shown recently in giving diplomacy a chance in
negotiations with Iran. 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 125WH</b><br>The United Kingdom also has a responsibility to continue direct
practical support, which has taken place under this Government and
previous ones, to Israel and Palestine. We do so by giving advice,
supplying officials, assisting security and through United Nations and

say that Westminster Hall debates are irrelevant. After all, we are out
of sight. Who sees us? It would seem only a few people sitting at the
back of the Room. But most of us know, from talking to those directly
involved in Israel and Palestine, that they watch, listen and hear what
is said. I urge the Government to continue their good offices in
bringing the sides together, as far as possible, to seek a solution.
That will not be found in the next few months, but there is a window of
opportunity because of the actions taken by the Israeli
Government.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000405">3.44

Minister for Europe (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b>
I add my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for
Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) for raising this issue for discussion in the
House. It is appropriate to examine the way forward in the middle east
at this time, four months after the election of the Hamas-led
Government in the Palestinian territories and two months after the
Israeli
elections.</p><p><a name="06060755000300">Others have
reflected on their visits to the region, and I shall do so as well.
Nearly seven years ago, I went to Israel and Gaza to negotiate final
status issues. Negotiations took place on borders, water rights, the
status of Jerusalem and refugees. I hope that the hon. Member for
Taunton (Mr. Browne) is right to be optimistic because it is clear that
the actions of the two new Governments will determine whether the path
of peace in the middle east, which we all want to see taken, is
actually pursued.</p><p><a name="06060755000301"><b><a name="06060755000477">Jane
Kennedy:</b> While listening to the debate, I was greatly
struck by the number of Members in all parties who have recently
visited the middle east. The Minister has described his own,
not-so-recent visit. However, I would like to put on the record that it
is a long time since I was able to visit the middle east. There may be
people listening to this debate who are able to change
that.</p><p><a name="06060755000302"><b><a name="06060755000478">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I am not entirely sure how to respond to that.
<i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> Unfortunately, I am not one of those
people.</p><p><a name="06060755000303">The British
government have consistently made it clear that Hamas came to power as
a result of free and fair elections and that, as a consequence, it has
a democratic mandate. However, those who take part in the democratic
process must play by the rules of democracy. Democracy is about more
than elections: it is about assuming the responsibilities of
government. We expect the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to assume
their prime responsibility to the Palestinian people by working
actively towards a lasting peace with the state of Israel. Peace
remains indispensable for the creation of the vibrant, fully
functioning Palestine that we all want to help to develop.</p><p><a name="06060755000304">The way towards that is set out
in the road map, endorsed in 2003 by both the Israeli and Palestinian
Governments of the day. It sets out clear steps to be 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 126WH</b><br>taken by both sides and the international community, culminating in the
creation of an independent and viable Palestinian state, living side by
side with Israel in peace and security. We and our international
partners are profoundly attached to that vision, and we regard it as
the best possible means of achieving the two-state solution.</p><p><a name="06060755000305">However, we
cannot advance the agenda for peace&#151;the road map&#151;as long
as one party refuses to recognise the other. It is essential that the
Hamas-led Government commit themselves to non-violence, recognise
Israel, and accept previous agreements and obligations, including the
road map. Those are the principles set out by the Quartet on 30
January, and endorsed by Palestinian President Abbas and most of the
international community. We are firmly committed to them. We are asking
nothing more than we asked of the previous Palestinian Government, but
so far Hamas has not signalled a readiness to accept the
principles.</p><p><a name="06060755000306">We
naturally welcome the process of national dialogue launched by
President Abbas on 25 May. We are encouraged by the President&#146;s
clear desire to establish himself as the international representative
of the Palestinian people, and we recognise him as such. I sincerely
hope the outcome of the national dialogue is positive for the
Palestinians, and positive for the peace process. The UK is certainly
eager for Israel and the Palestinians to re-engage with the peace
process as soon as possible.</p><p><a name="06060755000307"><b><a name="06060755000479">Barbara
Keeley:</b> On the point of trying to bring forward that
re-engagement, I mentioned earlier the international women&#146;s
commission, which is convened by Unifem&#151;the United Nations
Development Fund for Women&#151;and supported by European countries,
particularly Belgium. Given that women MPs in our party and throughout
the House are interested in supporting both that initiative and elected
women in Israel and Palestine, will my right hon. Friend advance
possible membership and support of that organisation from the UK? We
have been asked to support it, but that matter has not been resolved
yet. Given the interest from women MPs, now is a suitable time to do
something about
it.</p><p><a name="06060755000308"><b><a name="06060755000480">Mr.
Hoon:</b> We welcome any practical way of furthering dialogue
and understanding. If my hon. Friend would care to write to me or the
Minister directly responsible, we can consider that in more
detail.</p><p><a name="06060755000309">We welcome
President Abbas&#146;s call on the Hamas Government to endorse the
prisoners&#146; accord. Their doing so would be a step in the right
direction towards meeting the Quartet&#146;s three
principles.</p><p><a name="06060755000310">The UK,
along with most of the international donor community, continues to
provide assistance to the Palestinian people. Along with our EU
partners, we have a strong record of support for the Palestinian
people. On 25 April, the Department for International Development
announced a &#163;15 million payment to the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency. The UK alone has given &#163;147 million to the
Palestinian people since 2001, and we continue to be one of their
largest donors.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 127WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000311"><b><a name="06060755000481">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</p><p><a name="06060755000312"><b><a name="06060755000482">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I anticipate that my hon. Friend will want to
intervene after I have made my next point. If I may make it first, I
shall certainly give way to him once I have done
so.</p><p><a name="06060755000313">In
the present circumstances, the UK and the international community
cannot renew direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority
institutions. Given Hamas&#146;s position and, in particular, its
support for terrorism, we simply have no choice. We are, however,
determined to continue to support the Palestinian people and to help to
provide for their basic needs. We have been at the forefront of the
debate on how best to do that. The international funding mechanism
endorsed by the Quartet and now being worked up by the EU was based on
a UK proposal on how to channel funding to meet the
Palestinians&#146; basic needs while bypassing the Palestinian
Authority. The mechanism should be in place soon and the United Kingdom
is, of course, willing to contribute
funding.</p><p><a name="06060755000314"><b><a name="06060755000483">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> Can the Minister confirm that
pressure will be placed on Israel to pay the tax due to the Palestinian
Authority, to which it is clearly legally entitled? In his discussions
through the UN work, has he received any assurances from the Israeli
Government that they will no longer prevent the United Nations from
moving around by impounding vehicles and by doing all the other things
that they do that make life impossible for the UN
administration?</p><p><a name="06060755000315"><b><a name="06060755000484">Mr.
Hoon:</b> I shall deal with those points in due course, if my
hon. Friend will bear with me.</p><p><a name="06060755000316">We are
concerned about the deterioration of the Palestinian economy. We
continue to press Israel to open crossings into the Gaza strip to
enable Palestinian goods to be exported. We want to do more, but it is
a fact that the true regeneration of the Palestinian
economy&#151;which would require public and private international
investment and access to regional and international markets, and would
make a sustainable difference to Palestinian living
standards&#151;can be achieved only through a lasting
peace.</p><p><a name="06060755000317">Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken on several occasions about his ideas
for further withdrawals from the west bank, although those ideas have
yet to be set out in detail. We certainly support the principle of
further withdrawals, just as we supported disengagement from Gaza last
summer, as a step in the right direction, but we and international
partners, including the US Secretary of State and the UN
Secretary-General, have been clear that the final status issues, such
as borders, must be determined through a process of
negotiation.</p><p><a name="06060755000318">The UK and
the international community have on numerous occasions set out their
strong views that there should be a negotiated solution. President Bush
repeated that to the Israeli Prime Minister in Washington two weeks
ago. We are encouraged by Prime Minister Olmert&#146;s and President
Abbas&#146;s commitment to negotiations. We hope to see those two
leaders act on their commitment in the near future.</p><p><a name="06060755000319">To encourage such a solution,
Israel must stop any action, such as settlement activity and the
construction of the separation barrier on Palestinian land, that is 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 128WH</b><br>contrary to international law and threatens the viability of an agreed
two-state solution. All final status issues&#151;including
borders&#151;are for both parties to negotiate. The Israeli
Government should not take any actions that might prejudice these
negotiations.</p><p><a name="06060755000320"><b><a name="06060755000485">Richard
Burden:</b> My right hon. Friend has clearly outlined well
established UK policy. Given that Israel continues to build settlements
and says that it will go ahead with the E1 plan, what, in practical
terms, can Britain and the international community do to try to ensure
that the objectives that my right hon. Friend wants to be achieved will
be achieved, rather than precluded by further settlement building,
particularly in
E1?</p><p><a name="06060755000321"><b><a name="06060755000486">Mr.
Hoon:</b> We have continued to set out the clear view in
international law as well as getting the two parties into negotiation.
In the end, the history of this tragic situation demonstrates that only
the Israelis and Palestinians can reach conclusions. They might have
help, assistance and guidance from the international community, but
only if they sit down together and negotiate the
issues&#151;including the question of settlements&#151;can there be
real and lasting
progress.</p><p><a name="06060755000322">We
believe that the Israelis should adhere to international law and we
remain concerned by Israeli policies on settlements, the barrier and
access to Jerusalem, all of which threaten to cut off Palestinian East
Jerusalem from the west bank. Those policies will have serious
economic, social and humanitarian consequences for the Palestinian
people, and risk reducing the possibility of reaching a final status
agreement on Jerusalem. The Government have therefore called on both
parties to implement the 15 November agreement on movement and access
and for Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic
situation of the Palestinians, including by resuming transfers of the
withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues.</p><p><a name="06060755000323">The Karni crossing is the only
access point for Palestinian goods from the Gaza strip and is the major
point for the import of goods. The Israel defence forces closed Karni
on 26 April following a suicide bomb attempt that was foiled by
Palestinian security, and reopened it on 21 May. We continue to raise
the importance of crossing points with the Israeli authorities at all
levels.</p><p><a name="06060755000324">We remain
concerned at the worsening security situation in Gaza and parts of the
west bank. The Palestinian Authority must take action to stop the
rocket attacks from Gaza on nearby Israeli villages. We also urge the
Israeli Government to act with restraint in response to those attacks.
The impact of Israel&#146;s military operations in the occupied
territories continues to cause concern. Israel, like all states, has
the absolute right to defend itself against terrorism but it must
respect international humanitarian law. IDF operations have resulted in
Palestinian civilian deaths, including those of children. Such civilian
casualties are unacceptable. In addition, the destruction of
infrastructure only deepens Palestinians&#146; despair and hinders
efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement. The conflict cannot be
solved by military means alone.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 129WH</b><br><p><a name="06060755000325">We are also concerned about the
increase in intra-Palestinian violence, the effects that has on
people&#146;s daily lives, and the potential repercussions on the
delivery of aid and on the political process. Legally constituted
security services must take action to maintain law and order in the
Gaza strip and the west
bank.</p><p><a name="06060755000326">My hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) raised two
consular cases. Tom Hurndall&#146;s family met the Attorney-General
on 5 May 2006 and will meet the Foreign Secretary shortly. We will
decide on future actions once the Foreign Secretary has been able to
discuss the case with the family. In relation to James Miller&#146;s
case, the Foreign Secretary met the Miller family on 11 May 2006 and is
considering follow-up action in consultation with the
Attorney-General.</p><p><a name="06060755000327">In
conclusion, the UK Government remain committed to a two-state solution
to the middle east conflict and are eager to work with Israelis and
Palestinians to achieve that. The only solution, as I have made clear
repeatedly, remains a secure Israel and a viable, independent
Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security. We are
encouraged that Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas have made
commitments to negotiations and look forward to early progress. We and
the international community stand ready to support them in any way we
can. We also look to the Hamas-led Palestinian Government to commit to
the Quartet&#146;s three principles and thereby come into line with
the international community&#146;s views on how to make progress
towards a lasting and permanent
settlement.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 130WH</b><br>

Assyria)</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06060755000406">3.57
pm</h5><p><a name="06060755000328"><b><a name="06060755000487">Stephen
Pound (Ealing, North) (Lab):</b> It is a pleasure to appear
before you this afternoon, Mr. Cook, and a particular honour that my
right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe will be responding for the
Government. Few Ministers, if any, know more about the subject and I
could not have chosen a better Minister to
respond.</p><p><a name="06060755000329">I start with
a minor point. The subject of this Adjournment debate appears on the
Order Paper as &#147;Genocide in Armenia and Assyria&#148;. I am
not seeking to apportion blame, but that is not the title that was
submitted. The original title was &#147;Recognition of the genocide
of Armenians and Assyrians&#148;. It would be obvious to you, Mr.
Cook, and to many people, that to talk about genocide in Armenia, a
country that has existed in its present form for a comparatively short
time, and Assyria, a country that might have a millennia-old history
but is not recognised in international boundaries, would be
superfluous.</p><p><a name="06060755000330">I wish to
speak about the incidents in the then Ottoman empire, particularly in
the spring of and throughout 1915, that led, I hope indisputably, to
the planned, calculated genocide of the Christian community, which
consisted principally of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks. I shall seek
to persuade my right hon. Friend that the time has finally come for Her
Majesty&#146;s Government to join so many other countries,
Parliaments and legislatures in recognising the genocide that occurred
in that year.</p><p><a name="06060755000331">I hope
that it will be comparatively uncontentious to state a few basic facts.
One and a half million Armenian residents of the former Ottoman empire
died between 1915 and 1923 as a result of calculated genocide. I hope
that it is not contentious to say that 3.5 million of the historic
Christian population of Assyrians, Armenians and Greeks then living in
the Ottoman empire had been murdered&#151;starved to death or
slaughtered&#151;or exiled by 1923. I hope that those are not
contentious points. I hope that no one would seek to deny that the
process started on 24 April 1915 in Constantinople, where 1,000
Armenians were identified, taken from their homes and murdered. I hope
that it is not contentious to reaffirm that 300,000 Armenian males were
then conscripted into the Turkish army, unarmed and then murdered, and
that death marches into the Syrian desert took
place.</p><p><a name="06060755000332"><b><a name="06060755000488">Mr.
Andrew Dismore (Hendon) (Lab):</b> I do not wish to contest
what my hon. Friend says, but I point out that the oppression of the
Armenians started much earlier, in the 19th century, particularly under
the reign of Sultan Hamid, who was one of the really evil people in
this history.</p><p><a name="06060755000333"><b><a name="06060755000489">Stephen
Pound:</b> Were I to attempt to address the history of the
Armenian and Assyrian peoples, I would require far longer than the time
that Mr. Speaker and you, Mr. Cook, have allocated to me. I shall refer
later to the Caliph Sultan Abdul Hamid. For the record, I confirm that
my hon. Friend is correct&#151;massacres took place in 1895 and 1909,
and throughout this period&#151;but I am concentrating on 1915,
because it is 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 131WH</b><br>the first example of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the 20th century.
For that reason, it is vital that we identify the full horror of what
occurred.</p><p><a name="06060755000334">I
say that the events are uncontentious, yet Turkey&#146;s greatest
living writer, Orhan Pamuk, is currently the subject of attack and
vilification, and even a court order, for stating that the Armenian and
Assyrian genocides took place. The modern Turkish Government, of whom I
am no enemy and who are not entirely responsible for their precursor
Ottoman empire, deny to this day that genocide took
place.</p><p><a name="06060755000335"><b><a name="06060755000490">Mr.
Dismore:</b> The real problem is that article 301 of the
Turkish penal code makes it an offence to insult Turkishness, and that
is what Orhan Pamuk has been charged with. During the past year, 29
other journalists have been charged under that article, and eight have
been convicted. Article 305 talks of acts against the fundamental
national
interest&#151;</p><p><a name="06060755000336"><b><a name="06060755000491">Frank
Cook (in the Chair):</b>
Briefly.</p><p><a name="06060755000337"><b><a name="06060755000492">Mr.
Dismore:</b> It applies in respect of the Armenian genocide
and, of course, advocating troops going out of Cyprus. Article 318 is
being used to oppress journalists in a similar
fashion.</p><p><a name="06060755000338"><b><a name="06060755000493">Stephen
Pound:</b> I freely and publicly admit that there are few in
the House who have a deeper knowledge of the Turkish penal code than my
hon. Friend. He is absolutely correct. To deny genocide is bad enough,
but for a state to structure within its legal framework a formal
legalistic denial of it seems to be taking us into another
area.</p><p><a name="06060755000339">I said earlier
that I hoped that what I was saying was not contentious, but we have
heard that it is. I put to the House the simple question, &#147;Did
it happen?&#148; There are those in modern Turkey who would say that
there was no genocide&#151;that there was inter-communal fighting,
and that a movement of people chose of their own free will to march
into the desert and die; and that the decision was freely taken by
people in the eastern Ottoman empire to leave their homes, in which
their families had lived for hundreds of years, and to move away from
their livelihoods and their ancestral lands and to choose instead a
lonely death.</p><p><a name="06060755000340">I find
that view unconvincing, and I cite as evidence one of the most
remarkable books that I have ever read. It is by Viscount Bryce and
Arnold Toynbee. That book was published during the first world war at
the express instigation of the then Foreign Secretary in order to
respond to the reports that were then reaching Her Majesty&#146;s
Government, particularly via the United States Ambassador Morgenthau,
of what appeared to be a systematic programme of
genocide.</p><p><a name="06060755000341">Toynbee,
a distinguished Oxford historian, produced one of the most thoroughly
researched and empirically backed volumes that I have ever read. Over
and over again, it lists evidence from people who were there at the
time. The original version was censored, because it did not name the
witnesses. I am grateful, as is the House, to Ara Sarafian, who has
published the full uncensored edition of &#147;The Treatment of
Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916: Documents Presented to
Viscount Grey of Fallodon&#148;, which identifies those 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 132WH</b><br>who were there at the time&#151;those who witnessed with their own
eyes the horrors to which I refer.</p><p><a name="06060755000342">I give credit to Lord Avebury,
known to many of us as Eric Lubbock, who with me and the tireless
campaigner Odette Bazil, presented a copy of the book to Downing street
last year. We know that Lord Avebury is not well, and I am sure that we
all send our best wishes to him. I also pay credit to Ninos Warda,
whose famous book &#147;Seyfo: the Assyrian Genocide in International
Law&#148; was recently published.</p><p><a name="06060755000343">I also cite as evidence the
&#147;Blue Book&#148;&#151;provable, substantiated and sustained
evidence. It contains 102 specific eye-witness reports by neutral or
belligerent nationals&#151;neutrals such as the United States, and
belligerent nationals such as German missionaries. It also contains 10
full statements by missionaries and missionary societies and 66 reports
from Armenian clergy, local residents and refugees, as well as the
extraordinary documents released by the American State
Department&#151;the state papers of Edward Nathan, the US Consul in
Mersina. To read his reaction to the unfolding horrors is to realise
that this truly was the first genocide of the 20th century.</p><p><a name="06060755000344">We have from the then Ottoman
empire the evidence of the orders of the Minister of the Interior,
Talaat Pasha, to the man whose position might roughly be described as
analogous to that of a deportation Minister, Abdulahad Nuri, in which
the Minister of the Interior orders Nuri to increase deportation and
destruction finally to &#147;solve the Eastern
Question&#148;.</p><p><a name="06060755000345">Genocide
did happen&#151;3.5 million people were killed or died in the desert.
Why did it happen? Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians had lived in the
Ottoman empire for many hundreds of years, and some for even longer;
and there was not a systematic programme or pogrom until late in the
19th century. Without doubt there were isolated incidents, but
something changed, particularly during the caliphate of Sultan Abdul
Hamid, and especially with the election of the Committee for Union and
Progress.</p><p><a name="06060755000346">Ittihadve
Terakki, normally referred to now as the Young Turks, were heavily
influenced by ideologues such as Via Gokalp and Behaeddin Shakir, and
created an ideology of Turkification. They harked back to an earlier
Turkish empire, which they wanted to see freed of those who were not
Muslims and not Turkish speakers. The Christians were the obvious
target.</p><p><a name="06060755000347">On 12 November
1914, the sultan-caliph addressed an imperial declaration to the
Turkish army and navy, demanding their participation in what he
described as a &#147;jihad&#148;&#151;a word that few of us knew
10 or 15 years ago, but which now sadly resonates throughout
Westminster and the city. &#147;Jihad&#148; was the word that he
used on that day. The ruling triumvirate of Talaat Pasha, Jemal Pasha
and Enver Pasha were all enthusiastic supporters of the process of
Turkification.
</p><p><a name="06060755000348">If
one asks modern Turks why they still deny it, in addition to giving the
theory that people willingly wandered to their deaths, they will say
that the Armenians in particular were traitors. The Turks will refer to
the huge Armenian community around Van lake in Van province, and the
fact that some Armenians fought with General Nicolaieff, who led the
Russian troops south to the Van lake and the vilayets in the area. This
is an argument that constantly arises. General Nicolaieff&#146;s
fighting took 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 133WH</b><br>place in July, long after the massacres had started. By May 1915,
despite strong border censorship, reports were already being taken
outside the Ottoman empire by travellers, missionaries and particularly
employees of the Baghdad railway. Ambassador Morgenthau received a
report that the River Euphrates was so choked with bodies that the
water was breaking the banks and flowing beyond its
course.</p><p><a name="06060755000349">At that time,
further evidence was identified. Previously, forced conversions to
Islam had been demanded to spare people&#146;s lives, but the rule
was changed so that, to be spared, families could convert only in
groups of no fewer than 100, or they would not be allowed the
protection of Islam. By late May and early June, wounded orphans and
widows were arriving in Aleppo, Marash, Aintab, Tarsus, Adana, Sivas,
Konia and Smyrna. Refugee bodies throughout the world were begged to
help those people, who were arriving in such huge
numbers.</p><p><a name="06060755000350">I have
referred to the slaughter in Van, one of the traditional Armenian
centres. That was matched, if not exceeded, by the genocide that took
place in Cilicia in the vilayet of Adana and sandjak of Marash. That
population had already endured a massacre as recently as 1909. Despite
that, the population had increased and it was a stable community that
had established its own churches and schools. There was little
unemployment and a strong tradition of arable land and animal
husbandry. Yet that community had the great misfortune to live on a
strategic route through the empire and, more than that, to be the
chosen target for Muslim refugees from the Roumelian vilayets that had
been ceded by Turkey in 1913 as a consequence of the Balkan war. Those
refugees wanted the area around Cilicia, and they got it&#151;over
the dead bodies of the established local community.</p><p><a name="06060755000351">Zeitoun was ethnically cleansed
from April 1915; its inhabitants were driven into the Anatolian desert
to die. Those who did not were harried to Sultania and beyond; we do
not know where they ended up nor what happened to them. We have records
of who they were, but none about what happened to them. We know only
that they ceased to be.</p><p><a name="06060755000352">It is
intensely difficult even to describe what was happening in the Ottoman
empire at that time. Typically, the pattern was that Turkish regular
army troops&#151;I underscore that; they were regular army
troops&#151;would surround a village or community such as Ourfa. The
local community would defend itself, as Ourfa&#146;s did for a month.
Then, inevitably, through force majeure, the Turkish regulars would
surround, overcome and kill.</p><p><a name="06060755000353">The one exception to that
horrific repetition of slaughter was in Jibal Mousa in the vilayet of
Aleppo. A French naval squadron lying offshore witnessed the
inhabitants&#146; defence of Jibal Mousa, aware of the
horror&#151;the certain death&#151;that awaited them should the
Turkish regular army manage to breach their defences. The squadron
rescued the inhabitants and carried them to Port Said, where they came
under British
protection.</p><p><a name="06060755000354"><b><a name="06060755000494">Mr.
Dismore:</b> That account was very moving. It is a pity that
when the same happened in Smyrna in 1923, the navies of the world stood
by and let that city burn to the ground with the slaughter of hundreds
of 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 134WH</b><br>thousands of its inhabitants&#151;Greek, Armenian and other Christian
minorities. Ultimately, that led to an exchange of populations. My hon.
Friend mentioned an example of when something was done by the rest of
the world. Since then, however, the rest of the world has stood by and
allowed the Armenians to
suffer.</p><p><a name="06060755000355"><b><a name="06060755000495">Stephen
Pound:</b> As I said, if I took right hon. and hon. Members
down every bloodstained byway of the 20th century, I would exceed the
time that I am allowed, Mr. Cook. My hon. Friend mentions the sacking
of Smyrna and its replacement by Izmir. That is a scar on the history
of our globe and our people. We know
that.</p><p><a name="06060755000356">I
seek recognition of the genocide that occurred in the Ottoman empire.
One might think that that ideologically motivated, militarily enforced
genocide was so horrific, appalling and awful that recognition would be
almost an irrelevance; after all, it would not bring anyone back to
life. However, the relatives of those who suffered have experienced
what they see as a double death: the deaths of their relatives and the
death&#151;the pain and agony&#151;that they feel, knowing that
those deaths are denied by those responsible. When we take those
feelings into account, we begin to understand why recognition is so
crucial and
important.</p><p><a name="06060755000357">I am
massively indebted to the work of people whom I am proud to call my
friends, such as Dr. Harry Hagopian, Raffi Sarkissian, Ninab Lamasso,
Andy Dharmoo and so many others. They tell me over and again that until
there can be recognition of the genocide, there can be no peace. Only
when the denial has been confronted and the reasons for it analysed,
and when the modern, secular Turkish Government finally understand what
their ancestor Government did, can there be
peace.</p><p><a name="06060755000358">The friends
whom I mentioned make that demand for the sake of remembrance,
recognition, respect, redemption&#151;and, yes, recompense. How
otherwise can a people move on? The Armenian and Assyrian community has
now spread to France, San Francisco, Australia and to our islands,
where its people provide a service as ideal, model citizens. They are
hard-working decent people, whom we are proud to call British and our
brothers and sisters. Every time we look them in the eye, we see
reflected the pain of the denial of their history. We simply cannot
allow that situation to
pertain.</p><p><a name="06060755000359">I understand
how difficult matters diplomatic are, and how Turkey is becoming
increasingly important in the European context. It is a country for
which I have no enmity; I have affection and respect for modern Turkey
and only hope that it can do as this country has in respect of the
crimes committed by our ancestors in centuries past. I hope that modern
Turkey can accept what happened in its name and bring some
peace.</p><p><a name="06060755000360">Since
1965, many countries and bodies have recognised genocide: Uruguay,
Cyprus, Argentina, Russia, Greece, the United States House of
Representatives, Belgium, Sweden, Lebanon, the European Parliament, the
Italian Parliament, the French Assembly, the Council of Europe
Parliamentary Assembly, the Swiss Parliament, the Canadian House of
Commons, the Slovakian Parliament, the Dutch Parliament, the Polish
Parliament, the German Bundestag, the Venezuelan Parliament, the
Lithuanian 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 135WH</b><br>Parliament and recently even bodies such as Edinburgh city council and
the legislative body of British Columbia. The Holy See recognised
genocide on 10 November 2000. They have all recognised that genocide
occurred, and I cannot see how we can fail to follow where they
lead.</p><p><a name="06060755000361"><b><a name="06060755000496">Mr.
Dismore:</b> There is another reason why we should remember
that first genocide of the last century: to be able to look to the
future. I remind my hon. Friend of what Adolf Hitler said some 30 years
after that genocide: &#147;Who remembers the Armenians now?&#148;
That was one of his justifications for what he was doing to the Jewish
community during the second world war.</p><p><a name="06060755000362"><b><a name="06060755000497">Stephen
Pound:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s words are so prescient and
important that I almost felt like pausing when I heard them. I remember
standing on the steps of Downing street with the noble Lord Avebury,
who repeated those words in the original German. As we know, when
people said to Hitler, &#147;You will never be forgiven for the
genocide of the Jews&#148;, he said, &#147;Who remembers the
Armenians
now?&#148;</p><p><a name="06060755000363">Genocide
was the new horror of the 20th century. Technology had progressed in
such a way that whole populations could be slaughtered. The 1915
Armenian and Assyrian genocide in the Ottoman empire was the first;
sadly it was not to be the last, either in the last century or this
one. Now no one seeks to deny that genocide took place.</p><p><a name="06060755000364">I hope that we can be
realistic, because only when we accept that ethnic cleansing and
genocide take place can we confront their horrors. We owe that not only
to our Armenian, Assyrian and Greek friends, or only to our Christian
friends from the former Ottoman empire, but to ourselves. How can we
seek to combat the evil of genocide when the very existence of such a
major example is
denied?</p><p><a name="06060755000365">My hon. Friend
the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) quoted Adolf Hitler. I would like
to close by quoting a contemporary of Hitler&#146;s, but a man who
walked in the light rather than the darkness. In 1929, Winston
Churchill
stated:</p><a name="06060755000386"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
1915 the Turkish Government began and ruthlessly carried out the
infamous general massacre and deportation of Armenians in Asia
Minor...There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned
and executed for political
reasons.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060755000366">Churchill was
right then, and he is right now. I look to my right hon. Friend the
Minister and to this Government and this country to play their part in
assuaging the agony of those whose relatives died so horribly by
recognising in this country the fact that genocide took place. I hope
that by such recognition in this House of Commons, in this Parliament,
ultimately we may influence the Turkish Government, because as long as
we refuse to recognise that genocide took place, they have the perfect
excuse for
denial.</p><p><a name="06060755000367"><b><a name="06060755000498">Frank
Cook (in the Chair):</b> Mr. Hoon, you have nine minutes in
which to
reply.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 136WH</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06060762000072">4.21
pm</h5><p><a name="06060762000002"><b><a name="06060762000077">The
Minister for Europe (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</b>
Thank you, Mr. Cook. It is obvious from the
passionate presentation of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North
(Stephen Pound) that he has a thorough and detailed interest in this
difficult and painful subject, and we are all grateful to him for
setting out his arguments with such clarity and, indeed, for securing
this
debate.</p><p><a name="06060762000003">This
matter has been debated in this House on many occasions, not least, as
I am sure my hon. Friend is aware, in the immediate aftermath of the
1915-16 massacres that left so many dead and forced survivors into
exile. What happened to ethnic Armenians and other smaller Christian
minorities living in the Ottoman empire, including the Assyrians, was
roundly and rightly condemned at the time. I extend the
Government&#146;s deepest sympathies to the relatives and descendants
of the victims.</p><p><a name="06060762000004">That
the events took place, and that the then rulers of what is now Turkey
should bear some degree of responsibility for encouraging, allowing or
failing to prevent them, is not a matter of dispute in this House, but
the main concern of this Government is not what we call such horrific
events but ensuring that the lessons are learned, and that
relationships are rebuilt to ensure a peaceful and secure future for
everyone living in the region. To that end, we shall continue to
encourage the Governments of Armenia and Turkey to improve co-operation
and understanding between their
countries.</p><p><a name="06060762000005">I want to
deal with my hon. Friend&#146;s call for the United Kingdom legally
to recognise the events of 1915-16 as genocide. The fact is that the
legal offence of genocide had not been named or defined at the time
when the atrocities were committed. The United Nations convention on
genocide came into force in 1948, so it was not possible at the time of
the events that we are considering legally to label the massacres as
genocide within the terms of the
convention.</p><p><a name="06060762000006">I
recognise that it is perfectly possible intellectually to try to apply
the definitions of genocide from the convention to appalling tragedies
that occurred, in this case, some 30 years before. The common practice
in law is not to apply such judgments retrospectively. It is not
possible for us properly to provide a substitute today for the
submission of evidence, cross-examination or arguments that necessarily
would have arisen in mitigation in a court of law, whether a local or
international one, had there been one with the necessary jurisdiction
and had the crime already been recognised and defined. Not least would
be the issue of who should be charged with the offence in the
circumstances. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that
the legal process that he is asking for would not necessarily be
appropriate at this
stage.</p><p><a name="06060762000007">In any event,
as I hope he will accept, historians question each other&#146;s
accounts of what took place. The debate has primarily been about the
causes of the events, those responsible for them and the extent to
which the wartime security context may have been a factor, perhaps
obscuring the motives of those who were involved. As a result, neither
this Government nor previous British Governments have judged that the
evidence is sufficiently unequivocal to persuade us that the events
could be categorised as genocide, as defined by the 1948 UN convention
on the subject.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 137WH</b><br><p><a name="06060762000008">However, I emphasise that that
in no way diminishes the scale of the terrible individual and mass
tragedies that occurred between 1915-16 and both before and after, as
my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, North and for Hendon (Mr.
Dismore) have made clear. The key now is to ensure that the full truth
about those events is brought to light and that both Armenia and Turkey
look to the future.</p><p><a name="06060762000009">In
that context, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr.
MacShane), my distinguished predecessor as Minister for Europe, raised
the need for an independent inquiry on the events of 1915-16 at a
European Union ministerial meeting with Turkey in March 2005, in an
attempt to promote a truth and reconciliation process. I share the view
that the work of establishing truth, if it is indeed to help towards
reconciliation, must be conducted as a joint exercise by the parties
directly involved. Outsiders can commend the idea to them, but they
should not try to do the work for them, as the doing of the work by the
parties themselves is an important part of the confidence-building and
reconciliation
process.</p><p><a name="06060762000010">Last year,
shortly after that idea was proposed, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan
and the leader of the main Turkish opposition party joined forces to
call for an impartial investigation by Armenian and Turkish historians
of the allegations. I understand that the Armenians felt unable to
accept the proposal at that time, but we believe the Turkish proposal
to be a welcome signal that Turkey wishes to engage with its neighbour
and re-examine the issue. My conclusion is that the idea, or some
variant of it, is not at an end, but that further developments in the
international situation will be needed before the idea can be explored
again and constructively
developed.</p><p><a name="06060762000011">Obviously,
I cannot give the House an absolute assurance that Armenia and Turkey
will undertake to move relations forward this year or even the next,
although I certainly hope that they will, but I commend to the House
the idea that the resolution of the questions raised by my hon. Friend
should be pursued through some kind of truth and reconciliation process
undertaken by the people of Armenia and Turkey. This Government will
continue to encourage the parties to embark on such a process. In the
meantime, we should resist the temptation to pre-empt its
conclusions.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 138WH</b><br>

George (St. Ives) (LD):</b> I am delighted to have secured
this important debate, given the joint announcement on 9 May by the
Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence of the proposal to
move forward with the part-privatisation, as I interpret it, of the
search and rescue helicopter service provided variously by the Maritime
and Coastguard Agency through private providers, by the Ministry of
Defence through a branch of the RAF and by the Royal Navy. In my
constituency, in which the Royal Navy air station Culdrose is based,
there is, as I am sure the Minister will understand, a significant
sensitivity about the impact that the proposal will have not only on
the base, but on those who have enjoyed the safety and security of
knowing that such an excellent search and rescue service is available.
Indeed, it is a vital service. The capability of the Ministry of
Defence both on land and at sea provides significant reassurance to
mariners and to those who have enjoyed the benefits of the search and
rescue service and whose life has been saved by
it.</p><p><a name="06060762000013">In a written
answer to questions that I asked the Minister about the future of the
771 Squadron at Culdrose, he
stated:</p><a name="06060762000063"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In
contributing to Search and Rescue (SAR) in the coastal waters of the
south west extending 200 miles out to sea, 771 Squadron of the Royal
Navy was scrambled 211 times last year and rescued 154
people.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10 May 2006; Vol. 446,
c. 293W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06060762000014">The importance of the
service is known to many, and certainly from my consultations prior to
this debate with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the National
Coastwatch Institution, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the
National Federation of Fishermen&#146;s Organisations and many other
voluntary organisations, I know that there is widespread recognition of
its significance and importance. I am sure that, when considering any
change to any service, the Minister will be quite used to the
expression&#151;I think it is American&#151;&#147;If it
ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t fix it&#148;. That phrase will
surely be ringing in his ears when he considers what changes are
appropriate to such an important service and the potentially
detrimental impact if any decision is wrong. Those are the issues on
which I seek reassurances from him
today.</p><p><a name="06060762000015">The 771
Squadron at Culdrose provides two Sea King Mk 5 aircraft, which are
primarily located on site, although sometimes the aircraft on duty can
be taken up to five hours&#146; flying time away from the base. A
back-up aircraft is therefore needed. In providing the important search
and rescue service&#151;going as far out as 200 miles off the west
coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, as mentioned in the written
answer that I quoted&#151;the squadron needs a greater capacity than
one aircraft with a back-up.</p><p><a name="06060762000016">As the Minister is also aware,
the service fulfils an important maritime anti-terrorism function, to
which he referred in his letter to me on 26 May this
year:</p><a name="06060762000064"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Additionally,
the new UK SAR-H will not undertake the counter-terrorism role
currently undertaken by 771 squadron. This is a military role, the
continued requirement for which will be assessed in due
course.&#148;</p></ul><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 139WH</b><br><p><a name="06060762000017">Both he and the Minister of State,
Department for Transport, have written to me about the new opportunity
to bring the service together, but I am concerned, as I am sure many
others are, about the possible break-up of the service and the
potential for it to be salami-sliced, instead of brought together as a
more harmonised service. If the maritime counter-terrorism role is
taken away from the search and rescue capability, that is another
service that the Ministry of Defence will need to consider how best to
provide.</p><p><a name="06060762000018">In
my area, as I believe in many others, the search and rescue service
also doubles up as the night-time air ambulance. The air ambulance in
my constituency, which is very much appreciated and is supported
largely through voluntary contributions from the local community, can
fly only during daylight hours. The service can be provided out of
hours because 771 Squadron backs it up, providing an excellent service
itself.</p><p><a name="06060762000019">The search
and rescue service also provides a medevac service. For example, my
constituents on the Isles of Scilly are 30 miles out to the sea and
cannot get to the main acute hospital at Treliske, in Truro, very
quickly. They are sometimes evacuated from the isles when there is an
emergency and that service is very much appreciated. The search and
rescue service also provides other medevac services in other situations
and a casevac service&#151;in other words, a service for casualties,
for instance in road traffic accidents. Where the air ambulance cannot
get in, the 771 Squadron search and rescue service will come in and
provide an important service.</p><p><a name="06060762000020">The search
and rescue service also provides important support in major incidents,
with its standby helicopter and its back-up helicopter. However, if
there were a major incident, more helicopters would be required than
those two. For instance, on 16 August 2004 there was catastrophically
heavy rainfall in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for
North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson), particularly in the Boscastle area. Many
people know the name of Boscastle because it has been etched on their
memories from that day, when 50 or more cars were washed away from the
village and out to sea. Many buildings were also washed away, because
of the torrential rain and flooding that hit the village. Some 91
people were saved by the helicopter services, with three helicopters
from RAF Culdrose and three from RAF Chivenor. If we simply have a
search and rescue service but we do not have the capability, training
and back-up of the military service, we will not have the capacity to
provide that level of flexibility and respond to such catastrophic
major incidents, for which we clearly need to ensure that the service
is
available.</p><p><a name="06060762000021">There
are other important dimensions to the service. The significance of the
training for military pilots, crew and divers is often overlooked.
Surely it is better for them to have real-life experience, rather than
simulation exercises. If pilots, crew and divers are to be engaged in
combat situations or combat search and rescue, it is surely far better
for them to have had the opportunity of experiencing those real-life
situations rather than&#151;I should like the Minister to clarify how
firm the Government&#146;s plans are on this&#151;finding
themselves taken away from the many civilian situations to which they
are currently scrambled.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 140WH</b><br><p><a name="06060762000022">There is also the question of
the tests necessary for the capability of future aircraft. In letter of
15 June 2005, written in answer to questions from me, the Minister
said:</p><a name="06060762000065"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;With
regard to the training concerns you raise, whilst it is true that 771
squadron currently conduct residual Sea King training for Sea Kings Mks
5/6 and 7, the planned withdrawal of these aircraft types, in the years
2014 and 2018 respectively, means by definition that the requirement
for this training will diminish and eventually disappear. That said,
whatever optimum method is ultimately identified for the provision of
future SAR coverage, this will of course encompass full delivery of the
necessary training for the aircraft types
involved.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060762000023">The
problem, however, as I indicated in a letter to which the Minister
replied on 1 June, is that all the evidence seems to suggest the
Merlins that have been brought into base to replace the Sea Kings have
neither the capability nor the flexibility to perform the search and
rescue function, despite costing &#163;104 million an airframe. The
question remains: what aircraft will be used to perform those important
functions, despite all the expense and investment going into the Merlin
project?</p><p><a name="06060762000024">The Sea Kings
have been excellent workhorses, for the Royal Navy in particular, and
they have been much appreciated at Culdrose since they were first
brought into commission in the 1960s. They are being phased out in
coming years, but the Ministry must surely consider what aircraft will
replace them before it engages in such an exercise and considers the
part privatisation of the service. How will those aircraft be provided
and can we be sure that they will be sufficiently tested and proven
capable of providing such a
service?</p><p><a name="06060762000025">I
have mentioned combat search and rescue. I am sure that the Minister
will also have reflected on the experience that civilian search and
rescue can provide for personnel who are then engaged in combat search
and rescue. My noble Friend Lord Garden tabled a written question about
what plans the Government had
for</p><a name="06060762000066"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;development of
combat search and rescue
capabilities.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060762000026">Lord
Drayson
answered:</p><a name="06060762000067"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
UK is developing a combat recovery operations capability, of which
combat search and rescue is a subset. This will be achieved through the

says:</p><a name="06060762000068"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
decision to proceed to this next stage, however, gives an opportunity
to bring together the current Search and Rescue helicopter providers
into one harmonised service under a single contract providing the

optimised training opportunities and greater harmonisation between the

repeated in a number of responses and statements from both the
Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence: that the new
service will</p><a name="06060762000069"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;continue to
use a high proportion of military aircrew alongside civilian
aircrew&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060762000031">Certain questions arise from
this type of situation. In his letter to me of 15 June 2005, the
Minister now present said that in incidents such as that at Boscastle,
which I mentioned
earlier,</p><a name="06060762000070"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the military
will always be able to be called upon to support the Civilian Emergency
Services&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060762000032">That raises
questions about how the military can provide such support after the
only airframe left in the service is the Merlin, which has shown itself
not to be capable of providing such a service.</p><p><a name="06060762000033">In relation to the
points made by the Minister of State, Department for Transport, in his
letter of 5 June, I would like to know how a more harmonised service
will be provided if the maritime and counter-terrorism service is being
taken away from the search and rescue service. We still do not know how
a service including the air ambulance, medevac, casevac and other
functions provided by 711 Squadron&#151;I can talk only about that
service, but this no doubt that applies to many other MOD-based
services&#151;that are not part of the core search and rescue
function can be said to be part of a harmonised service if they are not
included in the cost-benefit analysis of the proposal brought forward
by both
Departments.</p><p><a name="06060762000034">In
order properly to inform those who are most concerned about
this&#151;many Members from across the country will be concerned
about this&#151;both Departments must give us more information on
costs and savings, and on how they will underpin the maritime,
counter-terrorism, medical air ambulance, RTA and other roles for which
the search and rescue service currently provides
services.</p><p><a name="06060762000035">In
cases in which civilian services are provided by Bristows, such as in
the Solent, for example, how often have such services failed to respond
because of unserviceable aircrafts? What proportion of jobs have they
failed to attend for which the MOD has provided back-up? I understand
that that has happened on a number of occasions. How will the training
that I mentioned earlier be provided, especially given that it is
important that the civilian function provided by the MOD provides that
essential real-life experience for the combat search and rescue
situation? How will it perform its combat search and rescue? Which
aircraft will be used if the Sea King is coming out of commission in
total by 2018? What will be put in its place, and on the basis of what
training and experience will that combat search and rescue service be
provided? How will the Government&#151;I suppose it will have to be
done across Government&#151;deal with major incidents such as those
that I mentioned? How will they scramble those aircraft and make sure
that the service is a harmonised service of the type that the Minister
envisioned in his letter to me? What preparation and training will be
given? Which aircraft will perform those
duties?</p><p><a name="06060762000036">I am sure that
the Minister understands that the future of the 711 Squadron is close
to my heart and 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 142WH</b><br>those of my constituents. It is interesting that in his letter to me of
26 May 2006, he
says:</p><a name="06060762000071"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No
decisions have yet been taken on the future bases for this service. The
PFI process will identify any gaps and risks, and only after full
consideration of all these will decisions be
taken.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060762000037">From that, I
presume that he is saying that there is potential for the present
search and rescue services to be moved off-base in future. He says that
the military crew should be used, but there is no guarantee or surety
in his response, given that it is unclear which bases the services will
operate from and whether many, if any, of the services will be based on
MOD sites such as RNAS Culdrose. I hope that the Minister will take on
board my concerns, and appreciate that I want to engage constructively
with him on this matter. I look forward to hearing his
response.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060762000076">4.59
pm</h5><p><a name="06060762000038"><b><a name="06060762000080">The
Minister of State, Ministry of Defence(Mr. Adam
Ingram):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member
for St. Ives (Andrew George) on securing this debate and on providing
me with the chance to speak on an unquestionably important issue. From
his opening and closing comments, I know that he shares my appreciation
of the excellent search and rescue helicopter service provided by the
Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy under the Ministry of Defence, and
the Maritime and Coastguard Agency under the Department for Transport.
I hope that he accepts that it is our intention to maintain the current
high standard of service. I want to touch on how that has been
approached.</p><p><a name="06060762000039">The hon.
Gentleman correctly referred to the written ministerial statement laid
before the House on 9 May by the Minister of State, Department for
Transport, which said that the Ministry of Defence and the Department
for Transport are moving forward together to ensure that we continue to
have an excellent service. That is a very positive step and we were
able to announce it jointly.</p><p><a name="06060762000040">It may be helpful if I were to
set out the background to that recent statement. The organisation of
search and rescue in the United Kingdom is an amalgam of separate
Departments, the emergency services and other organisations, all of
which play a vital part. The Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and
Coastguard Agency together provide a 24-hour military and civil search
and rescue helicopter service.</p><p><a name="06060762000041">We cover the
United Kingdom search and rescue region from 12 bases around the United
Kingdom. Currently, the service is provided by the RAF from six
bases&#151;at Boulmer, Chivenor, Leconfield, Lossiemouth, Valley and
Wattisham&#151;and by the Royal Navy from two bases, which are at
Culdrose and Prestwick, using Sea King helicopters. The Maritime and
Coastguard Agency service is provided from its four bases, which are at
Lee-on-Solent, Portland, Stornoway and Sumburgh, through a contractor,
as it has been for many years. That is re-competed for regularly:
approximately every five years.</p><p><a name="06060762000042">Over the next decade, the
Ministry of Defence search and rescue Sea Kings, which, as the hon.
Gentleman said, have given us good service since the 1970s, will come
to the end of their useful life. I sense that he wanted them to
continue in some shape or form, but they will come to the end of their
useful life. The 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 143WH</b><br>Maritime and Coastguard Agency service contract will also come up for
renewal in 2012. It was therefore essential for us to decide the best
way to ensure the continuation of that important service well into the
future and to work together even more closely. We needed to ensure that
the best possible service was delivered, while ensuring that it
demonstrated value for money. That was the overriding
priority.</p><p><a name="06060762000043">The hon.
Gentleman made the point that if it ain&#146;t broke, don&#146;t
fix it. As the Sea Kings are going out of service, they will not be
available, so we need to replace them. Therefore, it is right, at this
point, to consider what will replace them and what the replacement will
do. He began to allude to that.</p><p><a name="06060762000044">As a result of that, a joint
Ministry of Defence and Maritime and Coastguard Agency procurement team
was set up under an inter-departmental steering group to assess
options. Over the past three years, a rigorous joint assessment has
been carried out. It concluded that we should move to a harmonised
service, and that a service under the private finance initiative has
the best potential to deliver the capability we need at maximum value
for money.</p><p><a name="06060762000045">The
decision is very much in line with the plan outlined in the defence
industrial strategy, which states that the majority of search and
rescue helicopters in the UK currently are provided by the RAF and the
Royal Navy. The remainder are provided by civilian helicopters under
contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It is planned to
replace that capability with a single contract that retains a
proportion of military aircrews to enable operational readiness of
deployed search and rescue crews in the middle of the next decade. I
understood that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party supported the DIS. I
suggest that he perhaps reads what we set out and his party supported
in the construct of that document.</p><p><a name="06060762000046">The next stage is what do we do
now that we have set out that definition, and we are moving forward to
the joint search and rescue helicopter project as a competition under
the private finance initiative. The decision to proceed to that next
stage provides the opportunity to bring together the current search and
rescue helicopter provision.</p><p><a name="06060762000047">We intend to
provide a service that is at least as effective as the current one. We
also anticipate additional benefits from the flexibility that
harmonisation brings, from the improved capability and sustainability
that modern aircraft and technology will deliver, and from military and
civilian aircrew being trained to the same high standard. We believe
that that will enhance the service and provide an excellent service
that offers value for money for the
taxpayer.</p><p><a name="06060762000048"><b><a name="06060762000081">Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reassuring
comments. Will he address the question of which aircraft he believes
will perform this function? Will he reassure me that the additional
roles that Ministry of Defence search and rescue services provide with
regard to the air ambulance and so on will be contained in the contract
proposed?</p><p><a name="06060762000049"><b><a name="06060762000082">Mr.
Ingram:</b> I was moving on to the process. Hopefully, the
hon. Gentleman understands that it will 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 144WH</b><br>be a thorough process. We do not enter such a process by being
prescriptive. We must see what is out there and what the options are.
We must test the range of opportunities that exist. I shall explain how
that is approached, and hopefully that will deal with some, if not all,
of his points.</p><p><a name="06060762000050">The
competition is being carried out in accordance with the European Union
procurement regulations and was launched through a notice in the
European Union journal on 12 May. It will benefit from the new European
Union competitive dialogue procedure, which has been designed to deal
with PFI projects. The process, in partnership with industry, promotes
full evaluation of customer requirements and industry responses prior
to selecting a preferred bidder. We will use it to establish a robust
contract with industry and to ensure that we deliver an excellent
service for the taxpayer. The first step will be to ensure that
companies wishing to take part in the competition have the appropriate
capability. That will be done by thorough assessment of their
pre-qualification questionnaires later this year.</p><p><a name="06060762000051">The hon. Gentleman asked me
which aircraft will be involved and how things will be delivered. Is he
therefore asking me not to go through a procurement process, and not to
have rigorous examination and to be definitive before we see what the
market has available and how things should be delivered? Given his
strong European credentials, there seems to be a contradiction. We
should ensure best value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p><a name="06060762000052">There has been some speculation
about the implications of that decision for the standard of service. I
shall provide reassurance on the issue and bring out two key points.
First, the Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency
will continue jointly to manage and task the service. In particular,
the search and rescue tasking, which is currently carried out by the
aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre at Kinloss and the appropriate
maritime rescue co-ordination centres, will continue to be jointly
managed.</p><p><a name="06060762000053">Secondly, the
principle that the service will be no less effective than the current
one will underpin the detailed requirement specification against which
the competition will be conducted and performance will be measured. Key
performance indicators will be set to ensure that all aspects of the
service are met.</p><p><a name="06060762000054">As
with the current service, military crews will play a key part in the
future delivery of the search and rescue helicopter service. This is
not, as some have said, privatisation. People should not set hares
running, because there is no evidence for the assertion. People should
not raise it, because what has been said will not happen at the end of
the process. We will ensure that a high proportion of aircrew from the
RAF and Royal Navy will continue to form part of the future service. We
will continue to develop and maintain those valuable search and rescue
skills in the military. That is in line with current policy, which
seeks to transfer search and rescue skills to our deployable military
helicopter fleets. There is an essential defence role in all that we
do, and we have no intention of moving away from that, because we need
the skill capability for all the reasons mentioned by the hon.
Gentleman, and for some others.</p><br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 145WH</b><br><p><a name="06060762000055">I shall address three other
areas where I am aware that there has been considerable interest: the
specific aircraft, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned; basing
arrangements; and contract duration for the future service. The very
nature of a service provision competition places the incentive on
industry to propose the optimum means of delivering the service. That
will include consideration of many issues, such as basing, operational
capability, safety and the ability of airframes and crew to cover
simultaneous incidents. The specific parameters will be established
through the competition, and all aircraft proposed by industry will be
rigorously assessed to ensure that they are capable of delivering the
level of service we require. Only once that process is completed will
any decisions be made.</p><p><a name="06060762000057">The hon. Gentleman mentioned
Merlin helicopters. He is right in saying that although those based at
Culdrose are not designed for search and rescue purposes, they are used
by other nations in a search and rescue role. It is for providers to
decide whether they want an adapted airframe for that purpose. The hon.
Gentleman seems to be writing off the Merlin, but that is not desirable
given the importance of the airframe, so let us see whether it can be
adapted for that use and whether it can meet our rigorous testing,
against which it would be
measured.</p><p><a name="06060762000058">Clearly, the
hon. Gentleman has a particular interest in the Royal Navy air station
at Culdrose. The future use of Culdrose as a search and rescue base
will be fully assessed during the competitive phase. He set out various
reasons why it should be retained and I assure him that all those
factors will be taken into account. We are not setting out to close
stations; we want to see how best we can continue to deliver where
there is demand.</p><p><a name="06060762000059">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the maritime and counter-terrorism role of 771
Squadron, which will be 
<br><notus-date day="7" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>7 Jun 2006 : Column 146WH</b><br>unaffected by the future helicopter search and rescue plans. The search
and rescue role of the squadron, which is based at RNAS Culdrose, will
be transferred to an alternative, equally capable military unit in due
course and where it is best placed. I am sure that he recognises that.
The squadron needs to remain at Culdrose because its function is
UK-wide, so let us see where it is
required.</p><p><a name="06060762000060">Another
issue that must be addressed is the duration of the contract, which
will be established following dialogue with industry during the
competition phase. The duration must provide a solid assurance of the
future search and rescue service and is likely to relate to the
potential lifespan of the new aircraft. It is anticipated that that
will result in a duration of between 20 and 30 years, so when a
determination has been made it will be for two or three decades, which
is significant. It will depend on the airframes and other component
parts selected. None of that has been fixed and will be subject to full
and proper
evaluation.</p><p><a name="06060762000061">Our plans
for the future are of course relevant to the wider search and rescue
community. There is no question about that and we shall continue to
keep the UK search and rescue strategic committee and its operators
group informed. They are a key aspect of delivery and monitoring
because they bring together Departments, emergency services, charities
and voluntary organisations that contribute to search and rescue in the
United Kingdom. The wider public will be able to keep abreast of
progress through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency&#146;s website.
The process will be integrated. As each stage is reached, it will be
defined and set
out&#151;</p><p><a name="06060762000062"><i>It
