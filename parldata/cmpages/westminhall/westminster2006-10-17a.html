Mark Lancaster (North-East Milton Keynes) (Con):</b> It is a
pleasure to be under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor. I thank
the Secretary of State for being present. I understand that he has had
to change his plans and I am very grateful to him for
that.</p><p><a name="06101743000011">I should
start by saying that my personal experiences in Afghanistan pale into
insignificance when compared with some of those that our troops in
Helmand have suffered. I have certainly had my fair share of being
rocketed and bombed by the Taliban, but that is nothing compared with
what our troops have been going through, and it is only right that I
put on record my deep appreciation of our armed forces serving in
Afghanistan and, in particular, of 16th Air Assault Brigade.</p><p><a name="06101743000012">I can
pinpoint the exact moment when I realised that British troops would be
serving in Afghanistan for a very long time. It was 09.32 on 8
September&#151;a moment after I felt the shock wave pass through my
body from probably the largest car bomb there had ever been in Kabul.
The shock wave was not particularly shocking&#151;I got used to the
experience as a bomb disposal officer&#151;but I shall never forget
the sounds of agony and the smell of death that followed.</p><p><a name="06101743000013">If there is
one message that I want to get across to hon. Members today, it is
simply this: if we are to achieve the strong and stable society that
the Government want to achieve in Afghanistan, we will be there for a
very long time&#151;perhaps 15 or 20 years. If we manage to raise
Afghanistan to the level of a third-world country in that time, we
could perhaps pat ourselves on the back. None the less, that is the
task that faces us.</p><p><a name="06101743000014">In my role as a Royal Engineers
officer, I was charged with delivering in a small way the
reconstruction and development of Afghanistan and I travelled to the
four corners of the country&#151;to Kandahar and Helmand in the
south, Herat in the west, Mazar-e-Sharif and Faizabad in the north, and
Kabul and Bagram in the east. While much of the media focus is on the
war-fighting in Helmand, we are making progress elsewhere in the
country. In the north and the west, where the situation is much more
benign, some reconstruction and development is taking place, but
progress is painfully slow.</p><p><a name="06101743000015">However, we must give credit
where credit is due. There has been some progress in Government
thinking since the disastrous days of planning the Iraq war. The three
Ds&#151;defence, development and diplomacy&#151;now form the
bedrock of the strategy for the eventual planned withdrawal from
Afghanistan. The theory behind the three Ds, at least, is rather like
that behind the three strands of a rope: when they are applied
concurrently, their effect is far greater than when they

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 184WH</b><br>are applied on their own, and they are certainly far more effective than
when they are applied sequentially, as they used to be. The question,
however, is whether that new approach is working in Afghanistan. Having
spent nearly eight weeks travelling the length and breadth of the
country trying to deliver reconstruction and development, I would have
to say yes, but as I said, progress is painfully slow.</p><p><a name="06101743000016">I imagine that the Secretary of
State will outline Afghanistan&#146;s commitment to the millennium
development goals, although, unfortunately, we are currently
implementing only four of the eight plus one goals to which Afghanistan
has signed up. He will perhaps also outline what has happened since the
Afghan compact was agreed in London earlier this year and how we are
trying to implement the compact via the interim Afghan national
development strategy. However, I am here to tell him that the theory in
Kabul is one thing&#151;the reality on the ground in the provinces is
entirely different.</p><p><a name="06101743000017">Far from the capital, Kabul,
and the influence of the fragile central Government, in provinces such
as Helmand and Kandahar, the strategy is, in theory, being delivered
through provincial development committees&#151;civilian Afghan
committees made up of locally appointed provincial leaders. As a rule,
however, those organisations simply do not meet, and the result is that
there is little, if any, genuine dialogue between local people and
coalition forces. In practice, what little reconstruction there is is
delivered not via the local government, but via the military, through
provincial reconstruction teams, or PRTs. With few
exceptions&#151;Nimruz, which is sandwiched between Helmand and Iran
is one such exception, and Daykundi, just to the north of Helmand, is
another&#151;most provinces have a PRT. Those organisations are, in
effect, delivering central Government influence to the far-flung
corners of the country. Having visited several of those areas, it
struck me that despite the politically comforting name, the fact
remains that PRTs are predominately military units designed to provide
security and that the diplomatic and development elements appear almost
as bolt-ons or
afterthoughts.</p><p><a name="06101743000018">Earlier
this summer, I visited the UK-run PRT at Lashkar Gar in Helmand
province with the Select Committee on Defence. Then, as now, it
appeared that little if any development activity was going on because
of the fighting&#151;something that the British Government have
quietly recognised with the recent deployment of 28th Engineer Regiment
in an effort to fill the development
gap.</p><p><a name="06101743000019">In recent weeks,
much has been made of the lack activity by the Department for
International Development in Helmand&#151;even the whereabouts of the
DFID representative seem to be a mystery. It is clear that when
representatives have been present in the province they have rarely
wandered far from camp. If they had done so, they would have
discovered, just 10 minutes away from the PRT, a refugee camp full of
starving children who appeared to be gaining little, if any, benefit
from our presence in the region. What better recruiting grounds could
the Taliban want? Why are we failing to deliver food and basic medical
supplies&#151;basic hearts-and-minds stuff&#151;to those people?
Can the Secretary of State at least reassure me that poverty
eradication is a priority in Helmand?</p><br>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 185WH</b><br><p><a name="06101743000020">Another area
of controversy&#151;notionally, at least, the British are taking a
lead on this&#151;is the counter-narcotics strategy, but there has
been little if any progress in that area too. Opium cultivation rose by
59 per cent. in Afghanistan in 2006. Afghan farmers grow opium not
because they want to, but because they need to; it is one of the few
crops from which they can make any money. Many Afghan farmers would be
open to growing alternative crops if they thought that that was
sustainable. Among the few things that are sustainable in the long term
are vineyards and orchards, but they take seven to 10 years to
establish and in the main support is available for only one or two
years. Subsistence farmers simply cannot take the risk of converting to
vineyards and orchards unless they have a long-term guarantee of
support.</p><p><a name="06101743000021">One of the
principal problems with the PRTs has been their leadership. In theory
at least there should be a triumvirate structure, with each discipline
head having an equal say. In practice, the military has led in all
areas, with mixed results. In the south, where fighting dominates, the
military lead has been natural, and it has been broadly accepted as a
practical necessity, although it causes some resentment among other
partners. The problems really start when the requirement for a military
lead diminishes, as in the relatively benign northern and western
regions. While attending a PRT conference in Herat, I witnessed two
Spanish delegates from the same PRT almost coming to blows over who
supported whom.</p><p><a name="06101743000022">Even the name
&#147;provincial reconstruction team&#148; has become
controversial. At the same conference, I heard representatives from
NGOs and civilian organisations argue that only they could deliver
reconstruction and that the best the military could do was deliver
stability. On that basis, &#147;provincial stability team&#148;
would be a far better name. In that respect, it is interesting that the
first task of the 28th Engineer Regiment, which has been sent to
Helmand to deliver reconstruction, is the completion of permanent
vehicle checkpoints. That work is vital to providing stability, but it
can hardly be classified as reconstruction. What is in a name? I guess
that the problem is political and that &#147;reconstruction&#148;
sounds so much more progressive and acceptable than
&#147;stability&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101743000023">To be fair, some PRTs are
achieving success. Shortly before I came back from Afghanistan I went
to Faizabad to witness the opening of a new runway, which the PRT there
had built with the help of Slovakian engineers. That runway is vital,
because for the first time there is a link between Kabul and Faizabad,
and that will help the economy. Local leaders were delighted that that
work had been delivered. On my way back I flew via Mazar-e-Sharif,
accompanied by the very first PRT commander there. He told me how, only
three years before, one could not even land there during the daytime
without being shot at. Now the town has quite a flourishing economy. So
some progress is being made.</p><p><a name="06101743000024">Frankly,
though, the concept of reconstruction in Afghanistan is optimistic,
because it implies that there are institutions and infrastructure to
reconstruct. Some Government ministries, such as the Ministry of Rural
Rehabilitation and Development, are progressing fast and have offices
in some provinces, but others have little, if any, capacity. After
decades of war, the professional

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 186WH</b><br>class simply does not exist. Almost all of that class are ex-patriots
who have returned to the country, and that in itself is causing a
conflict with those who stayed behind to fight.</p><p><a name="06101743000025">Coalition forces are also
learning fast that it is all very well building schools but little will
be achieved without the teachers to put in them, such is the impact of
a local lack of co-ordination between international bodies, each
following its own agenda in splendid isolation. However, some progress
is being made and it would be wrong of me not to highlight the good
work of Colonel Pat Fryer in building the Afghan country stability
picture. We now have a digital image of every reconstruction project
and piece of infrastructure in Afghanistan, which will prove to be a
marvellous tool in future years.</p><p><a name="06101743000026">Genuine
efforts are being made at provincial level to build capacity in local
government, but that is proving to be a painfully slow process. I
recall a member of the PRT based in Ghor province telling me that he
struggles even to get the provincial council to meet. After a chaotic
start, when some PRTs, NGOs and international organisations operated
with little, if any, consultation with local people&#151;for example,
the magnificent new women&#146;s centre in Qalat city remains empty
because local men refuse to allow their wives to go to it&#151;steps
are now being taken to deliver provincial development plans, listing
regional development priorities drawn up not by coalition forces but by
local people. However, where they exist, they remain on the whole
little more than laundry lists.</p><p><a name="06101743000027">Rightly there
is a determination that all development should, where possible, have an
Afghan face to it, thereby demonstrating to the local population that
there are benefits to supporting the far away central Government. The
problem is that Afghan face equals Afghan pace, and very little gets
done quickly. All too often, military commanders, frustrated at the
concept of Afghan face, Afghan pace, use the military chain of command
instead. Although that delivers much quicker results, it does little to
build capacity in the provinces.</p><p><a name="06101743000028">Perhaps the
most striking thing is that even now the debate about how best to
deliver development continues. Let us consider the contrasting
approaches of the Department for International Development and its US
equivalent, the United States Agency for International Development.
USAID tends to use quick-impact projects, spending large amounts of
money in the provinces to give its local military commanders some
tactical effect. For example, in Kandahar, lots of wells have been
built. A local military commander will turn up and a well will be dug.
Local people can see some benefit of the military commander, but there
has been little strategic thought. I talked to representatives of one
of the NGOs that still operates in Helmand and discovered that so many
wells have been dug in parts of the province that some of the ancient
karez&#151;the water channels which Afghans have used for centuries
to bring water off the mountains&#151;have run dry. The water table
has been lowered by well digging.</p><p><a name="06101743000029">DFID puts less emphasis on
quick-impact projects and tends to deliver a longer-term strategic
effect, trying to build capacity in the provinces. The problem is that
we are not seeing much early tactical effect, so

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 187WH</b><br>what is the answer? Like most things in life, the answer is probably to
try to find a balance between the two approaches.</p><p><a name="06101743000030">I attended a
reconstruction conference in Kandahar in early September, which
coincided with Operation Medusa, NATO&#146;s largest land offensive
for many years. There is something odd about discussing reconstruction
and development when 200 yd away the sound of outgoing artillery might
be accompanying the discussion. At the conference, one PRT
commander&#151;not a Briton, I hasten to add&#151; confessed that
he felt that the only reason why he was building so many schools and
clinics was to please politicians back home, and that ultimately
building four walls and a roof has little long-term effect unless we
manage to get people in to run things. If we do not do that, such
places will simply end up as homes for the Taliban.</p><p><a name="06101743000031">Both the
Afghan Government and the international community are growing
increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress. The problem is that
reconstruction and development are simply not possible without
stability. The latest plan is to try to deliver stability by
introducing four so-called Afghan development zones, predominantly in
the south. Effectively, they are merely an attempt to reorganise the
troops that we have in theatre into small lozenges to deliver
stability. It might well work and it is a good plan, but we are simply
redistributing forces that we already have in Afghanistan. A cynic
would say that the whole of Afghanistan should be an ADZ and that the
latest plan simply recognises that we do not have the troops in theatre
to deliver what we need.</p><p><a name="06101743000032">I am sorry if
I paint a grim picture, but it is an honest assessment to colleagues of
what I have experienced in Afghanistan during the past eight weeks. I
believe that we are making progress, but as I have said on several
occasions, it is painfully slow. The Government have called for a
public debate on our role in Afghanistan. If we are to have that
debate, it must be with a degree of political honesty, and if we are to
achieve our aims, we will be in that country for a very long time to
come.</p><p><a name="06101743000033"><b><a name="61017h0001.htm_spnew362"><a name="06101743000465">Several

had a debate on this subject in February during which that was
forecast. Another military gentleman, Captain Leo Docherty of the Scots
Guards, resigned from the Army last month in some despair at a
situation that he described as &#147;barking mad&#148;. He
described how the military achieved a victory in the town of Sangin and
pointed out that that was when some development should have gone in. He
said:</p><a name="61017h0001.htmbrev_135"><a name="06101743000420"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
military is just one side of the triangle...Where were the
Department for International Development and the Foreign Office?...The
window was briefly open for our message to be spread, for the civilian
population to be informed of our
intent.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000037">In
fact, nothing happened and the Taliban regrouped and attacked a few
days later and there were six British casualties as a result.</p><p><a name="06101743000038">I would have
thought that this morning I would have heard a cry of some despair from
the military in Afghanistan who have been given several impossible
tasks. In the past 12 months in the Helmand province operation they
have been told that their task was to eliminate poppies and that their
task was not to eliminate poppies. They were told that their job was to
storm the Taliban strongholds and they have subsequently been told that
their task is not to do that. They were firmly told that their job was
one of reconstruction, but they are now told that their job is not to
do any reconstruction. They were told in a famous saying, which cannot
be unsaid, that there was a hope that they could go into Helmand
province without firing a &#147;single shot&#148; and of course
they have been ordered to fire tens of thousands of shots with the
result that many hundreds of Taliban and other Afghans have been
killed.</p><p><a name="06101743000039">We know that
this battle cannot be won using military power alone; hearts and minds
must be won. That is not done by using bombs and bullets, as the
Americans have been trying to do in their &#147;Operation Enduring
Stupidity&#148;, which consists mainly of aggressive search and
destroy missions, usually from the air, in which many people, both
innocent and guilty, are killed. That is entirely
counter-productive.</p><p><a name="06101743000040">Hearts and
minds are not won by cheating the Afghan farmers. We paid out
&#163;21 million of British taxpayers&#146; money in compensation.
That represents just a small part of what we have spent. The total bill
for the eradication of poppies will be around &#163;240 million. The
&#163;21 million was sent to the corrupt Karzai Government to
compensate farmers and some of them received cheques for &#163;380,
but all the cheques bounced and there has been an energetic campaign to
find out where that money went. The farmers are going through the
courts to establish their claim for compensation. None of the money got
through to them and perhaps the Minister will tell us this morning
where that &#163;21 million went.</p><p><a name="06101743000041">We are
dealing with a culture and a country that for two centuries at least
has been run by endemically corrupt warlords. We went there as the
Feringhi&#151;that is the name they use for us now&#151;and lost
three wars. The Russians went there and I remember a member of the
Russian Duma telling me with contempt, &#147;You have invaded
Afghanistan. We did the same. It took us six days to conquer
Afghanistan, but we were there for 10 years.&#148; They had
an army of 120,000&#151;not the 5,000 that we have or the 30,000 that
NATO has&#151;but they left in ignominy and 15,000 of their soldiers
were killed.</p><br>

brink of either going forward and rethinking our operation or losing
everything. Unless we have attainable objectives to consolidate the
gains that have been made around Kabul in education by recasting the
operation in the Helmand province, we may leave Afghanistan with the
same ignominy with which the French left Vietnam after Dien Bien Phu,
the Americans left Vietnam and the Russians left Afghanistan. We have
forgotten the nature of guerrilla warfare.</p><p><a name="06101743000043">There were vivid accounts of
French soldiers standing in serried ranks with epaulets and ceremonial
swords shining when they surrendered. They were the pride of the French
army, but they surrendered to a rabble that came out of the bush, many
of them barefooted with home-made weapons. The most high-tech equipment
they had were bicycles. That guerrilla army beat the French
army.</p><p><a name="06101743000044">Unless we
understand the hearts-and-minds argument and see the extent to which we
are losing the support of the Afghanistan people, we shall enter a
cauldron of grievous suffering and death. It is no exaggeration to say
that we are following the same path with the same delusions as the
Americans followed in Vietnam. We should reject the calls for
escalation because, if we do not, we shall be in the same situation as
in the past when, because of the belief in politicians here, the
military are there, in Afghanistan. Great anger is being expressed on
websites, and Ministers and others would do well to listen to what
serving soldiers are
saying.</p><p><a name="06101743000045">There is an
alternative for Afghan farmers. It is not to destroy the poppy crop. We
know about the abject futility of trying to reduce the poppy crop. We
know, as Lord Birt said in his strategy paper, that the supply side of
the drugs trade cannot be destroyed. In Afghanistan, we are trying to
do in five years what America has failed to do in Colombia in 20 years.
Colombia is in a state of bloody chaos with three armies, two of them
funded entirely by drugs. Destroying the poppy crop would make no
difference whatever to the supply of drugs because, for every reduction
in Colombia, more drugs were produced in Peru and Bolivia. Exactly the
same would happen if we reduced the crop in Afghanistan. It would be
grown in Myanmar, Laos and surrounding countries. There is no chance of
preventing that and of imposing on Afghanistan a Swedish-style
democracy or of ensuring that there will never be a place for Osama bin
Laden to hide in Afghanistan, north Pakistan or elsewhere. Despite the
might, subtlety, bribery and wealth of the American army, it has not
yet found him. Nothing we can do by changing the system would ensure
that there is no place for Osama bin Laden to hide. These are our
unachievable
objectives.</p><p><a name="06101743000046">Our
soldiers are right to ask what on earth the politicians are doing and
what the mission is. It was said of the charge of the Light Brigade
that those involved had no chance of objecting to what was an act of
military stupidity. A latter-day Tennyson writing the story of Helmand
might say, &#147;Blair to the right of them, Bush to the left of
them, Holler&#146;d and thunder&#146;d. Their&#146;s not to
reason why, Their&#146;s but to do and die: Into the valley of Death,
Into the mouth of Helmand drove the
5,000.&#148;</p><br>

wondering how much more could have been achieved had the 230,000 allied
forces been moved to Afghanistan instead of going to Iraq in 2002. Five
years after we first went into Afghanistan, we have only just gone into
the Helmand province, which is probably the heart of where the most
focus is required.</p><p><a name="06101743000051">I
praise 16th Air Assault Brigade, which has made a fantastic effort
there, but there is an issue of strategy. As a military person, I
question why 16th Air Assault Brigade was sent there alone. We have
huge and valuable experience of peacekeeping and war-fighting
operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and so on, yet we sent out a light
infantry unit for a task that required more armour, more firepower and
more mobility. I encourage the Secretary of State to do what he can to
influence the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence
to ensure that our troops are properly armoured. That includes sending
out one of the seven remaining Warrior battalions in this country that
are not on deployment. I do not believe that Snatch Land Rovers provide
the necessary protection, and the matter needs to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="06101743000052">The debate
focuses on reconstruction. I fully agree with the comments of my hon.
Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes. My experience of the
development teams was that they are in a competitive game. USAID has a
different strategy from DFID. Embassies have different forms of income
coming through and different ideas of where the money should be spent.
A myriad of agencies are competing against each other for contracts and
work. I have said before and I repeat that there needs to be a
UN-mandated co-ordinator for all reconstruction activities. Otherwise
there will be continued competition&#151;not necessarily between
agencies but between what the military are doing on one hand and
reconstruction efforts on the
other.</p><p><a name="06101743000053">South
of Kandahar I saw a school that had been rebuilt with international
money and that was fantastic.

crop-eradication programme around the school which removed the
livelihood of the community, so everyone left and there is now an empty
school building south of Kandahar which no one is
using.</p><p><a name="06101743000054">The hon. Member
for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) touched on the biggest issue about which
we are in complete denial: the poppy crop. We try to distinguish the
military front from reconstruction and from poppy growth, but the three
are intertwined, and we must come to terms with that, otherwise our
policy has no long-term future. Our policy on poppy crops is failing.
We have a policy of eradication and replacement, and we cannot separate
it from long-term factors even if we intend to remove the terrorism
link with Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06101743000055">The United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime opium survey shows that last year was
the largest opium crop ever. It represented a 59 per cent. increase on
the previous year&#146;s crop, which was also the largest crop up to
that point. The amount of crop exported has risen from 4,100 tonnes to
6,100 tonnes, which means that Afghanistan produces 92 per cent. of the
world&#146;s opium. Helmand province has increased its capacity by
162 per cent. right under our noses. That is where we are supposed to
operate. To put it another way, Helmand province produces just under
half the world&#146;s opium.</p><p><a name="06101743000056">Britain is
responsible under the list of G8 tasks for counter-narcotics and the
counter-narcotics programme. We are well placed to lead. Last year, the
United States spent more than $780 million, the UK about $100 million
and the EU about $150 million on poppy eradication and replacement
programmes, but let us face facts: the money was wasted. Crops have
increased, and we must find another strategy to deal with the
problem.</p><p><a name="06101743000057">I have
mentioned to hon. Members before that a similar story took place in
Turkey in 1969, when Turkey was identified as the main source of the
heroin that was entering the United States. President Nixon declared a
war on drugs, and he was about to impose military and economic
sanctions on Turkey. There were four years of hostility between the two
countries as they tried to work out how to deal with the huge amounts
of heroin entering the United States from Turkey. Eventually, after
trying to make the crop illegal, Turkey asked the UN, &#147;Can we
legalise it? Can we have a poppy programme in which poppies are grown
under licence and distributed to the international community? There it
will be controlled, it will not leak out, and it will be turned not
into heroin, but morphine and codeine&#151;other products of which
there is a world shortage.&#148;</p><p><a name="06101743000058">That was back
in 1969 and the 1970s. We do not hear of an opium or heroin problem
from Turkey anymore. Indeed, other countries throughout the world grow
poppies under licence. There is a massive threat and challenge in
Afghanistan, however. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that about
90 per cent. of the heroin on British streets comes from Afghanistan.
Yet, we are in denial; we believe that we can somehow eliminate the
crop. The poppies play into the hands of the terrorists. The saddest
fact is that when we try to eliminate those crops we alienate the very
people whose hearts and minds we are trying to win over. That is
fundamental.</p><p><a name="06101743000059">In
refugee camps around Lashkagar, there are 10,000 to 15,000 people, and

freely and recruit people from the refugee camps. So, when we talk
about the enemy, the Taliban, we must be specific, because
&#147;Talibanisation&#148; is the process whereby such people are
recruited. The recruits are not Taliban sympathisers in the sense that
they have a cause; they just want to put bread on their tables, feed
their families and get on.</p><p><a name="06101743000060">The recruits see that the
international community has been in their country for five years, and
that their communities have been ruined by the destruction of the crops
that have kept them going. It is understandable why when someone from
the Taliban gives them a rocket-propelled grenade and says,
&#147;Take a pop at a Land Rover or an American vehicle, and we will
give you two months&#146; salary in exchange&#148; they would be
happy to do so. We are losing the battle for hearts and minds because
of that.</p><p><a name="06101743000061">Organisations in Afghanistan
such as the Senlis council and others would be keen to run a pilot
scheme. Let us test the water. I am not saying that it would work. I
really do not know whether it would, but why not give it a try? We have
discussed how long it takes to grow a peach tree, pomegranates and so
on, so let us consider a five-year programme to wean farmers off poppy
cultivation. Each year they could give their poppies to a UN-licensed
scheme, and at the same time part of their crop could be replaced with
other produce. We could tax it, so the Afghan nation benefited, too.
Most importantly, however, we would deny the terrorists the chance to
benefit from the money, which is exactly what happens now.</p><p><a name="06101743000062">My hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Milton Keynes discussed the long term. We might be in
Afghanistan for 15 years, and it might be worth looking at the map of
Afghanistan again. With its Pashtuns, Tajiks and Baluchis, we might ask
whether the territorial line that encircles the country is ideal.
Alternatively, we might ask the Baluchis, &#147;Were you to recreate
your own country, where would it be?&#148; I think their answer would
be that they would take a nice chunk of Pakistan that Pakistan does not
like to talk about, and into which it does not send anybody in a
uniform. We might consider that idea in the long term if we asked those
people what they wanted to do. They are loyal not to Kandahar, Kabul or
President Karzai, but to their families and their ethnic grouping.
Until we understand that, we will never win the battles that we are
fighting in Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06101743000063"><b><a name="61017h0001.htm_spnew366"><a name="06101743000469">David

any recent first-hand experience of Afghanistan, because it is more
than 30 years since I travelled there. I recall a time before the earth
changed places with the sky, when King Zahir Shah was in his palace,
the Buddhas were in their place in Bamiyan, the markets in Kandahar and
Kabul were overflowing with fresh produce and it was possible for any
foreigner to travel almost anywhere on public transport&#151;albeit
on aged German buses that still had their German destinations, such as
Munich railway station, on the front.</p><p><a name="06101743000066">Nevertheless, I have picked up
from people with recent experience of Afghanistan that things are not
going well. That is the flavour of the debate. In particular, they are
not going well in the south of the country, where our troops appear to
be besieged in their bases, venturing out only in heavily armed convoys
and patrols. As hon. Members have said, there is no meaningful contact
with the locals, and we are in danger of losing the south. If we do, it
will mark the beginning of a new Taliban state that may spread north
whether we like it or not.</p><p><a name="06101743000067">Local people
are becoming increasingly desperate. They are squeezed between the
Taliban and the international community. Incidentally, they believe
that all the international community, whether Canadians or British, are
Americans. They refer to them as Americans. Among refugee camps, which
are within 10 minutes of our military bases, as hon. Members have
remarked, there is hunger. Among children, there is starvation, and
there is little or no sign of aid.</p><p><a name="06101743000068">The pursuit of the opium
eradication policy without any viable alternative strategy merely
drives people into the hands of the Taliban. We appear to be destroying
the crops only of those people who cannot afford to pay bribes not to
have them destroyed. They are the smaller and more vulnerable farmers.
For the larger farmers, who can pay the bribes, it is business as
usual. Anybody who sees the new houses of police chiefs being built in
the area will see where some of those bribes have gone. As hon. Members
have remarked, there is little or no development activity. The aid
agencies, including DFID, have more or less withdrawn from the south,
and foreigners are increasingly reluctant to venture out of their
fortified compounds, for reasons that I understand perfectly. It is not
for me, sitting here in the comfort of the United Kingdom, to lecture
the people on the ground in Afghanistan on what they should do.
However, we have not the slightest hope of winning hearts and minds in
such a situation. As others have said, the time has come to contemplate
alternatives, unless we believe&#151;I do not know anybody who
does&#151;that things are going so well that we can afford to ignore
those who suggest alternatives. New thinking is required.</p><p><a name="06101743000069">The hon.
Member for Bournemouth, East, mentioned the Senlis Council, which has
people on the ground in Afghanistan and appears to venture out where
most foreigners fear to tread, including into Lashkagar. It recently
published a report assessing the first five years of the international
presence in Afghanistan, entitled &#147;Afghanistan Five Years
Later&#151;The Return of the Taliban&#148;. I have sent a copy to
the Secretary of State, although he may not yet have received it as he
has been away. I have also sent copies to the Secretary of State for

covered by a personal note. I hope that somebody will examine the
report, because it tells a somewhat different story to the one that
Ministers appear to believe. Over the months in which I have tried to
interest Ministers in the work of the Senlis Council, it has depressed
me that it has been so difficult to engage their attention. That is
particularly true, I am sorry to say, of those in my old Department,
the Foreign Office, and in the Ministry of Defence. I have had more
luck with DFID, as one might expect, and I took some people from the
Senlis Council to meet the Under-Secretary of State for International
Development.</p><p><a name="06101743000070">Any
alternative strategy&#151;the report presents the one proposed by the
Senlis Council&#151;must involve local people. I wish to impress upon
Ministers that they should at least consider the proposal mentioned by
the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East, for opium to be grown under
licence for the international medical market, although I know that
there are practical difficulties. The alternative is more of the chaos
that already exists in Afghanistan and is writ large in Colombia, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn), said. We are
afraid to discuss the matter because the Americans do not approve, but
we must push it up the agenda. Pilot projects must obviously take place
before the scheme can be considered viable, and there are practical
difficulties, but they are not all that large compared with those of
carrying on down the present road. The hon. Member for Bournemouth,
East, mentioned the experience of eastern Turkey. If a scheme can work
there, it ought to be able to work in Afghanistan. I believe that India
grows opium under licence, as do half a dozen other countries, but the
Turkish experience is the best
example.</p><p><a name="06101743000071">The
Senlis Council, which as I have said has people on the ground in
Afghanistan in places where others fear to go, is offering to run pilot
schemes. If I were at DFID I would be talking to it about that offer.
An impressive woman named Norine MacDonald, a Canadian, is in this
country at the moment. She has been based in Afghanistan for 18 months,
and has just come back after three months there. I urge the Secretary
of State to meet her while she is here this week: he would hear a
version of events different from that which he is likely to hear from
his
officials.</p><p><a name="06101743000072">It
is clear from what has been said by anybody with even a small knowledge
of situation in Afghanistan&#151;my knowledge is small&#151;that
our military on the ground know that the present strategy is not
working. Opposition Members have spoken to them, and they are frank
about its failure. They are up for change: Ms MacDonald said to me last
night that our military are among the most open-minded about doing
things differently. The only hope for Afghanistan, particularly the
south, is a sustained effort to win hearts and minds before it is too
late. The present programme, based partly on the forcible eradication
of the poppy crop, which leads to hunger and in some cases starvation,
will not
work.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0001.htmordayhd_40"><a name="06101743000444">10.15

concerned, that security is a precondition of development. As Sikander
Ali of Islamic Relief made clear to us, development is also a
precondition of security. As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) said, the two go hand in hand.
On the two visits that I have made to Afghanistan, the question has
struck me, &#147;Where are the jobs going to come from?&#148; The
terrain is inhospitable at the best of times. I believe that someone
once said, &#147;When God made the Earth, he had a few rocks left
over and decided to make Afghanistan.&#148;</p><p><a name="06101743000077">When the International
Development Committee was first in Kabul in 2002 we asked people what
they thought they could do about jobs. The Kabul chamber of commerce
was interested only in importing such things as hair shampoo, and the
only export seemed to be carpets. Most of the carpets were going to
Pakistan, and traders in Peshawar were making most of the
profit.</p><p><a name="06101743000078">I am glad to
say that I have made a small contribution with Chris Beales, whom I
first met at the Inner Cities Religious Council and who has been
involved with the Afghan diaspora in the east of London. We have set up
Afghan Action, which with the help of a DFID grant from the business
linkages challenge fund now has a factory and a training school in
Kabul. In the next two or three years we hope to train 350 young men
and women and employ 140, making carpets to be sold directly to the UK
under fair trade principles whereby all the profits will go back into
supporting those people. That has required a considerable amount of
effort, but with the best will in the world we will train only 350
young people. Thousands need to be trained. We know that the Taliban
destroyed many of the orchards and vineyards; one does not have to go
far from Kabul to see the scorched earth of the Taliban. A country that
used to produce much of the world&#146;s dried fruit is no longer
able to do so. Answering the question of where jobs will come from will
require a lot of
focus.</p><p><a name="06101743000079">Many of us have

for a long time. It does not help to take pot shots at the Government

perceptive. I also thank my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for

debate in the first place. The recent cover of <i>The House Magazine
</i>said it all. I looked on with not a little envy, and would like to
congratulate him on the example that he has set to many of the rest of
us.</p><p><a name="06101743000081">Three things have
rather chilled me over the past couple of months, the first of which
was my visit to Kiev. It is a little known fact but, for whatever
reason, about 60 per cent. of the Soviet forces that fought in
Afghanistan were Ukrainian. The beggars in Kiev are of a wholly
different class from anything that we see even in London. Many of them
wear their veteran&#146;s caps, desert camouflage and Soviet orders
from their times in Afghanistan, and an awful lot of them are minus
limbs. Many of them are scarred horribly from the effects of bullets
and shrapnel. They are an eloquent testimony to getting it wrong in
Afghanistan. I wonder how closely we have paid attention to the lessons
that the Soviets
learned.</p><p><a name="06101743000082">The
second thing that worried me was a comment that was made by
Mr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second in command of al-Qaeda. He
said, &#147;Don&#146;t bother bringing your troops home,
there&#146;s no need&#151;there&#146;ll be no more Dr. Brydons
this time&#148;. I am looking around and wondering just how many
people know who Dr. Brydon was. He was the single British survivor from
the 1842 expedition. The fact that that name does not necessarily trip
off our tongues, but that it does trip off the tongue of an important
individual in al-Qaeda, alarms
me.</p><p><a name="06101743000083">The
third thing that worried me seriously was my conversation with some
American special forces officers yesterday, who said, &#147;Do
understand that the war in Afghanistan is all-out war. Your troops are
going there to fight&#151;nothing more, nothing less. You must
understand that the only solution is the destruction and the death of
the Taliban.&#148; I do not think that that is correct and, without
wishing to criticise our American allies in any way, I think that they
have essentially missed the point.</p><p><a name="06101743000084">We must remember that our
forces&#151;and by that I do not just mean our armed forces, but our
officials, our NGOs, our effort, our treasure and our
emotions&#151;are all driven towards creating the conditions in which
the Afghan authorities can govern their country properly and
peacefully. We are not there as a force to invade. My hon. Friend the
Member for North-East Milton Keynes said that he had painted a bleak
picture, but I am not sure that he painted as bleak a picture as he
suggested. He painted a picture in which there is hope, but in which,
above and beyond everything, we must maintain a sense of balance about
the campaign, both military and civil.</p><br>

fighting will die down. Very shortly we will have some wonderful
stories of heroism, with serious awards for gallantry&#151;possibly
Victoria crosses&#151;to gentlemen who have bravely fought tooth and
nail. We may allow ourselves to be distracted and to think that the
war, or at least the fighting along the border, is won and that things
are probably back on an even footing.</p><p><a name="06101743000086">Winter is when things go
quiet&#151;ask Roberts, of the British punitive expedition mounted
from 1878 to 1880, which was extremely successful for a punitive
expedition, inasmuch as it killed a lot of people. Ask him what
happened in the winter. Things go quiet. The farmers and the Taliban
retire to their deep valleys, where the satellites and the B-52s cannot
get at them, let alone the special forces patrols. The farmers prepare
their crops for the next season. It will be easy for the western press
to say, &#147;Yeah, things are fine, guys&#151;let&#146;s not
worry about it&#148;, but what happens next spring? What happens when
we find ourselves without the troops, money or Government direction to
take on the next phase of the campaign, both civil and
military?</p><p><a name="06101743000087">I am
grateful for the presence of the Secretary of State, for whom I have a
huge amount of respect, and I would like him to answer one or two
questions. The first concerns the delivery of international aid
straight to the Afghans via the Afghan reconstruction fund, which is
administered by the World Bank. How cleverly are we delivering money
into the hands of the Afghans? Forgive me for using that horrid phrase,
but if we are to empower the Afghan politician, authority, policeman,
soldier, hospital or whomever, surely they must have budgets that they
can use and that they can direct right to the spot where the trouble
is. We cannot empathise exactly with the problems that face the
Afghans&#151;only they can&#151;but we can make those in power seem
powerful and influential in the eyes of the Afghans only if the money
goes to the right places at the right times and is administered by
Afghans, not Americans, Brits or Canadians. Can the Secretary of State
shed some light on
that?</p><p><a name="06101743000088">My hon. and
gallant Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr.
Ellwood) made some interesting points about what motivates the Taliban.
Are they still an ideological movement or have they become a pragmatic
movement? What dialogue are we trying to establish with the Taliban? I
appreciate that such dialogue is probably loathed by some of our
allies, such as the Tajiks and others, but we must surely be clever in
the same way that we were, at times, pretty clever in the 19th century
on the north-west frontier. Will the Secretary of State make it clear
how subtle and sophisticated we are being in talking to the people who
oppose progress inside Afghanistan?</p><p><a name="06101743000089">I shall end on that point, but
I roundly condemned the Government&#146;s tactic of sending few
troops and few guns to Afghanistan when I lead a similar debate in
February this year. I hope that the Government have realised that we
sent too few men, not to do killing and military tasks, but to enable
security to reign, the NGOs to do their job and proper, sensible aid to
be brought to the embattled people of

Kramer (Richmond Park) (LD):</b> I, too, congratulate the hon.
Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) both on
securing this debate and on making an incredibly good start to it, by
laying out issues that only someone of his experience and background
could present. I found that extraordinarily helpful. I also thank the
Secretary of State for coming to this debate. I want to hear what he
has to say and there are important questions to answer, so I shall keep
my contribution short. I want to make two comments and then ask some
questions.</p><p><a name="06101743000091">First, my
party supported the agenda for Afghanistan that the Government set out
five years ago, but implicit in that support was the commitment of the
international community not only to tackle the terrorist threat to the
west, but to work together to bring reconstruction and economic
development to Afghanistan. We are exceedingly worried at the slow pace
at which that project has advanced. Secondly, as others would agree,
Afghanistan has in many ways been a victim of the misguided US-UK
adventure in Iraq, which has taken military resources, distracted
promised investment in reconstruction and, perhaps most importantly,
diverted high-level international attention away from what should have
been one of the major projects of the past five
years.</p><p><a name="06101743000092">Some of my
questions were asked in another place by Lord Garden, so the Secretary
of State will have advance awareness of the issues that we want to
pursue, which are about the progress towards reconstruction and
development. The Afghanistan compact was agreed in London in January
and set down some benchmarks, one of which
stated:</p><a name="61017h0001.htmbrev_136"><a name="06101743000421"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All
illegal armed groups will be disbanded by
end-2007&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000093">Does
the Secretary of State really believe that that can still be achieved?
We are all conscious that reconstruction and development are impossible
without security.</p><p><a name="06101743000094">The
compact also says that by the end of 2010 there will be in
place</p><a name="61017h0001.htmbrev_137"><a name="06101743000422"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;effective
measures...that contribute to the elimination of poppy
cultivation.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000095">Does the
Secretary of State not regard that as rather optimistic when, as others
have said, there has been a 60 per cent. rise in the poppy harvest in
the past year, when Afghanistan produces 92 per cent. of the
world&#146;s heroin supply and when the country depends on the export
of illegal opium for some 70 per cent. of its gross domestic product?
What can the Minister tell us to give us confidence that there has been
a genuine shift to alternative livelihoods? Others have raised
questions about that and about whether we should consider the licensed
growth of poppies for medicine. Will the Minister enlighten us? Can he
tell us something about the overall strategy that might give us some
reasonable hope?</p><p><a name="06101743000096">The
compact states that by the end of
2010</p><a name="61017h0001.htmbrev_138"><a name="06101743000423"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the National Action
Plan for Women in Afghanistan will be fully implemented;
and...female participation in all Afghan governance
institutions...will be
strengthened.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000097">How
will that be possible, given that the education of girls, which lies at
the heart of that aspiration, is&#151;at least in the south and the
south-east&#151;being totally undermined? It had seemed to be locked
in place, but now schools, especially girls&#146; schools, are being
closed because of pressure from the Taliban and local communities.

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 199WH</b><br>What action are the British Government taking to reverse those
unfortunate
experiences?</p><p><a name="06101743000098">The
Afghan compact requires the Government to raise domestic revenues to
more than 8 per cent. of GDP by 2011. It also requires such revenues to
cover 58 per cent. of their recurrent budget by that year;
that compares with 28 per cent. now. Given the escalating costs of
security and civil service reforms, is that realistic? Corruption is
genuinely an issue, in part because of how we took control of
Afghanistan&#151;not through conquest, but through alliances with
people, many of whom were inherently corrupt and now dominate many of
the ministries, particularly at provincial level. The compact obliges
the Government to fight corruption, but does not say how. Perhaps the
Minister could enlighten us on that
issue.</p><p><a name="06101743000099">An article by
Christina Lamb in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 8 October discussed the
turf war between DFID and the Ministry of Defence. A little like the
United States Agency for International Development, the MOD wants any
possible jobs for young Afghans so that they have options other than
joining the Taliban, joining a militia or growing poppies. DFID is
looking for sustainable development. We all read that in Helmand
province DFID could mention only a few market stalls as its
contribution, as it has found the situation difficult. How will that
circle be squared? Will the Minister tell us
more?</p><p><a name="06101743000100">We
also read in that article that the British military, as others have
mentioned, are turning to local militias&#151;renamed
&#147;auxiliary police&#148;&#151;to guard various districts and
allow the redeployment of British troops for reconstruction and
development. What assurances do we have that that is not a new
underpinning for the corrupt and authoritarian powers of
warlords?</p><p><a name="06101743000101">The UK
mission in Afghanistan has always been characterised as firmly centred
on the reconstruction effort. The United States has never been shy of
saying that its mission has been one of &#147;search and
destroy&#148;. There has always been confusion about the agendas and
their priorities. When the US takes command of NATO forces in February,
which agenda will take precedence? Can NGOs operate seriously if
offensive air power is being used other than as a last
resort?</p><p><a name="06101743000102">Other
questions have been raised in the debate. I thank you, Mr.
Taylor, for the opportunity to speak. I shall take my seat, because so
many of those questions need to be
answered.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0001.htmordayhd_43"><a name="06101743000447">10.33

Simmonds (Boston and Skegness) (Con):</b> Like other Members,
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes
(Mr. Lancaster) on securing this important debate. I join
him and other Members in congratulating and thanking British troops for
their bravery and commitment in Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06101743000104">This has been
an excellent debate. My hon. Friend commenced it with an articulate and
informative contribution, based and founded on his personal experience.
I am sure that the Secretary of State will acknowledge that across the
Chamber&#151;although I emphasise the contributions from the
Conservative Benches&#151;there is real expertise and knowledge, and
a genuine concern about what is going on in Afghanistan. My hon.
Friends the Members for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood),

significant contributions, in their own inimitable styles.</p><p><a name="06101743000105">We Conservatives support the
Government&#146;s aim in Afghanistan: to prevent the recurrence of a
failed state, and the re-emergence of Taliban or al-Qaeda terrorists
and the effect that that would directly have on Britain&#146;s
security. We accept that preventing Afghanistan from becoming a rogue
or fragile state is a complex mission, at the heart of which must be
the reconstruction of the country in all its facets. The creation of a
stable state is challenging, but it is fundamental for regional and
global security, for controlling narcotics production, for the
improvement of the capacity of the Afghan Government and for Afghan
citizens.</p><p><a name="06101743000106">In January,
we welcomed the Afghan compact, which commits the British Government,
other donor Governments&#151;the involvement of some was
surprising&#151;the Afghanistan Government and the UN to improving
conditions in the country. As other hon. Members have said, the key
principle of the compact is to give more ownership of the process of
development and reconstruction to the Afghan Government and their
people. The other key aspect is the improvement of economic
development&#151;a point well made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Banbury. Significant benchmarks were set out in the compact, and I
should be grateful if the Secretary of State said whether they were
being applied and met. Does he still think that they are working and
correct?</p><p><a name="06101743000107">The
hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) made a good point in saying
that he did not understand what the obtainable objectives in
Afghanistan were&#151;counter-narcotics, counter-insurgency or nation
building? Will the Secretary of State set out the Government&#146;s
priorities and the order in which they put those issues?</p><p><a name="06101743000108">I shall not
detail the expenditure proposed for Afghanistan except to say that the
Government have rightly made significant commitments, bilaterally and
through multilateral channels, to enable capacity to be built. It
should be put on record that it is estimated that during the past five
years, since the allied forces&#146; intervention in Afghanistan,
2,000 schools and 70 new hospitals and clinics have been built, and
that 4.5 million refugees have returned home. Those significant
achievements need to be acknowledged.</p><p><a name="06101743000109">However, numerous challenges
remain, not only for the donor Governments, including the British
Government, but for the Afghan Government, the Afghan people, the NGOs
and the aid agencies. Only yesterday, there were suicide bombs in
Kandahar and Kabul. Terrible atrocities are taking place on the main
highway, as I am sure the Secretary of State is
aware.</p><p><a name="06101743000110">I
am not sure that I agree with one of the points made by the hon. Member
for Newport, West. We need to tackle both the supply and demand for
opium production. It would not be acceptable to leave the supply side
to blossom and grow unchecked. We need to strengthen the Government,
civil society, the provision of infrastructure, the development of
sustainable public services and the creation of a non-narco economy.
All those challenging issues need to be taken
head-on.</p><p><a name="06101743000111">In
some parts of the country there is economic activity and improvement in
infrastructure, but progress is being hampered by the deteriorating
security situation, persistent

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 201WH</b><br>unemployment, poverty and corruption. The real key to the issue is that
very few Afghans have felt much benefit from the political change of
the past few years. Most still live in abject poverty; Afghanistan is
one of the poorest countries in the world and is not on track to meet
any of the millennium development goals&#151;so much so that the MDGs
in Afghanistan have been added to and put back by five years to 2020.
There is a Government in Afghanistan, but they do not have much
capacity. They have very little penetration and reach in rural areas
among the traditional make-up of Afghan society and the different
ethnic groups in different parts of the
country.</p><p><a name="06101743000112">I shall not
concentrate on security, as other Members have mentioned that, but I
should like to make a couple of points. The international community
needs to do far more to develop faster the Afghan police force, which
is two years off track. There are significant problems. The force is
criticised for being fragmented; many police remain loyal to local
warlords rather than the national interest. That needs to be
tackled.</p><p><a name="06101743000113">My hon.
Friend the Member for Newark made reference to my next point. Military
commanders in Afghanistan are speaking of a small window of opportunity
for reconstruction and development in the next six months&#151;during
the winter, until the spring returns. Does the Secretary of State agree
that that short window exists? If so, how do he and his Department
intend to take advantage of it?</p><p><a name="06101743000114">Will the Secretary of State
confirm how many DFID personnel are in Afghanistan? How many, if any,
remain in Helmand province? Under what circumstances will he allow them
to return, hopefully to start the reconstruction and redevelopment
process?</p><p><a name="06101743000115">I should like
to make a couple of points about the humanitarian situation in
Afghanistan. Nine provinces face a critical shortage of drinking water,
and the failure of many cereal crops could leave 2.5 million people in
Afghanistan facing a chronic food shortage. What thinking have the UK
Government and DFID done and what contribution have they made to the
latest UN drought appeal? What steps are the Government taking to
ensure that the situation does not escalate into another major
humanitarian
disaster?</p><p><a name="06101743000116">We are
deeply concerned that Afghanistan and the Afghan Government are not on
track to meet any of their millennium development goals, which as I
have said have been pushed back to 2020. What is DFID doing to improve
progress towards the targets, and how many of the goals does it expect
Afghanistan to reach by the revised 2020
deadline?</p><p><a name="06101743000117">One of the
most oppressive features of the Taliban regime is their appalling
behaviour towards women. We very much welcome the freeing up and
expansion of education facilities available to women in Afghanistan,
but there are suggestions that up to 200 schools in Kandahar and 165 in
Helmand have been closed for security reasons. DFID and the military
must focus on reopening education facilities, particularly those for
girls, and protecting female Government employees who work in high-risk
areas. When does the Secretary of State hope and anticipate that many
of those schools will be reopened?</p><br>

<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 202WH</b><br><p><a name="06101743000118">I would also like to pick up
briefly on cross-Whitehall co-ordination, which was mentioned by other
hon. Members. There is no doubt that there have been friction and
tensions between the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and DFID.
The inability to agree on how the post-conflict reconstruction period
should be handled has led to delay in setting up the post-conflict
reconstruction unit. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State
would say which Minister is accountable or responsible for the
unit&#151;that is not clear&#151;and if he could detail exactly
what the unit has achieved in Afghanistan so far. All that comes out of
the International Development Act
2002.</p><p><a name="06101743000119">As well as
ensuring the necessary co-ordination in Whitehall, efforts must be made
to ensure co-ordination on the ground between various multilateral and
bilateral donor parties, the Afghan Government, Bretton Woods
institutions, NGOs and civil society. From his direct experience, my
hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes made some
interesting suggestions and analyses in respect of how things must
change, and I hope that the Secretary of State will take some of them
on board.</p><p><a name="06101743000120">I do not
want to repeat points that have already been made about opium
production except to say what others have said about opium cultivation
rising by 59 per cent. The Secretary of State is fond of
saying that production fell in the previous year, but he knows that it
fell only in terms of acres, or hectares, cultivated, and not in
yields. In fact, decreases have been due to bad weather, not to the
fact that people have stopped trying to grow the
crop.</p><p><a name="06101743000121">The production
of opium as a potential source of heroin is not the only problem. It is
the currency in some parts of Afghanistan, and it meets a demand in the
country itself&#151;it is not all exported. People are robbed of
their livelihood, and in some parts of the country those who grow the
crops are in serious debt to drug barons and exporters. If they do not
produce opium, they often have to pay those debts with their children.
There are serious societal issues that must be tackled, and I believe
that all hon. Members agree that some fresh thinking is needed in this
area.</p><p><a name="06101743000122">Aid is the final
issue that I would like quickly to explore. It is estimated that DFID
now channels 70 per cent. of its aid directly to the Afghan Government;
only 30 per cent. goes through NGOs and civil society. Putting aside
for a moment the point that was made by the hon. Member for Newport,
West about corruption in the Afghan Government, they do not have the
capacity to spend the money on agreed infrastructure and other
projects. It is estimated that only 10 per cent. of the available aid
money has been
spent.</p><p><a name="06101743000123">The
Secretary of State must focus his Department on ensuring faster yet
still effective allocation of money. It must ensure that money is spent
by the central Government and, perhaps, through other routes in the
more rural places that the central Government have not reached. There
seems to be a contradiction in the British Government&#146;s
strategy, in that they acknowledge that President Karzai&#146;s
authority and reach are limited to the immediate area around Kabul, yet
they seem to be putting more and more money directly into central
Government. We know that the Afghan Government do not have the capacity
to spend money in the more rural areas to alleviate poverty, which is
needed.</p><br>

from DFID and other donors is being withdrawn. As they are perfectly
capable of delivering the services that are required on the ground, I
suggest that the Secretary of State needs to revisit the
issue.</p><p><a name="06101743000125">We
hope that very quickly following the establishment of security DFID and
other international donors will be ready and prepared to act as
speedily as they can. That was one of the main problems in 2001, when
the Taliban were taken out in the first element of the military
conflict. We must ensure that that does not happen again. It would also
be helpful if the Secretary of State would give us his view as to
whether and when Afghanistan will be able to survive without such a
level and type of donor
support.</p><p><a name="06101743000126">Conservative
Members support the Government; we wish Afghanistan to be stable, but
that will happen only with adequate necessary resources from both the
military and the international donor community. First, security must be
provided and then, immediately post-conflict, there must be the
reconstruction and redevelopment that will demonstrate to the Afghan
people that they are better off remaining under a fledgling democratic
state than returning to a damaging and poisonous
theocracy.</p><p><a name="06101743000127"><b><a name="61017h0001.htm_spnew374"><a name="06101743000477">David

that we are all grateful to him and to all our troops for their service
in Afghanistan and for their courage and professionalism in extremely
challenging circumstances. That point was made by several hon.

last visited Afghanistan in June and spent some time in Kabul and in
Lashkar Gah. I was able to see the progress that has been made as well
as how far there is yet to go and the obstacles faced by the people of
Afghanistan. The hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes referred, as
did others, to the tragic history of the Afghan people, who have been
terrorised by 30 years of conflict, widespread poverty, a complete lack
of essential services and&#151;the thing that most forcefully strikes
me and other hon. Members&#151;an absence of
capacity.</p><p><a name="06101743000131">As has been

third of those children do not celebrate even their first
birthday&#151;they die before they are one year old. Afghanistan,
along with Sierra Leone, has the highest infant mortality rate in the
world. Only 47 per cent. of men and 15 per cent. of women can read. The
challenge is immense, and the first thing that we must do is be
absolutely straight about the scale of it. What has characterised this
debate has been the honesty and candour with which all hon. Members
have
spoken.</p><p><a name="06101743000132">The
hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes also knows the history of
British involvement, and that we are part of a wider endeavour with the
United Nations and NATO and one of 36 countries contributing to the
international security assistance
force.</p><p><a name="06101743000133">I agree
completely with the hon. Gentleman and others who spoke that this is a
long-term commitment. The challenge that the Afghan people face in
changing their country and therefore their lives will involve a long,
hard slog, to use a technical term. That is what we are talking about,
and it will not be easy for the Afghan people quickly to undo the
effects of the conflict. That is why we must demonstrate a long-term
commitment.</p><p><a name="06101743000134">I was
asked to sum up what we are trying to do. We are trying to help the
Afghan Government and people to create a stable and secure country.
That is in their interests above all, but it is also in our interests,
not least because of the circumstances that led us and others into
Afghanistan after September 2001. That is why I say in all honesty to
my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West that I do not recognise
parallels with Vietnam. I believe that the circumstances are different,
not least because we are supporting an elected Government. However,
that is not to say that there are not challenges, and I shall return to
them.</p><p><a name="06101743000135">We must
acknowledge that there has been some progress, and the hon. Member for
Boston and Skegness just outlined some of it. A good indicator of
whether things are moving in the right direction in a country where
there has been a conflict is whether people who fled the country when
fighting was going on have come back. The fact that more than 4.5
million refugees have returned to Afghanistan since 2001 is an
indication that things are better than they were when those people fled
the country.</p><p><a name="06101743000136">The
presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place and 25
million people participated. One answer to the point raised by the hon.
Member for Richmond Park is that, as she will know, 25 per cent. of
Afghan parliamentarians are women. They are doing better than we are in
that respect. Some 6 million children have returned to school and a
third of them are girls&#151;I shall come back to the important point
about intimidation. Immunisation has saved the lives of 35,000 children
and&#151;this links to the point about jobs that was raised by the
hon. Member for Banbury&#151;in 2005 the legal economy was estimated
to have grown by 14 per cent. Private investment has soared
from $22 million in 2003 to more than $400 million.</p><p><a name="06101743000137">Road rehabilitation, which is
now taking place, will help to connect the major urban centres. One of
the most striking things about Afghanistan is how it is decentralised
by its geography. It is quite hard to get around. The improvement of
communications and road communications will help people to travel, to

the chance to grow.</p><p><a name="06101743000138">The UK is the second largest
bilateral donor after the United States of America. We have spent about
&#163;390 million since 2001, and that is the fifth largest DFID
programme. At the London conference, which was mentioned by a number of
hon. Members, the Prime Minister committed us to a 10-year development
partnership with Afghanistan, which is another sign of long-term
commitment from the Government. That is intended to try to help the
Government of Afghanistan to plan for the long term and to invest in
schools, hospitals and infrastructure. We are also providing support
through the European Commission, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.</p><p><a name="06101743000139">The
hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes clearly set out&#151;the
point was also made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East&#151;the
choice and tension between doing things quickly and building capacity
for them to be done in the long term by the Afghans. The hon. Member
for North-East Milton Keynes used exactly the right word; there is a
balance to be struck, and that is what we are trying to get right. The
way in which we give our support has led to Britain being described by
Finance Minister Ahady as a model donor.</p><p><a name="06101743000140">We give 70 per cent. of our
assistance directly to the Government of Afghanistan and that is one of
the ways in which we can avoid lots of donors doing their own thing,
which was the point made by the hon. Gentleman. It is also the best
thing that we can do to show that there is an Afghan face to
redevelopment and reconstruction. It is about giving the Afghans the
tools to do the job. We are the largest donor to the recurrent budget,
which covers the central costs such as salaries for teachers and health
workers. It is for that reason that the Afghan Government want donors
to provide more support in that way. They have acknowledged
Britain&#146;s contribution, and the point that came across most
forcefully at the London conference was a request to other donors to do
more of that. The Afghans recognise that that is the most effective way
in which, over time, they can increase their capacity to build
effective state institutions that will last. Directing funds through
the Government of Afghanistan also enhances their accountability and
authority. That directly responds to the point made by the hon. Member
for Newark. We know that such an approach is the most effective way of
ensuring sustainability in the long term. That is why it is a question
of balance.</p><p><a name="06101743000141">The hon.

painfully slow and, in some ways, he is absolutely right. We all share
the frustration, but we have to accept that if the goal towards which
the people of Afghanistan and the Government are working is to be
realised&#151;an Afghan Government, elected by their citizens,

monitoring it. She raised good questions about the rate of progress and
the honest answer is that we will not know whether those benchmarks
will be achieved until we reach those dates, but they express a set of
targets towards which we are working. The rate at which the Afghans
will be able to make progress on meeting the benchmarks will depend in
part on security. There are some significant hurdles to overcome; we
must be straight about those, too.</p><p><a name="06101743000143">When I was in
Lashkar Gah, I went down to the banks of the bright turquoise-blue
Helmand river to look at some work that DFID has been supporting. The
thing that I remember, apart from the young boys who were having a swim
having taken their examinations in school earlier in the day, was that
the interpreter who turned up so that I could have a conversation with
them and others was wearing a black facemask that covered his face. He
had a baseball cap pulled down over his head. Why? It is a risk, in

brain&#151;are currently shut because of intimidation. Some head
teachers have been murdered, as have some students and school
officials, because they continue to try to teach girls. When will they
reopen? It depends on when they feel that it is safe and secure enough
to do so. That is why bringing security is, in my view, the
precondition to development.</p><p><a name="06101743000145"><b><a name="61017h0001.htm_spnew376"><a name="06101743000479">Mr.

Sally Keeble (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> I am pleased to
have the opportunity to debate the subject of housing homeless people.
For me, as for most hon. Members, it is not a debate about dry policy
but a reality with which I come face to face each week through the
lives of my constituents. The old and the young, families and the
disabled&#151;most of them are women&#151;all come to my advice
surgeries with the problems of
homelessness.</p><p><a name="06101743000155">First, I
pay tribute to the Government for their record in tackling the problem.
We used to have a huge problem with people sleeping rough, particularly
in this city. As I recall it, when the Conservative party was in
government, it complained about the problem only when Ministers tripped
over people sleeping rough on the pavements during ministerial visits
to the opera. Chronic homelessness and overcrowding in the inner cities
led to the resurgence of TB. We also saw the refusal to recognise the
problems of the young homeless&#151;of 16 and 17-year-olds&#151;and
of the single homeless, and the growth of an army of homeless women and
children living in bed-and-breakfast hostels across the
country.</p><p><a name="06101743000156">During the
nine years of Labour government we have seen the virtual elimination of
rough sleeping, a reduction of 70 per cent. in the number of homeless
families and an improvement in the rights of homeless people,
especially for the many women who are forced into homelessness as a
result of domestic violence. We have also seen a reduction in homeless
acceptances by local authorities. The crude measure of homelessness has
dropped to its lowest level since the early 1980s. In the Green Paper
&#147;Every Child Matters&#148; and in the &#147;Breaking the
Cycle&#148; report on social exclusion, the Government recognised for
the first time the disastrous social impact of homelessness.</p><p><a name="06101743000157">Although I shall listen with
great interest to what Conservative Members have to say, for all who
have had to deal with the Conservative party either in central
Government or local government, the tag &#147;compassionate
conservatism&#148; rings very hollow when it comes to housing the
homeless. However, despite the many achievements of the Government in
tackling homelessness, I still see too much of
it.</p><p><a name="06101743000158"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew379"><a name="06101743000482">Michael

Keeble:</b> The figures for housing completions are a matter
of record, and we all know what they are. However, I draw from two
experiences. The first was the leader of an inner London council having
to house destitute people under a Conservative Government who were
vicious in their determination to try to ignore the plight of the
homeless. The other is having to deal with a Conservative-controlled
council that is equally brutal in how it deals with a number of my
homeless constituents. It is a matter of recognising housing need and
of properly assessing and meeting it. The Labour

Conservatives could never hope to match, much less beat.</p><p><a name="06101743000160">As I said, however, despite the
Government&#146;s many achievements in tackling homelessness, I still
see too much of it. Not only that, the homeless people that I see are
often the most vulnerable and the most in need of support; the very
people whom I would expect to be helped by the state. Homelessness may
have reduced, but it has intensified in nature. I shall deal with four
particular issues. I know that some of my hon. Friends wish to raise
other concerns, so I shall not stray on to that territory.</p><p><a name="06101743000161">The first is
the need to get families with children out of bed-and-breakfast
accommodation; the current rules must be tightened. Another is to stop
councils making the unacceptable decision that people intentionally
have made themselves homeless, and especially to ensure that a proper
assessment is made of vulnerability among adults. The third is to stop
diverting the homeless into private sector accommodation that is often
completely inappropriate to their needs. The last is to end the single
room rent. Underlying all that is the need for more social housing to
rent. I welcome the recommendations of the Select Committee, as well as
the commitment by the Chancellor to increase spending, which he sees as
a key part of the spending review.</p><p><a name="06101743000162">I start with getting families
out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have seen a welcome
reduction of 80 per cent. in the overall numbers since March 2002.
Government guidance is that bed-and-breakfast accommodation should be
used to accommodate families with children only as a last resort and
only for six weeks. Although it might be possible for some councils to
interpret that in a reasonable fashion, that is not the case in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06101743000163">My
understanding of &#147;last resort&#148; or
&#147;emergency&#148; is that someone&#146;s house has burned
down, or that everything else has been tried and failed. Yet in
Northampton, I find that the threat of bed and breakfast seems to be
used routinely to deter people from applying for social housing, and it
is still used routinely for families who face what might be termed
predictable homelessness; families who have been served with notices to
quit their private sector rented accommodation because the landlord
wants to sell the property, or lone parents with children who are
evicted by grandparents or friends who have given a month&#146;s
notice of their impending homelessness and who have time to find a more
acceptable alternative.</p><p><a name="06101743000164">I shall give
some examples of what is meant by bed and breakfast. In one instance, a
young lone parent in my constituency was placed in a bed-and-breakfast
hostel where, as she complained to me, a relative of the owner rifled
through her belongings. She felt unsafe and left, and was promptly
branded as being intentionally homeless; she was therefore refused
further help with housing. She had suffered a compound series of issues
in her previous life, so by any reasonable standard she should have
been regarded as vulnerable and in priority need. It would be hard to
interpret what had happened to her as intentional.</p><p><a name="06101743000165">Another example was of someone
being refused housing by a local authority but being helped by social
services; there was a particular need to ensure parity of

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 210WH</b><br>treatment between the two groups. A Muslim widow with seven children was
placed in a bed-and-breakfast hostel that had no cooking facilities.
Because of that restriction, she had to walk across town each day to a
community centre in order to cook a meal for her children and then walk
back with the cooked meal.</p><p><a name="06101743000166">Finally, only last weekend a
woman with three children came to my advice surgery. She was being
evicted by her landlord because he wanted to sell the property. She had
nowhere to live and went to the local council, which said that she
would have to come back on the day of the eviction and that they would
probably put her in bed-and-breakfast accommodation in a town about 20
miles away. Not only would that have made it virtually impossible to
sort out her accommodation needs, it would mean disruption for the
children; they would not receive schooling and they would also lose
their friends. When she was eventually placed in a single
bed-and-breakfast room in a hostel in Northampton, she saw it as a real
concession; never mind that that she was in a bed and breakfast, with
all its attendant difficulties. Frankly, that is being
bullied.</p><p><a name="06101743000167">The
Government have to be much more specific about the circumstances in
which families with children are placed in bed and breakfast, and about
the facilities that they should have. They should ensure that the rules
apply equally to families placed in accommodation by the housing
authority under homelessness legislation and those placed in hostel
accommodation by social services under the Children Act 1989. By
whichever route they get there, the same standards should
apply.</p><p><a name="06101743000168">If it is not
possible to be more specific about the circumstances, the Government
should take the bold step of completely ruling out bed-and-breakfast
accommodation for families. I realise the difficulties that that would
create, but we cannot have families with children being placed in
unacceptable accommodation. That is unacceptable, as is the default
route whereby, instead of being dealt with under homelessness
legislation, those concerned are deal with by social services under the
Children Act; that is because they do not have the same
safeguards.</p><p><a name="06101743000169">Although
the pressure on the numbers of families in bed and breakfasts is
welcome, it is one of the causes of the dramatic increase in families
in temporary accommodation. In my own region of the east midlands, the
numbers have more than doubled since 1997, and the evidence from
Shelter on the position of those families is acute. As some of my
colleagues want to speak about that, I will leave further description
of that problem to them.</p><p><a name="06101743000170"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew381"><a name="06101743000484">Mr.
Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Does my hon. Friend
agree that those who suggest that much of temporary accommodation is of
good quality are wrong? The experience of my constituents and, I
suspect the constituents of most hon. Members, is that the least good
accommodation is generally used for temporary accommodation and most

negative.</p><p><a name="06101743000171"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew382"><a name="06101743000485">Ms
Keeble:</b> I completely agree. The problem of instability is
profound and has a huge impact on families.</p><p><a name="06101743000172">A further
issue is that of decision making in terms of intentionality and the
difficulty that homeless people

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 211WH</b><br>have challenging those decisions. For example, there is a woman whose
case I have already raised with the Minister&#146;s
Department&#151;I have not yet had a reply&#151;who is disabled,
has mental health issues and is a former care leaver who walks with
difficulty and uses crutches. She was judged to be intentionally
homeless because of an eviction for rent arrears, which she says was
due to problems with housing benefit. I have been through the
circumstances carefully with her and it seems that her explanation is
entirely credible. She is presently living in a privately rented room
above a pub. The landlord wants to evict her not, I hasten to say,
because of problems with the rent, but for quite different reasons. Her
single room is up several flights of stairs and, bearing in mind she
walks with crutches, there is no lift and the kitchen is down a flight
of stairs, with the toilet and bathroom&#151;her washing
facilities&#151;up another fight of stairs.</p><p><a name="06101743000173">In order to
avoid going up and down to the kitchen, she eats what she is able to
cook in her room, which is not very healthy. The problems of getting to
the toilet are more acute&#151;I will not go into the details out of
respect for her privacy. This woman has survived a pretty horrendous
time in and out of care and subsequently a number of other difficult
circumstances in her life, yet she is coping remarkably well. I am
surprised that she copes at all, despite the fact she feels very
depressed about the conditions in which she is forced to
live.</p><p><a name="06101743000174">There are, of
course, procedures that should have ensured that that woman was not
left in that position. She is supported by a number of organisations so
it is not just me who has heard her story. It is hard for someone in
her position to challenge the local authority, especially when there is
no one to take on housing cases funded by legal aid in Northampton and
decisions simply go unchallenged.</p><p><a name="06101743000175">Intentionality
officially accounts for just under 10 per cent. of
homelessness refusals, but those cases often involve the most
vulnerable people who have difficultly challenging flawed or
inconsistent decisions. A great deal more work needs to be done to
ensure that there is consistency within the decision making process and
that decisions are taken properly. The vulnerability of people should
be properly assessed and they should be given a real opportunity to
challenge decisions. That process might already appear to exist on
paper, but in reality, certainly for many of my constituents, it simply
does not
happen.</p><p><a name="06101743000176">I
would also like to refer to the diversion of homeless families into
private sector accommodation. I have pressed the Government on that a
number of times because it is a real problem for my constituents.
Although the Government&#146;s intentions are clear, they are not
being translated into action on the ground. I still find that
constituents who face homelessness are encouraged to go into private
sector housing and claim housing benefit before their vulnerability is
assessed, instead of making a homeless application. A young couple came
to see me who were homeless and vulnerable; the mother of a former care
leaver and a young man evicted by his mother with a young child and a
second expected. They were diverted away from making a homelessness
application towards a private sector tenancy, which they ultimately
took. When I last heard from them they were on their second private
sector tenancy and facing difficulties because they could only get
six-month tenancies and therefore have to keep moving.</p><br>

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 212WH</b><br><p><a name="06101743000177">Another woman
was diverted away from making a homelessness application despite being
a victim of domestic violence. She was unable to manage the rent for a
private sector tenancy&#151;housing benefit does not now routinely
cover private sector rents&#151;fell into debt, was evicted for
non-payment of rent, and was judged to be intentionally homeless
because of the eviction for rent arrears. She was then refused further
help. Some of my constituents who are now routinely caught in that
situation are paying &#163;50 per month and more on top of their
housing benefit for their private rented accommodation with no security
of tenure beyond six months. People who are forced to move from one
short tenancy to another find it difficult to get work and finding that
extra money out of benefits it very difficult. My constituency has very
high levels of employment, including among women, so it is not an issue
about people wanting to work. If people cannot work it is because of
the practical difficulties in their
way.</p><p><a name="06101743000178">The single room
rent means that single people under the age of 25 can only claim
housing benefit for a single room. That is perhaps the last matter
hanging over from the Conservative Government and is long overdue for
change. Research from the Department for Work and Pensions shows that
87 per cent. of all single room rent claimants face a shortfall because
of the low level at which the single room rent is paid, usually around
&#163;35 per week.</p><p><a name="06101743000179">I wish to pay
tribute to the YMCA in Northampton for its outstanding work on that and
other issues relating to single homeless people in the town. I am
concerned about the possibility of funding cuts to what is a life-line
service for many young people in my constituency. Not only is the
single room rent forcing young people into debt, it is perpetuating the
continuation of a sub-standard category of housing that should have
disappeared long ago. A home shared by friends is a far cry from a
property where each room houses a different person. There are a group
of private sector landlords who subdivide and let their properties to
maximise their housing benefit receipts: a type of benefit farming that
traps the most vulnerable and marginalised in the worst housing whether
they are young, single people or homeless families. A change in the
rules on the single room rent would help prevent at least part of
that.</p><p><a name="06101743000180">This
debate comes 40 years after the historic screening of &#147;Cathy
Come Home&#148;, which led to establishment of Shelter, and its
outstanding campaign on behalf of homeless people. This Government have
worked closely with Shelter on many housing issues and have transformed
the rights and realities for many families at the bottom of the housing
ladder. Despite the great progress that has been made under this
Government, my judgment is that a lot of &#147;Cathys&#148; are
still out there somewhere with their children, drifting in and out of
bed and breakfasts, temporary accommodation and the occasional private
sector tenancy. Those who are more resilient have managed to get a home
of their own, but for the most vulnerable, there are still wide holes
in the safety net and I ask the Minister to ensure that they are closed
so that all of the &#147;Cathys&#148; can finally come
home.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0002.htmordayhd_46"><a name="06101743000450">11.18

this debate above the tiresome, tribal debates and squabbles that often
take place; homeless people deserve
that.</p><p><a name="06101743000182">I
also entirely agree with the hon. Lady&#146;s concluding remarks
regarding the single room rent. From my own experience of my west
Cornwall and Isles of Scilly constituency of St. Ives, I know that
there is a significant problem with the setting of local reference
rents generally. Because of the methodology used, they are often set
significantly below the rate that the private sector charges for
properties, certainly in my area. That leaves many people who are on
low incomes, earning and non-earning, facing a significant shortfall
between the housing benefit that they receive and the rent that they
are charged, in an environment in which private rented accommodation
especially is scarce and extortionately expensive compared with
incomes, at least in my area, which has the lowest incomes in the
country.</p><p><a name="06101743000183">The debate is
about homelessness and I want to deal with two matters. One relates to
the gathering of the data&#151;the basis on which we take decisions
or Government policy is decided. I had an exchange of letters with the
Minister for Housing and Planning a year ago, querying the figures
given by the Government at that stage. The theme that I want to develop
and the question that I want to ask is whether the Government believe
that homelessness is the result of dysfunctional people who have simply
failed themselves and that accommodation does exist, or whether there
is a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market, which
I argue is more likely, particularly in an area such as my
own.</p><p><a name="06101743000184">The
impression given, certainly in the exchange that I have had with
Ministers, is that homelessness is a problem of data collection and
definition. There is a rather patronising centralist view that somehow
those stakeholders out in the sticks are not competent enough to
establish and operate strategies to deal with the problems. All the
correspondence and dialogue that I have had points to a failure of the
Department, whether Ministers or officials, to accept that there might
be a malfunctioning of the housing system and the housing market that
might result in pressures throughout the system such that those who are
dropping out at the end are in fact properly functioning people who
simply cannot be housed because insufficient housing is available for
them and their circumstances are not a result of a failure in
themselves.</p><p><a name="06101743000185">In
commenting on this issue, especially with regard to my constituency, I
should congratulate a large number of voluntary sector projects in
particular. One in which I was involved from the very early stages is
called Breadline; it is just up the road from me in Bread street in
Penzance. Since 1986, that project has provided very significant help
to homeless people and unemployed people in the Penwith area. The YMCA
has some hostel accommodation, particularly for younger single people,
in the Penwith area. Penwith Housing Concern provides support, advice
and counselling, particularly for those who have suffered substance and
alcohol misuse.</p><br>

its own quarterly count and provides us with extremely helpful figures
on the people with whom it makes contact and provides support for, and
works with other agencies in a very professional manner in the Penwith
area. It has recently secured another hostel to assist and relieve the
problem locally. Of course, there is also Shelter, with which I was
involved before I was elected as an MP, and many other organisations.
There are also the local authority professionals in this sphere, for
whom I have a very high regard as
well.</p><p><a name="06101743000187">In setting the
backdrop to my comments on this issue, I should say that I undertook a
survey of estate agents in March/April last year, about 18 months ago.
I asked very simple straightforward questions regarding how properties
had been sold, to whom they had been sold and the prices and the estate
agents&#146; estimates, as they are in the best position to give
estimates, of the change in house prices and the change in the nature
of the market. I found that, in the whole of west Cornwall and the
Isles of Scilly, twice as many properties were sold to second-home
buyers as to first-time buyers. People locally will be not surprised at
that; in fact, they will be surprised that first-time buyers are able
to buy and get that toehold in the market at all, given the house
prices. I will not bore hon. Members with statistics&#151;those can
be trotted out on many occasions and I can supply them to
people&#151;but certainly the average house price in the area vastly
outstrips local wages. According to one&#146;s source, the average
house price is anything from seven to 10 or 12 times local wages. That
is not a surprise and it is not a surprise that large numbers of
properties are purchased for recreational and investment purposes by
people who want to enjoy them as holiday accommodation and for their
own leisure and
investment.</p><p><a name="06101743000188">I am not
involved and nor am I interested in the politics of envy. People are of
course entitled to buy properties for recreational and investment
purposes if that is their desire. However, we need to consider a range
of policy issues relating to the impact that that is having and whether
we need to change policy, particularly in the area of planning use
class orders, to constrain the numbers of properties that can be
purchased and converted from permanent to non-permanent
residency.</p><p><a name="06101743000189">Hon.
Members, including you, Mr. Taylor, may be asking
yourselves, &#147;Well, what has second-home ownership to do with
homelessness?&#148; This is the very point that I want to make.
Second-home ownership is having a very direct effect in this regard. If
the market is significantly influenced by extremely wealthy
people&#151;wealthy compared with locals&#151;who can intervene in
the market and in fact set the whole tone of it and if the price regime
is largely generated or led by that development, it will inevitably
have an impact on families who, 20 or 30 years ago, might have
anticipated that they would have a chance of getting into the market.
They now cannot and they are looking for the very scarce accommodation
available through either the public or the private sector for rent.
Particularly in the private sector, such accommodation is not only
scarce but extortionate in
price.</p><p><a name="06101743000190">Further to the
survey that I undertook last year, I undertook a survey this summer and
found that five times as many properties were sold to second-home

survey. Again, the findings are not a surprise. In St. Ives, for
example, an estate agent told me that 60 per cent. of properties were
sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals. Many people will
not be surprised by that outcome, but perhaps it is a surprise and very
disturbing to people here to hear that that is the dysfunctional way in
which the housing market operates in my
area.</p><p><a name="06101743000191">Down on the
Lizard peninsula, an estate agent told me that 65 per cent. of
properties were sold to second-home buyers and 0 per cent. to locals.
<i>[Interruption.] </i>I do not know whether you can still hear me,
Mr. Taylor, given the intervention from a phantom driller
off to my right&#151;that is not a political statement. I am trying
to show a significant connection, relating to how the housing market
works for thousands of people, who are unable to express their demand,
desire and need for housing in the market place, as they might well
have been able to a generation ago, even in an area as difficult as
Cornwall.

very small areas in the south-west? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting,
as a consequence, that we should intervene in the market place to
restrain, somehow, the level of activity in the housing
market?</p><p><a name="06101743000193"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew385"><a name="06101743000488">Andrew

nationwide one. It is clearly localised to Cornwall, parts of
south-west England and Norfolk, the Lake district, Somerset and some
other places. It is not inconceivable, and it would certainly be
acceptable in my view, for the Government to provide local authorities
with the tools, if they wanted to use them. It would be appropriate
only in areas such as those I have described, where second-home
purchases have a detrimental impact not only on the housing market but
on such matters as community infrastructure and the viability of
schools. There is clearly an opportunity, as the Affordable Rural
Housing Commission suggested in its report, not for the Government to
intervene themselves but for them to provide local authorities with the
tools to do so where appropriate.</p><p><a name="06101743000194">In view of the time, I want to
return to the issue of homelessness, and to provide a backdrop to show
why, surprising as it may appear, homelessness, which is assumed to be
an urban phenomenon affecting only metropolitan and inner city areas,
has significantly affected an area such as mine in west Cornwall for
the past 10 to 20 years. It has certainly not gone away. Our problem
is, first, that the Government do not accept the level and seriousness
of the problem in my area.</p><p><a name="06101743000195">In Penwith alone&#151;my
constituency covers most of Kerrier, Penwith and, of course, the Isles
of Scilly&#151;the count on 14 and 15 March last year demonstrated
that there were six rough sleepers in Penwith district. It is the
smallest by far of the six districts in Cornwall. The figure for
Cornwall as a whole was 11. That is an absurd figure. Anyone who works
in the relevant policy sphere will know that that does not at all
reflect the seriousness of the problem in the area. The figures that
the Salvation Army gave me for that period suggest that the number was
in the region of 40. Some of the

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 216WH</b><br>latest figures suggest that the number remains the same. The official
figures that I have had most recently from Penwith district council,
despite tremendous efforts by the district and by other stakeholders
working together to bear down on the problem, show eight rough sleepers
now in the district.</p><p><a name="06101743000196">Transient people coming to the
end of the line are an issue. The district has the image of a place to
which people can escape, and that is a theme that certainly has an
effect in an area such as my own. However, we also generate a
significant amount of indigenous homelessness, and the Government need
to take that fact on board. The Ministerial response to me on this
matter suggested that the reason for the relevant figure was a problem
with the statistical measures that were used, or a problem with Penwith
district council and its manner of addressing the problem. I was told
that officers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister came down
and spoke to local stakeholders, and suggested ways to tackle the
problem. All those measures were already in place in the area. There
are also 65 people in bed and breakfast. Those are single people, not
families. Alternative hostel accommodation is being provided for
families in my area.</p><p><a name="06101743000197">There is a
significant problem in the area, and the Government do not seem to want
to accept that it is a problem. I believe that they view it as a matter
of the statistical count, and of the homeless people themselves, rather
than as the product of a dysfunctional, malfunctioning housing market
in which pressure higher up leads inevitably to unbearable pressure
further down the housing supply chain, so that large numbers of people
are homeless in areas such as mine. Those areas need their problems
addressed.</p><p><a name="06101743000198">I hope that
the Minister will accept that what I have outlined is not simply a
statistical exercise, but is an issue that must be related to the
working of the whole housing
market.</p><p><a name="06101743000199"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew386"><a name="06101743000489">David

interest in this issue because, after the 2005 general election, I was

doing about homelessness. I held my hand up and said, &#147;Well, not
a lot, really,&#148; but I knew then that I had better do something
about it, and my researcher and I set to work in the Norwich area to
find out how homelessness was created. We visited rough sleepers, soup
kitchens, drug counsellors, housing officers and charity chief
executives, and managed to get them all

how well they were behaving, but they did not seem to know each other
or work together very creatively. That was the lesson that I came away
with after my initial six months of study; they really ought to work
together. We need a whole city programme in which that happens, and we
need to be radical about looking after homeless
people.</p><p><a name="06101743000202">There
is a lot of confusion among the service users, who have been given
little help or information by statutory bodies, and who are sent from
one charity to another and one hostel to another. There is no standard
process for them to follow, and it is no wonder that they fall through
the net; in actuality there is no net. There is no way of tracking an
individual&#146;s progress through the system and no uniform method
of assessment and referral. It is difficult to get information about
where to go. There is no uniform assessment of needs at all.</p><p><a name="06101743000203">My young researcher asked why
there was not a website in the city of Norwich, which has had a proud
record on housing for years. I know that not everyone uses websites,
but that would at least be a slightly creative thing to do in this day
and age to enable people to see which places were or were not full. I
think that that will happen now.</p><p><a name="06101743000204">I have been
through all the statistics and have found out that the number of
households in temporary accommodation in the eastern region rose by 171
per cent. between 1997 and 2005. I always can be suspicious of
statistics and figures, but that one is being heavily quoted, and
perhaps the Minister would look into it.</p><p><a name="06101743000205">The issue of housing&#151;the
lack of affordable and social housing that affects families across the
board, from the homeless to first time buyers and others&#151;has
already been covered in the debate. I know that the Government are
making efforts to increase affordable housing, and I welcome that. The
right to buy has crippled the housing stock in Norwich. Both the
Norwich MPs get many visits on the subject. Nearly half of every
surgery is taken up by people who cannot find a home and do not
understand why there are empty homes in the city of Norwich that they
cannot get into. Some of those people would be quite prepared to go
into the houses and decorate them, but there is always some pathetic
excuse as to why they cannot use houses that have been empty for a few
months or so. That is one problem with the affordable housing
issue.</p><p><a name="06101743000206">As an aside I
ask this: when we do build houses, could we please think about the
environment and climate change? Also, having a bit of photovoltaics
around would not do any harm. We could combine the
problems.</p><p><a name="06101743000207">The
second prong of homelessness has not been touched on today, so I shall
spend a minute on that. I want to lubricate the system by which people
who are registered as being homeless can be helped. We cannot
immediately put people into homes because the homes are not there; I
want to address the issue of how assessments are made as to whether
people have made themselves homeless. Under section 191 of the Housing
Act 1996 the local authority must determine if an applicant is
intentionally homeless. The DCLG guidelines on homelessness say that an
applicant is intentionally homeless if they have deliberately done or
failed to do

for the interpretation of individual circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101743000208">My hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton, North has illustrated one or two cases, and I will give
another. She referred to &#147;Cathy Come Home&#148;; those were
the days. Back then, everybody had to watch because there were only two
channels, BBC and ITV. My goodness, those were the days; we had to
watch political history unfolding in front of our eyes on television
rather than skipping and floating around 50 different
channels. I have a young male constituent who suffers from depression,
which is common in people who are homeless. Mental health problems
occur much more frequently than in the days of &#147;Cathy Come
Home&#148;. My constituent lived in private rented accommodation and
had problems managing his money, which is not particularly abnormal; it
happens. He got into rent arrears and lost his tenancy, and he was
classified as intentionally homeless. The stringent interpretation of
the priority need legislation is leaving many vulnerable people
homeless who really should not be and who need our help. The system has
to help them. My constituent found it difficult to get local people to
take his problem seriously. Legislation and the filling in of forms got
in his way, as he found that incompatible with his particular
problems.</p><p><a name="06101743000209">I went round
and talked to people about the paper-based medical assessments, which
people have to fill in. A general practitioner&#146;s word is not
good enough; a medical assessment form has to be filled in. I met the
Norfolk and Waveney mental health partnership homeless mentally ill
outreach team&#151;there&#146;s a mouthful&#151;who told me that
the council in the eastern region refused evidence of an
applicant&#146;s doctor or support workers in favour of these
paper-based medical reports. The council relies heavily on the type of
medication and dosage in making a final assessment of a person&#146;s
condition and, therefore, whether they are in priority need.</p><p><a name="06101743000210">There is a world-class agency
in Norwich called Julian Housing Support, which gives amazing housing
support for people with mental health problems. That organisation says
that it is necessary to assess people as individuals rather than
through a strict medical model that fails to take into account a
person&#146;s choice to decline medication, and other factors. People
with mental illnesses frequently do not take their medication or do
what their doctors tell them. Gosh, does anybody in the Chamber do
everything that their doctor tells them? I certainly hope
not.</p><p><a name="06101743000211">I have tabled
parliamentary questions on this issue, and was told that is for a local
authority to decide which services to use, and the Department
recommends certain agencies as being useful. In friendship, I say to
the Minister that we need there to be high-quality initial decision
making about individuals. Is the Department prepared to commission
research into the quality of these paper-based assessments and withdraw
support if they are found wanting? I believe that some of them will be
found wanting, and that there may be other ways to get the necessary
information.</p><p><a name="06101743000212">We know that
because of the nature of homelessness, many people find themselves in
the same situation on a regular basis. Drug and alcohol dependencies

council now has a full-time private sector facilitator to help people

out. However, we should not spend all our time helping private
landlords; we should find other solutions to help the weakest and most
vulnerable in our society.</p><p><a name="06101743000214">I shall finish by talking about
hostels and the problems with them. They are always full, there is no
move-on accommodation, the individuals who stay in them become
institutionalised, and rough sleepers cannot get a foot on the ladder
of rehabilitation. I have talked to Norfolk Supporting People and
Norwich city council, which has produced a marvellous document,
&#147;A Review of Hostels and Supported Housing in the Greater
Norwich Housing Sub Region&#148;, for which I have high hopes. We had
a meeting, and somebody from the Department came and gave a
presentation about the work being done by the Department&#146;s
hostels capital improvement programme, which helps to create bright,
vibrant, positive, modem hostels. Was not the PowerPoint presentation
magnificent?</p><p><a name="06101743000215">The
scheme&#146;s mantra, quite rightly, is not more beds, but better
beds. Its aim is to make hostels centres of excellence. We need more
such programmes to help people, because hostels become full very
quickly, and people become institutionalised and cannot move on. We
need more of that kind of programme and we need hostels that are
supportive and rehabilitative environments in which people can access
to health and career services and counselling. While the Minister is at
it, I wonder if she would give Norwich city council a bit more money.

however, that while the foyer movement is doing an exceptionally good
job, there is a real problem with move-on accommodation. That comes
back to the homelessness
issue.</p><p><a name="06101743000221">My
final point about the Government&#146;s initiative is that we should
accept the work that is being done to end the use of bed and breakfasts
for families. I would, however, concur with those who mentioned the
large amount of emerging evidence showing that bed and breakfast is
still used for families in the short term. I hope that the Minister
will take that issue back to the Department.</p><p><a name="06101743000222">I want to look now at some of
the continuing problems that we have with homelessness. I make no
excuse for focusing to some extent on the situation in the capital,
where homelessness is still a significant problem. Nationwide, about
100,000 families live in temporary accommodation and something like
116,000 children are particularly affected, according to Shelter.
Although I congratulate the Government on setting a target to halve the
numbers in temporary accommodation over the next few years, it is a
major task, and they need to redouble their efforts to deal with all
the issues involved. Let me just mention some of those
issues.</p><p><a name="06101743000223">Others have
mentioned the time that people spend in temporary accommodation, and
the insecurity and isolation that they experience as a result. There is
also the impact on the health of many of those who live in temporary
accommodation, and it is mainly children who are affected. Finally,
families are continuously moved from one set of temporary accommodation
to another, especially in London, and the amount of time that children
spend out of school has an impact on their education and their future
ability to achieve more as part of the next generation. Those are real
concerns, which have been expressed right across the board.</p><p><a name="06101743000224">I want to echo a question that
I raised earlier about the standard of temporary accommodation. We are
often told that such accommodation is good quality, and there have
undoubtedly been improvements. Indeed, there was some very bad
accommodation five or 10 years ago, but things have not improved so
much that we cannot still say that many people still live in bad
accommodation; indeed, three constituents came to my last surgery to
talk specifically about the quality of their
accommodation.</p><p><a name="06101743000225">My
hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North talked in some detail
about the emerging problem of the rather over-zealous way in which
people attempt to prevent homelessness. In particular, they are using
the private rented sector for settled accommodation, but many of the
people who are placed in that sector have had dismal and negative
experiences of it. It does not

people back into that sector.</p><p><a name="06101743000226">When the
changes were made to the Housing Bill, mediation was touted as a way
forward, and I still accept that 100 per cent., but some local
authorities have been rather over-zealous in implementing mediation. It
is often used as a weapon to persuade 16 and 17-year-olds whose
relationships have broken down to go back into the family or to
persuade those in marital situations that have broken down to reunite,
when there is no real prospect of securing a settled
situation.</p><p><a name="06101743000227">I am acutely
aware of the time, Mr. Taylor, so let me briefly mention
solutions. We must press the Minister on this because we are coming
round to the comprehensive spending review, which will give us an
opportunity to look at solutions. I recognise that the things that the
Government are doing will continue to produce improvements and I hope
that we will be able to halve the number of people in temporary
accommodation over the next few years. However, we all recognise that
we need to go further, and that was one of the major recommendations of
the Barker review, which the Government set up. The review clearly
showed the slump in the provision of new affordable rented
accommodation, and steps must be taken to address that
problem.</p><p><a name="06101743000228">The
Communities and Local Government Committee, in its recent report, which
I hope the Minister and the Department are looking at closely,
suggested that there needed to be a significant increase in affordable
accommodation. However, it also went further. Some of the resources
that are available are spent not only on affordable rented
accommodation, but on providing low-cost home ownership. I am very
supportive of low-cost home ownership initiatives, and I want to see
the 1 million additional home owners the Government have committed
themselves to creating, but we must look carefully at the balance of

hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), because we need
to think seriously about additional resources.</p><p><a name="06101743000229">The
Government have set themselves a priority for housing, and
cross-cutting reviews on housing and growth are going on. Given all the
concerns that our constituents have expressed to us, let me therefore
make a plea to the Government as they undertake that work. The only
real solution to the problems of homelessness is additional supply of
affordable rented accommodation. I therefore hope that the Minister
will respond on that point and, more importantly, take it back for
discussion in the Department.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0002.htmordayhd_49"><a name="06101743000453">11.55

about which there are some toe-curling and eye-opening things to be
said.</p><p><a name="06101743000231">Today,
however, I start with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton (Mr. Love) about the provision of genuinely
affordable social housing, which primarily means social housing,
certainly in London. Of course, there are many other issues around the
subject raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms
Keeble), and I pay tribute to her not only for securing the debate, but
for the part that she is playing in getting the issues of affordable
housing and homelessness higher up the agenda. That is happening thanks
not only to the Minister for Housing and Planning and the departmental
team, but to a groundswell of support, certainly on the Labour Back
Benches.</p><p><a name="06101743000232">As I said,
there are many issues around homelessness, but in the end, the
provision of genuine affordable housing must be the key issue, and the
case for it is being made. The Select Committee has made the case, as
have Shelter and other organisations. Shelter&#146;s campaign for an
extra 20,000 units of affordable housing should be supported. In
London, that would mean that than 15,000 new units of affordable
housing were built each year, rather than 9,000, although the Greater
London authority says that the figure should be 20,000 units, and that
might be right.</p><p><a name="06101743000233">The
Government deserve all credit for taking away the worst excesses of
homelessness since 1997. With the effective ending of bed-and-breakfast
provision and street homelessness, the worst excesses have gone, but
long-term, affordable, permanent housing has been on the decline for
many years because of the right to buy and other measures. The problem
for the Government is that a lot of affordable housing is not
affordable, and they must not be caught out by that trick. Intermediate
housing at &#163;300,000 and &#163;400,000 is not intermediate
housing. I fully support intermediate housing where it provides starter
homes and takes people out of the rented sector, but I do not support
the sort of intermediate housing that is cynically being built under
the guise of affordable housing. That is being done primarily by Tory
councils, but also by Liberal councils, certainly in London. The hon.
Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) looks sceptical, so he must
attend my debate on Friday if he wants to find out more about the
subject. He defends his case very well and very smoothly, but I tell my
hon. Friend the Minister that if the Government are not careful, they
will be taken for a ride on this issue; a smooth ride perhaps, but a
ride nevertheless.</p><p><a name="06101743000234">If
we want to tackle the problems of homelessness in London in the long
term and to build stable communities, as we did after the first and
second world wars, there must be substantial investment in genuinely
affordable
housing.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0002.htmordayhd_50"><a name="06101743000454">11.59

the current social housing crisis was started under the right-to-buy
scheme when there was not adequate replacement to ensure that we had
the necessary housing stock. The current Government have failed to
address that since they have been in office. I look forward to hearing
more from the Minister on how they are planning to address
it.</p><p><a name="06101743000236">The hon. Member
for Northampton, North spoke about the problem of people still being
placed in bed and breakfast accommodation, and the effects that that
has on them, not just in terms of their immediate surroundings and the
pressures and strains that it places on families, but in terms of
location.</p><p><a name="06101743000237">Intentionality
is a key issue. When one talks to local authority officers, one finds
that they feel under pressure to be as rigorous as possible in the
definition of &#147;intentionality&#148;. I am being generous to
them and to the environment in which they are
working.</p><p><a name="06101743000238"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew393"><a name="06101743000496">Greg
Mulholland (Leeds, North-West) (LD):</b> Something has not
come out in the debate so far. As we have concentrated on families in
bed and breakfast accommodation, we have missed the growing crisis in
this country concerning hidden homelessness. Crisis estimates that
there are at least 380,000 single homeless people. Will the Minister
address not only those people who are in bed and breakfast
accommodation but also those who are in squats and on sofas in the
homes of friends and family, as many of our constituents are? There is
a growing problem because we have an overly rigid system that is
failing to deal with homelessness.</p><p><a name="06101743000239"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew394"><a name="06101743000497">Mr.
Rogerson:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very valid point, to
which I shall return. When we are considering how local authorities
assess homelessness we want a consistent approach: one that
consistently reflects the situations that people are experiencing
rather than the strictures within which the local authority is
working.</p><p><a name="06101743000240">I agree with
the hon. Member for Northampton, North that there is pressure to go
into the private rented sector, which undoubtedly has a contribution to
make. However, I echo other hon. Members&#146; comments: the approach
is not necessarily the one that my party would support. Greater
investment in social housing offers far better provision for
people&#146;s housing needs. She also discussed the single room rent.
I hope that the Government will return to that issue. Things have moved
on considerably since its introduction, and her party and mine opposed
it at that time.</p><p><a name="06101743000241">My
hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) referred to the
situation in our own region of Cornwall, particularly in respect of
second homes. I hope that the Minister will update us on the response
to the Affordable Rural Housing Commission&#146;s proposal, in line
with that of my party, to examine planning use categories and to give
local authorities in areas where that matter is a problem the chance to
deal with it. I hope that there is a contrast with the approach taken
by her colleague, the Minister for Housing and Planning, when she was
interviewed in the <i>Financial Times</i> not long after the report
came out. She basically said that this was not an issue that the
Government were interested in tackling. I hope that the approach has
moved on a little.</p><br>

North (Dr. Gibson) referred to the lack of a thorough system of
tracking, to be sure of how many people are involved and what the need
is. He is right that that could be improved. He also referred to
sustainability in housing. When there is investment in new social
housing, the fact that sustainable housing in terms of energy
efficiency would make such housing more affordable on an ongoing basis
for the people who live in it should be reflected. I was glad that he
raised that point. He also focused on some vulnerable groups, and that
is useful.</p><p><a name="06101743000243">Other hon.
Members highlighted the situation in the capital. It was useful to hear
that there will be further opportunity for that to be discussed later
in the week. We must be clear that homelessness is much more than
rooflessness; my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg
Mulholland) made reference to rough sleeping. While my party welcomes
the efforts that the Government have made in dealing with that, it is
clear that there are disputes about the official statistics on people
who are currently sleeping rough. As he was saying, we must also focus
on the fact that many people live in temporary and inadequate
accommodation. There are now twice as many families living in temporary
accommodation as there were when the Government came to power. Council
house waiting lists have risen by 50 per cent., and 100,000 are
officially homeless. Shelter&#146;s powerful briefing on this issue
said that the real figure is more like 500,000.</p><p><a name="06101743000244">We must address homelessness as
the biggest blight on the quality of life of the citizens of this
country. It is difficult to address health if people are living in
inadequate housing. People cannot take educational opportunities that
are presented to them if they have to live in intolerable
conditions.</p><p><a name="06101743000245">Families who
are placed in temporary accommodation have the constant worry that they
will be moved on somewhere else. That insecurity is found in the
private rented sector, where people may be on housing benefit and do
not have settled accommodation as they have shorthold tenancies of
perhaps six months to a year. They do not have the security that allows
them to plan further forward and to feel settled in a community. They
feel that they are at risk in future of once again finding themselves
homeless and having to return to the local authority for assistance.
That means that children are unable to establish themselves in schools
or to cement friendships, and that can adversely affect their education
and wider social well-being.</p><p><a name="06101743000246">Current Government guidelines
state that councils should avoid using bed and breakfast accommodation
wherever possible, especially for families with children. However, they
state that private landlords can be a source of high-quality,
self-contained temporary accommodation. I hope that the Minister will
deal with how we can get away from short-term accommodation in tackling
this problem.</p><p><a name="06101743000247">Earlier
this year, I tabled a question on Newham&#146;s local space
initiative, Ealing&#146;s safe haven partnership and London and
Quadrant housing trust&#146;s homeless initiative leasing scheme, all
of which are initiatives aimed at bringing temporary accommodation into
use as permanent homes and examining new ways of tackling the need for
temporary accommodation. I did not get a comprehensive answer, and
would welcome

provided with settled homes through those programmes.</p><p><a name="06101743000248">Single people make up the
majority of those living on friends&#146; floors. They are the hidden
homeless to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West
referred, and they tend to be low down on councils&#146;
vulnerability criteria. We need to address, as a country, what these
criteria are and come up with a better standard, so that councils have
slightly less scope to come up with their own criteria on
vulnerability.</p><p><a name="06101743000249">One
would think that creating new social housing stock would be the obvious
thing for the Government to do to tackle this problem, but only 170,000
new social homes have been built since 1997. Meanwhile, the social
housing stock has been reduced by a net 500,000 homes and local
authority waiting lists have also risen by that figure. We must invest
more in social housing and we need to build it as quickly as possible.
Some local authorities, such as Liberal Democrat-led South Shropshire
district council, to which I have referred in previous debates, have
used existing possibilities in respect of section 106 agreements to
increase the amount of social housing that can be provided as a result
of private development. I hope that other local authorities will take
the chance to do
that.</p><p><a name="06101743000250">We
must also tackle the issue of bringing empty property back into use,
which several local authorities have been examining recently. I welcome
the Government&#146;s initiatives on empty dwelling management
orders, which give greater tools to local authorities to address that.
The solutions are varied, but we must target resources more in the
direction to which other hon. Members referred by providing social,
rented accommodation which would offer a permanent, settled solution
for people who find themselves homeless and would prevent them from
having to return to the lack of security in the private rented
sector.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0002.htmordayhd_51"><a name="06101743000455">12.10

almost always not good enough and not what a civilised society

where the number of people in temporary accommodation has doubled. It
is 200 per cent. more than it was in 1997. I know that the Government
have made a commitment to halve that but if they do so they will only
restore the figure to what it was in 1997.</p><p><a name="06101743000254">I pay tribute to the
Government&#146;s commitment, which is part of their overall worthy
and admirable commitment to help to reduce poverty, particularly child
poverty. However, we must put the statistics into perspective because
the hon. Member for Northampton, North, for understandable reasons as a
loyal member of her party, thought it was appropriate to cast
aspersions on the Conservative record. I am the first to acknowledge
that between 1979 and 1997 Conservative Governments made mistakes, but
we should bear in mind two matters. The original steps to tackle the
acute crisis of homelessness occurred under a Conservative leadership
with Michael Howard&#146;s championing of the rough sleepers
initiative. In addition, during the early 1990s and particularly the
1980s, Conservative Governments were committed to increasing the supply
of social housing. As the hon. Lady almost acknowledged, the record for
supplying social housing under Conservative Governments was much more
successful than the Government&#146;s record since
1997.</p><p><a name="06101743000255"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew396"><a name="06101743000499">Dr.
Gibson:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the right to
buy decimated the housing stock in this country? That was a
Conservative
highlight.</p><p><a name="06101743000256"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew397"><a name="06101743000500">Michael
Gove:</b> The right to buy certainly ensured that more people
had the opportunity of owning their homes, and that policy has now been
embraced by both major parties because home ownership is a way of
spreading assets more equitably throughout
society.</p><p><a name="06101743000257">As the hon.
Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) said, one of the
flaws in the right-to-buy legislation was that local government and
other social landlords could not use capital receipts effectively to
reinvest in housing. We propose that future attempts to encourage
low-cost home ownership should allow local authorities and housing
associations to use the receipts from those sales to fund an overall
expansion in the supply of housing. That is an appropriate way both of
meeting people&#146;s aspirations to own and of ensuring that we have
more social housing for those who are genuinely in
need.</p><p><a name="06101743000258">I want to return
briefly to what the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush
(Mr. Slaughter) said. He rightly drew attention to the fact
that some housing that is designated affordable, not least in the
capital, is affordable only to those who are earning strikingly high
salaries. In the strictures that he applied to Conservative local
authorities he perhaps forgot that the building of Imperial Wharf in
the south of Hammersmith and Fulham occurred with the encouragement of
the Deputy Prime Minister and the support of Hammersmith and Fulham
council. It is unfair to single out particular local authorities
because of their political colour for the part they play in the
situation that he so accurately described. That undermined the validity
of his important point that when we talk about affordable housing we
must ask, &#147;Affordable for whom?&#148;</p><br>

for St. Ives (Andrew George) were useful in helping to clarify the
debate. He invited us to consider whether homeless is a consequence of
fractured lives or of a broken housing market. He preferred to
concentrate on the failures in the housing market. There are failures,
but my analysis differs from his. We must not overlook the way in which
some of the most acute homelessness problems result from fractured
lives.</p><p><a name="06101743000260">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) was,
unbelievably, attacked by Ministers for a speech that he made earlier
this year and which became known as the hug-a-hoodie speech. In that
speech my right hon. Friend drew attention to the fact that when
dealing with crime we must look at social exclusion, social breakdown
and the causes of crime. Unfortunately, I am afraid that in their
raucous populism the Government sought to undermine what he was saying.
What he said about the causes of crime and the importance of social
exclusion applies also to homelessness. Factors applying to
homelessness include problems of social fracture: family breakdown and
the placing of children in care, which is often not the best solution
for those who are in desperate need; the way in which we deal with
prisoners and the failure adequately to educate prisoners for a life
outside when they complete their sentences; the problems of drug abuse
and alcohol addiction; our failure adequately to provide services for
those who face those challenges and problems; our failure over
generations to deal with the transition of servicemen from service life
to civvy street; and, as the hon. Member for Norwich, North eloquently
said, particularly the problems of those with mental health challenges.
Will the Minister give a commitment today that the supporting people
programme will be not only protected but enhanced to ensure independent
living for those with mental health challenges and learning
difficulties who want and deserve independence, dignity and a home of
their
own?</p><p><a name="06101743000261">Housing
charities and pressure groups have said that we must address those
issues when dealing with homelessness. I pay particular tribute to
<i>The Big Issue</i> and its campaign for a Rolls-Royce service for the
homeless. It pointed out that the cost of accommodation if people are
kept permanently in a state of not having dignity and independence is a
long-term drain on the Exchequer. In the long term, early intervention
to deal with the problems of social fracture not only helps to rebuild
lives but makes sense for the
economy.</p><p><a name="06101743000262">I
particularly commend the work of some of our social enterprises, such
as the Notting Hill housing trust, which works to ensure that people in
accommodation are given skills and the opportunity to save through its
schemes, and Thames Reach Bondway, a social enterprise that I had the
opportunity of visiting and whose &#147;Moving In, Moving On&#148;
programme helps to equip people with the skills required to ensure that
when they have a roof over their head they acquire
independence.</p><p><a name="06101743000263">When
mentioning social breakdown and the way in which it contributes to the
most acute need, we cannot escape the fact that we need more homes in
this country. I was delighted when my right hon. Friend the Member for
Witney spelled out at the Conservative party conference the vital need
to increase housing supply. We have heard today an interesting and

record on tackling homelessness, and I am grateful for the opportunity
to set out some of our achievements and aims. The latest quarterly

homelessness have fallen to levels not seen since the early 1980s,
continuing a trend that started at about the beginning of
2004.</p><p><a name="06101743000272">The latest
statistics show that we are also making good progress in reducing the
number of households in temporary accommodation, which is too high. At
about 94,000 households, the number is 7 per cent. lower than at the
same time last year. We have a target to halve that number by 2010,
which we are determined to achieve. Although the level is decreasing,
we have done much to minimise the negative impact of homelessness, so
that 85 per cent. of households&#151;92 per cent. of households with
children&#151;in temporary accommodation are in self-contained homes
with their own bathroom and kitchen.</p><p><a name="06101743000273">On coming into office, the
Government were quick to get to grips with the worst manifestations of
homelessness. In 1998, the Prime Minister set a target to reduce rough
sleeping by two thirds by 2002. It was met one year early and to date
it has been sustained, reducing numbers from 1,850 to about 500. In
2002, the Government set a target to end by March 2004 the use for more
than six weeks of bed-and-breakfast hotels for families with children.
It was ambitious, many said it could not be done, but the target has
been met and sustained.</p><p><a name="06101743000274">We have achieved those
successes by continuing to invest in the prevention of homelessness. I
shall return to that issue, because it is important. We have invested
&#163;200 million over the three years to 2007-08. That includes
investment in rent deposit schemes to enable households to find good
quality accommodation in the private sector, if that is what they want,
and investment in mediation services to resolve family and relationship
breakdown and enable young people to remain in the family
home.</p><p><a name="06101743000275">In 2002, we
also strengthened the homelessness legislation, providing one of the
strongest statutory safety nets in the world for homeless households,
and requiring all local authorities to draft a strategy to prevent
homelessness and provide accommodation and support. Although I am proud
of our record of achievement, I am confident that we can do
more.</p><p><a name="06101743000276">I shall turn to
the specific issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
North raised, because we have been concerned about issues in
Northampton. The report of an inspection in 2005 said that housing
services provided</p><a name="61017h0002.htmbrev_140"><a name="06101743000425"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a
fair, one-star service that had uncertain prospects for
improvement.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000277">The
housing inspectorate is carrying out a progress check on the housing
service to analyse the progress that has been made since that report.
The findings will contribute to the overall progress assessment that
the Audit Commission issues in January 2007. On the positive side,
there has been an improvement in homelessness figures.</p><p><a name="06101743000278">Several hon.
Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton
(Mr. Love), raised an important

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 230WH</b><br>issue about the quality of temporary accommodation. He is right: it is
not only about what is provided, but the quality of what is provided.
We have issued statutory guidance to local authorities, and as I said,
92 per cent. of families with children are now in self-contained homes.
However, we are not content, so we are conducting a survey of 2,500
households in temporary accommodation to understand more about their
experiences. We shall issue that report towards the end of this
year.</p><p><a name="06101743000279">My hon. Friends
the Members for Northampton, North and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)
raised the issue of intentionality. All councils are required to assess
applicants in accordance with the legislation, and we monitor that to
see whether there is any difference in the statistics on people who are
identified as intentionally homeless. The statistics have remained
steady, so we are not picking up concerns about that
issue.</p><p><a name="06101743000280"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew401"><a name="06101743000504">Ms
Keeble:</b> Does my hon. Friend think that families placed in
bed and breakfast by social services under the Children Act 2004 should
have the same safeguards as those people placed in bed and breakfast by
housing authorities under the Homelessness Act 2002? I have had cases
in which people placed by social services have stayed in bed and
breakfast for 18 months.</p><p><a name="06101743000281"><b><a name="61017h0002.htm_spnew402"><a name="06101743000505">Meg
Munn:</b> That is a concern, and I shall take it back to my
Department. We need to address it with the Department for Education and
Skills, and I shall to write to my hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06101743000282">The
Government set up their homelessness system to prevent homelessness. I
am sure every hon. Member agrees that it is better to prevent
homelessness than to have to deal with it. Homelessness legislation was
always intended to be a safety net, and not the main route to social
housing. Good practice says that people should be given a choice, and
that may include the private sector. Many people live quite reasonably
in the private sector, and it is an option.</p><p><a name="06101743000283">It is also important that if
families are at risk of homelessness, whether in the private sector or
anywhere else, they talk to their councils early on, because measures
exist to enable housing authority assistance. On the issue of the gap
between the market rent and housing benefit, discretionary housing
payments can be used temporarily to allow more suitable and affordable
accommodation to be found. Single room rent is a matter for the
Department for Work and Pensions, but we continue to work
together.</p><p><a name="06101743000284">The hon.
Member for St. Ives (Andrew George), whose constituency I recently
visited, raised the issue of the whole system. My Department, with the
Government offices for the regions, supports local authorities so that
they can improve their strategic housing role. They must consider not
only the social market, but the whole market and how it
works.</p><p><a name="06101743000285">My hon. Friend
the Member for Norwich, North raised the issue of hostels. They are
funded through the supporting people programme, as he identified, which
requires staff to assess support needs and construct support plans that
supporting people commissioning groups then monitor. We are not
complacent about hidden homelessness. We are considering other ways of
identifying it, such as measuring overcrowding in concealed and shared
housing.</p><br>

hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) should not give me lessons
on the problems of homelessness. I worked in social services for 16
years under a Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman rightly
identified the problematic issues and their causes, but for anybody who
had to turn away 16 and 17-year-olds without accommodation or funding,
or who at half-past 10 at night had to phone a housing officer to look
for accommodation for a mother with three young children, there were no
answers under the previous Conservative Government.</p><p><a name="06101743000287">Too many
households live in temporary accommodation, but we have a strategy in
place which I believe will succeed in meeting our target to halve the
number by 2010. We are committed to delivering a wide range of
preventative services, increasing homelessness grants to local
authorities and voluntary sector agencies by 23 per cent. by
2007-08, helping 1.2 million vulnerable people sustain independent
living through the &#163;5 billion supporting people programme over
three years to 2007-08, providing 75,000 new social rented homes
between 2005-06 and 2007-08, and building an extra 10,000 social homes
a year by 2008. We will also invest &#163;90 million to improve
hostels and their services, and help rough sleepers make a permanent
move away from the
streets.</p><p><a name="06101743000288">In
conclusion, I thank all Members who have participated. This is an
important area. The Government are not complacent, and we are doing
more, including ensuring that a greater number of homes and affordable

Alasdair McDonnell (Belfast, South) (SDLP):</b> This is an
issue close to my heart, and it is a privilege to be able to discuss it
under your chairmanship, Mr.
Williams.</p><p><a name="06101743000290">It
is an unfortunate fact of life that for at least a generation, perhaps
longer, the great city of Belfast, part of which I have the honour and
privilege of representing, was known to most of my colleagues in the
House and most of the public for one thing only; the violent and futile
conflict between its people. I hope that that conflict is now resolved.
Had I been making this speech 50 or 100 years ago, the city would have
been known for something very different. It would have been recognised
as one of the most vibrant and successful manufacturing and trading
centres in these islands. Indeed, when the Harland and Wolff shipyard
was at its peak, Belfast was known as a global centre of manufacturing
and trade. We had not only that shipyard but a massive ropeworks and
Mackie&#146;s foundry, to name but a couple, each employing more than
8,000 people.</p><p><a name="06101743000291">At the centre
of all that success were Belfast lough and the port of Belfast. At that
time the natural resource provided by the lough and the port, and our
wise management of it, gave Belfast a strategic advantage over the rest
of the region. That advantage has been the bedrock of the city&#146;s
economic life since the earliest days of Belfast, when it was a small
community founded at the mouth of the Farset river and known in Gaelic
as B&#233;al Feirste; the mouth of the
Farset.</p><p><a name="06101743000292">Officialdom&#146;s
attitude to the port down the years has often reflected closely the
quality of life in Northern Ireland and the expectations of people
living there. When things were bad throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the
port was largely left to its own devices. The priorities of that time
were different from today&#146;s, with a few notable exceptions;
individual Ministers sent from this House to administer government in
Northern Ireland focused largely on containing a deteriorating security
situation and then, in their own interests, getting out of there as
quickly as possible to a better job in government. Through that
difficult period, the port of Belfast continued to do its job, giving
the enduring businesses that still operated there a reliable,
economical link to the outside, normal world of commerce. It was a
commercial success at a time when we had few
successes.</p><p><a name="06101743000293">In the
1990s, the peace process began to emerge. Life and business made their
first faltering steps back to normality and the people of the region
began to hope and expect that the quality of our lives would improve.
As part of that process, the Belfast harbour commissioners examined the
port&#146;s facilities carefully, and wisely began to invest heavily
in improving them to ensure that the port could capitalise on the
improved business environment around it. That the harbour commissioners
continue to take seriously the role that they have taken on is
reflected in the projection that between 1995 and 2010 they will have
invested a massive &#163;250 million in developing the port and the
harbour estate around it. Amazingly, and as an obvious

achieved without any direct expense from the public
purse.</p><p><a name="06101743000294">I
wish also to mention another organisation close to my heart; the
Laganside Corporation. It was established in shadow form in about 1987
and went live under legislation passed early in 1989. It did some of
the greatest work that our city has ever seen and was innovative and
successful. It played a major role in reminding the people of our city
of their connection with and reliance on Belfast lough and the River
Lagan, which flows into it. The Laganside Corporation took over
wasteland and waste docklands that people never dreamed would be of any
use again. With appropriate infrastructure investments it turned
hundreds of acres of worthless land into land for which anything up
to &#163;1 million or &#163;2 million an acre is paid
today. By bringing people back to the water and bringing the waterside
of Belfast back to life, Laganside raised public awareness of the
port&#146;s key role and reminded us all what an amazing resource it
had been and continues to be for our future.</p><p><a name="06101743000295">It is a matter of deep regret
to me and to many of those interested in the improvement of the welfare
of Belfast that the Laganside Corporation is shortly to be wound up
despite the fact that much of its work remains to be done. Yes, an exit
strategy was designed all those years ago when the body was set up, and
it was intended to survive for only 15 or 18 years, but it has done
such an outstanding job and there is still so much more to do that it
should not be wound up. I will continue to bring the need for an
immediate and effective successor to the attention of the House in the
coming
months.</p><p><a name="06101743000296">The
greater awareness created by the Laganside Corporation and the
waterfront developments meant greater scrutiny of the work of the port
and the challenges that it faced. In 1998 a report issued by the
Department of Education, as it was then, covered some of the issues
involved and concluded that Northern Ireland&#146;s trust ports, of
which Belfast is one&#151;there are others in Derry and
Warrenpoint&#151;should be granted greater financial freedom and more
powers to do their work.</p><p><a name="06101743000297">In 2001, a Committee of the
Northern Ireland Assembly, chaired by my party colleague Alban
Maginness, carried out a detailed assessment and came to a similar
conclusion; that things should be loosened up and that the enormous
potential of the port could be achieved, and the potential benefits to
the people realised, only if it remained a fully accountable trust port
but with greatly extended powers to give it the financial and
managerial flexibility to compete successfully with its competitors in
Britain and the Republic of Ireland. I regret to say that the bulk of
the recommendations in that Assembly report have been ignored. None of
the necessary extended powers recommended was ever implemented.
Instead, in 2001 the Office for National Statistics required that trust
boards be classified as public corporations. That regulation eventually
came into effect in 2005. The already restricted regulatory environment
in which the port operated was further tightened and the clearly
expressed will of the Assembly and the devolved Government
ignored.</p><br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 234WH</b><br><p><a name="06101743000298">Against that background, four
months ago the Department for Regional Development published a public
consultation document on the powers, status and governance of public
trust ports in Northern Ireland. The Department has considered ports
policy in parallel with a UK-wide consultation, and the report follows
a lengthy period of debate. Unsurprisingly, the debate and uncertainty
do nothing to improve our facilities or give the trust ports the
freedom that they need to develop the appropriate infrastructure and
help us to
compete.</p><p><a name="06101743000299">Before I
briefly consider what I would like to come out of the exercise, I want
to look at the current state of the port of Belfast. By any financial
measure, Belfast is one of the most successful and efficiently run
ports in these islands. Only last month the port of Belfast was named
Irish port of the year at the transport and logistics awards. It is by
far Northern Ireland&#146;s largest port and a strategic asset for
the entire island of Ireland. It handles 60 per cent. by volume of
Northern Ireland&#146;s seaborne trade and 20 per cent. by volume of
the trade of the island as a whole. The port of Belfast handles
&#163;19 billion of trade annually, in which is contained 25 per
cent. by value of the goods coming from and going to the whole island
of Ireland. The port is a significant gateway for trade and the
economy. </p><p><a name="06101743000300">Apart from
being Northern Ireland&#146;s most important gateway for trade, the
port is an economic catalyst and contributes significantly to its
principal stakeholders, namely the Government, port users and the wider
economy. Any failure of the port to develop to meet the demands that
are placed on it would directly impact on thousands of businesses, big
and small, and tens of thousands of workers who rely on it directly and
indirectly for their jobs.</p><p><a name="06101743000301">The port of
Belfast is also one of Northern Ireland&#146;s key infrastructure
developers. It has facilitated some of Northern Ireland&#146;s most
important economic urban regeneration projects, including the Odyssey
complex, the Northern Ireland Science Park, Clarendon docks, Sydenham
business park, Belfast city airport, which was built on port land,
Hollywood exchange and, last but not least, Titanic quarter, where
25,000 homes will be built over the next 25 to 30 years. The total
gross development value of Belfast harbour estate projects since 1991
is &#163;700 million. The Federation of Small Businesses made
something of understatement when it said in a recent submission that it
was questionable whether those sums and those projects could have been
achieved under a totally public sector model of governance.</p><p><a name="06101743000302">As the port of Belfast has
succeeded, so too has the Exchequer. I understand that in the past 10
years around &#163;34 million has been paid by the port in
corporation tax and that &#163;10 million has been paid in rates by
the port and the port&#146;s tenants&#151;that is, people who have
leased land off the port. I am told that, all in all, the port supports
somewhere in the region of 175,000 jobs in industries not only right
across Northern Ireland, but in a big slice of southern Irish territory
as well. However, to deliver the regional economic growth that I and
others in Belfast want, it is estimated that 69 per cent. more capacity
is required in the next 19 to 20 years, to 2025.</p><p><a name="06101743000303">It is essential, not only for
Belfast and Northern Ireland, but for the island of
Ireland&#151;particularly the northern half, within the Belfast port
catchment 
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 235WH</b><br>area&#151;that we move to achieve the capacity required to do the
business. I see a major opportunity in the review for Belfast, Northern
Ireland and the northern half of the island of Ireland finally to
implement the Assembly&#146;s recommendations of five years ago and
to allow the port to develop into a major strategic asset that can take
the city of Belfast to a new level strategically and
economically.</p><p><a name="06101743000304">One example
of the strategic opportunity that exists is the potential for
transatlantic freight. Ireland does not currently have a transatlantic
freight terminal. However, as the economy continues to race ahead and
the north finds it feet for the economic boom that can and will follow
the restoration of devolution, the case for a transatlantic freight
terminal on the island becomes more and more compelling. Realistically,
there are only two sites for such a development, Belfast or Cork. I
believe that the choice should be Belfast; there is no surprise in
that. With the investment in the roads network between Belfast and
Dublin, the port of Belfast can come genuinely to compete with the port
of Dublin in both revenue and Ireland-wide importance. In many ways the
port of Dublin is choked, and serious discussions are taking place
about relocating it away from the city centre, because the large
vehicles trying to access the port are in conflict with a city that is
bursting with all sorts of new technology projects and so on.</p><p><a name="06101743000305">That brings me back to the
review. We must do whatever is necessary to ensure that the potential
success is realised. The first and most obvious answer is that the port
of Belfast and more generally all Northern Ireland trust ports require
the end of public corporation status and the long-awaited granting of
fuller commercial powers. It is widely recognised that public
corporation status is incompatible with the commercial realities of
running of a modern port, because it subjects organisations that are
run in the commercial world to a public sector regime and the inherent
Government controls that that entails. I am all in favour of
transparency and openness, but it is vital that the ports should be
freed up to do the job quickly and efficiently.</p><p><a name="06101743000306">Ports trade
commercially, and they generate their incomes and finance capital
expenditure commercially. They have no preferential access to public
sector spending. Commercial operations are required to be flexible and
agile, and ports need decision-making processes that are at odds with
much of public sector control. Trust ports need to be fully accountable
to the public, but that is achievable without labelling them with the
wholly inappropriate title of public corporation. All the trust ports
in Northern Ireland share that view, and I understand that they have
provided detailed proposals to the Department for Transport on getting
the balance right between accountability and financial flexibility. I
call for those proposals to be adopted. It is vital that any conclusion
drawn from the review should finally give the port of Belfast the
commercial, managerial and financial freedoms that it requires to
address the needs of the Northern Ireland economy.</p><p><a name="06101743000307">That is only half the story,
however. I am concerned that the recent review also reopened a debate
about what appears to be the privatisation of the port of Belfast land
bank, creating the possibility of the port being stripped of its
assets. However, free land in and around the port appears to be
limited. Most if not all 
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 236WH</b><br>the land is tied up in leases lasting for 100 to 150 years from now. The
concerns and anxiety about the implied threat has destabilised our
situation. Access to that land is essential in the public interest. The
port is a public organisation, and the public interest has to be kept
at a high level.</p><p><a name="06101743000308">To
those who wonder why the port of Belfast should be the city&#146;s
largest land holder, I would say that the public interest in the
harbour estate is protected by legislation enshrined in the previous
Assembly. Again, much of the harbour estate was created at the
port&#146;s own expense as the harbour extended. The port started
small in the heart of the city, but as it needed deeper and deeper
water it moved out and developed reclaimed land from Belfast lough. My
figures suggest that 97 per cent. of the non-port land supports various
forms of useful economic activity. Some 2 per cent. of the land was
released for other uses in April 2006, and 1 per cent. is unusable. It
would be wrong to interfere unnecessarily with the activities of the
port and the success that it has been. Indeed, my opinion on that seems
reflected and supported by no less an expert than the Minister with
responsibility for shipping, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr.
Ladyman), who said this to the ports policy review
conference:</p><a name="61017h0003.htmbrev_141"><a name="06101743000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We&#146;re
not in the business of &#145;fixing things that ain't broke&#146;.
Any future policy will be grounded on the evidence of what does or
doesn't work in
practice.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000309">I
say to that Minister, and his colleagues in the Northern Ireland
Department of Regional Development, that the port of Belfast is not
&#147;broke&#148;. It needs to be retuned and given more
flexibility, freedom and scope to act commercially. It is delivering
substantial benefits to the Northern Ireland economy and is well placed
to gear up for future challenges. All Belfast wants is for the
sentiment expressed by the Minister at the conference to apply equally
to all UK ports. If that does not happen, the ability of Belfast port
to prepare for and service the substantial anticipated economic growth
will be hindered. In the short term, breaking up the port would yield
some financial benefits but it would create obstacles in the long
term.</p><p><a name="06101743000310">Massive
investment will be required to build new quays, berths and deeper
channels to accommodate growing international trade and a new
generation of larger ships that, I hope, will use the port. The
required investment will come relatively easily if the port has greater
commercial agility and the ownership of the harbour estate is
protected.</p><p><a name="06101743000311">At the
beginning of my contribution, I remarked that until 50 years ago,
Belfast was known as a centre for manufacturing and trade. If we make
the correct decisions for the port now, Belfast will be able to
resurrect itself as a centre for manufacturing and trade. Some 95 per
cent. of all our trade is seaborne; I repeat that, by volume, Belfast
handles 60 per cent. of Northern Ireland&#146;s trade and 20 per
cent. of the whole island&#146;s trade.</p><p><a name="06101743000312">If time were available, I would
add much more, but I shall leave the issue here. I call on the Minister
to state whether he shares my vision of the potential of the port of
Belfast. I welcome his views on the issue, whether he agrees with me or
not, because we must have a serious debate on the port before any
decisions are made that could put a positive and successful economic
future at
risk.</p><br>

harbours simply do not understand their enormous commercial potential
in this day and age. More and more freight is travelling the world on
larger and larger vessels and more and more people are going on cruises
and so on. The potential of ports is greater today than it has been for
a long time. People who do not have many dealings with them do not
understand that; they think that ports belong to the 19th century. My
hon. Friend and I know that that is not the
case.</p><p><a name="06101743000318">I should like to
pay tribute to Frank Cushnahan, the outgoing chairman of the Belfast
harbour commissioners, who has worked very hard during many years of
involvement with Belfast. He is retiring, but only in the sense that he
will not be chairman for much longer&#151;he is certainly not
&#147;retiring&#148; otherwise, but comes forward to express his
views on what should happen in Belfast. He has done a great deal to
advance the cause of the port of Belfast and I wish him a long and
happy
retirement.</p><p><a name="06101743000319">I
do not want to go over every bit of ground covered by my hon. Friend,
but it is important to understand the scale of Belfast port and harbour
to understand the seriousness of the decisions that the Government will
have to make on its future and that of others in Northern Ireland. The
eight miles of Belfast port&#146;s quays occupy 2,000 acres. The port
has 1.2 million sq ft of warehousing and 100 acres of terminals. As my
hon. Friend rightly

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 238WH</b><br>reminded us, two thirds of Northern Ireland&#146;s seaborne trade and
a quarter of that for Ireland as a whole is handled by the port. It is
doing very well and going from strength to strength. It is the busiest
ferry port in Northern Ireland, ferrying 1.2 million passengers, many
of them lucky enough to be going to Scotland. I join my hon. Friend in
paying tribute to the port for garnering the title of Irish port of the
year at the recent awards
ceremony.</p><p><a name="06101743000320">My hon.
Friend is right to highlight the fact that standing still is not an
option for the port of Belfast; this era of globalisation, developing
trade, changing ship design and changing business processes means that
the port has to evolve and change. My hon. Friend highlighted one model
that he thinks would serve that change process, but there is no
difference between us&#151;we both believe that the port of Belfast,
although currently successful, has great potential into which it can
grow. We must find the right mechanism to unlock some of that potential
and allow the port to flourish to an even greater
extent.</p><p><a name="06101743000321">I am happy to
acknowledge the Belfast harbour commissioners&#146; response: their
five-year, &#163;140 million capital expenditure programme,
delivering new terminals, new logistics facilities and new container
capacity. I look forward to seeing those developments emerge, albeit
from this side of the
water.</p><p><a name="06101743000322">Belfast port is
successful, thriving and crucial to the well-being of Northern Ireland.
In that context and as part of the review, we are giving consideration
to the power, status and governance of the public trust ports such as
Belfast to ensure that they are appropriate for their crucial
role.</p><p><a name="06101743000323">Time is short,
so I shall cut to the model raised by my hon. Friend: giving extended
commercial powers to the port, as recommended by the Assembly and the
Executive. My hon. Friend was fair enough to acknowledge that that was
part of a package on tighter public accountability. He knows that all
that was caught up in and affected by the ruling by the Office for
National Statistics that certain trust ports should be considered as
public corporations for public expenditure purposes. There is a dilemma
at the heart of that: if ports are to remain public corporations, how
do we give them greater commercial freedom while ensuring that there
are public lines of accountability? That is one of the options outlined
in the ports review and it is under consideration. It is not the only
one; on this side of the water, there are many examples of privatised
ports that do an excellent job of developing their
facilities&#151;and, in a sensitive way, the associated land
bank&#151;for the economic benefit of people who live around them.
There is not simply one available model. We have to look at the special
circumstances of Belfast port. We also have to ensure that we design a
model that is appropriate to all the trust ports in Northern Ireland.
Of course, the specific circumstances of Belfast port would
automatically read across to the other trust ports, but it is the
largest one and is absolutely central to this
discussion.</p><p><a name="06101743000324">The
Government take seriously my hon. Friend&#146;s advice. We will
reflect on the model that he proposed and in due course introduce plans
that will unlock the greater potential of Belfast port, as we entirely
share his vision for
it.</p><br>

Tipping (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> It is a great pleasure to
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Williams. I know that you take
an interest in the youth service, which is an important service. I am
pleased to have this opportunity to praise the work of youth service
workers and to draw attention to
funding.</p><p><a name="06101743000326">I want to
make an opening remark about young people. If one were to believe the
tabloid press, one would think that young people were difficult and a
threat to our society. I believe that they are a force for change.
Young citizens can make a real difference to our society, and it is
important to praise them rather than constantly criticise
them.</p><p><a name="06101743000327">It is also
important to praise the work of the many people who work in the youth
service and who provide a range of avenues for young people&#146;s
development. I am pleased that the Government recognise the work of the
youth service. After all, in recent years they have commissioned a
great number of publications and reports about it. Let me highlight
some of them: &#147;Transforming Youth Work: Resourcing Excellent
Youth Services&#148; in 2002, and &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;
in 2003, followed by &#147;Youth Matters&#148; in 2005, the same
year in which Ofsted&#146;s report, &#147;Effective Youth
Services&#148;, came out. More recently, &#147;Youth Matters: Next
Steps&#148; was published this year. In July, the Department for
Education and Skills and the Treasury working together made an
important statement about the need to introduce proposals in respect of
the youth service during the comprehensive spending review. I welcome
that&#151;it is a real
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06101743000328">All those
reports accept the value of the youth service. It can reduce antisocial
behaviour and crime, help reduce truancy&#151;I have personal
experience of projects that get youngsters back into school&#151;and
tackle social problems such as drug misuse and teenage pregnancies.
Most importantly, good youth work involves young people, makes them
active citizens and gives them an opportunity to debate not just
society and international affairs but how tangibly they can affect
local governance.</p><p><a name="06101743000329">In a
way, all those outcomes can be measured, but one of the real issues for
the youth service is that a good deal of its work cannot be measured
quantitatively. Much of the youth service centres around building
personalities and developing young people. It is about the
relationships that exist between youth workers and young people. In
effect, we are talking about a qualitative rather than a quantitative
relationship, and one of the areas of social policy that we need to do
further work on is being clearer about how we measure qualitative
relationships. Of course, one of the ways to do it is to ask young
people themselves. When asked, they give a resounding cheer for the
youth service. They see it as an important project and
sector.</p><p><a name="06101743000330">I am pleased
that the Audit Commission in its report &#147;Misspent Youth&#148;
suggested that for every &#163;1 that is invested in the youth
service, a corresponding &#163;8 is spent in the voluntary sector.
For every &#163;1 from the state, &#163;8 of voluntary work is
produced. The Audit Commission stated clearly that investment in youth

<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 240WH</b><br>services could help save money in other Government services,
particularly in health and education. Despite those favourable reviews
and reports, the youth service is under threat. I do not want to
exaggerate the situation, but the Government need carefully to consider
several factors so that the service can go forward into the
future.</p><p><a name="06101743000331">The first
threat is the development by local authorities of integrated
children&#146;s services, which come out of &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148;. In principle, I support that move. It must be right
that education, social services, play services and youth services work
together within a local authority, but my fear&#151;it is one that
exists in the youth service&#151;is that when it comes to considering
the spending on youth services compared with spending on, say, schools
or children in care, the youth service, which traditionally has been a
Cinderella service, may lose out. It really is important that the youth
service plays an important part in the new integrated children&#146;s
services. There are people in local government who advocate the youth
service and its
importance.</p><p><a name="06101743000332">One of the
things that the Community and Youth Workers Union has done is to review
the strategies provided by local authorities to the Government on the
way forward on integrated youth services. I am concerned that the youth
service gets no mention at all in 50 per cent. of those published
strategies. That reinforces my anxiety that it will lose out in the new
local government world. That is a challenge to the local authorities
but also to the people who work in the youth service. They must argue
strongly&#151;I know that they will&#151;about the importance of
their service.</p><p><a name="06101743000333">My
second point is about the need for a statutory basis for the youth
service and its work force plan, and the need for people who work with
young people to be professionally licensed. Those are all long-term
campaign aims of the TUC and the CYWU. The CYWU has long argued that
only with a statutory base can we be sure that the youth service will
have priority in local government services and resources. It is
interesting and coincidental that the Education and Inspections Bill is
in the other place this afternoon. Clause 6 places a requirement on
local authorities&#151;I stress
this&#151;</p><a name="61017h0003.htmbrev_142"><a name="06101743000427"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so far as
reasonably
practicable&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000334">to provide a
range of recreational provisions for 13 to 19-year-olds. There has been
substantial debate about whether the clause gives the statutory basis
that the youth service deserves and needs. I understand that the
Government are to introduce amendments to strengthen the youth service,
and I would be interested in hearing from the Minister, before the
debate in the other place this afternoon, what the Government&#146;s
thinking is about a statutory base for the youth
service.</p><p><a name="06101743000335">Thirdly, I
want to discuss current spending on the youth service. I am grateful
for the figures provided by the National Youth Agency. In the last
financial year, 2004-05, the average local authority spent &#163;75
per head of population on the youth service&#151;on young people aged
13 to 19. There was a lot of variation in what local authorities did.
The highest spender spent just over &#163;200; the lowest spender
spent &#163;23.23. My local authority, Nottinghamshire, spent
&#163;89.78, and the Minister&#146;s local authority,
Gloucestershire, spent &#163;74.22, which was about the average. It
is interesting to 
<br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 241WH</b><br>note that 13 local authorities spent less than &#163;50, well below
the average of &#163;75. I remind the Minister and his Department
that in &#147;Transforming Youth Work&#148;, one of the
Government&#146;s publications, the suggestion was made that the
average spend&#151;the appropriate amount&#151;should be
&#163;100 per young person. That shows that we still have a long way
to go. We can look at local authority spending on the youth service in
another way, as a percentage of total education spending. Again, I am
grateful to the NYA for providing the figures. In 2004-05, spending on
the youth service as a proportion of total education spending was 1.18
per cent., slightly down from 1.2 per cent. in 2003-04 and
significantly different from 1996-97, when the figure was
proportionally higher at 1.24 per cent. Spending on the youth service
is patchy.</p><p><a name="06101743000336">One of the
important things for the youth service has been the ability to
benchmark its spending against the Government grant. Using the youth
and communities sub-block allocation to local authorities, as defined
in the education formula spending, it is possible to see what the
Government are allocating and expecting local authorities to spend
against the actual spend. As I have argued before, the amount spent is
significantly below the expectation. I am concerned&#151;this is a
real challenge to the youth service&#151;that in funding integrated
services in future that spending will be contained in the children and
young persons&#146; services block, and it will not be possible to
disaggregate the amount of money spent on the youth service. I hope
that the Minister will consider that issue and that it will be
considered during the joint Treasury departmental spending
review.</p><p><a name="06101743000337">There is a
long history of local authorities trying to avoid spending on the youth
service. In the &#146;80s and &#146;90s, some local authorities
tried to stop spending on the youth service. The CYWU intervened and
stopped them from doing that. It is interesting that Bromley outsourced
its youth service and has now taken it back in-house. At the moment,
there are problems in Northamptonshire&#151;my hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) will speak about that&#151;with
youth workers being sacked and Ofsted finding the service
unsatisfactory.</p><p><a name="06101743000338">I do
not want to end on a dismal note. I am a strong believer in the youth
service. My local authority in Nottinghamshire has an excellent
service. I know that it faces hard choices in the future. It spends
&#163;6.5 million on youth services but because of budget planning it
is talking about reducing that by about &#163;500,000. However, I
want the good things&#151;such as the shadow exercise that took place
in Sherwood forest, the E2E project and the work that is done to
involve young people in monitoring Connexions&#151;to go forward. It
is important that we have a strong, statutory youth service that is
well resourced by local
government.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0003.htmordayhd_56"><a name="06101743000460">1.13

CYWU campaigned strongly against that and won a wide level of support
from the general public, the churches, for example, and other
organisations.</p><p><a name="06101743000340">In
principle I am not one of those who have a huge objection to
outsourcing to the independent and voluntary sector. However, the
CYWU&#146;s arguments in this case have all proved to be absolutely
accurate. If something is to be outsourced and contracted to the
independent and voluntary sector, there has to be a voluntary sector to
contract with. In this instance, there simply was not. The areas that
most need youth services are often those where the voluntary sector is
least active. For example, in the Goldings and Overstone Lodge estates
in my constituency, a door-to-door survey that I carried out with local
residents showed that their highest need was for some youth facilities.
It also showed a startling lack of access to services elsewhere in the
town and constituency.</p><p><a name="06101743000341">In Southfields estate, the one
person who did all the youth work was unfortunately very elderly and
died, and was profoundly missed by all of the young people. Some of the
mothers and I held a mini-fun day on the estate during the school
holidays to give the children something to do. I would rather do five
night sittings on the trot than do one fun day on a difficult estate,
because of the difficulty of the work. The mothers are determined to
carry on and set up something, and all credit to them.</p><p><a name="06101743000342">I applaud the voluntary sector
and the other parts of the statutory service for the work they do for
young people. For example, the county&#146;s music and performing
arts service, which my daughter has gone to since she was two years
old, is astounding. Fantastic work is done for youth sports and an
amazing job is done through the supplementary schools. However, there
is a bit missing. We have to ensure that we target the areas of
disadvantage. There is no point in hugging hoodies if we do not even
have them in a room to hug.
</p><p><a name="06101743000343">It is important that
we have a youth service with a clear commitment to dealing with the
issues of social disadvantage, which is given real guidance to ensure
that that happens. That is what I fear is now sadly missing in my
constituency. It is really important as things move forward,
particularly as we get integrated budgets, that the need to tackle
social disadvantage among young people and to reach difficult, excluded
young people is clearly carried out in the interests of our
communities. I am grateful to have had the chance to make this
point.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="61017h0003.htmordayhd_57"><a name="06101743000461">1.16

his youth service in Nottinghamshire, and I know that there is some
excellent work going on there&#151;make the best of that.</p><p><a name="06101743000345">I also welcome my hon. Friend
the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble). Obviously, there are
problems in her part of the world, as she has mentioned, and she has
been championing the issue in her constituency. I shall say a few words
about that in the course of my speech.</p><p><a name="06101743000346">First, I think that this is
absolutely the right time for this debate. It is an essential debate,
which the Government welcome. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood
said, the Government recently announced plans for a radical reform of
youth support services. &#147;Youth Matters&#148; laid out our
vision for youth support services. It emphasises the benefit of
bringing services together around the needs of young people through an
integrated youth support service. That will empower young people,
giving them more choice and influence over their services. Having said
that, I understand the comments that my hon. Friend made about the
youth service being a Cinderella and about where it stands in the
priorities of local authorities. I shall come on to that in a moment,
too.</p><p><a name="06101743000347">The reforms make
clear the Government&#146;s recognition of the great importance of
youth work and their commitment to make agencies and the services that
they deliver even more responsive to the needs of young people. I note
that some young people have just arrived in the Public Gallery to
listen to the debate; they are most welcome. I refer to local authority
youth services when I speak of youth work, but we do not overlook the
valuable youth work delivered by the range of trained professionals
based in other community and voluntary settings. &#147;Youth
Matters&#148; demonstrates the Government&#146;s recognition that
those delivering youth work are crucial to the impact of the
reforms.</p><p><a name="06101743000348">I shall
briefly summarise why those reforms were and are necessary. First,
despite tremendous enthusiasm, organisations providing services and
help for young people do not always work together as effectively or
imaginatively as they should. The result is that money and effort can
sometimes be wasted. Secondly, teenagers and their parents do not have
enough say in what is provided, which results in services not always
meeting individuals&#146; needs&#151;hence &#147;Youth
Matters&#148; and &#147;Youth Matters: Next Steps&#148;. Thirdly,
more can be done to prevent young people from drifting into a life of
poverty or crime. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood has
already mentioned the benefit of youth services in cutting crime and
antisocial
behaviour.</p><p><a name="06101743000349">We
passionately believe in having more integrated arrangements for
delivering youth support; support that helps the most disadvantaged in
a tailored way. That is why we look to Children&#146;s Trust
arrangements to lead the delivery of integrated youth support, of which
youth work is a key part. However, the impact of integrated
arrangements are limited if we focus attention on individual funding
streams in isolation. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood
made the pertinent point that we are not talking only about the early
years but about youth service and young people.</p><br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Oct 2006">


<notus-date day="17" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>17 Oct 2006 : Column 244WH</b><br><p><a name="06101743000350">Of course, as we embark on
reform, youth work itself will go through its own period of transition,
with its own challenges, and my hon. Friend described what has happened
in his area. Young people do not conform to single silos; the young
offender will often play truant, may have mental health problems, and
will often lack a stable family environment, so youth support must
operate in the wider playing field. I hope that Children&#146;s Trust
will help in that respect, bearing in mind the &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148; agenda and bringing services together.</p><p><a name="06101743000351">We want the new arrangements to
give youth work the chance to flourish; through it, young people can
achieve the outcomes that they want. We want to build on what is
working but we know that we have to do some things differently.
Inspection evidence tells us that about one in four youth services is
not performing adequately, and we all want to give young people more
than an adequate chance. We want to give young people the best whenever
we can.</p><p><a name="06101743000352">It is natural
that periods of transition such as those that youth services are going
through now should give rise to concerns about positions and roles. The
debate about youth service and youth work funding highlights that, but
I emphasise that integrated working does not mean a loss of identity
for youth work or for any other deliverer of youth support. I hope that
today&#146;s debate will highlight that for all local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06101743000353">I
hope that we can begin to think of funding for that aspect of youth
support as part of a wider pool of resources, which are meant to help
young people reach their potential by sharing knowledge with others.
Youth support can refine its strengths by learning from the experience
of others within the wider support services.</p><p><a name="06101743000354">The debate should not be
restricted to focusing on one service&#146;s funding and how it is
determined. We should take as our starting point the following
questions. How do we give young people the help they need? What is the
best way of delivering it? Who can deliver it, and how can we help them
to deliver it?</p><p><a name="06101743000355">I
welcome the call for a focus on the most disadvantaged, and for youth
work to be targeted there. For example, projects such as Late Zone in
Dartford recruit young people on the streets to come and visit them.
Late Zone is open on Friday nights between 10 pm and 11.30
pm; it is an informal information session and includes opportunities
for young people to access coffee bars and other activities. I would
like to see far more such projects; they reach out to young people at a
time when they most need it. Other projects such as Midnight Football
do similar work.</p><p><a name="06101743000356">However, we must recognise that
the young person&#146;s journey is fraught with change, including in
circumstances. All young people have needs, and they can find their
needs suddenly accelerating, which can put them outside the support
offered by the universal services. That is why we have introduced
target support pathfinders in 14 local authority areas; they will
inform those concerned as to how local user support services can be
best designed so that they can respond to the needs of the most
troubled young people. More detailed guidance will be issued later in
the year, based on findings from those pathfinder
projects.</p><p><a name="06101743000357">The
funding of youth work was mentioned by my hon. Friends. We want local
authorities to consider

Matters&#148;. That is why the Minister for Children and Families, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley
Hughes), wrote to all local authorities in early February. She made
clear that we are providing new funding for the youth opportunity and
youth capital funds of &#163;115 million over two years.</p><p><a name="06101743000358">Those two funds have been
received with great enthusiasm by young people and all who support
them. As a result, local authorities should not be making cuts to core
provision for youth work. They should instead be building on the
transforming youth agenda; and we want them to give priority to
spending on youth support in order to ensure that all young people
achieve the five &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; outcomes. Indeed,
my hon. Friend mentioned the 5.8 per cent. increase in his own local
authority area.</p><p><a name="06101743000359">In
total, &#163;1.6 billion is available for support services for young
people, and I want to see local authorities using those resources, as
local leaders of youth policy, to deliver effective services for young
people. I know that some issues are currently being considered in
relation to the youth service in Northamptonshire. Northamptonshire
county council is working to produce an action plan that responds to
the issues raised by Ofsted inspections. I assure my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, North that we shall be monitoring progress
closely. Ultimately, it is for local authorities to decide how much
they spend on local services, but I assure my hon. Friend that I am
happy to remain engaged; she was right to bring the matter to the
attention of the House
today.</p><p><a name="06101743000360">I welcome the
opportunity to look at the strengths of the current Education and
Inspections Bill. In the context of the move to integrated
arrangements, the Bill promotes integration by legislating on youth
work matters in order to help local authorities take changes forward.
The Bill strengthens previous outmoded legislation, and will help local
authorities to consider how best to use the wide range of resources
available to them to commission, facilitate and provide youth work. The
new duty will require local authorities, as far as possible, to secure
access for young people to sufficient educational leisure-time
activities in order to improve their well-being. Youth work is a
significant source of the current provision of such activities, and we
expect authorities to recognise the importance of youth work in meeting
the new duty. We will make that clear in statutory guidance. The
thematic view set up by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor earlier
this year rightly looks right across youth matters&#151;at the whole
landscape&#151;and sets out our vision until 2017. That marks a real
long-term commitment to services for young people, of which local
authority youth services will certainly be an important
part.</p><br>

Main (St. Albans) (Con):</b> This is not a debate about the
desirability of getting freight off our roads, hence the formation of
the title. It is a debate about the necessity of ensuring that rail
freight locations are correctly located in areas well served by direct
transport, road and rail links, and with minimum impact on local
communities.</p><p><a name="06101743000362">This is
not about nimbyism. I want to stress the need for a truly critical
appraisal of the merits of locating a large industrial facility in the
green belt accessed off local roads in areas of acknowledged traffic
congestion, poor air quality and noise pollution. In fact the
Department of Health&#146;s own 2006 health profile for St. Albans
accepts that our local air quality rating is below the accepted England
average. The Radlett area is a particular hot spot that contributes
significantly to that poor rating. I am seeking to outline to the
Minister why this particular proposal is an inappropriate development.
It is at an early stage, but I feel that I ought to make the case for
our communities. </p><p><a name="06101743000363">The
district council has already allocated &#163;500,000 of
taxpayers&#146; money to fight this proposal and given my concerns,
the views of the county council and the regional planning committee,
which I will seek to highlight later in my speech, I am asking the
Minister to call this decision in at the earliest possible
stage.</p><p><a name="06101743000364">I am sure that
the Minister agrees that this proposal must be robustly scrutinised in
terms of strict planning criteria and not pushed through as a result of
a desire by the Government to locate up to four new interchange sites
around a London hub. We must move away from the positive rhetoric of
the developer Helioslough as its proposals seek to gloss over the real
impact of this development and do not adequately address concerns over
the impact of increased traffic and green belt requirements. The
proposals also fail to fulfil locational requirements of the Strategic
Rail Authority&#146;s rail freight interchange policy document,
paragraph 4.2 of which states:</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_143"><a name="06101743000428"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Strategic RFIs tend to
be large commercial operations which...may not be considered
suitable adjacent to uses such as residential which may be sensitive to
the impact of noise and movements&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000365">Park Street is a village and
access from the site will be directly adjacent to residential homes and
along village roads. I, like many people, am in favour of getting
freight off our roads, but strategic rail freight interchanges must be
appropriately located. This former gravel working is a metropolitan
green belt site that ought to be returned to an acceptable amenity for
local residents.</p><p><a name="06101743000366">The

Friend on obtaining this important debate and on the lead she has taken
in addressing the issues surrounding the proposal. As well as
addressing technical rail issues, this debate is also important for
road traffic and strategic reasons, as she has rightly outlined, and
for even wider environmental reasons regarding the green belt. Does my
hon. Friend accept that anyone who looks at the proposal has to
consider whether it will have a massive impact on the green belt in
Hertfordshire, particularly in the area around St. Albans, Park Street,
London Colney and Radlett in my constituency? In effect, those
communities will coalesce into each other, and an area of green with
important environmental qualities will be
lost.</p><p><a name="06101743000369"><b><a name="61017h0004.htm_spnew410"><a name="06101743000513">Anne

important aspects of the green belt is to stop the coalescing of
smaller communities and that facility will indeed be lost should the
site be developed in that particular way.</p><p><a name="06101743000370">Helioslough&#151;the
proposed developer&#151;maintains that its study on the site shows
that Radlett is an optimum site with regard to location. That may be
its opinion as a result of its own study, but a county development
control report released on Monday 16 October profoundly disagrees with
that assertion. It states that the developers&#146; study is not
robust and that</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_146"><a name="06101743000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;officers
are also of the view that a location North of London is not that

the very special circumstances that would be necessary to warrant the
release of this Green Belt site are considered not to have been
adequately demonstrated by the applicant.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000372">It is not just local people who believe
that this green belt site is strategically important. The report says
that the site has not demonstrated any real reasons to show it should
be treated as an exceptional circumstance. The regional planning
sub-committee report also agrees with that conclusion on the green
belt, adding that</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_148"><a name="06101743000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
application is therefore not consistent with Policies SS7 and LA1 of
the Draft east of England
Plan&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000373">The
Radlett site proposes a large 3.5 million sq ft strategic rail
interchange, warehousing ancillary office developments served by the
rail sidings linked to the slow up-line&#151;the midland main
line&#151;with no direct motorway access. I do not wish to go on
about access on the rail line because it has not actually been
demonstrated that the site will get the additional capacity or access
to it: that is a transport issue, not the issue I am dealing with at
the moment.</p><p><a name="06101743000374">There is
no direct motorway access and all road access from the new signalised
roundabout on the north orbital will be off the A414. A direct road
access link for the proposal has already been refused and deemed
unacceptable by the highways authority, so all new and existing traffic
must still use local roads.</p><p><a name="06101743000375">County development

existing flows. Typically a traffic increase of 5% is considered to be
a material increase and therefore this development is likely to have a
significant impact on the road network.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000376">That would have a huge and detrimental
impact on local road networks.</p><p><a name="06101743000377">A report from the regional
planning sub-committee dated 6 October said
that</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_150"><a name="06101743000435"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;on the evidence

released on the strategic highway network and hence is not consistent
to the policy T3 for
access.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000378">Again, an
excellent planning reason to turn the proposal down.</p><p><a name="06101743000379">The impact on the local
roundabouts is less well defined in the developer&#146;s proposals,
but the county report says, from the scanty recommendations that are in
the developer&#146;s proposals,
that</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_151"><a name="06101743000436"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;officers are not
satisfied that the solutions offered will prove acceptable in either
congestion capacity or safety terms.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000380">It is also worth noting that in the
health outcomes for St. Albans, we have some of the highest road
traffic incidents, which is above the national average.</p><p><a name="06101743000381">Work by the Highways Agency for
the regional spatial strategy examination in public showed that
specific congestion issues were anticipated for this part of
Hertfordshire. Without the proposal, we are still anticipating a
massive impact on congestion, and the proposal will only add to that in
a detrimental way. The A414 in particular, which will provide the
access point, was highlighted as creating congestion issues. Any
highways problems that already occur on the M25, and they are numerous,
cause rat running and severe additional congestion. The addition of
thousands of extra lorries trying to access the site would cause mayhem
beyond comprehension.</p><p><a name="06101743000382">The traffic implications beyond
the two roundabouts that feature heavily in the developer&#146;s
application are also important. The developer seems to conveniently
forget that this will impact on the whole of St. Albans and my hon.
Friend&#146;s constituency as well. It is not just a Park Street and
Radlett proposal.</p><p><a name="06101743000383">The
Highways Agency does look further afield and is concerned about the
junctions where traffic joins the trunk road networks: junction 21A and
22 on the M25 and junction 3 of the A1(M). As a result of those
concerns, the Highways Agency has already issued a holding objection to
the proposal.</p><p><a name="06101743000384">The
proposed Park Street bypass, which has long been argued for by local
residents, is a key part of this scheme. Unfortunately, that will not
deliver the bypass scheme the residents wanted in order to get the
lorries that are already there out of Park Street and eliminate the
traffic that clogs the village. It will have no impact on the traffic
concerns of the Highways
Agency.</p><p><a name="06101743000385">With regard to
alleviating traffic within the village, it could be possible, for
example, to exclude heavy goods vehicle traffic from Park Street and
Frogmore, but the impact on HGVs that currently use Harper lane, the
B556, to access junction 22 of the M25 and on all related local car
movements will not be addressed by any bypass proposed for this
application and therefore it does not address current traffic concerns
and will only add to them. That remains a valid concern and was
accepted by the highways authority in its report.</p><br>

17.10, the county council is not convinced at this stage that the
proposed mitigation measures are adequate to address the problem. Nor
are the environmental implications for Radlett and Elstree fully
addressed. Overall, the report recommends refusal of the
application.</p><p><a name="06101743000388">The
employment forecast to do with strategic rail freight interchanges is
usually heralded as a good thing. The forecast for this proposal is
3,500 employees, but more than 50 per cent. of the staff are expected
to live outside Hertfordshire. The employment gains will be greater
than the level of supply in the local area, which is not a priority
area for regeneration. There will be little economic benefit to the
local area, merely increases in traffic congestion as people try to get
to work on already congested roads. In fact, the site is deemed to be
poorly located to attract necessary staff. Many of them will be unable
to live locally due to the constraints of the village and the fact that
house prices are extremely high, and many will be low-paid
workers.</p><p><a name="06101743000389">Point 5.6 of
the regional report
concludes:</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_153"><a name="06101743000438"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Other
locations may fit better with the regional policies on regeneration and
not require the length of commuting of this
site.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000390">This is vital. If
the Government truly wish to get traffic off our roads, they must
ensure that they are not busing and ferrying in people from other areas
just because they say that they want to get freight off the
roads.</p><p><a name="06101743000391">Contrary to the
developers&#146; proposals, the county believes that for the
developers to suggest that existing or improved local transport
services will serve 67 per cent. of potential employee catchment areas
is not credible in practical terms. There has been an attempt to
advance a case as to how bicycle and bus services could be improved,
but none of the proposals has been deemed credible. The document also
states:</p><a name="61017h0004.htmbrev_154"><a name="06101743000439"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
target non car mode share for journeys to work of 35 per cent. is
considered unachievable on the evidence presented...With no evidence
that practical difficulties can be
overcome.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06101743000392">All that means
that the proposal does not, cannot and probably never will meet
planning policy guidance note 13
requirements.</p><p><a name="06101743000393">Again, I
question the developers&#146; proposals, which I know the Minister
will have on her desk in the not-too-distant future. The highly
selective theoretical noise projection tables included in the proposal
include no actual noise readings from the seven existing rail freight
interchange sites. I myself have stood in Park Street with a monitor
and I can tell the Minister that noise levels already well exceed the
European decibel levels. Supporting data for traffic generation were
helpfully gleaned from the Daventry site, but noise readings were not
included. I feel that that was possibly because they would do little to
bolster the
proposal.</p><p><a name="06101743000394">The noise
calculations are based on the questionable theoretical premise that
there will be an 89 per cent. decrease in traffic flow through Park
Street. I dealt with that earlier. In fact, the majority of traffic
that currently goes through Park Street will not be tempted to use the
bypass. The bypass will merely serve as a link

decreased traffic flow through Park Street and Frogmore are questioned
by both county and region in their reports. I know that my hon. Friend
the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) has massive
concerns, as do many Radlett residents, who feel that the traffic
impacts may well be much
greater.</p><p><a name="06101743000395">How can it be
possible to direct not only HGV traffic but all traffic going east on
the M25 or north via the M10/Ml through the strategic rail freight

will see a massive increase in rat-running to avoid the
detours.</p><p><a name="06101743000396">I seek
assurances from the Minister today that she will not take at face value
the blithe assurances on the part of the developer that the scheme will
benefit the area. In fact, it will have a catastrophic impact. It is
completely contrary to green belt policy. It fails on many transport
accounts, and the residents are looking to the Minister to take an
objective planning decision on the proposal where it fails on all
accounts. I would welcome assurances from her on how much weight she
will place on the views of local people, the local district and county
councils&#151;the district has yet to express a view on this; it has
a hearing on it on 1 November&#151;and the regional planning
committee, which I have quoted extensively. I trust that when she has
examined all their evidence, she will robustly reject the
proposal.</p><p><a name="06101743000397">May I add a
footnote to that? It has cost so much money to fight these large
developers. Local authorities feel totally disadvantaged in their fight
against massive, inappropriate development that they believe the

site owner, submitted an outline planning application for the proposal
to St. Albans district council on 28 July. I understand that it seeks

served on the council a direction under article 14 of the Town and
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, which
prevents it from taking a decision on whether to grant planning

December&#151;the end of this year&#151;unless sufficient
information has been provided before then to satisfy the agency, given
its criteria and the issues that it has to take account of as part of
the planning process. That does not preclude the council from
considering the application or determining its views on other aspects
of the application. Given that concerns are always raised about the
time scale of consideration of planning applications, it is right that
councils should be able to consider other aspects simultaneously while
Highways Agency concerns are explored. Nevertheless, until a
satisfactory conclusion is found to the agency&#146;s concerns, the
article 14 direction must remain in place, which means that the council
will be unable to reach a final decision on the

refuse planning permission, of course the applicant will have the right
to lodge an appeal with the Secretary of State. If the council is
minded to grant planning permission, the application will be referred
to the Secretary of State for consideration. There is a 21-day period
within which the decision must be made on whether the application
should be called in for the Secretary of State&#146;s determination.
Should the matter be called in by the Secretary of State, there would
need to be a public inquiry, which would look into all these
matters.</p><p><a name="06101743000402">In view of
that and of the fact that the Secretary of State may well have to take
a series of decisions relating to this case, it is clear that I cannot
discuss the merits of the application. It would be improper for me to
do so, as it could be seen to prejudice the case or fetter the
Secretary of State&#146;s discretion, should she decide to call it in
for her own determination or should it go to appeal&#151;or, indeed,
prejudice the call-in decision itself. I know that the hon. Lady has
requested that the matter should be called in. I must make it clear
that there are of course clear rules on the way Ministers deal with

issues that need to be taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06101743000403">Hon. Members
are right to say that there is a wider need to get freight on to rail
rather than roads, given the need to cut carbon emissions and as part
of a long-term strategy to safeguard the environment, in this country
and around the world. I understand that the examination in public of
the east of England plan identifies the need for one strategic rail
freight interchange for the east of England, and that the Strategic
Rail Authority&#146;s submission to the plan stated that at least one
rail freight interchange needed to be accommodated within the east of
England region, serving broadly the north quadrant of London and
adjacent parts of the east of

site-specific recommendation was made; it also noted, particularly on
the employment issue, that the site at Radlett was not a good fit.
There were also massive concerns about the road links, which also meant
that there was not a particularly good fit. The report merely accepted
the general location policy for the east of England, which is a very
large area, and certainly did not come down in support of our

Secretary of State has not yet responded to the examination in public
of the east of England plan, and will need to do so in due course. As I
understand the position, the panel does not identify any particular
location, and clearly such matters need to be taken into account when
planning applications are examined. We can note the points raised by
the panel and the report commissioned for the East of England
Development Agency, which suggests that there is an increasing need for
rail freight services resulting from major container port schemes and
the ability of the rail infrastructure to accommodate the increase in
demand, but we need to be clear that that must not prejudge any
planning application, and certainly not one that must go to the
Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06101743000406">With planning
applications it is necessary to consider a series of site-specific
details, including the designation of the land as greenfield,
brownfield or in the green belt&#151;and, given the importance of
protecting the green belt, wider considerations must be taken into
account. It is also necessary to consider a wider range of details
concerning applications, such as transport, impact on the area and
economic
considerations.</p><p><a name="06101743000407">As I
mentioned earlier, I understand that the Highways Agency is seeking
further technical data from the applicant on the impact of the proposal
on the motorway and trunk roads involved. I know that the Highways
Agency is already seriously considering the traffic implications, as it
does in every case, to ensure that they are properly taken into
account.</p><p><a name="06101743000408"><b><a name="61017h0004.htm_spnew414"><a name="06101743000517">Anne
Main:</b> The Highways Agency, as the Minister points out, is
looking at the implications of the wider effect of the proposals, which
the developer&#146;s proposal does not deal with. However, the
highways authority has already made site-specific observations on the
predicted impact and has considered that it is not acceptable. I hope
that, although further data may bring solutions to other parts of the
equation, specific weight will be given to the existing fact of the
almost intractable problems on the
site.</p><p><a name="06101743000409"><b><a name="61017h0004.htm_spnew415"><a name="06101743000518">Yvette
Cooper:</b> As I have said, it would be improper for me to
comment on the detail of the Highways Agency&#146;s views at this
stage. It would be inappropriate given the Secretary of State&#146;s
potential role in the process. The Highways Agency&#146;s views need
to be taken into account by local councils and planning inspectors as
well as by the Secretary of State. As I have also made clear, we give
the Highways Agency additional powers through article 14 directions to
prevent decisions on planning permissions being made when there is not
satisfactory information about the implications for the road
infrastructure in the area&#151;particularly major road
infrastructure such as motorways and trunk roads. That is precisely to
ensure that the planning system properly takes account of transport
considerations, wherever the application is
made.</p><p><a name="06101743000410"><b><a name="61017h0004.htm_spnew416"><a name="06101743000519">Anne
Main:</b> As a matter of clarification, given that no relevant
noise readings were included in the proposals for traffic impact and
transport impact, would the Minister expect noise impact facts and
figures as part of the environmental
statement?</p><br>

Cooper:</b> Again, it would be inappropriate for me to comment
on the details of the application, the factors that would need to be
taken into account or the level of evidence that would be required on
particular issues. In general terms we require consideration against
local plan considerations and issues to do with the green belt,
transport, the environment, noise, pollution, climate change and the
need for economic development. A wide range of issues need to be
weighed in the balance by local planning authorities when they consider
major applications such as the one we are discussing.</p><p><a name="06101743000412">The green belt is an important
factor, because green belts are a long-standing element of planning
policy, to which we attach great importance. Many businesses operate
within the green belt and people live there, so clearly there must be
ways in which it can respond to those conditions. Equally, however, we
set particularly strong tests for new and future development in the
green belt. Those are embedded in the planning policy
statements.</p><p><a name="06101743000413">The local
planning authority also needs to consider wider issues set out in
planning policy statement 1, the main planning policy statement for
development. Those are issues to do with sustainability and the
recognition that our quality of life depends on transport and easy
access to jobs, services and shopping, but that there is also a need to
sustain our communities for the longer
term.</p><p><a name="06101743000414">I think,
therefore, that it is right that in the first instance the matter
should be considered by the local planning authority. It is a matter to
be considered first by that authority and the Highways Agency, before

it down there may be a chance of appeal, in which case the Secretary of
State will have a role at that point. Should the planning application
be accepted, the Secretary of State will need to take a view on whether
the proposal should be called
in.</p><p><a name="06101743000415">I recognise the
strong feelings that the hon. Members for St. Albans and for Hertsmere
(Mr. Clappison) have about this matter and I understand that
they would like the case to be called in rather than decided by the
local authority. We think it important that at this stage the local
authority should take the first view, before the Secretary of State
takes a decision&#151;before the matter is referred to the Secretary
of State to decide whether the proposal should be called
in.</p><p><a name="06101743000416">I assure hon.
Members that whenever call-in proposals are put forward the Secretary
of State gives serious consideration to all the relevant circumstances
to make sure that an application is appropriate for call-in. We take
the view that we should not call in cases that can better be decided at
local level by local planning authorities. Therefore it is right to
continue with the approach under which it is deemed that only a small
minority of cases should be called in for determination by the
Secretary of State. Nevertheless, within any individual case we always
take the points that are made very seriously.</p><p><a name="06101743000417">In the circumstances, it is not
