</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51101h01_spnew0"><b> Mark Fisher  (Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</b>  (Lab): I am conscious of, and grateful for, the good fortune that allows me to raise this issue. For those women in Britain who have breast cancer and who are HER2 positive, it is literally a matter of life and death. If treated with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drug Herceptin, it is likely&#151;indeed, it is almost certain&#151;that, in the first year after they are diagnosed, 50 per cent. of those women will survive and lead a full and normal life. If the drug is not available to them, they will suffer and die.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">Other cancer drugs, wonderful though they are, tend to have a success rate of 3, 4, 5 and 6 per cent. That is a good success rate for cancer drugs. However, the success rate for Herceptin is without precedent. It is 50 per cent. It has led the eminent oncologist, Professor Ian Smith, to describe the trials on Herceptin as the &quot;most stunning&quot; data that he has ever known throughout his career.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">The brilliant scientists who developed the drug won the Nobel prize in the 1980s. It has been developed by the pharmaceutical company Roche at a cost of about &#163;900 million. In the past two weeks, <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> has given the drug a peer review. I&nbsp;am no expert on such matters but, by all accounts, the journal is the most rigorous and highly respected medical journal in the world. It stated that the drug really is as good as everyone hoped that it was. It is a potential savour. Yet, it is not generally available in this country.
</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51101h01_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): No one in the Chamber would speak against prescribing Herceptin to those who will benefit from it. Does my hon. Friend agree that describing it as a magic bullet masks the reality that it can have serious side effects and that its benefits may be less than the breathless press coverage suggests? Does he accept that such matters can skew finite research resources away from, say, hepatitis, dementia or prostrate cancer where clinical needs and patient benefits are every bit as great?
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51101h01_spnew2"><b> Mark Fisher </b> : My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. When referring to new developments, it is, of course, always right not to overstate them and raise people&#039;s expectations. There is nothing more cruel for people with breast cancer than to believe that the drug will solve all problems. It will not; only 23 per cent. of women with breast cancer are HER2 positive and it can help only them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">I thoroughly disagreed with my hon. Friend when he said that there are substantial problems. I cannot claim&nbsp;to have read the whole of the report on the drug in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 186WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. I would not have understood it even if I had, but eminent clinicians say that the drug really is as good as everyone said. As for his further point that it would divert resources, it should not do that. If it is as good and will save the lives of women with breast cancer, we need resources directed at the drug. On the whole, I do not share my hon. Friend&#039;s reservations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">Given that the drug is so extraordinary, why is it not available in Britain? It is now available for late-stage breast cancer, but oncologists will prescribe it for women who can afford to pay for it and that is not a satisfactory solution. We are talking about a matter of life and death. It should not be about where a person lives and whether she can afford the drug. There should not be a market in the drug. It is saving lives. It should be used to save the lives of all the women who can be treated by it successfully.
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51101h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Nick Gibb  (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</b>  (Con): On the point about paying for drug, a huge number of people went on a sponsored walk in Rose Green in my constituency to raise &#163;20,000 to enable Mrs. Chris McKrill, a district nurse, to pay for the dosage of the Herceptin that she needs to secure recovery. Does that not show that there is public support for prescribing the drug on the NHS? Does the hon. Gentleman agree that anyone diagnosed with breast cancer should automatically have the test for the presence of HER2?
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51101h01_spnew4"><b> Mark Fisher </b> : I entirely agree, and I will come to the general availability of testing&#151;or lack of it&#151;in a minute. At the moment, the only cases that we know about are in those areas where there have been trial tests. That is how I came to be involved in the subject in a slight way, because Stoke-on-Trent was one of the areas chosen for testing. For that reason, women with breast cancer in my constituency&#151;and in other areas, including Somerset, along the south coast, Devon and Cornwall&#151;have been made aware that they are HER2 positive and so might be susceptible to the benefits of the drug.
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51101h01_spnew5"><b> Paul Farrelly  (Newcastle-under-Lyme)</b>  (Lab): I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, because I have a Select Committee to go to; I am afraid that I will not be here at the close of the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">On testing, does my hon. Friend welcome the Secretary of State&#039;s statement over the summer and her generally sympathetic response on the issue, not least in making testing available to sufferers, so that they can see whether they might benefit from Herceptin and whether they are, in the jargon, HER2 positive? Also, does he agree that there seems to be an anomaly, in that the statement seems to suggest that testing will be given to those newly diagnosed with breast cancer, but not to existing sufferers? Does he agree that that position is not defensible, and that the Minister should address that when she responds?
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51101h01_spnew6"><b> Mark Fisher </b> : My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Anybody who cares about the subject must want testing to be universally available. Everybody should be tested; only then will we know who can be helped by the testing, and only then will the Government, and primary 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 187WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
care trusts, know definitively the scale of the problem and so will be able to work out the cost and a way of getting treatment to the people who need it. So, yes, my hon. Friend makes an essential point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">The Secretary of State&#039;s involvement and interest is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrifically encouraging, but testing has got to be widespread and general. At the moment, it is partial. That probably accounts for the fact that the matter is not a major national issue yet. Only in those areas where there has been testing have women, and therefore their parliamentary representatives, really been made aware of it.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">As I say, I came across the issue in Stoke-on-Trent because women are being tested there. The circumstances of many women are extremely upsetting. Like the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibb), I have a constituent&#151;Dorothy Griffiths&#151;who has raised money for her treatment, but she is determined that it should be generally available, and not just to those lucky enough to be able to afford it, or to find&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means of affording it. There are women such as Joanne Leese, 31, who is from my constituency. She was diagnosed with breast cancer while she was pregnant, and therefore had to wait until she had given birth to begin treatment. She now has a son aged 11, and she started treatment for breast cancer the day after she gave birth, her son having been prematurely induced. She wants her son to grow up knowing her; at the moment, if she cannot get Herceptin, she will not see her son get older.

</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51101h01_spnew7"><b> Annette Brooke  (Mid-Dorset and North Poole)</b>  (LD): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Secretary of State for Health said, at a Breakthrough Breast Cancer meeting last week in Methodist Central hall, that Herceptin should not be refused by any primary care trust solely on the grounds of cost? Does he agree that it would be very helpful if the Minister could say how that will be communicated to PCTs, so that we get rid of the postcode lottery?
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51101h01_spnew8"><b> Mark Fisher </b> : I had noted that remark and, indeed, the Secretary of State&#039;s evidence to the Select Committee on 27 October, in which she said that the matter was one for PCTs, and that they should proceed with the issue. She then gave her support to the drug. However what she said rather clouds the issue. It is no good saying that prescription for the drug is a matter for PCTs if they cannot afford it, and we cannot leave the issue of whether women die from the disease to the financial skills of PCT managers around the country. This is not really a local matter; it needs to be decided nationally and we need guidance and a lead from the Minister. She cannot hide behind the PCTs and say, &quot;It&#039;s over to you. You make the decisions and find the money.&quot; Most PCTs&#151;or very many of them&#151;are heavily in debt, and the women in those PCTs could be denied this drug simply because of those financial problems. This national problem should be dealt with nationally, and that applies as much to diagnosis as to prescription.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">Some very small PCTs do not have oncologists on the panels that make such decisions. A PCT in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) had to decide a case last week, but felt that its panel did not 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 188WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have the necessary professional expertise. It had to defer its decision and look outside the panel for that expertise. That is not a problem for a PCT in a big city such as Leeds or Manchester, but it is a genuine problem across the country. We cannot leave this issue to the vagaries of, and disparities between, PCTs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">This problem affects women all over the country, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of where they live or of the financial circumstances of their PCTs, this issue should be decided on the basis of clinical need. PCTs in deficit are unlikely to feel that they can afford to prescribe the drug. They need not only guidance and a lead from the Secretary of State, but some help.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">I have mentioned two cases in my constituency, and there are others: a staff nurse is using her life savings because, as she said, she wants to live to see her daughter walk down the aisle. The husband of another sufferer has just lost his job, and she now wonders whether she will be able to remortgage her house to pay for the Herceptin that may keep her alive. She does not know whether she will get a remortgage, given that her husband is now out of work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">I am very conscious that we should not decide these things on the emotional context. Nevertheless, we ought all to be aware of that context, and I am sure that we are. These matters are not simple but they concern people&#039;s lives and hopes, and we should therefore at least be aware of the emotional context, even if that is not the sole factor.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">What are the problems? Why is Herceptin not being prescribed? It is licensed for late-stage treatment, but giving it for late-stage breast cancer means that the patient has to be on the drug for the rest of her life,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however long that is, and that is very expensive. Moreover, the drug will never cure them. Herceptin is not licensed for early-stage breast cancer, when 12 months&#039; treatment is enough to decide whether the patient can be cured. As the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) suggested, not everybody is tested, so there are no national statistics. That inhibits the debate.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">Herceptin is not yet approved by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and is not licensed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which is the Minister&#039;s particular responsibility. We shall be very interested to hear what she has to say about that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">Until recently, few primary care trusts would prescribe Herceptin; they were waiting for formal approval, as is understandable and correct. However, the drug is now prescribed widely, off-licence, in other countries such as France. Waiting for a drug as well proved and mature as Herceptin to be licensed is not as essential, I understand, as it might appear to the layperson.
</p>






<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51101h01_spnew9"><b> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North)</b>  (Lab): As my hon. Friend will know, in the early stages, the drug is directed against a certain characteristic of the cells that express the HER2 receptor. That receptor is present in both late and early stages, so there is no scientific or medical reason why the drug should not be used at both stages. What is the point of NICE in all this? If NICE is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 189WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
examining the issue and giving out a message, what is happening between it and the PCTs? What is the point of NICE?
</p>






<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51101h01_spnew10"><b> Mark Fisher </b> : It is not for me to say; I suspect that the Minister will have a clear view on that. However, my hon. Friend makes a good point; given his medical and scientific expertise, I think that he will be listened to carefully.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">The drug is not yet approved by NICE. As a result, until quite recently, few PCTs were anxious to prescribe it; they wanted to wait and see. Roche has not yet applied for a licence. I spoke to people from Roche yesterday and I asked what the delay was. They said, &quot;Licence applications are very difficult. This one will probably have 3,000 pages of text and analysis. We have not finished it, but we hope to do so and apply for a licence in February. It should not take very long then.&quot; Nevertheless, Roche emphasised that we do not have to wait for the licence. Oncologists want to prescribe the drug and they feel safe about doing so. It is being prescribed in other countries, such as France and Canada. I do not think that that necessarily is a full explanation about why it is not being prescribed in this country.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">The drug is undoubtedly expensive; it costs &#163;21,000 for a year&#039;s treatment. However, the Secretary of State told the Select Committee on 27 October that cost is not an issue. Perhaps it is not an issue for her&#151;it is rather encouraging to hear that she believes that this should be paid for&#151;but it is one for many PCTs that are millions of pounds in debt. It is not a satisfactory solution for the&nbsp;Secretary of State simply to say to PCTs that are &#163;10&nbsp;million or &#163;15 million in debt, &quot;Cost is no problem, go on and do it.&quot; It is not satisfactory that women in those PCTs should be penalised for whatever the financial problems of those PCTs are.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">The drug has terrific cost benefits. If a diagnosis is made in the early stages of breast cancer, it can be cured and the direct saving of cost to the NHS is enormous. If, as now, it is prescribed only at a late stage, the cost of the treatment through Herceptin and the chemotherapy associated with it will be considerable for a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years. It is in everybody&#039;s interest&#151;the patient&#039;s, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCT&#039;s, the Government&#039;s and the national health service&#039;s&#151;that it is prescribed at an early stage, when it can save lives rather than simply prolong them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">Those cost benefits do not take into account the indirect cost benefits to the state. If these women die, the costs of the people who are dependent on them&#151;young children and dependent parents&#151;will fall considerably on the state. The knock-on costs of not prescribing the drug at an early stage are considerable. As we do not know how many people in the country are suitable to have the drug, we cannot calculate those costs. That is yet another reason for getting on with the testing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">Where are we with this issue? Women with money and access to the finances receive the drug. Women in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and now Leeds are receiving it; I gather there was also a case in the Wyre valley last week. It is more widely available in the south of England than in the north. In the midlands, it is hardly available at all. Why is there yet another postcode lottery, when postcode lotteries in health have been so discredited and reviled? I cannot understand it, and it is not acceptable.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 190WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">I understand the difficult position that the Minister is in and the fact that she, as all Members of this House do, cares very much about the fate of these women. However, there are things that it is right that we ask her and the Government to do. First, we must make testing generally available now, so that we know how many people can be helped by this drug. Secondly, we must give clear guidance to the PCTs now. It is not enough simply to give encouragement to them. They need to know that the Government are behind them and will back them up financially. This is not a local decision and should not be left as such.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">Will the Minister take the issue back to the Secretary of State, so that she can reconsider her decision that&nbsp;this is a local decision? It is not a local decision. Discussions should be entered into with Roche. That &#163;21,000 might, in some ways, be a negotiable figure, particularly if the drug is widely prescribed and therefore the unit costs ought, logically, to come down&#151;although once &#163;900 million has been invested, that will take some time. Also, amazingly, Roche&#039;s patent expires in 2011, so it does not have much time to recoup its costs. Nevertheless, with the Secretary of State&#039;s influence and strong position, it would be helpful if she entered into discussions with Roche.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">Finally, the Secretary of State really must enter into discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury now. More money is going to be needed for this. In Government terms, it is not a huge sum of money, but it is more money than the primary care trusts can find. There has to be some additional funding from the Treasury to recognise the potential of this drug. Those are not unreasonable requests and they make good sense.
</p>






<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51101h01_spnew11"><b> Dr. Gibson </b> : Does my hon. Friend realise that there may be another 100 cancer drugs in the pipeline over the next five years, so we had better get this one right before we address the others?
</p>






<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51101h01_spnew12"><b> Mark Fisher </b> : Yes, but I suspect that my hon. Friend understands more than me how particularly effective this drug is and how startling, compared with other drugs, the percentage of cure is. Of course, he is right. This is not the only drug now; it is not the only drug in the future. But it is one that we believe, and <i>The New England Medical Journal</i> believes, can save a great many lives. It is a matter of life and death.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">Where women live should not determine whether they get this drug. On behalf of those women, I say to the Secretary of State, let them live. Let them have this drug. Let them be tested. Let its availability not be dependent on where they live or how much money they have, but on the national health service, which has served this country well. I beg the Secretary of State not to turn her back on these women. The Government must act on testing, on guidance and on finance. If these women are to be saved, they must act now.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
sense. May I also congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) on initiating this extremely important debate?


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">I have a small personal interest to declare, albeit not a financial interest as far as I am aware at this stage. Right in the middle of the general election campaign, horrifyingly enough, my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I remember going to see the surgeon who said, &quot;Oh yes, I&#039;ve arranged a date for surgery. It will be 5&nbsp;May.&quot; Sarah and I had to explain why that would not be appropriate. She is now in the middle of her chemotherapy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">I understand that Herceptin is not suitable for women who are in the middle of chemotherapy. Therefore, I&nbsp;presume that it would not be suitable for Sarah. But the interesting point is that as far as I am aware&#151;I have not checked her notes&#151;she was not tested for HER2 and she certainly was not offered the opportunity of having Herceptin. Although it would not now be appropriate for her to have it, I would be interested to know whether it would have changed the course of her treatment, which is a tough business by any standards, as many here will know.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">I was very impressed when I attended the Breakthrough Breast Cancer lobby last Tuesday. What a well organised lobby it was. We are all subjected to all kinds of lobbies from all kinds of different interest groups. Breakthrough Breast Cancer organised a superb lobby and told us all precisely what to do. One thing it told us to do was to get in touch with our local primary care trust and discover whether Herceptin would be prescribed automatically and whether testing was done. Being an efficient bunny I did exactly that. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote to my PCT and I got the reply this morning. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote simply asking whether North Wiltshire and Kennet primary care trust would prescribe Herceptin.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">I spent six years at university so I pride myself in not being too dim, but I shall read out the reply carefully. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;We have funded the full drug uplift&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">whatever that might be&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;which has been recommended nationally, in all major acute providers for 2005/2006. This means that Trusts are free to make clinical decisions about any new/high cost drugs without having to come back to the PCTs for financial approval.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The planning process for 2006/2007 is just starting and within that we will take full account of emerging national guidance on the prescribing of Herceptin.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">I have read that about six times and the meaning is just dimly beginning to come through to me. At the moment, the Government say that hospitals can make up their own minds on the subject&#151;the PCT does not have to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide&#151;but that they will none the less take full account of emerging national guidance over the next few months. Frankly, if I sent that letter to a constituent, particularly one who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, and said, &quot;Here is what the local NHS has to say on Herceptin&quot;, it would make the situation a great deal worse than it is at the moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">One thing that we must do&#151;perhaps it will be an outcome of the debate&#151;is to clarify to the many thousands of women being diagnosed year by year with breast cancer what Herceptin is for and whether they 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 192WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
will be automatically tested for it. The question of testing is extremely important. I think that only 35 per cent. of PCTs test for HER2. Such testing should be universal. Will women be tested for it; will they be suitable for Herceptin? If they are suitable, will their local PCT or the local hospital deal with the issue?


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">Frankly, the architecture of the health service is an academic matter. It may interest the Minister and others in this Room, but my constituents who have been diagnosed today with breast cancer do not care whether it is the PCT, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority, the national health service in London or the Bath Royal United hospital that deals with the issue. My constituents want to know whether Herceptin will work for them and whether Her Majesty&#039;s Government, or the national health service, will pay for it. Those are the important things. Sending out confusing letters is not helpful. Some of the language that we have heard is exactly what the national health service should not be using. It is national; it is the health service. Her Majesty&#039;s Government are responsible for it because it uses taxpayers&#039; money. We want to know from the Government whether they will make automatic testing for Herceptin available and whether the drug will be available more generally than it is at the moment.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">Incidentally, I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). He is absolutely right to say that many more breakthrough drugs for all kinds of cancer will come along in the next few years as science develops rapidly, so getting the protocol right for this breakthrough drug now is desperately important for the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">Many other hon. Members want to take part in this very important debate, so I shall conclude with a relevant issue that is a particular hobby-horse of mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the establishment of NICE. It is perfectly reasonable and sensible that there should be a Government organisation set up to examine the efficaciousness of drugs. Some drugs work for some people and some drugs do not. It is absolutely right that the Government should examine which are which. However, the word that we do not like in the task given to NICE is &quot;cost-effective&quot;. NICE should determine whether drugs are effective&#151;whether they work. NICE should determine whether Herceptin would have been appropriate in my wife&#039;s case. That should be a clear and straightforward matter. It should then say to the Government and to the national health service whether the drug is good, bad or indifferent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">Of course, the situation may be much more complicated than that. NICE might say that the drug is good in some cases, but not in others. However, it should not have to say, &quot;This is a good drug. It works, but we are not certain that the Government can afford it.&quot; The affordability of drugs should be a matter for the Government&#151;for politicians. It should be up to the Minister of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), to stand up this morning and say&#151;this may well not be the case&#151;&quot;NICE has said that this is a brilliant drug. It works. However, I am awfully sorry but my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that he is spending the money this year on schools, so the money will not be available for Herceptin.&quot; That would be a perfectly legitimate political decision to take&#151;a tough 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 193WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
decision, but perfectly legitimate. To shuffle off the decision about whether the drug is cost-effective to an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anonymous organisation called NICE, which few people know, seems to me to be less acceptable. The Government should come to a conclusion as to whether the drug is cost-effective as well as effective; that should not be left to NICE.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">We need greater clarity. My local PCT, like many others, is massively in debt&#151;to the tune of millions of pounds. Is the decision up to the PCT? In that case, I fear that the nice people who run my local PCT will have to say, &quot;Well, I&#039;m awfully sorry, but I&#039;m going to be faced with a choice between closing two or three&nbsp;community hospitals&quot;&#151;there is a debate in this Chamber tomorrow on community hospitals&#151;&quot;and making Herceptin available.&quot; That should not be a decision that it takes. It should not be a decision that the Bath Royal United hospital takes, because it is deeply in debt. That decision should be taken by the NHS; it is a national health service, and if this drug works, it must be available to all.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">I hope that the Minister echoes some of the remarks that the Secretary of State made at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer lobby meeting last Tuesday. She made encouraging comments on this matter at that meeting. The Government agree with me about what is the right&nbsp;direction, so I do not want to press them unduly. However, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the drug works, that testing is essential and should be universal rather than done on a postcode basis, and that it should be the Government who decide whether it is affordable. If it is, I would also like her to explain the mechanism by which it will be paid for.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">I congratulate the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central on asking the right questions so well. He is right: we need to know from the Government today&#151;as do the tens of millions of women throughout Britain who have a keen personal interest in this subject&#151;whether the drug will be made available, on what basis it will be made available and who will pay for it.

If, as a result of this debate secured by my hon.

<a name="51101h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">I congratulate my hon. Friend. We and other Members of Parliament from north Staffordshire met our constituents in the summer, and it is clear that we are totally behind them in their campaign, from north Staffordshire, to make Herceptin available throughout the country.

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">Over the weekend, there was much press speculation and discussion about a conference in Birmingham that was attended by more than 1,000 people. As I tuned into&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;various media shows, I heard how much the Government wanted to listen to people&#151;wanted to

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
listen to those 1,000 people about the way forward for the health service. I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that 37,000 people in north Staffordshire have signed a petition; they simply want the Government and the Secretary of State to listen to what they are saying about Herceptin.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">It is important to set out, as the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central did, the real issues that we are dealing with. We are dealing with the long term and the short term in respect of the way in which the NHS is able to provide care across the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">I have followed this matter carefully since we first had&nbsp;meetings with our constituents in the early summer months, and I think that the Government have made a lot of progress, and I commend them on that. In particular, it is good that the Government have now said that there will be testing throughout the country. I assume that that means that they have conceded that it is almost certain that NICE will approve the licensing once the drug has gone through its submission from Roche to the European licensing structure and then on to NICE. As we are to have national testing, I also assume that the necessary machinery will be put in place, and that finance will subsequently be put in place, and that guidance will follow in order to ensure that anyone diagnosed now will have that testing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">Those bureaucratic hurdles must be overcome, and other hurdles that are not bureaucratic must also be overcome. I genuinely believe that we need to have a proper licensing structure. I assume that when they have been overcome and everything is in place, there will not&nbsp;be any problem in the long term with people being able to access Herceptin as a NICE treatment, as the Government are starting to put those particular bits of the machinery in place. I welcome the decision about testing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">I also welcome the statement that the Health Minister in the other place made on 19 October. He said that a review of how the NHS pays for expensive treatments and expensive drugs would be undertaken. I gather that that review will be completed in December. I hope that the debate on the non-availability of Herceptin will be able to contribute to that review.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">When I raised the issue at Prime Minister&#039;s questions almost a fortnight ago, I felt that I received a sympathetic response from the Prime Minister. He acknowledged that NICE&#039;s drug-approval system is not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working quickly enough, not only in approving Herceptin but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) pointed out, the other new cancer treatments that are about to be introduced as a result of technological advances. The Prime Minister&#039;s response suggested that we must do more, more speedily; however, we must to do it effectively, too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">In response to the intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), there is no way that we want to be in a situation in which we say that drugs that will cause other serious medical illnesses should be prescribed. I accept that the Government are looking to do more, which I welcome and on which I congratulate them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">When it comes to the short-time issue, however, I feel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angry. The Government are almost hiding behind bureaucracy and the machinery that is in place. As my

<br>&nbsp;<br>
hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central pointed out, we have a system whereby tests have been ongoing for five years with the manufacturers Roche. We now know that 50 per cent. of the women who have tested for HER2 positive status could benefit, and they are now having that treatment. A huge sense of injustice and unfairness is building because treatment is being considered on a case-by-case basis. I could understand that if case by case meant that the consultant clinician said, &quot;You have tested positive for HER2; therefore Herceptin can make a real difference to your treatment. The primary care trusts will decide whether to agree that treatment in exceptional cases.&quot; However, each primary care trust has to reinvent the wheel while NICE assesses whether to approve the treatment. That cannot be right. Why, for example, should the North Stoke primary care trust have to fund research into whether the outcome of the New England review will be as cost-effective as we have been led to believe in order for it to be able to prescribe Herceptin subject to conditions?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">We have NICE, yet every primary care trust in the country is seeking to establish that it will prescribe the drug cost-effectively for the small group of women who are now known to be HER2 positive and who need the treatment now. Those women cannot wait to be treated, yet the NHS is denying them the treatment because the Government are hiding behind NICE.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">Following meetings that I&#151;along with colleagues in north Staffordshire&#151;have had with the women who are waiting to be treated, I have asked for a meeting with the Secretary of State, although I have not yet been given one. I hope that when the Minister responds, she will look carefully at agreeing to a meeting with the north Staffordshire MPs to see how we can deal with the situation in the interim.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">It is too late for some women in north Staffordshire to be tested. Had they been involved in the tests, they would have had Herceptin. Had they been in the control group, they would still have had access to Herceptin. However, their cancer is at too early a stage for NICE. About 1,000 women are affected by that. That is where the nub of the debate lies: what do we do about those 1,000 women around the country, of whom there are about 14 affected in north Staffordshire? Budgets have been set for this year that have been unable to account for unanticipated expenditure should treatment be agreed on a case-by-case basis. The money is not there because the primary care trusts are so much in deficit. The Government must deal with that issue, but they have not done so. They have put all the long-term measures in place, but they have not faced the reality that about 1,000 women known to be HER2 positive will simply not get the treatment because the primary care trusts cannot agree it. That is a question of money. It is important in the long term that this discussion should open a wider debate on NHS funding. We talk about taxes, but I do not think that we should be in the position where we say that we will pay less tax. Everyone whom I meet says, &quot;Joan, we want these women to get this treatment if they need it, and if it has been recommended.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">We must hold the debate on how we fund the NHS and ensure the availability of stunning treatments such as Herceptin, which is 50 per cent. effective in cases for

which it is available. For that reason, I support my hon.&nbsp;Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask the Minister to hold a meeting with north Staffordshire MPs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">This week&#039;s <i>Health Service Journal</i> editorial states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;The Government&#039;s decision on Herceptin in the face of lack of guidance from the independent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will have been duly noted by patients with other conditions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">The Secretary of State&#039;s knee-jerk reaction to an emotive appeal in the press does not take account of many of the problems that are associated with Herceptin. One cannot simply take a pill. An injection has to be given. Full back-up and resuscitation facilities are required because there can be acute reactions to it.&nbsp;There must be tests for safety because cardiac side-effects must be taken into account. Therefore, it is not just a matter of money; there are other matters to consider. Within my PCT area, about 10 ladies could benefit from the treatment. One has been approved, but I spoke to the director of public health yesterday, and the facilities for giving the treatment are not in place, even if the money is there to fund it. That is a major problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">How should it have been done? First, we should not have waited for a patient to raise the matter. In a way, I&nbsp;blame my profession. It was well known from <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> and from the conference that the treatment was a major breakthrough. Ideally&#151;I do not know that this did not happen&#151;oncologists should have gone to the cancer tsar. The cancer tsar should have gone to the Secretary of State, who should have gone to NICE. A committee of oncologists should have been urgently convened to make an interim appraisal. If one looks back to the Health Committee report on NICE, which was published as long ago as 2002, we stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;We recommend that for all new technologies, NICE&#039;s work programme is arranged to facilitate publication of guidance at the time of launch. When this is not possible, NICE should conduct rapid &#039;interim&#039; appraisals of clinical and cost-effectiveness to be published at the time of a treatment&#039;s launch&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">Surely, therefore, a rapid assessment by a committee of oncologists to give an interim appraisal would not be beyond possibility.

I can understand the company&#039;s dragging its heels. Think of the trouble the makers of Vioxx and of Celebrex have got into. There could be tremendous troubles ahead for this drug. It is entirely different when one is talking about a drug for cancer, for stomach ulcers or for arthritis, but there is a huge problem.

Does he accept that discussions had been taking place with the cancer tsar, with my colleagues in Government and with oncologists about the speed with which we were getting new cancer drugs to patients who were identified as being able to benefit from them?

<a name="51101h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">Recommendation 26 of the Health Committee inquiry this year on the pharmaceutical industry stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;We recommend increased funding of NICE to allow it to evaluate more medicines more quickly. Consequent improvement in prescribing standards should make such investment cost-effective.&quot;</p>

</p>


<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">What is NICE&#039;s work load? I tabled a parliamentary question to try to find out the number of cancer and non-cancer drugs waiting for appraisal. Cancer Research UK says that it is waiting for 13 appraisals on cancer drugs, of which 11 are being delayed, nine as a direct result of NICE having been given extra jobs to undertake without being given money. It has made proposals to the Department of Health about how to speed up the appraisal process and I hope that the Minister may tell us something about the Government&#039;s response to those proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">Other hon. Members mentioned the possibility of other drugs becoming available. There is an exact parallel. A drug called Eloxatin has NICE guidelines for use in a specific group of patients with bowel cancer, rather as Herceptin has guidelines for use in a specific group. Now there is evidence to suggest that it is the most effective treatment advance for early colon cancer after surgery for 15 years. Up to 8,000 patients a year could need it. We must get the mechanism right now, so that when that and other drugs that are in the pipeline come along we do not have to wait for people to go to the press to get their drugs.

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">I want to mention another difficult problem of rationing. Orphan drugs, which are for very rare illnesses, are protected. They have a specific pot of money for their prescription. Is that right? Two articles in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>this week question whether it is. It brings one back to the question of health care rationing which has absolutely got to take place. I&nbsp;shall quote briefly from an article by McCabe, Claxton and Tsuchiya in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>this week:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Special status for orphan drugs in resource allocation will avoid difficult and unpopular decisions, but it may impose substantial and increasing costs on the healthcare system. The costs will be borne by other, unknown patients with more common diseases, who will be unable to access effective and cost effective treatment as a result.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">Funding and priorities are the huge issue. In the Health Committee report on NICE in 2002, when we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested that the Government were not giving sufficient funding for NICE guidelines, the Government response was:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;The NHS does have sufficient funding to meet the cost of NICE recommendations. The expected aggregate cost of NICE recommendations is one of the factors taken into account by the Department of Health and the Treasury when discussing future funding requirements for the NHS&quot;.</p>

Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) on securing this vital debate, which is particularly vital for those of us in North Staffordshire. Herceptin has become the cope for countless women with breast cancer. It seems to be a remarkable drug. I was delighted to hear that the Secretary of State for Health has cleared the way for its use by women who have early onset of aggressive breast cancer long before the drug is likely to be licensed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">The Secretary of State rightly said that local health trusts must not refuse to fund the drug solely on the ground of costs. In North Staffordshire, the PCTs have large deficits&#151;in my constituency, there is a cumulative deficit of &#163;5 million&#151;so it is easier said than done for the&nbsp;financial aspect to be taken on board. Such heart-rending cases will go to the PCT complex case panels and the decisions will have to be made largely by non-specialists&#151;lay people, supported or not supported by experts.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">Effectively, on Herceptin, the primary care trusts are going to be taking over the role of NICE, but they will be doing it in a highly-charged emotive atmosphere, because they will be dealing not only with theories and medical views but with real women whose lives literally are in the balance. It does not seem the right way forward in the present situation to put such pressure on 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 199WH</b>

PCTs and on lay non-executive directors, who will have to balance their decisions against the services that they know they will have to withdraw from other deserving patients just to fund this drug.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">Time is on no one&#039;s side. One constituent, a young woman whose name I cannot reveal because she works for the NHS and does not want any publicity, needs the drug as soon as possible if she is to survive. I have referred her case to my local PCT, which will decide on her individual circumstances, but even at an overall cost of &#163;40,000 for a year&#039;s treatment, which includes the cost&nbsp;of administering the drug, Herceptin could be in the&nbsp;long term a saviour for PCTs in terms of finance. The chances are that, if a patient has Herceptin early enough, the breast cancer from which the patient is suffering will be eradicated after a year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">The trouble is that PCT budgets do not work in that way. The trusts cannot say, &quot;Well, we will invest this money now to save it over the next five or six years&quot;. Each PCT has to stay within its budget year on year. The&nbsp;cost of an expensive drug such as Herceptin cannot be spread over those years, although, clearly, it could reduce the risk of that disease coming back in women with early stage HER2 positive cancer by nearly 50 per cent. That will provide a huge saving not just to the PCT but in social security benefits if families are not deprived of women&#039;s help and care.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">I suggested to the Secretary of State last Thursday when she appeared in front of the Health Committee that such cases should be funded in the short term not by the PCTs but by the NHS bank. This is an immediate problem that we must overcome. Clearly, we do not want to go back to the bad old days of postcode lotteries. These women are fighting for their lives and for the future lives and happiness of their families. Money should not be part of that equation, yet Herceptin&#039;s heavy price tag has an impact, particularly as Roche needs to recoup its &#163;900 million expenses over just six years. Private companies need to make those profits, but they are incredibly high. I want the NHS to take a longer-term view over the next 20 to 25 years, by when the cost of Herceptin will have come down. The NHS should fund the drug over 25 years and reimburse PCTs accordingly.

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">On that basis, I tabled about 30 questions and I would be grateful if the Minister sped up the replies. The drift&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the letter was that some drugs were already licensed in Scotland. Taxotere, for example, has already been licensed by the Scottish Medicines Consortium. Apparently, a drug called Arimidex will get its licence a year ahead of the rest of the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">When I got into it, I discovered that the regulatory system is even more complicated. It is not just a question of an agency in Scotland giving a yes while a slow agency in England gives a no. There appear to be four agencies, and I would be grateful if the Minister explained exactly what the process is if a company with a world-wide reputation such as Roche produces a drug that it believes works. First, we have the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and, apparently, a consultation process to speed that up is going on. Can the Minister clarify that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">Secondly, we have the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which, as I understand it, has to give formal marketing approval before a drug can be considered in this country. We then have the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. In an incredible answer to my parliamentary question, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is not responsible for assessing the suitability of drugs for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human use.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 28 October 2005; Vol. 438, c.&nbsp;586W.]</p>

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">In that case, what is it for? Finally, we have the drugs tsar, about whom I knew nothing until this morning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">The Secretary of State has told us that cost is not an issue. I went to my PCT 10 days ago and it said that if Herceptin were prescribed across Shropshire it would cost &#163;1 million a year. My hon. Friend for North Wiltshire put the point well. We need clarity. It is a matter of life or death, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said. Should the priority be primary care centres, community hospitals or Herceptin? It is extremely difficult for the PCTs. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley) said, the procedure is not clear.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">In my remaining minute, I ask the Minister to clarify the procedure if a drug appears to work. Hundreds of thousands of women are watching this debate. They want to know what the process is and what the Government are doing to speed it up. What is the form on money should such drugs come through? As the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), who has left his seat, said, Herceptin is not the only one. We will have a raft of new drugs coming through that will probably be extremely effective, but might also be extremely expensive.

Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark&nbsp;Fisher) on having initiated the debate. It is very timely, and somewhat emotive. Everybody who has spoken is keen to see women quickly identified and treated. The question of the prescribing of Herceptin raises wider issues on the health economy, and I want to pursue those.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 201WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">I do not want anybody to think that I have anything against Herceptin, but I would like to paint a context for it. Herceptin was the first monoclonal antibody drug licensed in the United Kingdom, initially to treat women with secondary breast cancer. It was approved for that by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 2002 because trials had shown that it increased the survival rate of women with secondary cancer from 22 per cent. to 33 per cent. Not all breast cancers are helped by Herceptin. Only those that test positive for HER2 benefit, and they are often the most aggressive cancers. I shall return to that point later, because it is important in the context of testing and when women will be allowed access to the drugs.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">Every year, in Britain breast cancer is diagnosed in 35,000 women, of whom 20,000 are suitable for HER2 testing and 5,000 may benefit from Herceptin. There has long been speculation about whether we should give the drug earlier, because it might have long-term benefits. That is no longer speculation, because <i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine</i> very recently published a remarkable paper showing that the risk of the recurrence of breast cancer could be cut by almost half. Having worked as a pharmacist in a previous life, I know about being bombarded by drug companies claiming all sorts of benefits. However, the cure rate of Herceptin is exceptional. That is probably why there has been so much excitement about the potential of the treatment&#151;in many ways, it is justified.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">I share the feeling that it is a shame that it took an individual, Barbara Clark, to highlight the issue by threatening to take Somerset primary care trust to the European Court of Human Rights. Although I am delighted that Barbara will receive the treatment, we are talking about real lives, and thousands of women still have their own battles to face. I hope that recent announcements have not raised their hopes too much.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">Let me make a few more points. First, the drug is not yet licensed for use. The licensing process usually balances the efficiency of a drug against its side effects. Roche must be kicking itself for not being further ahead&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the process. However, as has been said, that process is cumbersome, requiring a huge amount of documentation. When we consider the people who have suffered the side effects of drugs that have not been identified properly, we realise that that balance must be struck. Secondly, the drug has not been to NICE. Neither of those things would in itself preclude the prescription of the drug by a consultant. However, in this litigious society, many are rightly wary of prescribing a drug for an indication for which it has not received a licence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">It was all too easy in the past, as the Select Committee report highlighted, for primary care trusts to hide behind the fact that NICE was still appraising the technology and to say that they would not provide funding until the results were known. That was a process commonly known as &quot;NICE blight&quot;. Yet that was also rubbish, for if the primary care trusts had wanted to, they could have funded those drugs. Indeed, on occasions, some decided to do so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">The odd thing in this was when the Secretary of State made a superficial and bizarre announcement that was&nbsp;still wholly welcome. The wholly welcome bit was the fast-tracking of Herceptin. We should have a determination on that by July 2006. However, the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 202WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
current record of NICE does not bear close scrutiny, since many appraisals have overrun. The bit that I found rather strange was to say that women should be able to have HER2 testing straight away. I return to my point about these often being the most vigorous and aggressive cancers. If the drug is not to be licensed until next year and NICE is not determining next year, what is the point of testing a woman only to make her then jump through endless hoops&#151;her cancer growing all the time&#151;while the primary care trust makes a decision? I&nbsp;find it morally almost indefensible that we are saying &#039;Yes, we will test you, but you will then have to fight a battle for the drug&#039;.
</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51101h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Gray </b> : Is the hon. Lady seriously suggesting that there could be a scientific method of knowing whether a particular woman is suitable for Herceptin but, because of the bureaucratic problems that she has described, that testing should not in itself take place?
</p>






<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51101h01_spnew25"><b> Sandra Gidley </b> : I am saying the bizarre bit is that we are testing women, but are then unable to treat them. We would be making women jump through all these hoops.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">Despite the assurances of the Secretary of State that primary care trusts should fund this drug, the point already brought out here by hon. Members is that most are cash-strapped, and will have to make many difficult decisions about where priorities lie. That could be raising false hopes, rather than being an absolute solution.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">The fact is that only around one-third of women are now tested, which is completely wrong. If we are not robust in saying that we shall give the treatment, we must question the point in letting somebody know what is wrong and just raising uncertainty. Women may be able to fund the treatment themselves, but the battles will be there. The bottom line is that some women who would be tested may not receive the drug, and will actually die. That is the point I was hoping to stress. Anything that can be done to secure funding will be wholly welcome.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">I have mentioned the capacity of testing, but I also want to ask the Minister what estimate there has been of the cost, the infrastructure and the manpower needed to ensure that the system is up and running fully&#151;and as soon as possible. Will she look into why, in some areas, the PCTs that have the lowest funding per capita&#151;because they are regarded as being in healthier parts of the country&#151;actually have high rates of breast cancer? Will she commit to looking into whether there is some reverse inequality happening in areas with generally high health levels yet a high incidence of breast cancer?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">The total cost of funding Herceptin has been identified as &#163;60 million. An important point is that, in 1998, the total chemotherapy budget was &#163;60 million. Clearly, as a Parliament and a country, we need a robust debate about funding these drugs. I am in no doubt that the long-term benefits make that investment worth while. Yet the short-term problems facing PCTs that have already been pointed out mean that perverse decisions are sometimes made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">There are wider issues around NICE. It should, perhaps, be allowed to give interim approval in such cases, as in Scotland, to help to avoid the delays in the

system that have just been challenged. If we could go down that route, women might not have to wait if they tested positive. On behalf of the women who will benefit, I am delighted that the Secretary of State has created this somewhat uncomfortable precedent. However, by stating that she wanted to see widespread use and the licence granted as quickly as possible, she has called into question the role of the licensing authority and the role of NICE.

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">There are 23 drugs in the system for cancer: some are still in a queue for consideration at the Department of Health, and the process needs speeding up.

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="51101h01_spnew28"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b>  (Con): May I add my congratulations to you, Mr. Bercow, on your elevation to the Speaker&#039;s Panel?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">I shall start by congratulating the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher) on securing this timely debate, and other hon. Members on their heartfelt contributions. We all have families in our constituencies to whom this issue matters a great deal. The debate has raised a number of serious questions that the Government need to answer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">It has long been apparent that the postcode lottery in cancer health care is not a scare story put about by the media, but a reality that must be addressed. Last year, the cancer tsar, Mike Richards, confirmed that fact by denouncing the unacceptably high variations in cancer treatments. A survey by CancerBACUP published in 2003 measured the extent to which a postcode lottery existed for the drug Herceptin, despite the drug&#039;s undoubted merits and efficacy. Some 61 per cent. of women in the south-west had access to the drug, compared to a shameful 14 per cent. in the midlands. Those figures were updated recently by a study cited in <i>Clinical Oncology</i>, which last year confirmed the extent of the postcode lottery when it came to Herceptin. It showed that 16 per cent. of eligible women in Essex were prescribed the drug, compared with some 90 per cent. in Dorset.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">Why does that postcode lottery exist? Part of the reason is that although primary care trusts no doubt want to prescribe Herceptin and many other drugs, they are unable to do so because of the financial deficits that many of them now face. That issue has been raised time and time again by hon. Members in debates such as this.&nbsp;The situation seems to be getting worse rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better. We in the Opposition contend that the Government&#039;s 300-plus targets have spawned a massive bureaucracy, which has soaked up a lot of the new 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
money that has undoubtedly been put into the NHS. That bureaucracy has prevented a lot of that new money reaching front-line services, including drug delivery.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">International comparisons are revealing. In the cancer plan 2000, it was claimed that, by 2010, the UK&#039;s survival rates in relation to cancer mortality would be comparable with the best in Europe. However, the truth is that the UK remains in the bottom third of the European cancer mortality league table. If the UK matched the European leaders in respect of cancer mortality, as many as 23,000 to 25,000 lives could be saved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">A key reason for our poor survival rates is that Britain lags considerably behind many of our European neighbours when it comes to the uptake of new medicines for the benefit of cancer patients. A very interesting and recent report by the Karolinska institute and the Stockholm school of economics found that, despite the proven benefits of new treatment options, patients across Europe did not have equal access to new drugs. Of the 19 countries surveyed representing something like three quarters of the population of Europe, the UK lagged well behind, in good part because of financial considerations and pressures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">The postcode lottery in Herceptin also exists because of the Government&#039;s ambivalence to NICE. NICE should have a crucial role to play in appraising drugs for the benefit of patients, with the minimum of delay. It should be at centre stage in the Government&#039;s efforts to allow patients to benefit from the latest technology, treatment and drugs. However, the Government have recently cut NICE funding by &#163;3 million, forcing it to scrap one of its appraisal committees. Does the Minister not agree with me&#151;and with CancerBACUP&#151;that it is unacceptable, with all the extra billions being put into the NHS at the moment, that 23 vital cancer treatments have been subject to long delays before being made available to the NHS? In September, NICE submitted its recommendations for reform of its procedures. Will the Minister publish those recommendations and set a timetable for the Government&#039;s response in order to try to eradicate the postcode lottery?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">It is equally unacceptable that NICE, which was set up to stamp out postcode lottery inequalities and to ensure that patients have rapid access to the best available treatments, is having its guidance ignored by NHS bodies because of financial pressures. How are the Government going to address that issue?


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">The Opposition have consistently called for NICE to be given the support that it needs to achieve, primarily, two objectives. The first is that appraisals for new drugs are, where possible, considered with their original licence applications, so that the unacceptable delay between drugs being licensed and being approved by NICE are removed from the system. I welcome the Government&#039;s consideration of that. The second objective is that resource implementation assessments&#151;the issue of NICE&#039;s funding has been raised by several hon. Members&#151;are conducted alongside NICE appraisals to ensure that NHS bodies implement NICE guidance with the necessary resources.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">A third strand of our thinking is that it is wrong that although appraisals have statutory backing, NICE guidelines do not. NICE would be at centre stage in our proposals for the NHS, and guidelines would be given 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 205WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
statutory force. The targets now set by politicians would be replaced with standards set by medical professionals through NICE. That would ensure that money soaked up by bureaucracy because targets need measuring would be released for the benefit of cancer patients and of drug delivery.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">The question of the availability of Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer crystallises a number of issues. The Secretary of State&#039;s announcement in the summer about the decision to fast-track NICE&#039;s appraisal of Herceptin is to be welcomed, but it is still likely to be many months before Herceptin is widely available for women with early-stage breast cancer. Many women who have already been diagnosed with breast cancer simply do not have time to wait until the licence and&nbsp;approval processes are completed next year. They need Herceptin now. According to Breakthrough Breast Cancer, experts estimate that about 1,000 lives could be saved every year if Herceptin were available to treat early-stage breast cancer. It is possible for women to be prescribed Herceptin prior to its licensing if their PCT agrees to fund it and the patient&#039;s doctor retains clinical responsibility.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">As we have heard, on 25 October the Secretary of State stated&#151;perhaps because of the Barbara Clark case&#151;that PCTs should not refuse Herceptin solely on the ground of its cost. Two days later, she seemed to go further by suggesting that all PCTs will be directly informed that they are now required to fund and prescribe Herceptin to treat early-stage breast cancer when there is a clinical need to do so. The Secretary of State&#039;s intervention is all-important, yet, as we have heard from many hon. Members, it is causing confusion. Will the Minister clarify the situation? Is the Secretary of State obliging PCTs to fund Herceptin when it is prescribed even if that means diverting resources that are already intended for other services? If so, what assessment has been made of the services that will suffer as a result of finances being redirected to achieve that directive?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">Will the Minister tell us how many trusts are in a financial position to take up the Secretary of State&#039;s instructions? She must be aware that many PCTs have financial deficits. A British Medical Association survey suggests that three out of four PCTs face deficits. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said, the Secretary of State cannot hide behind PCTs on this issue. She seems to be placing obligations on PCTs without providing the resources to enable them to meet them. Does the Minister agree that the Secretary of State&#039;s comments are an admission that the licensing and appraisal processes are taking far too long? What is the point of NICE if the Secretary of State is just going to bypass it?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para100"><a name="stpa_101">Those questions need to be answered because the Secretary of State&#039;s intervention has caused confusion. If it is a directive, many PCTs cannot afford it, while the treatment may not be prescribed because it is unlicensed and NICE seems to be left on the sidelines. If, on the other hand, the comments did not amount to an instruction, what were they meant to achieve? The uncharitable view might be that the Secretary of State was simply responding to media pressure, as PCTs already know they are free to fund the drug.

<a name="51101h01_para101"><a name="stpa_102">There has been no shortage of evidence from respected charities in the country, well known bodies and think tanks internationally, and from hon.

The Government are to blame because they have failed to reform the way in which NICE operates and have created a situation in which PCTs are unable to implement its guidance in many areas because of financial pressures.

I reassure her that people can have the test at any time. The tumour sample is kept and can be tested.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">It is important that we take care not to give the impression that the drug is suitable for all or even most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women with breast cancer. It is also linked to serious cardiac problems, and I know that that was acknowledged by other contributors to the debate. Nevertheless, as has been repeatedly said, the early evidence of effectiveness in women who do fit the category is very strong. That is why we acted in response to that evidence.

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">To ensure that we can identify all the women who can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benefit from treatment, we have asked professor Professor Mike Richards, the national clinical director for cancer, to ensure that HER2 testing is available across the NHS as soon as possible. He has already met with the directors of the 34 cancer networks and that move has been enthusiastically welcomed by them. The manufacturers of Herceptin have not yet applied for a licence&#151;that point, too, was made. The Government play no part in the licensing process&#151;we cannot intervene&#151;but we have urged the manufacturer to apply for a licence as quickly as possible.

<a name="51101h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">That question will be addressed by the licensing process, not the NICE process. However, NICE will consider a complex range of factors, including cost-effectiveness, which is an important consideration when introducing an expensive new treatment. I strongly support the NICE process. I hope within a few days to be able to go into detail about the work that we are doing with NICE. I am considering proposals for a faster technology appraisal process for important new drugs, not only for Herceptin, so that NICE can offer the NHS guidance on their clinical worth and their cost-effectiveness closer to the time of licensing. I am grateful to NICE for that important work.

<p>
<a name="51101h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">The Secretary of State has asked NICE to begin its appraisal of the use of Herceptin for early-stage breast cancer as soon as possible; indeed, that process has begun. As a result, the appraisal of the treatment will run concurrently with the licensing process. If the licence is granted, NICE guidelines can be issued shortly afterwards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para112"><a name="stpa_113">We now come to the nub of the matter. A number of women being treated for early breast cancer could benefit from Herceptin. I accept that. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), met representatives of the women fighting for Herceptin on 22 September. My hon. Friend and I are in close touch, and we will be communicating by way of a NHS circular exactly how we expect PCTs to respond to patients whose clinicians believe that they would benefit from Herceptin.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para113"><a name="stpa_114">It has been said many times that the Secretary of State has announced that PCTs should not refuse to fund Herceptin on cost grounds alone. What does that mean? It means that there has to be a medical reason for the medicine not being prescribed. That reason ought to be communicated to the patient and her clinician.
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51101h01_spnew31"><b> Joan Walley </b> : Is the Minister saying that if there is a medical reason for prescribing it, she would wish PCTs to fund it? If so, she must pay attention to the need for additional funding&#151;or even emergency funding&#151;in this financial year.
</p>






<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51101h01_spnew32"><b> Jane Kennedy </b> : My hon. Friend has raised that question before. Indeed, as a result, I began to look at the circumstances that have given rise to genuine anxiety among our friends in Stoke and elsewhere. I want my constituents, too, to be able to gain from the potential benefits of Herceptin. We are continuing to look at the situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h01_para114"><a name="stpa_115">As for funding, my hon. Friend knows that we have passed to the primary care trusts the resources that used to be held centrally. We have seen big increases going to the primary care trusts as a result. However, if PCTs are having specific cost problems, they need to talk to their strategic health authority. I want to know if primary care trusts are making blanket decisions to refuse funding for Herceptin on the ground of cost alone. I will need to examine the circumstances surrounding such cases.
</p>






<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51101h01_spnew33"><b> Mr. Baron </b> : Time is short, but will the Minister assure the House that she will respond to our questions in writing?
</p>






<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51101h01_spnew34"><b> Jane Kennedy </b> : Of course, I intend to do that, but only the pressure of time has forced me to reduce my comments to the minimum. I hope to have reassured all those who have participated in the debate&#151;

<a name="51101h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Planning (Northern Ireland)</h3>

<a name="time_9">
<a name="51101h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51101h02_spnew0"><b> Sammy Wilson  (East Antrim)</b>  (DUP): I am grateful for the opportunity to debate an issue that is of increasing importance in Northern Ireland. I am grateful, too, that the Minister is in attendance this morning. I know that I have dragged her away from the fair shores of Northern Ireland, which she left yesterday. She is rushing back again, so keen is she on the place, but she has come to respond to the debate.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para0"><a name="stpa_116">All public representatives are finding that levels of satisfaction with the Northern Ireland Planning Service are falling. That dissatisfaction is experienced not just by those who make applications, but by objectors to applications and those who simply have an interest in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the planning system. The two greatest concerns are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delays in the planning process and lack of accountability. Those two problems go hand in hand. The lack of accountability has resulted in a lack of urgency in the planning process and a lack of response to the increasing criticisms of the process.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para1"><a name="stpa_117">I want to deal first with delays. Delays occur in the processing of planning applications, in the production of policies and in the bringing forward of area plans. The Planning Service suffers from more delays than British Rail on a bad day&#151;and it probably comes up with as many excuses, too. Those bringing forward major developments now build in a minimum of two years for planning permission, and most housing association schemes take up to one year for the planning application process to be completed.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para2"><a name="stpa_118">As to what some stakeholders and players in the system have said about the planning system in Northern Ireland, Tesco described it as &quot;wading through treacle&quot;. Banks now put planning risk as a major financing risk to any scheme&#151;significantly, it now ranks above political instability. One of the large private developers in Northern Ireland, CUSP, claims that the planning process is extremely slow, to the extent that development opportunities are being put at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risk or missed altogether. In a recent report, Investment Belfast estimated that in excess of &#163;1 billion of property investment has been lost to Northern Ireland. It has flowed into Great Britain, instead. That is equal to about 15,000 full-time construction jobs. The Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association described the system as a farce and a shambles, and William Ewart Properties Ltd recently invested in three GB-based shopping centres because of the uncertainty and difficulties in getting planning permission in Northern Ireland.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para3"><a name="stpa_119">That all comes at a time when, rightly, the Government are seeking to wean Northern Ireland from dependence on the public sector, yet the opportunity to create jobs in the private sector is being held up by major impediments in the planning process. It is clear from the examples that I have given that economic development and job promotion are being held up, and that the planning process is responsible for a shortfall in economic growth in Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para4"><a name="stpa_120">Delays in the planning system are not just manifested in the slowness of the divisional planning offices in assessing and processing planning applications. There is another major delay in bringing forward policies and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 210WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
area plans. That creates greater uncertainty, because planning then takes place in a vacuum. Those who are objecting do not know the status of certain areas and those applying do not know the ground rules.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para5"><a name="stpa_121">The Belfast metropolitan area plan, which covers two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;areas in my constituency of East Antrim&#151;Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus&#151;was meant to replace the Belfast urban area plan, which is in itself 10&nbsp;years out of date. The Belfast metropolitan area plan has been five years in the making. The draft was finally published at the end of 2004. It is now going to be subject to a public inquiry, and it could be 2009 before it is adopted. We could have 14 years of no formal plan for the Greater Belfast area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para6"><a name="stpa_122">That turgid document&#151;that is all one can describe it as, because it lacks vision&#151;and its technical support stand 3 ft high. I am not so sure that it is a useful document for anyone who applies. Indeed, a document that is as prescriptive as that one in itself creates difficulties, which is one of the problems with the way in which area plans are drawn up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para7"><a name="stpa_123">The damage that tardiness in advancing planning policies can do could not be illustrated better than by the disgraceful way in which successive Ministers have handled the review of planning policy statement 5, which deals with retail planning policy in Northern Ireland. The guidelines have now been under review for five years. That review was greatly needed because, after several judicial reviews and other legal challenges, PPS5, which was meant to protect town centres, was so watered down that it was almost meaningless and certainly did not protect town centres.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para8"><a name="stpa_124">The work started in autumn 2000. The original research was carried out by Roger Tym and Partners, who were the authors of the successful policy that limited superstore development in the Republic to 30,000 sq ft. The report, which was published in February 2003, indicated that the Northern Ireland food market was reaching saturation point, with growth down from 1.28 per cent. to less than half that figure. Obviously, that did not suit some people in the Department, because at that stage there was an influx of major food retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury&#039;s and Asda into Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para9"><a name="stpa_125">There was therefore a delay in submitting the document for public consultation. It was available in September 2004 and was to go out to consultation in&nbsp;November 2004. The then Minister, the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), decided that there would be a further delay while he consulted another Department. It was promised that the consultation would start in February 2005, but we then had an election, so it was delayed for that. Since the election, however, there has still been no sign of it. The document was delayed, but it now seems to have fallen off the radar completely.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para10"><a name="stpa_126">The planning vacuum that has occurred as a result has created dangers for many provincial towns. Let me give one example. Enniskillen, a town in the west of the Province, with 17,000 people, currently has four applications for food superstores. I know that they will not all be granted, but if they were, there would be another 7 sq ft of retail shopping for every man, woman and child in the whole of County Fermanagh. That creates uncertainty for investment in Fermanagh, but 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 211WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also creates frustration for those who have applied, because there is no clear policy on which of the schemes are most likely to be successful.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para11"><a name="stpa_127">Some people argue for a moratorium on the processing of applications until the new PPS5 is in place. I do not support that call, because I believe that it would only prolong the uncertainty about investment in town centres and would stymie some schemes that would benefit the economy of some provincial towns. Rather than having a moratorium, the obvious answer is simply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to produce the policy, to put it out to public consultation, to get it adopted, to start applying it and to inject some certainty into the planning regime.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para12"><a name="stpa_128">I believe that other planning documents require revision, but one that concerns me in particular is PPS2, which deals with planning, nature conservation and the protection of natural habitats. It is quite clear that the statement is not up to date and is not strong enough. In my constituency of East Antrim, I have seen builders deliberately tear out old field hedges and take down copses, even when those have been marked on maps as features that must be preserved. There seems to be little or no protection. In large housing developments, much of the landscaping that is required as a result of the quality development requirements is unimaginative. It often resembles the landscaping that we would expect from a garden makeover, rather than integrating naturally into the environment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para13"><a name="stpa_129">The Woodland Trust has estimated that about 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hectares of native trees need to be planted in the Larne area to meet the standards in &quot;Space for People&quot;. Rather than allowing the unimaginative landscape schemes that are accepted at present, we should make provision to create quality open space by planting woodland, particularly on large housing developments, which can tolerate planting because of their scale. That would also go a long way towards meeting the demand in &quot;Space for People&quot; for woodland access within two miles of where people live.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para14"><a name="stpa_130">There are many creative ideas from developers and groups such as the Woodland Trust, and those should be considered in the review of PPS2. It is significant that the members of the working group that was set up in May 2004 have not been called together since. That is another example of the lack of urgency in reviewing policies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para15"><a name="stpa_131">The problem seems to be that the planning system finds it difficult to cope with the current volume of planning applications, to the point that those people who would be involved in drawing up policy are now allocated to development control. That means that policy development has been all but forgotten.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para16"><a name="stpa_132">What has caused this problem of delay? Why is the planning system grinding to a halt in that way? The planners blame everyone but themselves, and the excuses that have come from the planning system mimic those that we got from British Rail for the delays to trains. The latest culprit to be identified is councils. We are told they are responsible for the delay, that they defer applications, that they send them to the management board and that they are irresponsible. Under &quot;Modernising Planning&quot;, therefore, councils will be limited to one deferral of a planning application, regardless of the reason for that deferral.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 212WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para17"><a name="stpa_133">I know that some councils are irresponsible and defer a planning application when they do not know what to do with it; they send it to the management board to pretend that they are doing something. I was the chairman of the Belfast city council planning committee for many years, and we would have sent an application to the management board as a last resort. We had a self-denying ordinance that, where the council did not show that it was delaying or deferring an application for good reasons, the committee would take the application out of its hands and push it through the system. However, such councils will be punished, because the planning system wants to find a scapegoat. That will not speed up the planning process, because most of the planning applications about which people complain come to councils only a year and a half after they were first made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para18"><a name="stpa_134">The other reason that there has been a delay is that no such restrictions are placed on statutory consultees such as the Roads Service, the Environment and Heritage Service, the Water Service and the landscape division of the Department of the Environment, which can, and often do, delay a process for as long as they want. To save time, I shall give hon. Members just one example, involving a planning application by one of my constituents, who lives beside Belfast lough. I do not know whether this has anything do with the debate, but I got a call from the Environment and Heritage Service yesterday, saying that, after two years, it had finally sorted the matter out. I hope that that illustrates the power of Parliament, but I shall wait to see. If I have planning difficulties in future, however, I might apply for another debate; that might be the way to get things done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para19"><a name="stpa_135">The building of Carrick marina changed wave patterns, and the sea wall that bordered my constituent&#039;s property was starting to wash away. Every week, he was paying builders to shore it up to stop it and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his garden being washed into the lough. He needed to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build some armouring, which would have extended 4&nbsp;ft on to the beach and run 100 yd along it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para20"><a name="stpa_136">One of the consultees, the Environment and Heritage Service, rightly took an interest in the matter, because Belfast lough is a special protection area. Over two years, however, the service asked him to do survey after survey. First, he was asked to do a survey of the ducks and seagulls&#151;a bird survey. When that was done, he&nbsp;was asked to do a seal survey. It then asked him to do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a worm survey&#151;the service called it a benthic invertebrate survey, but I think that means worms. After that, he had to do a model of coastal dynamics to show the macro-effects of the development on the whole north shore of the lough&#151;the whole north shore of the lough stretches for about 15 miles, and he was going to do some work on 100 yards. He was then told that he was going to have to do a bird-nesting survey. I think that the only survey they did not ask him to do was on the impact on global warming&#151;and had it not been for this debate, he may have been asked to do that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para21"><a name="stpa_137">My constituent spent more than &#163;9,000 on those surveys. He was happy to do so, if that was what was required. However, if the Environment and Heritage Service knew at the start that those were the areas it was concerned about, why did it not ask for surveys on them to be done all at once? Why did it ask for one after another over two years? During that time, he was spending money shoring up the wall. The irony is that, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 213WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
had the sea wall come down and the garden been washed on to the beach, it would not have impinged on to 4 ft of beach; it would have washed across a much larger area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para22"><a name="stpa_138">I will not bore hon. Members by giving further illustrations; I am sure that they could give many similar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illustrations. However, I could provide further illustrations on the Roads Service, the Water Service, and the landscape division of the Department of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment. There does not seem to be any curtailment on how long consultees can hold the process up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para23"><a name="stpa_139">Another explanation that has been given is that the number of applications received by the Planning Service has jumped greatly, and that is true. However, that is also true for councils, which have to deal with the building control aspects of any planning application. The odd thing is that, during the period of the increase in planning applications, councils&#039; building control departments have reduced their waiting lists and times, whereas the length of time it takes the planning system to deal with planning applications has increased dramatically.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para24"><a name="stpa_140">The Minister authorised the employment of 120 new planners&#151;she can correct that figure if it is wrong&#151;to supplement those already employed, and to move people off area plan teams and policy making in order to try to deal with the backlog, yet the problem has still not been dealt with. One of the reasons for that is that, although additional planning staff have been introduced, the bureaucracy of the planning system has not been dealt with. It grinds slowly and frustrates the public and their representatives.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para25"><a name="stpa_141">One of the major sources of delay in recent times has been the practice of sending planning applications back as invalid. I do not know if architects are getting worse, or if, as a result of ageing, they are becoming senile, but I cannot understand why that is happening. Architects&#039; applications used seldom to be declared invalid, but now there is suddenly a big jump in the number of invalid applications. That has added delay to the process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para26"><a name="stpa_142">I dealt with one such application in my constituency. A group that had got temporary permission simply photocopied and sent in the same application as the previous year&#151;an application that had been processed and given permission&#151;and it was sent back to them as invalid. I could not find out what the reason for that was, and neither could any members of the group. Once I started making inquiries, it was determined that perhaps it was valid.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para27"><a name="stpa_143">One architect who knew about this debate sent me a letter on five applications he had submitted. All of them were initially returned as invalid, but were subsequently passed after a period&#151;one after a year&#151;without any amendment to the documentation or plans. That is another issue that the planners need to address.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para28"><a name="stpa_144">The second problem is one of accountability. I will deal with only one aspect of that, because I know that I will probably have a disagreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson), who is sitting beside me. Planners have decided that they will consult councils even less than they did in the past. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Ireland, councils are only consultees. They&nbsp;are not the final authority on planning decisions. It rests with the civil servants. So there is a lack of accountability already. We have no chance to question 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 214WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Minister who makes the decisions directly, although I am sure that the Minister who is here this morning will&nbsp;do an excellent job in responding, because he is a member of the other House. As a result, the channels and communications required for accountability are being stretched.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para29"><a name="stpa_145">One case study that illustrates that lack of accountability was the decision to permit John Lewis to locate at Sprucefield along with 20 other retail units on the site. I am sure that my hon. Friend will wish to say something about that. The Minister made that decision fairly quickly when he took office and has explained his position by saying that the decision was &quot;a no-brainer&quot;. That major planning decision, which will have an impact on Lisburn town centre, on Belfast and on a number of other town centres was put through.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para30"><a name="stpa_146">Many people in Northern Ireland welcomed the fact that at least the Minister was prepared to make a decision, even though it was controversial and opposed by many. But one would have expected at least some explanation of why that decision was made, especially as, when the Minister was the Minister for Regeneration in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, he stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;But allowing the market to do what it likes risks severe economic, environmental and social consequences&#151;because investment will tend to gravitate to honey pot areas like affluent suburbia or the edge of towns. Having to burn a pint of petrol to buy a pint of milk&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because retailers haven&#039;t chosen to locate in your area makes no sense whatsoever.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para31"><a name="stpa_147">What was the Minister&#039;s first decision when he reached Northern Ireland? He granted an application for one of the largest out-of-town shopping developments in the United Kingdom. It may well be that, when he crossed the water and changed Department, he changed his mind. That is fine, but an accountable planning system ought at least to have had a mechanism to explain that change of heart, especially when it was opposed by a wide range of interest groups. That did not happen. It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goes against all the policies on urban densities, sustainable communities, public transport and social exclusion, yet we had no explanation from the Minister.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para32"><a name="stpa_148">I want to describe some of the things that could be done to improve the current situation. First, there must be an immediate publication of PPS5 and an agreement to update the other planning policy statements that are out of date and causing problems, including PPS2.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para33"><a name="stpa_149">Secondly, consultees must be put under pressure to respond much more quickly than they do at present, as they are one of the major reasons for planning applications being held back. Whether that is by means of a service level agreement, an indication that, if representations are not received within a certain period the application will be determined without them, or some other arrangement, should be a matter for debate. One set of consultees&#151;those who are at least allowed some public accountability&#151;should not be restricted in how long they can delay planning applications while statutory consultees are given carte blanche. That is what happens at present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para34"><a name="stpa_150">Thirdly, in parts of England, planning applications have been speeded up by the establishment of business planning zones, where economic clusters are established and where decisions are made quickly on a basis of established planning principles which have been laid down. We should look at that in Northern Ireland, too. Fourthly, additional resources could be made available 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 215WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to the planning system if developers were given assurances that their applications would be fast-tracked if they provided additional resources to buy in some of the expertise that might be needed to do economic impact or environmental assessments, which the planning system does not have the resources to do at present. Some people would say that that compromises the planning system. However, if it were simply a case of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developers handing over money to the divisional planning office or the Department for Regional Development to buy in the services, there would be no conflict of interest and it might speed things up. How often have I rung planners who say, &quot;We can&#039;t process this because the person who is meant to be dealing with it is working on another job&quot;? If additional resources could come from developers, why not? Many developers would be prepared to provide that, because a quick decision would be less costly than the delay that happens at present.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para35"><a name="stpa_151">Fifthly, the process of drawing up policies must be reviewed. The Belfast metropolitan area plan, which many people welcomed at the time, was subject to massive consultation&#151;about four years of consultation. Then when the draft plan was drawn up, what did we get? We got 9,000 objections, which will go through a legal process. Either the consultation method is wrong or the legalistic nature of what happens after the draft plan is published is wrong. One thing is certain: we cannot go on with the present arrangements, which drag things on for ever.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para36"><a name="stpa_152">With certain safeguards, planning powers could be devolved to councils. I hope that that will happen under&nbsp;the review of public administration. Other hon. Members may want to comment on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para37"><a name="stpa_153">It is significant that until 2002 the Planning Service carried out customer satisfaction surveys. In 2002, it decided that it would aim for 80 per cent. of applicants being satisfied with the way in which their planning applications were determined; that was the target. The figure for the previous year was 64 per cent. The service sent questionnaires to 1,200 applicants. However, only 61 per cent. of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the service. Rather than going up, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;figure went down. The Planning Service promptly decided not to do any more surveys. That is one way of ensuring that there is no dissatisfaction, or at least that it is not expressed. It may indicate the uncertainty that the planners themselves feel about the way in which they deal with planning applications.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para38"><a name="stpa_154">I am sure that other hon. Members want to make contributions. I look forward to hearing them and the response from the Minister.

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51101h02_spnew1"><b> Dr. William McCrea  (South Antrim)</b>  (DUP): I thank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) for bringing a very important issue before this Chamber today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para39"><a name="stpa_155">The Minister will know that there is great dissatisfaction in local authorities about the new arrangements for consulting councils. In fact, there is great anger and frustration at the manner in which the present Minister decided to remove site meetings from 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 216WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
councillors. I would rather have five minutes in a site meeting with an officer than an hour in an office to talk about a planning application. The decision furthers the democratic deficit that is felt in the Province. The anger and frustration felt by many elected representatives certainly has been, and will continue to be, expressed until the new policy of so-called modernising planning arrangements is changed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para40"><a name="stpa_156">My hon. Friend touched on the issue of statutory consultees. A constituent of mine put in an application for one simple dwelling in the countryside in 2002. The matter was delayed and he got approval in August 2005 for one simple dwelling for his family in the countryside. There was an intervention by the EHS: it put in an objection to the application. A year was taken to respond and then the Department decided that it would consider approving the matter. The EHS was asked for a further letter and it wrote back with the same letter that it had sent a year before. The Department has seemed able to hold back such applications. Had the matter not been deferred, that person would have had a refusal even though he should have had an approval right at the beginning. His application went in in 2005, but it was approved only in 2005. That is totally unacceptable; it was totally in the power of the Departments to deal with the matter. The delay was completely down to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para41"><a name="stpa_157">The removal of proper consultation with district councils and site meetings with district councillors is not only greatly to be regretted, but should be strongly opposed by elected representatives. However, it seems that statutory consultees can keep back planning determinations for as long as they want.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para42"><a name="stpa_158">Many area plans are in total chaos. My hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim mentioned his area, and there is also the situation in Antrim. The officials have been removed from the Antrim area plan because of 5,000 objections to the Magherafelt area plan. The officials have just been moved over to another area plan, bringing a full stop to the plan in Antrim.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para43"><a name="stpa_159">The lack of appropriate and proper officers is a problem. The Minister employed more officers to deal with the plans, but the tragedy is that many senior officers retired from the system. Junior officers were brought in their place, but many were totally inexperienced in planning, so the delays happened. We need proper planning arrangements that are effective and realistic.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para44"><a name="stpa_160">The area plans that are in total chaos need to be dealt with. For example, the Assembly made a great announcement; Mr. Empey came to South Antrim and told us that the jewel in the crown of all industrial bases was going to be a global point in Newtownabbey. Yet many years later, not one building has been put on to that jewel in the crown for industrial development. I&nbsp;asked the Minister why there had been a delay. What answer did I receive the other day? He told me that we had to wait until the Belfast metropolitan area plan was published before anything could be done. That global point was supposed to be the jewel in the crown, but the jewel must have fallen out because the situation is going nowhere. That is disgraceful. The place is decaying and what ought to be the jewel in the crown of industrial development is sitting in absolute disarray and decay because of the delay in, or our waiting for, the Belfast metropolitan area plan. That is totally unacceptable. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 217WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Did those responsible not know about that plan when they came down to make that precious announcement about the jewel in the crown, which gave the community great hope and anticipation of great industrial things? Yes, they did&#151;but there seems to be delay upon delay upon delay.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para45"><a name="stpa_161">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim on the publication of the retail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning policy. That is an absolute necessity. The policy is already decided; it is sitting on the shelf, gathering dust, and that will be a major impediment to appropriate retail development in Northern Ireland. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am not entering into the debate on the John Lewis stores, because they have nothing to do with me. However, I am saying that my developers and the people in my constituency are demanding that that retail planning policy should be released. If there is a planning situation or court proceedings are in the offing, that is no reason whatsoever for everything else to draw to a stop and for the document not to be published. There is a demand for it to be published.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para46"><a name="stpa_162">The Minister and the Department have to deal with one of the major problems in planning: a lack of consistency in planning approvals and in the reasons for planning refusals. That has brought more disrepute to the Department than anything else. Not only do matters go outside divisional planning offices or areas, but inside areas there are variations in decisions, approvals and the reasons for approvals

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para47"><a name="stpa_163">Let us consider one of the reasons for refusing build-up. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One officer can see build-up, while another officer goes into the same area on another day and accepts that there is no build-up or lack of integration. One officer sees trees, while another sees a bush, as a result of which one gives approval and the other refuses. An officer might not have the guts to say that what was happening was ribbon development so he says instead that there was tendency towards ribbon development. I asked several officers at the Department what that meant and each of them gave me a different interpretation. We are dealing with a sensitive problem and the lack of consistency in planning approvals or refusals brings the whole position into disrepute.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para48"><a name="stpa_164">As for the Crosshill inquiry, there is great opposition within my constituency in respect of the approval for the asbestos transfer station in Crumlin. The constituency of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donaldson) runs alongside mine and our constituents are bringing their problems to our attention. The Minister who is here today made the decision about the station. The questions asked by those in our communities have not been answered. A decision cannot railroaded over the heads of the people. Members of the general public need to accept that decisions are made for the right purposes. The Department says, &quot;We have to have an asbestos transfer station somewhere.&quot; I accept that, but it must be situated in the right place, not beside Lough Neagh nor in an area that is zoned for housing and population growth. The station will be a hazard to the well-being of our community. The matter will have to be taken to a judicial review, because the decision was forced over the heads of members of the community.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para49"><a name="stpa_165">Let us consider the Cottonmont landfill site. It is to take most of the community&#039;s rubbish, but it will be situated beside a private development. Approval has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 218WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
been given for many houses to be built on the verge of the area, yet the problems of birds, litter, smell, infestation of rodents, additional traffic beside a school and numerous other hazards will have a detrimental environmental impact on members of the community. The decision has been forced on them. The response is, &quot;Well, the site has to go somewhere&quot;. I agree that a landfill site is necessary, but we must ensure that it is situated in a proper place. The community is again forced into the position in which it must go to court to achieve a judicial review of what is happening. The Department is irresponsible. Such action brings the right of third party appeals closer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para50"><a name="stpa_166">Many people in the community consider that decisions are being forced on them. Rights are being given to developers and to others, but no one has a right to appeal against the decision without going to a judicial review. That does not apply in all cases, but what is happening shows that certain cases need to be dealt with by the Department.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para51"><a name="stpa_167">We have a serious problem with planning in Northern Ireland. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley that I do not accept that developers have more rights than individuals, just because they have the money and can get matters speeded up. Everyone should be equal under the law and equally subject to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law. I am a great adherent to the principles of the Democratic Unionist party, and I fear that developers are given more rights because they can pay. Naturally, they will be able to pay the money if they receive approval quickly for their developments. I do not want to remove their rights, but I am putting up a marker because individuals with one little planning application in the countryside should have the same rights as everyone else. They have a right to demand approval or to object if they believe that something is against their rights.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para52"><a name="stpa_168">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim on securing this important debate and I will now let other hon. Members to speak. I trust that the Minister will take note of the points that have been made and, if he cannot reply to them today, that he will write to hon. Members with answers to their questions.

</p>



<a name="time_11">
<a name="51101h02_time2"><h5>11.40 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51101h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jeffrey M. Donaldson  (Lagan Valley)</b>  (DUP): I,&nbsp;too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) on securing the debate. He made an excellent speech, laced with his usual good humour, and demonstrated a strong grasp of the relevant issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para53"><a name="stpa_169">I want to draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland, especially the housing growth indicators within that strategy. Under the Belfast metropolitan area draft plan, those housing growth indicators were set at 20 per cent. growth for the duration of the plan period. The figure of 20 per cent. is too low and fails to reflect the housing growth that will be required in the Belfast metropolitan area over the plan period. As my hon. Friend said, given the likely further delay in processing the plan, which may not come live until 2009, the figure needs to be revised. Recently, the Planning Appeals Commission at the inquiry into the draft North Down and Ards area plan conceded that point and accepted that the target 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 219WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for that area&#039;s housing growth was inadequate. The principle having been conceded, the Department and the Planning Service need to reconsider and to revise the figure for BMAP.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para54"><a name="stpa_170">In the light of my hon. Friend&#039;s comments, I ask the Minister to clarify the likely time scale within which it is intended to hold the public inquiry into the Belfast metropolitan area draft plan. When is it intended that BMAP will be adopted? What is the target date for adoption of BMAP and its implementation?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para55"><a name="stpa_171">I want to mention briefly some of the consequences of the current BMAP process. Primarily, there is concern in my constituency about the joint ministerial statement by Lord Rooker, the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, who is responsible for the environment, and the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Woodward), who is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible for the Planning Service. That edict caused great concern especially in rural areas in Northern Ireland. There is a proposal in the draft BMAP plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extend the green belt in rural areas. Planning applications that were already in the system, which pre-date the publication of BMAP, although they met all the planning policy guidelines, were refused on the ground of prematurity because the area where the site was located would potentially form part of the green belt. That is grossly unfair.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para56"><a name="stpa_172">Applicants, in good faith, submitted a planning application and found themselves caught, sometimes because the planning process had resulted in significant delays for those applications. A few weeks could have made all the difference between getting an approval and finding that their application was suddenly refused, purely on the ground of prematurity. I say, with respect, that the Department needs to look at the issue again in the interests of fairness and to revisit the issue of the joint ministerial statement. It is unfair that people have been disadvantaged in that way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para57"><a name="stpa_173">The strongest objection to the draft BMAP plan came from the residents of Drumbeg in my constituency. Some 1,000 objections were lodged against the proposal for a cemetery and crematorium on the edge of the Lagan Valley regional park. The former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the late Mo Mowlam, took time out to walk the Lagan Valley regional park with me. Her intervention strengthened the safeguards for that valuable open space, which is important not just to my constituents in the city of Lisburn, but to the city of Belfast.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para58"><a name="stpa_174">However, there is now a proposal to locate a huge cemetery and crematorium in the expanded boundaries of the Lagan Valley regional park. There is a proposal under BMAP to extend the boundary of the regional park to include the area around Drumbeg. In the same draft plan, there is a proposal to create the cemetery and crematorium within that space. There is outrage in the community about that proposal and total opposition to it. I urge the Department to take that on board and, in revising the draft plan, to drop the proposal for the Drumbeg cemetery and crematorium. I accept that there is a need for a new facility, but surely not in the Lagan Valley regional park. We need to protect the open space 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 220WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that we have in the Belfast metropolitan area, which is a valued asset that should be conserved and preserved for future generations. That is the wrong way to go about it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para59"><a name="stpa_175">My hon. Friend touched on the sensitive issue of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed development of the John Lewis store at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprucefield. I understand why, representing his constituents as a councillor in Belfast, he takes the view that he does, and I respect that. However, having said that, the decision on the John Lewis store is one example&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of how the planning system&#151;whether one agrees or disagrees with the outcome&#151;got it right in terms of fast-tracking a major investment proposal for Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para60"><a name="stpa_176">The John Lewis development is not just relevant to Lisburn, but will have a wider impact on Northern Ireland. The proposal is for the first John Lewis store on the island of Ireland&#151;not just the retail store, but the warehousing and distribution centre for the whole of the island. The two developments together will create almost 1,000 jobs, and will be a multi-million pound investment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para61"><a name="stpa_177">I have met the chairman and the board of John Lewis and, sadly, for my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim, I know that the choice for them was not between Belfast and Sprucefield. They looked at and considered Belfast and decided that Belfast city centre was not the right location. They need to locate their store on the key Belfast-Dublin corridor, because they need to attract 3 million people within the radius of the store&#151;they need an area that will justify the level of investment. Sprucefield was the ideal location, because it is on the A1 Belfast-Dublin corridor. With the new motorway development south of the border, it now takes an hour and 15 minutes&#151;an hour and a half maximum&#151;from the north of Dublin to Sprucefield. There is ease of access to Sprucefield. It is a central location for all of Northern Ireland, right beside the M1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motorway, and there are not the parking or congestion problems that there are in Belfast. I can therefore understand why John Lewis chose Sprucefield.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para62"><a name="stpa_178">The Minister&#039;s decision was the right decision for Northern Ireland. The Minister has to look at such decisions in a Northern Ireland context. We cannot afford to turn away the level of investment that John Lewis proposes, nor can we dictate to companies where they should locate. If we believe in a free market, we should believe properly in that free market.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para63"><a name="stpa_179">In respect of the impact on Lisburn city centre, the people who object to John Lewis are the same people&nbsp;who objected to the Marks and Spencer&#039;s store 15&nbsp;years ago. They said that a Marks and Spencer&#039;s at Sprucefield would destroy Lisburn city centre&#151;or town centre, as it was then. Today, the city centre is thriving, and Bow Street mall is the largest shopping centre in Northern Ireland. There is also the Lisburn square development&#151;there has been major investment in Lisburn city centre. Whatever measure is used, Lisburn city centre has benefited from the retail development at Sprucefield, and can benefit further from the development of the John Lewis store and the other units there.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para64"><a name="stpa_180">Let me say to my hon. Friend that, as I understand it, we are not talking about small 20 retail units, but a much smaller number of large retail units going in alongside the John Lewis store. That will help to ease the impact on town and city centres in Northern Ireland.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 221WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para65"><a name="stpa_181">I understand that competition breeds fear. There is no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt about that. When a new player, especially someone with the prestige of John Lewis, enters the market it is bound to create fear and opposition. I appreciate that, and believe that people should have the opportunity to express their concerns and to challenge decisions with which they do not agree.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para66"><a name="stpa_182">I also want to mention some other developments in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my constituency which I hope the Minister&#039;s Department and the Planning Service will do their best to push through the system, since they represent major investment. One is the relocation of the Coca-Cola bottling plant from Larnebeg to the Knockmore Hill industrial site. Again, we won that in stiff competition from Dublin, south of the border. We secured Coca-Cola as a continuing employer in Northern Ireland. The relocation will provide additional jobs in my area and the Greater Belfast area. Therefore, I hope that the planning system will put no major hurdles in the way of getting a speedy decision on the Coca-Cola application.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para67"><a name="stpa_183">I want to mention the development of the former Maze prison site. Again, I am aware that there may need to be further inquiries into the site&#039;s development, but it is a major asset. Let us not tie it up in the planning process and bureaucracy. That project should be fast-tracked, particularly since the national stadium project, as the Minister will know from her previous involvement with culture, arts and leisure in Northern Ireland, is so important to the development of sport there. We want to have the opportunity to bid for some Olympics events in 2012. The stadium at the Maze gives us a golden opportunity to do that. Let us get it up and running. Let us get builders on to the site as quickly as possible. Of course, we will allow people to have their say in a democracy, but let us have no undue delay in pushing that project forward, so that the new stadium is in place well in advance of the Olympics. I hope we shall then be able to attract events, so that Northern Ireland will benefit from London&#039;s success&#151;we supported it in its bid for the Olympic games.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para68"><a name="stpa_184">My hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McCrea) quite rightly mentioned the Crumlin asbestos store, to which the Minister granted approval in her previous capacity. I want to endorse his comments in that regard, but also draw the Minister&#039;s attention to my&nbsp;concerns about the Belfast hills. A proliferation of landfill sites are being granted approval there. The Belfast hills are a wonderful environmental asset to the people of Belfast and the Belfast metropolitan area, including the city of Lisburn. It pains me to see the way in which a multiplicity of landfill sites is gaining approval in the hills, with the impact that that will have on the environment of the area. Can the Minister advise her colleague, Lord Rooker, to look at the issue again? We need to preserve the Belfast hills not just for this generation but for future generations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para69"><a name="stpa_185">Roads and infrastructure form a major part of the planning process. We hope to secure additional investment to make major infrastructure improvements in Northern Ireland, including major road projects. Again, the planning system needs to be addressed here. The Roads Service can be tardy at times in its planning procedures for major roads projects. The planning system needs to give that priority.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 222WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para70"><a name="stpa_186">In my own constituency, for example, I think of the proposed Knockmore link between the M1 and the new north feeder road, which I welcome. That is close to completion at present and was entirely funded by private developers. There is scope for the planning system to encourage investment in local communities by making it part of planning delivery that we get returns from major development in terms of infrastructure improvements. The north Lisburn feeder road is a prime example of how that works, and I hope that the Knockmore link will take priority there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para71"><a name="stpa_187">Another priority for us is the upgrading of the link between Sprucefield and Lisburn city centre to help to improve the flow of traffic between the two retail centres, as is the possibility of a new south Lisburn orbital link to accommodate the increasing volume of traffic coming off the M1 motorway and into the south of the city of Lisburn.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para72"><a name="stpa_188">We also want the Department to deal with the question of office space provision in Lisburn city centre. We believe that the development of office space in the city centre is crucial to its strategic development and to increasing footfall in the retail space in Lisburn. We hope that that, along with car parking provision, will be given greater priority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para73"><a name="stpa_189">I finish by making a plea about the B23 Hillhall road, which is now a major route. Some of my hon. Friends who travel from the west of the Province use it regularly to bypass the M1 into Belfast city. The forthcoming major roadworks on the west link will mean a large increase for three years in the volume of traffic on the Hillhall road. The planning system needs to take account of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para74"><a name="stpa_190">It seems that the development of the Hillhall road is being fast-tracked, but the infrastructure is not being increased at the same time on that busy stretch of road. That needs to be revised. The concerns of local residents should be taken on board about the future development of the Hillhall road and the need to improve road safety. There is almost an accident a day on that stretch of road.

Several hon. Members have remarked on the lack of consistency in the Planning Service. Anyone from the Planning Service who is listening to the debate might well question the consistency of hon. Members as we politicians duck and weave on both sides of the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para76"><a name="stpa_192">I fully support what other hon. Members have said about the need for planning policy statement 5 to be developed, not only for all the reasons that have been given, such as the confusion and consternation created around the whole Sprucefield-Belfast situation, but because of Tesco&#039;s proposal for a shopping centre in Derry outside the city centre, which would have a major impact and would be a major drain on other businesses. Springtown centre, which is a small local centre not far from where Tesco would locate its super-development, was built with completely private local money. The planners are now telling the centre, which has been refurbished, that it will not be allowed to have any extra retail area because it competes with the city centre, even though it is quite clear that it does not. That is the sort of contradiction that exists for the Springtown centre, which is hardly a stone&#039;s throw from where Tesco proposes to put a superstore.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para77"><a name="stpa_193">That leaves people asking all sorts of questions, and comes on top of the fact that Seagate, a major employer in the area, has trouble coping with the scale of development around it. The roads cannot cope. I know that the Minister who will respond to the debate today is not a Minister at the Department of the Environment, but she is attached to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Industry in Northern Ireland, and I encourage her to visit Seagate in that capacity on a future trip to Derry. She might hear not only about the plans for future expansion, but about the confusion, which Seagate is experiencing as a major employer, that is caused by the lack of coherent planning and certainty around regional planning policy statements.

<a name="51101h02_para78"><a name="stpa_194">The Minister will be aware of the difficulties in my constituency in relation to the Craigavon area plan. I see her smiling. I am sure that she was on therapy when she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was dealing with the Craigavon area plan in her previous capacity. We have had several meetings in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past few months. I must express to her my disappointment and frustration about the plan and the continuing delays. In the 2004 draft plan, the planners, in their wisdom, did not designate the town centre boundaries&#151;they are now redrafting it. Months ago, they promised that a draft proposal would be issued by the end of the year, but planning officials informed me yesterday that that is not even on the Richter scale at the moment.

divided up and looked after by three people, as it is impossible for one person to do that. We therefore have a difficulty with delays, which stymie development.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para80"><a name="stpa_196">As the Minister will be aware from her visits to Craigavon, we have major potential for investment but the delay in the development plan is holding everything back. We have potential investment of &#163;300 million, but developers are being held back because they cannot get approval. We have the major Vico development in Portadown, the proposal for a &#163;30 million extension to the Rushmere shopping centre, and another proposed &#163;30 million investment in Magowan West in the Portadown area, but we cannot progress because of the area plan.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para81"><a name="stpa_197">For some reason, the Planning Service, in its wisdom, brought Colliers Consultants, an English consultancy company, into Northern Ireland to try to sort out the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retail query. I believe that the consultants met Craigavon district council once to introduce themselves. Since then, there has been no contact with the council about retail viability. We need to make some progress toward reaching a satisfactory conclusion. A lot of developers have purchased land and are waiting to proceed, but cannot.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para82"><a name="stpa_198">I shall deal briefly with the issue of housing indicators for the Craigavon area. Will the Minister speak to officials in the Planning Service to release phase 2 land there for housing? We were told that,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originally, 13,400 homes were planned for the Craigavon area. We are now told that that number has been reduced to 11,000. Time is moving on and others want to speak, so I will sit down, but will the Minister address some of those issues?

<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51101h02_spnew7"><b> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire)</b>  (LD): First, I must say how much I am looking forward to the Minister&#039;s response to the 72 detailed planning points that have been raised so far. Secondly, we always talk about normalisation in the Province. Having listened to hon. Members&#039; frustrations at the delays that occur and the randomness of the planning process, I say, &quot;Welcome to the normal planning process, as implemented across the rest of the United Kingdom.&quot; I find planning so frustrating in my area that I have considered standing for the local authority. It looks like a great deal of fun, although I suspect that the planning process has less to do with objective debate and more to do with a throw of the dice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para83"><a name="stpa_199">I applaud the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) for securing the debate and for highlighting issues that his constituents, and those of other hon. Members who have spoken, will be grateful have been raised. The Minister will be unable to respond to all the detailed points, but I hope that she will make the effort to respond in writing to the extensive list of frustrations that have been expressed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para84"><a name="stpa_200">Planning is particularly important in Northern Ireland because of the feeling that exists there that applicants cannot find an avenue to appeal in the same way as people can elsewhere. The hon. Member for East Antrim has provided a vital platform for those specific issues.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 225WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para85"><a name="stpa_201">I have a few general concerns about Northern Ireland planning policy. An inadequate approach to sustainable planning has been adopted. There are several examples of that, many of which have been highlighted already. I&nbsp;merely add that apartments are springing up in south Belfast, only to remain half full. Traffic congestion, the destruction of older buildings and plans to build houses and supermarkets in the green belt all give a sense of randomness not only in individual applications but in the strategic plan for Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para86"><a name="stpa_202">I agree with those hon. Members who feel that there must be a general review of planning policy statements to ensure that they are consistent with both economic and social needs and that the communities&#039; concerns are taken into account. We certainly need more clear targets for brownfield development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para87"><a name="stpa_203">Moreover, the Minister could easily take on board some other straightforward proposals. The abolition of VAT on renovation would encourage the use of existing buildings, which developers often shy away from because they cost more to renovate. Compared with new builds, less profit can be made from them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para88"><a name="stpa_204">The establishment of more conservation areas would make much sense, together with a more clear-headed look at out-of-town retail developments. We heard about the conflicting pressures that hon. Members from the Province face on that subject. It would help them and their communities if the Government provided clarity of direction on those issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para89"><a name="stpa_205">Councils should be able to initiate third-party appeals. Although it may not be practical to grant that power to individual residents, parties such as the Alliance party believe that the power should be vested in local councillors, through a weighted majority vote. I&nbsp;tend to agree with that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para90"><a name="stpa_206">We must see a strategic approach to develop best practice in the design of the urban environment. An opportunity exists to maximise cross-community mixing, which is connected to the urban landscape that one develops. Lord Rooker must be asked why he is reducing councils&#039; consultation powers on planning issues. We have already heard the reason why that could prove a difficult and counter-productive move. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that or write to us with an answer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para91"><a name="stpa_207">Finally, this may be a contradiction, but I agree with hon. Members&#039; frustrations with the speed of the planning process. We heard one dramatic example of the Environment and Heritage Service&#039;s repeated requests for a constituent to do surveys on his garden, which is falling into Belfast lough. Similar complaints are common in planning across the entire UK. Perhaps the Minister, with her sage-like, in-depth understanding of the issues, can make Northern Ireland a role model for the rest of us to follow, so that never again will those who are simply trying to protect their grass have to spend &#163;9,000 on understanding in detail the breeding habits of worms on the beach.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para92"><a name="stpa_208">We have had a wide-ranging debate. I am pleased that hon. Members have had the opportunity effectively to act as a kind of planning inspectorate. I hope that, today and in the days ahead, the Minister will give them the responses that they and their constituents deserve.

<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51101h02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) on securing the debate and, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) said, on enabling us once again to discuss the more normal aspects of life in Northern Ireland. That makes a pleasant change, especially after yesterday&#039;s very necessary debate, in which probably everyone in this Chamber took part. I&nbsp;intend to speak for just a few minutes to allow the Minister time to respond to the important issues raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para93"><a name="stpa_209">Planning has many objectives. It must balance the rights of those who live close to potential developments with the rights of developers themselves and the need for development. It must ensure sustainability as well as protect the countryside. It must achieve a balance between smaller shops and supermarkets, between affordable housing and larger housing, and between activity and not having too much traffic. There is a balance to be struck. The hon. Member for East Antrim was absolutely right when he said that two of the big problems are delays and accountability. If those delays are too long, or if accountability is not there, it is very difficult to achieve the balance and the objectives that I&nbsp;mentioned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para94"><a name="stpa_210">I pay tribute to the hon. Members for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea), for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson), for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foyle (Mark Durkan) and for Upper Bann (David&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simpson), who raised a number of local and important issues, such as inconsistency in decisions and third-party appeals. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Excuse me; I have come in this morning not feeling in the best of health.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para95"><a name="stpa_211">Hon. Members also mentioned levels of investment and the regional planning strategy, so many important issues need to be addressed. However, I entirely concur with the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire when he says that even in England the situation is far from perfect. The Government have introduced pressure to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delegate many planning decisions to officers; indeed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a financial inducement to do so. I do not necessarily think that that is the right way forward. I&nbsp;mention that only to demonstrate that even in England there is concern about the time that decisions are taking. That is perhaps something that the Minister needs to consider.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para96"><a name="stpa_212">By drawing my remarks to a hasty conclusion, I mean no disrespect to hon. Members from Northern Ireland; I am sure that they realise that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and I wanted them to speak, rather than to take the time ourselves. I had a meeting with the planning people in Northern Ireland last Thursday, and one of the questions that I asked was whether it was an objective to move the decision-making process to local councils. I was a little surprised at the answer, which was that not all councils want that authority or power. The people to whom I spoke said that some do and some do not. Perhaps that is a further problem, and perhaps the Minister could address that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para97"><a name="stpa_213">The other problem relayed to me was the shortage of people considering planning applications, given that quite a large number of applications are coming forward. As I represent an English constituency, I do not know the extent to which those two issues are problems, but I raise them because they were raised with&nbsp;me. It sounds like they are obstacles in the way of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 227WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
making progress towards a better planning system. I&nbsp;look forward to the Minister&#039;s response, not only to those two points, but to the many real issues raised by hon. Members representing constituencies in Northern Ireland.

</p>

<a name="51101h02_time7"><h5>12.14 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51101h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Angela E. Smith) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) on securing the debate and on discussing planning in such a lively and witty manner&#151;I think most people would not be able to do that. This is obviously a subject on which he feels strongly, and I assure him that my ministerial colleagues and I feel equally strongly about it. We want to ensure that we have an effective, efficient planning system in Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para98"><a name="stpa_214">The discussion highlights some of the areas of difficulty. A number of contradictory comments were made. There were comments about having to speed up the systems, but criticisms of methods to try do so and suggestions of new methods to improve accountability, which would slow down the system. That is not a criticism of any hon. Member. It just shows the complexities in the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para99"><a name="stpa_215">We recognise that, if Northern Ireland is to move forward in promoting the economy and jobs and in ensuring that we have the housing and transport infrastructure in place to provide sustainable, lively communities, we need to get these issues right. That cuts across all areas, particularly the built and natural environment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para100"><a name="stpa_216">I will do my best to address all the points that were raised. There were quite a lot of them. The hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) suggested that I might have had therapy. I assure him that in my time at the Department of the Environment I never needed therapy, and planning was one of the joys of my life.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para101"><a name="stpa_217">There was talk about the excuses made by the Planning Service about the pressures on it, and they were likened to the excuses of British Rail. British Rail would have used a growth in business not as an excuse but as a reason for what was happening&#151;it would have been delighted by a growth in business similar to that experienced by the Planning Service in Northern Ireland. I will give an example. In 2002&#150;03, there were some 27,500 applications on planning. In two years, that increased by a third to slightly more than 37,500. That is one of the factors that has led to work load pressures. I think that there are three others.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para102"><a name="stpa_218">One relates to the enforcement side. The case load on enforcement has risen dramatically. I partly welcome that, because there is a growing willingness on the part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the public to complain. However, it must be accepted that there is a growing willingness among some developers to flout the law. I am sorry that the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell) was not&nbsp;able to speak and has left, because he was involved in a particular matter in his constituency relating to Portstewart. Information was needed to take somebody to court and he was helpful in trying to obtain it and other evidence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para103"><a name="stpa_219">The development plan programme, which several hon. Members mentioned, is the most ambitious for any part of the UK. It is a massive programme and has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 228WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
brought an increasing strain on resources. I think that the number of objections to the draft plan in Magherafelt was more than 3,000.
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51101h02_spnew9"><b> Dr. McCrea </b> : Over 5,000.
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51101h02_spnew10"><b> Angela E. Smith </b> : Over 5,000. Not just the level of objections, but the level of responses is unprecedented, although some of the responses we get on the plans are supportive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para104"><a name="stpa_220">The number of responses to the Ards and Down plan, the Magherafelt plan, the northern area plan and BMAP were well in excess of any received for previous plans. Those pressures are increasing. So, too, are the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of people wanting to participate in the planning process. The transparency of the planning process encourages people to do that. There have been many more applications. All that is happening when the public have a right to expect, and do expect, greater turnaround, response and clarity in the process. That has provided a challenge and makes things more difficult. The Planning Service has done a lot of work to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase capacity to deal with that work load. Hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have recognised that some matters, including the key players giving responses, and some of the processes are outside the control of the Planning Service, which does its best to manage. I will discuss some of those comments in a moment.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para105"><a name="stpa_221">On short-term actions, the hon. Members for East Antrim, for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea) and for Upper Bann will recognise that we provided additional funding for an extra 125 planners to work in the Planning Service. We are not talking, as the hon. Member for South Antrim suggested, about junior officers replacing senior officers. It may have been newer officers replacing people who had more experience.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para106"><a name="stpa_222">I endorsed a decision to deploy staff as a short-term measure away from the area plans and on to planning decisions to address that work load. New staff have to get up to speed and to learn the processes. They were junior staff but they did not replace senior officers. They may have replaced more experienced staff. Decisions increased by 11 per cent. in that time. We are talking about the number of decisions increasing by 20 per cent. compared with the equivalent period last year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para107"><a name="stpa_223">The hon. Members for East Antrim, for Upper Bann, for South Antrim, and for Lagan Valley specifically mentioned the area plans. There is a need to act on that matter, but there is also political and public pressure to ensure that we have new revised policies. That has an impact on the number of applications that we receive. We must proceed with the reform and modernisation programme, which helps us to address those issues. Many of the deployed staff have returned to work on the area plans, but the pressures in respect of applications remain, and Lord Rooker felt that further short-term measures were needed to cope with the work load and to strengthen the focus on service delivery.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para108"><a name="stpa_224">The modernisation and reform programme clearly addresses the concerns that the hon. Member for South&nbsp;Antrim raised on accountability. Changes to the modernisation and planning processes are designed to increase accountability and transparency. The aims are to have a much simpler, faster and more accessible planning process to ensure speedier decisions; to reduce 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 229WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
regulation where appropriate; to ensure greater community involvement; to develop more streamlined development plan processes; and to produce clear and unambiguous planning policies to underpin decisions on planning applications. That has to be done as a matter of urgency, as Lord Rooker is aware. There are four key areas: reviewing processes and policies; introducing new technology, including e-planning, so that there is far more information and transparency, which is a major step forward; reforming the legislation; and taking forward internal organisational structural changes.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para109"><a name="stpa_225">One of the biggest challenges is the change programme that is being introduced. It has been designed only to support efficiency in the Planning Service, and that itself creates demand on services that are managed internally. Various initiatives have been aimed at improving the speed of decision making and the performance and monitoring of the new targets. As for procedures, outline planning permission has been reviewed and retained. Guidelines have been published and revised procedures introduced on repeat applications. On plans and policy, procedures are in place to ensure that they are developed in line with the regional development strategy. Increased resources have been put into enforcement, internal guidance has been revised and an enhanced programme of training has been developed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para110"><a name="stpa_226">On e-planning, to assist transparency, a new Planning Service internet website has been launched and now provides access to a range of information and advice. The area plans have also been placed on that site to increase transparency. The scope and detail of information on facilities has been increased considerably over the past year, and the website is now being used extensively.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para111"><a name="stpa_227">Several hon. Members raised the return of invalid applications. The hon. Member for South Antrim gave two examples. I cannot elaborate on those, but if he lets&nbsp;me have the details, I will look into it. However, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose of the measures is to ensure that, if an application is invalid, it is returned at an early stage. Previously, were an invalid application submitted, it would be sent back sometimes six months or even a year later with a request for further information. That is a waste of time for the applicant and staff. Invalid applications will be returned as soon as possible to the applicant with a request for the required information.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para112"><a name="stpa_228">If the hon. Member for South Antrim gives me the details of the group about which he is concerned, we will deal with that. However, I remind him that about 25 per cent. of applications are incomplete as to information, plans and fees, and the weight and pressure that that puts on the system is enormous. A scheme is being piloted in Belfast. If there are concerns about its operation, the Planning Service can examine that. However, it has been supported by the CBI and the Construction Employers Federation as a way of moving matters along more quickly, as it is designed to do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para113"><a name="stpa_229">The review of customer service standards is under way, examining how we manage contact with the customer to ensure that they get correct information. Work is continuing with the key consultees in the Roads Service, the Water Service and the Environment and Heritage Service, which was mentioned several times, to improve consultation relations.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para114"><a name="stpa_230">I shall address the matter of legislative reform. Hon. Members will be aware that, last Friday, Lord Rooker launched a consultation paper on proposed legislation for reform of planning. Members will have an opportunity to give their views on that. However, there are several interesting proposals, particularly the one about temporary stop notices, which the hon. Member for South Antrim recently mentioned to me. They will be used to halt a breach of planning control for a period of up to 28 days, as soon as a breach is identified. There is also a doubling of fines for breaches of advertising control, which will act as a deterrent. There are a number of legislative proposals. One that will be of particular interest is the removal of Crown immunity in the Planning Service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para115"><a name="stpa_231">Members mentioned council consultations. No one denies that councils have a key and statutory role to play in the planning process. Ensuring that that process works efficiently and effectively is a shared objective for councils and the Government. The current process has not changed for more than 30 years. On 30 September, there were 6,000 deferrals in the system. The practice of delaying decisions and accepting multiple referrals for site visits has built up over many years. The hon. Member for South Antrim said that site meetings were removed. They were not removed, but they might not be necessary in every case.
</p>






<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51101h02_spnew11"><b> Dr. McCrea </b> : They were removed.
</p>






<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51101h02_spnew12"><b> Angela E. Smith </b> : No, they were not, but they are not necessary in every single case. Where issues can only be addressed by a site visit, they will go ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para116"><a name="stpa_232">Consultation with local councillors is a central part of the planning process, and we believe that the proposals strike the right balance between ensuring that councils are consulted and express a view, and ensuring that there is swift decision making.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para117"><a name="stpa_233">The hon. Gentleman spoke about a lack of consistency in planning decisions. There is certainly a lack of consistency in the way in which councils operate the system, with some of them having more deferrals than others. The hon. Member for East Antrim said that we would consult councils less. We will not consult them less&#151;the same number of applications will go to the councils&#151;but there will be fewer deferrals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para118"><a name="stpa_234">There is also a right to hurry along, as it were, the decisions of other consultees. The head of the Planning Service is meeting with his counterparts in agencies such as the EHS and the Roads Service on that issue to ensure that all consultees are aware of that. Applications must be processed as quickly as possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para119"><a name="stpa_235">The hon. Member for South Antrim referred to the Crosshill and Cottonmont cases. I made the decisions on them when I had ministerial responsibility for the environment. Both of them are now subject to review. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not talk about those particular applications because of ongoing legal processes, but I will say that there is always a difficulty for constituencies when such decisions are made. He will be aware that, prior to making those decisions, I discussed the issues with many groups and received many representations. All views were considered prior to decisions being taken.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para120"><a name="stpa_236">The hon. Gentleman referred to third party appeals&#151;I am not sure whether his views on that were shared by all his party colleagues&#151;and the hon. Member for Foyle 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 231WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
(Mark Durkan) mentioned the contradictions in some of the issues that were being raised. A decision has not been made on third party appeals, but it must be accepted that, if we were to have such appeals, the delays in the planning decision process would be far greater than at present&#151;that would inevitably cause delays. That is because of the contradiction I mentioned earlier between accountability and speedier decision making.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para121"><a name="stpa_237">The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) and I met previously to talk about the Belfast hills, and I will ensure that his comments are brought to the attention of Lord Rooker. The hon. Member for Foyle asked me to visit Seagate when I next go to his constituency. I will visit his constituency shortly, but I have a full programme. However, I assure him that I will see if we can arrange a visit. I will also ask Lord Rooker to address the points that were raised on housing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h02_para122"><a name="stpa_238">The hon. Member for Upper Bann raised the issue of Craigavon town centre and the area plan. It is my understanding that the plan will be published by the end of 2005. That is the information I have been given today. If he has been given other information, we may want to discuss the matter. However, the senior planners in the Department tell me that they are still working to have the draft plan issued at around the turn of the year.

In this debate I am looking at the wider issue of the use of restraint in secure training centres. I am not dealing with overall secure training centre policy, the quality of education services in them, the reoffending rate or any other wider policy matters; I am concentrating on the use of restraint. My information is taken from official sources, including the many parliamentary questions I&nbsp;have tabled, and also from the people to whom I have spoken over the past 18 months.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para1"><a name="stpa_240">Any residential institution needs strategies for securing the safety of staff and residents. In a secure training centre it is inevitably going to be a complex task&nbsp;managing some difficult challenging behaviour by&nbsp;people who, although they may be young, may be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physically strong and also difficult. Many people would concede that, regrettable though it might be, any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strategy for behaviour management in such institutions would have to address the need for physical restraint. The question is what sort of restraint, at what stage it should be applied, for how long, with what checks, and what else should be tried beforehand in terms of de-escalation and prevention.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para2"><a name="stpa_241">My contention is that the present regime in the four secure training centres is unacceptable. I will set out the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extent of my concerns, and what I believe the Government need to do. The Minister&#039;s predecessor&#151;her fellow Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goggins)&#151;indicated in a written response that the restraint techniques in question, including distraction techniques, are supposed to be used as a last resort. However, Home Office figures show that the use of restraint in secure training centres is routine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para3"><a name="stpa_242">In 2002, restraint was used on 2,461 occasions; in 2003 it was used on 3,289 occasions; in the first few months of 2004 it was used 1,228 times. That means that in 2002 and 2003 it was used an average of four times a year on each resident or trainee accommodated during the course of the year in each secure training centre. To put it another way, across the whole establishment restraint was used between seven and nine times a day in 2002 and 2003, and in each of the secure training centres, restraint was used about twice a day, each and every day of the year. That is not a technique of last resort. That is routine use of physical control, sometimes involving the inflicting of pain on young people, day in and day out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para4"><a name="stpa_243">It is often assumed that those are the most severely disturbed, challenging and violent young people. Again, the reality is somewhat different. The median age of the young people in secure training centres in 2002 and 2003 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
was 14. Increasingly, they had not been convicted of anything at all. In 2002 almost one third of them were being held on remand, and in 2003 that figure had risen to almost half of them. What on earth does anyone think happens to a 14-year-old being held on remand when day in and day out&#151;they may have been there for a month or longer&#151;they witness the consistent use of physical force to control other young people?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para5"><a name="stpa_244">A report that I received stated that on her first night in one of the secure training centres, a girl who witnessed one of those incidents, in which another young girl was held in the restraint position for some time, then went into her room, curled into a ball and cried all night. After April 2004 a number of reviews were set up, including a review of the use of physical control in care, and a summary of the conclusions was posted on the Youth Justice Board website. As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, the use of the seated double embrace has been banned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para6"><a name="stpa_245">My hon. Friend said in a written answer today that figures were not held centrally on the number of times that the seated double embrace had been used in secure training centres. However, I understand that that information is recorded by each secure training centre, so it should be possible to provide it to the Home Office. The statement on the Youth Justice Board website restricted the use of other restraints, but allowed the continued use of many, including nose distraction. The review carried out by a team of experts showed, however, that many more restraint techniques should be scrapped&#151;about 20 in total, including the nose distraction technique. This is the technique described by the Howard League for Penal Reform as being a kind of karate chop. It puts staff at risk of being bitten, and young people at risk of nose bleeds.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para7"><a name="stpa_246">Another technique recommended for abolition was thumb distraction. It is described as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;This is another pain compliance technique which causes pain by stretching the joint capsule and ligaments of the thumb. It has a relatively high injury potential in youngsters. The mechanical disparity delivered by the force of an adult hand on a child&#039;s thumb has the potential to deliver more injury than other joint stretch pain compliance techniques&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para8"><a name="stpa_247">How on earth are we, in the 21st century, managing to run a regime for young people that includes the equivalent of thumbscrews?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para9"><a name="stpa_248">Since the double seated embrace was banned, increased use of handcuffs is reported. As my hon. Friend will know, I have tabled a question about that. In at least one of the institutions, in place of the double seated embrace a standing hold is used, but it has been reported to me that children are still being bent over&#151;and it is the bending that is so dangerous, because that is what prevents breathing. During the course of my investigations I had some of these holds demonstrated to me, and the risks are evident.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para10"><a name="stpa_249">There is also a real problem of churn among both staff and trainees in secure training centres. Medway, with 76 places, had a total of 322 residents or trainees in 2003 and Rainsbrook, which is the same size, had 289. Meanwhile, staff figures show that often there is a turnover of 20 to 25 per cent. of staff leaving in a year. At Medway, 101 of 256 staff left in 2003.

<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para11"><a name="stpa_250">Questions have been raised with me about the qualifications and training of staff. Are psychologists suitably qualified and registered? Have nursing staff who are supposed to be present and observe&#151;and, indeed, video&#151;the use of physical control been trained to know what they are looking at? Do then know when things become risky, and when to intervene? How many staff have higher education qualifications? How many staff have qualifications in child care or social work? What about training and procedures in relation to gender, such as the impact of male staff using physical restraint techniques on vulnerable young girls?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para12"><a name="stpa_251">Questions have also been raised about the appropriateness of the use of restraint, and whether physical control is being used not just to protect the safety of staff and residents, but to achieve compliance with instructions, which is not supposed to be allowed. There have also been questions about the quality of the guidance and the manuals on the use of restraint provided for staff. For example, in the central police training manual on the use of control techniques, police officers are told they should


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;pay close attention when they recognise the following symptoms, taking immediate action to remedy them and apply emergency aid&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para13"><a name="stpa_252">including if the


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;Subject tells the officer that they cannot breathe&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para14"><a name="stpa_253">I understand that there is no such caveat in the training manual for secure training centre staff, although one might have prevented the tragedy of April last year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para15"><a name="stpa_254">There has been criticism of the length of time for which children are held in these positions of restraint. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one institution staff reported recently that they thought it reasonable to hold them for up to 40 minutes. Questions have also been raised about the monitoring and reporting arrangements, and about the sharing of information and skills across the different private companies which run these institutions. There has been criticism of the way in which the complaints systems operate in one of the institutions, on the ground that the complaints procedure was too internally focused.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para16"><a name="stpa_255">It is completely wrong that it should take 18 months and an Adjournment debate to get the full statement from the Home Office on the use of restraint in secure training centres. The short statement posted on the Youth Justice Board website does no justice at all to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerns that have been voiced and the reviews that&nbsp;have been carried out in this difficult policy area. The fact that after repeated concerns were raised in Parliament by me and by other hon. Members it was sneaked out during the recess is woeful.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para17"><a name="stpa_256">During that 18 months of delay, hundreds of other children and young people have passed through those institutions. There are two actions that the Government should take, bearing in mind the fact that those four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;institutions&#151;the only ones in the secure training centre&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;programme&#151;are all in the private sector, and not open to the controls that might apply to public sector institutions. There is sufficient ground for concern at Hassockfield and Oakhill for the Home Office to conduct a stringent review of the contracts with the companies involved, to ensure that they are capable of complying with what is required to provide a safe regime for young people and staff, and that any penalties for non-performance are applied.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 235WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para18"><a name="stpa_257">At Medway and Rainsbrook, however, the position is more serious. Those are the two secure training centres with the greatest use of restraint. One of them was also the scene of the serious incident last April. In addition, I understand that those centres did not allow admission to the consultants employed by the Home Office to carry out the review of physical control in care. In those circumstances, the contract with the private company responsible for these two centres should be terminated, because they have not shown that they have provided, or indeed are able to provide, a regime that is either appropriate for the staff or safe for the young people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para19"><a name="stpa_258">Terminating the contract would leave the front-line staff in place, but ensure that a management structure and team that could instigate the changes in procedures and policies needed in these institutions to protect both&nbsp;staff and residents was put in position. In the past 18 months, I have looked at many reports and spoken to many people about what happens in the secure training centres, and the problems associated with their use of restraint exceed my worst fears. For the Government to fail to act on this matter would be a complete dereliction of duty.

</p>



<a name="time_18">
<a name="51101h03_time1"><h5>12.43 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51101h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) on raising this important matter, which we have spoken about before. The use of restraint on young people in secure training centres is rightly a matter of concern, and I welcome this opportunity to discuss it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para20"><a name="stpa_259">It may help if I begin by saying something about the role of the centres, which are a relatively recent addition to the youth justice system. The first centre, Medway, opened in 1998 and three more are now operating. The most recent, Oakhill, came into operation in August last year. The aim of the centres is to provide high-quality education and care for young people between the ages of 12 and 17 who have been sentenced to custody. As my hon. Friend said, they also accommodate some young people who have been remanded in the care of a local authority with a requirement that they be kept in secure conditions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para21"><a name="stpa_260">From a modest start&#151;Medway originally held 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trainees&#151;the secure training centres now provide 274 places for young people. Placement is, in most cases, decided by the Youth Justice Board and takes account of the young person&#039;s age, sex and assessment of vulnerability, and where he or she lives. STCs seek to combine the high staff-trainee ratio that is also a feature of secure children&#039;s homes, with the benefits of a larger establishment&#151;in particular, the ability to run a wider range of programmes, with an emphasis on education.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para22"><a name="stpa_261">Those young children do not only have the problem of lack of educational achievement; they frequently have a range of other difficulties, including unstable family relationships, substance and alcohol misuse and mental health problems. Many have poor social skills and little understanding of the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, so for those who run STCs, maintaining good order is necessarily a high priority.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 236WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para23"><a name="stpa_262">That has become more problematic as the average age of trainees at STCs has increased. Originally, the centres held only 12 to 14-year-olds under secure training orders. After April 2000, when the secure training order was replaced by the detention and training order, the centres began to take older, and therefore physically more developed, children. As my hon. Friend admitted, such children can be very strong. The reality is of physically well developed but socially unskilled young people who, often for the first time in their lives, are expected to adapt to the standards of behaviour that the rest of us think of as normal. There is bound to be some resistance, and staff need to be skilled in dealing with that. The guiding principle is that physical methods of restraint should be used only as a last resort; other methods of behaviour management should be used to resolve incidents whenever possible.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para24"><a name="stpa_263">The Youth Justice Board has been consulting on a draft code of practice for managing children&#039;s and young people&#039;s behaviour in the secure estate. The code places very strong emphasis on maximising the use of non-restraint methods of behaviour management, in order to minimise the need for physical intervention. I expect to receive the final version of the code for approval in the near future. The YJB is also seeking to develop guidance on and training in behaviour management techniques as part of the follow-up to its review of physical restraint in care.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para25"><a name="stpa_264">Regrettably, however expert STC staff are at managing behaviour, on some occasions physical restraint will have to be used. Staff may need to act quickly to prevent trainees from harming themselves, another trainee or a member of staff. It may also be necessary to restrain a trainee from damaging property or escaping from custody. Use of restraint must, of course, be lawful, and the use of restraint is authorised for those strictly limited purposes by rule 38(1) of the STC rules, which are a statutory instrument laid before Parliament.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para26"><a name="stpa_265">A system of physical interventions known as physical control in care&#151;PCC&#151;was developed in the late 1990s for use in STCs. It was approved by the Secretary of State on the advice of a panel of experts, including medical experts. It was designed to be non-pain-compliant, although, as my hon. Friend said, it includes certain distraction techniques that involve the brief infliction of pain. Those techniques may be used where necessary for safety reasons. PCC may be used only by staff who have received the proper training. There are strict guidelines about how incidents involving the use of restraint are managed, and each incident must be properly recorded within 12 hours of its occurrence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para27"><a name="stpa_266">PCC has recently been reviewed by a panel of experts, again including medical experts. The review began in March 2004. Following the death the next month to which my hon. Friend referred, the use of one type of hold previously approved as part of PCC has been discontinued, and others have been modified. My noble Friend Baroness Scotland has approved the new arrangements, and the YJB published a summary of the panel&#039;s recommendations in September this year. My hon. Friend suggests that it was sneaked out during the recess, but I believe that that is a misrepresentation. It would have been utterly wrong of Ministers to delay until Parliament had returned the production of such important information about the way in which physical control in care is managed.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para28"><a name="stpa_267">The YJB plans to publish a full report of the review in the fairly near future. The reason for delaying the full report is that the follow-up review covers a number of other matters, including the recommendations of the expert panel that focus on more general issues of behaviour management. If we are to ensure that physical restraint is in practice a last resort, we must ensure that behaviour management techniques that do not rely on physical restraint are well developed and effective.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para29"><a name="stpa_268">My hon. Friend expressed particular concern about the Rainsbrook centre. It would be helpful for her to visit the centre, and I understand that the operators have invited her to do so. I have suggested that she also discuss her concerns with the chief executive of the Youth Justice Board. She is aware that I have spoken to him and to the deputy chief executive about the full range of those concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para30"><a name="stpa_269">The most recent inspection of Rainsbrook was carried out by the Commission for Social Care Inspection in January 2005. It found that monthly meetings were held at which the quality assurance and information officer presented an analysis of the data on the use of physical restraint, single separations and sanctions applying to young people. All the senior managers at the meeting considered in detail the information&#151;including trends over time&#151;on young people, the staff involved and the location of incidents. A young person was invited to the final part of the meeting to provide feedback on his experience of being subject to control.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para31"><a name="stpa_270">All that is part of the process, which is quite well developed, of ensuring that the implementation of policy is as close as possible to our ambitions to reduce the use of physical control, to improve other means of behaviour management and to ensure that things are monitored well. In practice, they are monitored well at individual centres, even if we do not always have the IT mechanisms to ensure that data collected locally can be centrally provided at reasonable cost. Each of the centres is inspected every year, and in addition to those regular CSCI inspections, there are a range of random inspections.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para32"><a name="stpa_271">My hon. Friend expressed concerns about staff recruitment and retention. I hope that she will be aware that before commencing work, all staff must undergo a comprehensive vetting process that includes an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check and employer vetting. The contracts with secure centre operators require that all successful job applicants should be vetted both by the employer and the authority&#151;now the Youth Justice Board, but previously the Home Office. That consists of the CRB checks I have just referred to and the verification of the employment history of each applicant.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para33"><a name="stpa_272">Before an individual commences employment in a secure training centre, the employer must verify that individual&#039;s employment over the previous five years. Within three months of their commencing work, the employer must verify their employment history over the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previous 20 years, or from when they left school. Rebound, the operator of Rainsbrook, has assured the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth Justice Board that no member of staff employed at the centre has been subject to disciplinary procedures, suspension or conviction for a criminal offence while employed at Northamptonshire social services department or any other such department.

<p>
<a name="51101h03_para34"><a name="stpa_273">The Youth Justice Board is committed to working with the organisations that provide custody for children to make sure that the behaviour of young offenders is dealt with in a constructive and positive way whenever possible, and with minimum physical intervention. The way in which statistics are presented can imply a widespread and common use of physical restraint. However, our rigorous reporting requirements mean that such physical intervention as using an arm to encourage a child to behave in a particular way would be reported, because we need to be rigorous in ensuring that all incidents are reported.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para35"><a name="stpa_274">My hon. Friend&#039;s focus on the most concerning aspect of physical control in care, which is the use of pain-compliant techniques&#151;she is right to be concerned about that&#151;implies that it is a frequent occurrence in our secure training centres. However, I agree that those techniques must be used only in a tiny number of exceptional cases, and in the context of the number of&nbsp;places available in each centre, the use of any form of restraint is reported less than twice a month per place in our centres.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para36"><a name="stpa_275">We need to ensure that that such use is minimised and that our staff have the appropriate skills to manage behaviour without using physical restraint. However, in order to protect trainees as well as staff from potentially violent incidents, methods to distract children who behave dangerously are required. When essential, pain-distraction techniques are authorised, but I do not want this debate to leave the impression that they are a common feature of our restraint techniques.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para37"><a name="stpa_276">The Youth Justice Board works with organisations that provide custody for children to ensure that young offenders&#039; behaviour is dealt with constructively and positively wherever possible, and that physical intervention is kept to a minimum. For that reason the production of a full code of practice has been delayed, because it seems right to us that restraints should be used only as a minor part of a suite of behaviour-influencing tools. The YJB will produce the full report on behaviour management, which will be backed up with training and will include the full final report of the review of physical control in care.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para38"><a name="stpa_277">We are determined to improve the systems of restraint used in custodial establishments. The YJB has completed its review; it is also working with the Prison Service to see whether the latter&#039;s system of restraint can be modified, so that it relies less on the controlled use of pain to achieve compliance.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h03_para39"><a name="stpa_278">My hon. Friend raised her concerns about the use of handcuffs. I approved an answer to her parliamentary question over the weekend, so it will probably be in her pigeonhole today. It appears to me that centres that use handcuffs can use them to reduce the incidence of other methods of physical control. There is often a trade-off. I would be interested to learn her comments when she views the figures.

<p>
<a name="51101h03_para40"><a name="stpa_279">Difficult choices must be made. The YJB is determined to learn from the best. That is why it is discussing with the Prison Service whether other adaptations can be made.

<a name="51101h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Renewable Transport Fuels</h3>

<a name="time_19">
<a name="51101h04_time0"><h5>1 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51101h04_spnew0"><b> Norman Lamb  (North Norfolk)</b>  (LD): This is a timely debate; I have even heard a suggestion that the Prime Minister might make some sort of announcement on the issue soon, and I will be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s response to what I say. Many of us have been pursuing the issue of renewable transport fuels for a long time&#151;and I am pleased to see that Baroness Shephard has just arrived in the Gallery to hear the debate. She has been active in pursuing the subject, alongside others from across the political divide.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para0"><a name="stpa_281">This debate comes at a time when it is clear that the Government&#039;s domestic target for reducing carbon emissions&#151;a 20 per cent. reduction by 2010, from a 1990 baseline&#151;will not be met. I understand that we have achieved a reduction of only 4 per cent. so far, so the chances of meeting the domestic target seem low, if not non-existent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para1"><a name="stpa_282">In the transport sector, carbon emissions are actually increasing, when all the emphasis should be on reducing them. There was an 8.8 per cent. increase between 1990 and 2005. Among those of us who have been campaigning for effective action to kick-start a domestic biofuels industry, there is great frustration that so far nothing effective has happened. It is interesting to look back, and soon after I was elected in 2001, I took a delegation of North Norfolk farmers to see Lord Whitty at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. At that stage, the subject was very much a minority pursuit. Farmers were starting to talk about biofuels as a possible new income stream, but there were many sceptics&#151;including some on the environmental side.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para2"><a name="stpa_283">Since then, there has been growing momentum. Indeed, when one talks to Ministers privately, it is clear that on the Government side there is growing acceptance of the need for action. The frustration is that that has not yet been backed up by anything that will effectively kick-start a biofuels industry.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para3"><a name="stpa_284">I was struck by an article in <i>The Observer </i>last Sunday, written by the Prime Minister. He says&#151;this demonstrates the change that has occurred since those early days:

<a name="51101h04_para4"><a name="stpa_285">I do not think that he has ever said anything like that before.

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51101h04_spnew1"><b> Mark Williams  (Ceredigion)</b>  (LD): Does my hon.&nbsp;Friend acknowledge that there is provision in the Energy Act 2004 for the Minister to introduce a renewable transport fuel obligation? I am sure that my hon. Friend will press the Minister to give some assurance as to the outcome of the feasibility study that the Government are undertaking on the introduction of such an obligation.
</p>






<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51101h04_spnew2"><b> Norman Lamb </b> : My hon. Friend pre-empts me; I was going to come to that later. Many of us campaigned for that provision in the 2004 Act, and as my hon. Friend suggests, it is essential that the Minister responds to that idea.

<p>
<a name="51101h04_para5"><a name="stpa_286">To complete my quotation, the Prime Minister says that the increased use of biofuels is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;already well developed in Brazil and the US&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para6"><a name="stpa_287">Actually, it is already well developed in Europe, too, as I shall explain. He goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;If we can achieve just 5 per cent of fuel from renewable sources by 2010 that has the potential to take more than one megatonne of carbon.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para7"><a name="stpa_288">That means that it could take away more than one megatonne of carbon emissions. So the Prime Minister is now making the case for biofuels.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para8"><a name="stpa_289">I will focus on the renewable transport fuel obligation proposal, which, as my hon. Friend said, was facilitated by the Energy Act 2004. However, first I want to say a word or two about what is happening elsewhere, because there has been some dramatic progress in the United States. In May this year, a fascinating article in <i>The Economist </i>highlighted the progress that has been made elsewhere, and maize-based ethanol production in the United States is increasing each year by 30 per cent. Brazil has long been the world leader; it has produced vast quantities of bioethanol, in particular. China has built the world&#039;s largest ethanol plant, so we must think again about our assumptions that that country is a big polluter, as it is looking at how to produce renewable energy. Germany is focusing on biodiesel; it is raising production by 40 to 50 per cent. a year. France&#039;s aim is&nbsp;to triple output of biodiesel and bioethanol by 2007. The article then referred to &quot;backward Britain&quot;. That is depressing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para9"><a name="stpa_290">Fascinating developments are taking place in the mix of fuel. We have assumed so far that we can have only a low mix of bioethanol, in particular, with ordinary carbon fuels. However, the picture is changing. Europe has a typical 5 per cent. of biodiesel mix but, unbeknown to them, many drivers in the United States are already using a 10 per cent. ethanol mix with standard gasoline&#151;and that can be higher. In both the United States and Canada, public sector vehicles are running on a 20 per cent. mix. In California, 100 per cent. biodiesel is used regularly. Some companies in this country are doing the same, with the limited amount of biodiesel that is already in production. Much work has been done to include additives that make the fuel usable at low temperatures, which has until now been a problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para10"><a name="stpa_291">In the United States and Brazil, flex-fuel engines have been developed; they allow the use of a high mix of bioethanol&#151;up to 75 per cent.&#151;with petrol. The driver behind the increase in the development of biofuels in the United States has been the price of mineral fuels, although that is still low by our standards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para11"><a name="stpa_292">As we know, the United States Government have not been particularly interested in the imperative of tackling climate change, but the case for action is threefold, the first and most important reason being the imperative of tackling climate change. I quoted the Prime Minister earlier, and I wish to stress that if every private car used 5 per cent. biofuels, it would lead to a reduction in transport sector emissions of 1 megatonne of carbon, That is a substantial contribution to the objective of cutting carbon emissions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para12"><a name="stpa_293">The second case for action concerns fuel security and price. There is a strong argument for breaking the reliance on what are ultimately unstable regions of the world. Over the years, that has had a distorting effect on 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 242WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
foreign policy. We can argue about the impact of the pursuit of oil in respect of the war in Iraq, but whatever our view on that subject, there is clear evidence that it has distorted foreign policy objectives over the years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para13"><a name="stpa_294">The third objective is to produce a new income stream for rural communities and farmers, in particular. Farmers&#151;certainly in Norfolk, as well as elsewhere in the country&#151;face a massive loss of income as a result of the sugar regime reforms, together with other reforms of the common agricultural policy. We can argue about the extent of the sugar regime reform, but there is a broad consensus that it has to change, and the impact of lost income could be significant for farmers. This provides the potential for a new income stream and a boost to the rural economy. A study commissioned by the East of England Development Agency two or three years ago showed that we could generate about 20,000 new jobs, mostly in rural areas, if we developed a significant biofuels industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para14"><a name="stpa_295">I have outlined three objectives that the Government can achieve: real impact on climate change, impact on fuel security and a boost for the rural economy. That is win, win, win for the Government and I hope that they will take the chance to achieve those objectives. The great fear of many of us is that if they delay even longer, all we will see is imports of biofuels sucked in from overseas, and a failure to take advantage of the great opportunity that is before us.
</p>






<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51101h04_spnew3"><b> Dr. Alan Whitehead  (Southampton, Test)</b>  (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is making a case that I have fully and strongly supported for a long time. Does he consider that the best way to introduce a renewable fuel obligation would be alongside the present fuel duty reduction provision, rather than as a replacement for it, and also that the biofuel specified in the obligation should be sustainably sourced? Will he join me in welcoming the commitment of the biofuels industry to work alongside producers and non-governmental organisations to achieve the highest standard of sustainability?
</p>






<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51101h04_spnew4"><b> Norman Lamb </b> : I have been pre-empted again. Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead); he has long campaigned for biofuels, and what he has said today is consistent with the case he has been arguing for many years. I agree with the important points that he has made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para15"><a name="stpa_296">What do we need to do now? The Government must make a commitment before the end of the year&#151;perhaps in the pre-Budget report or the report on the climate change review&#151;to introduce a renewable transport fuel obligation, and they must also commit to having that in place by 2007, so that the industry can start to gear up to produce the fuel by the time the commitment is in force.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para16"><a name="stpa_297">The European Union biofuels directive which came into force in 2003 sets indicative targets; it gives targets for member states on the percentage of fuel sales coming from biofuels. The indicative target for 2005 was 2 per cent. However, the target that the Government actually committed to was 0.3 per cent.&#151;far below the directive&#039;s indicative target. The target in the directive for 2010 is 5.75 per cent. Can we have a commitment, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 243WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
alongside the commitment to introduce an obligation, that we will achieve that target by 2010? That will have an impact; it will stimulate investment in plant to produce the amount of biofuels required.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para17"><a name="stpa_298">It is also necessary for the Government to give a commitment to keep the obligation in place for a reasonable period. It has been suggested to me that it should be in place until at least 2015, so that there will be certainty that the investment will take place. That would be in line with the electricity renewables obligation already in place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para18"><a name="stpa_299">Will the Government also undertake to increase the target level beyond 2010? We have said that we would like the target of 5.75 per cent.&#151;the indicative target in the directive&#151;to be achieved by 2010, but it is not good enough to leave that as the final objective. With the capacity to adapt engines to take a higher percentage of biofuels, it should be possible to have significantly higher targets for the mix in the years beyond 2010.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para19"><a name="stpa_300">To pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, further work must be done on carbon accreditation, with a certification scheme to prove carbon savings, and on environmental and social standards. That will help to give investor confidence. However, it is also important to give confidence to the wider community that the move towards biofuels will not have adverse consequences. The law of unintended consequences often applies in respect of new legislation and new commitments, and we must make sure that we have the arrangements in place now to avoid those unintended and unattractive consequences.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para20"><a name="stpa_301">There is a particular sustainability concern regarding the production of palm oil, with fears of deforestation as well as concerns about labour practices in south-east Asia. That concern must be addressed, and Friends of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Earth has come forward with sensible recommendations to ensure that the development does not have those adverse impacts. Taking those recommendations on board would seem sensible, to me, in moving to introduce a commitment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para21"><a name="stpa_302">Industry has also repeated its call for enhanced capital allowances. A reply that I received from a Treasury Minister in July showed encouraging indications of a willingness to consider capital allowances, but it also confirmed that no decision had been taken&#151;as appears to be the case with so much else in this connection. Can the Minister indicate whether there has been any move on that front?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para22"><a name="stpa_303">Finally, there is the importance of what the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, said about maintaining the duty differential alongside the obligation. We should not just replace one with the other. That would not give the stimulus needed for investment.

speak&#151;but there is one crucial matter for which I am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sure he will agree the Minister here today is not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible. Going back over 10 years, more or less every Government Department but the Treasury has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signed up to this idea. Zero-rating on biofuels is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the crucial question. I am encouraged by the Prime&nbsp;Minister&#039;s comments in <i>The Observer</i>; does the hon. Gentleman think that he might perhaps have some influence over the Chancellor?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para23"><a name="stpa_304">The time for action has come; in fact, it is long overdue. Can the Minister respond positively, and say whether the Prime Minister has already spoken today to confirm that that action will be taken?

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51101h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) on securing the debate today on an important subject, and I thank hon. Members who have taken the time and trouble to attend. I am sure many people are watching the debate, but as the hon. Gentleman will probably guess, there is some focus elsewhere on this particular issue today. We shall see what happens there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para24"><a name="stpa_305">This is an important and timely debate. Climate change is rising up the agenda of Governments around the world. Today, the UK hosts the first meeting under the new Gleneagles dialogue, between the G8 and China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. That will focus on what is needed to make the transition to a low-carbon economy, and consider how existing and future energy technologies can generate the low-carbon power that the world needs. In the UK we have been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing precisely that in reviewing our climate change programme&#151;thinking about measures to reduce emissions across the economy, including from transport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para25"><a name="stpa_306">Public interest in the environmental impact of transport has never been higher. Recent events such as the flooding in New Orleans and hurricanes in the gulf of Mexico have raised awareness still further. As we made clear in our White Paper &quot;The Future of Transport&quot; in 2004, the challenge that we face is to balance the increasing demand for travel against the goal of protecting the environment. As a society we are travelling further than we used to, for both work and leisure. Transport-related CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions are rising, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of overall emissions. Road transport alone accounts for 20 per cent of the CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions in Britain, so it is vital that we promote a shift towards cleaner low-carbon road transport where it is feasible and affordable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para26"><a name="stpa_307">Improving the efficiency of our vehicles, and offering better and more reliable public transport, are important aspects of our strategy. However, renewable transport fuels have a key role to play too. In the longer term, that could mean renewable hydrogen, offering the prospect of zero tailpipe emissions. In the short term at least, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 245WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
renewable transport fuels means biofuels. As we have heard, biofuels offer significant carbon savings compared to fossil fuels, and other advantages too&#151;economic opportunities for rural areas, and diversity of energy supply benefits, to mention but two.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para27"><a name="stpa_308">There are excellent prospects for technological advances with biofuels too. Today they are made from crops such as wheat and oilseed rape, but tomorrow could see fuels made from the organic parts of our household waste. Biofuels tick so many of the boxes when it comes to finding a greener alternative to petrol and diesel. Among the

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para28"><a name="stpa_309">advantages, they are potentially easy to source, they work with modern engines and they are potentially carbon-neutral.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para29"><a name="stpa_310">We recognise those benefits, and that is why biofuels already enjoy a 20p a litre fuel duty incentive over conventional fuels. This year&#039;s Budget announced that the fuel duty differentials of 20p a litre on biodiesel and bioethanol would continue until 2008.
</p>






<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51101h04_spnew9"><b> Norman Lamb </b> : Does the Minister accept that the duty differential has not yet given the kick-start needed to get the biofuels industry going in this country?
</p>






<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51101h04_spnew10"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : I can understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s enthusiasm and his concern to move things on as quickly as possible. We have made a start, and I hope that the rest of my speech will give him more comfort on that issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para30"><a name="stpa_311">The differentials are making an important difference to sales. Biofuels are now available at well over 150 sites across the country, and 10 million litres were sold in September alone. We are currently well on track to meet a biofuels sales target of 12 million litres a month by the end of this year, which would account for 0.3 per cent. of overall fuel sales. We are aware that 0.3 per cent. may not seem like a huge amount, but it is important to realise that we are building sales quickly and that we are still at an early stage in the development of a sustainable biofuels industry in Britain.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para31"><a name="stpa_312">Sales have risen rapidly since 2004, thanks to the 20p&nbsp;a litre price differential for bioethanol introduced in January. In fact, 12 million litres a month would represent a tenfold increase in sales over 2004. It is also important to understand why we cannot support a much more dramatic increase in biofuel sales over night. There is still a huge variation in carbon savings between the best biofuels and the worst.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para32"><a name="stpa_313">There are also questions over the sustainability of supplies, especially, as the hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned, in view of the threat of deforestation abroad. It is vital that we get the long-term policy right. There is the possibility that vegetable oils can be refined directly with conventional hydrocarbons in major oil refineries, although the process has yet to be proven on a large scale. That could give us cheaper and higher-quality biofuels at lower cost. We are very interested in examining that process, as it could allow a significant shift in the scale of biofuel production. We are about to undertake a pilot project to examine how such a scheme could work. The tendering process is under way, and the Government are expecting the project to begin from 2006, subject to European approval.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para33"><a name="stpa_314">We have also taken advantage of the regional selective assistance grant system to fund the development of a biofuels processing plant in Scotland. The Argent plant in Motherwell benefited from a grant of &#163;1.2 million from the Scottish Executive, and is now up and running, producing high quality biodiesel from a variety of sources, including used cooking oil and tallow.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para34"><a name="stpa_315">We have also been looking at capital allowances to support biodiesel production, and have been talking to the industry about the merits of an enhanced capital allowance scheme for the cleanest plants. Of course, we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have also been closely examining the possibility of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;introducing a renewable transport fuel obligation, which hon. Members have mentioned. Such an obligation would place a legal obligation on transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a proportion of their road fuel supplies were from renewable energy resources.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para35"><a name="stpa_316">As we have heard, an RTFO could have a number of advantages as a policy mechanism. A successful policy would provide certainty for industry by setting out targets over the longer term. It would encourage efficiencies and economies of scale by mainstreaming the market, and it would promote investment in production facilities and advances in technology.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para36"><a name="stpa_317">We have been carrying out a detailed study over the past 10 months or so to examine how an obligation in the&nbsp;transport sector might work. The study set out to establish the cost-effectiveness, administrative feasibility and legal acceptability of an obligation. It also examined how concerns over sustainability and carbon savings might be taken into account, to ensure that the right kinds of biofuels are incentivised, and to avoid the promotion of fuels that would, for example, lead to deforestation in areas such as south-east Asia.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para37"><a name="stpa_318">We held a series of stakeholder workshops in spring&nbsp;to discuss in detail how such a scheme might operate,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we have had informal discussions with the European Commission and others about it. We are now considering the findings of the feasibility study in the context of our revised climate change programme, which is due to be published shortly. We have already said that we will set an ambitious and realistic target for biofuels sales in 2010, once the right policy measures have been decided. That should give industry the longer-term certainty that it is asking for, and a clear policy framework to ensure that targets are delivered.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para38"><a name="stpa_319">Meanwhile, we continue to build up valuable experience of biofuels through pilot studies and test projects&#151;funded, for example, by our new and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renewable energy research and development programme. The Government Car and Dispatch Agency uses a 5 per cent. biodiesel blend in its London-based delivery fleet. At local government level, many local authorities and police forces are using biofuels. For example, Somerset county council has announced a joint initiative with several partners to introduce fleets of Ford flexi-fuel vehicles. The cars will use a fuel blend containing up to 85 per cent. bioethanol, which will be produced locally from sugar or starch crops such as sugar beet and cereals. Avon and Somerset police and Wessex Water are also committed to using the flexi-fuel vehicles as part of their fleets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para39"><a name="stpa_320">Renewable fuels are high up our list of priorities as we seek to balance the need for mobility against the need to protect the environment. Governments across the world 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 247WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
increasingly recognise that our reliance on fossil fuels will not last for ever and that we have to find cleaner and better solutions to our transport needs. Every week that passes, we get slightly closer to finding those solutions&#151;solutions that are environmentally friendly, efficient and cost-effective. Among them, biofuels have enormous potential, and the Government remain committed to developing a future transport system in which they can play a significant role.
 

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h04_para40"><a name="stpa_321">We want to give biofuels their best chance of succeeding as a major contributor to a greener future. The strategy has to be long-term, with sustainable supplies from the right production facilities. As I said at the beginning, the Government have been considering biofuels in the broader context of our revised climate change programme, which is due to be published shortly, and will set out new measures to take us towards our climate change goals. I sincerely hope that hon. Members will have every reason to welcome the publication of the new programme.

<a name="time_22">
<a name="51101h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51101h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b>  (Lab): This brief debate is an opportunity to do three things&#151;first, to celebrate a local achievement in South Derbyshire, secondly, to see what lessons can be drawn from what has happened, and thirdly, to ask some questions about the future. To start with the achievements, the Safer South Derbyshire partnership is regarded as the leading crime and disorder reduction partnership in Derbyshire by the local constabulary. It is seen as a model of how local organisations in a diverse community can get together to discuss and resolve how to address issues relating to crime and the fear of crime.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para0"><a name="stpa_322">Among the successful projects in which the partnership has been involved, in several of which I have participated, are the school safety days, during which pupils work with drama groups to examine issues relating to antisocial behaviour and prejudice. Having witnessed one of the performances, I know that the organisers managed to secure a great deal of engagement with young people on some of the key issues of understanding what constitutes antisocial behaviour, and how diverse prejudice can be.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para1"><a name="stpa_323">One of the critical elements of support for diversionary activity on demand for young people, to which I shall return when I address the lessons that can be learned, is empowering local people to find local solutions. In one case, young people came up with the idea of organising a football league to run through the summer, when some of them might have been engaged in other less constructive activities. That was set up, has been very successful, and will now continue into a Christmas league. One of the key points is that young people suggested that that was something that they would like to do for themselves.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para2"><a name="stpa_324">A third, highly successful initiative is liberation day&#151;which I do not always manage to attend because it tends to be timetabled when Parliament is sitting, regrettably, and sometimes on the busiest days. It is held by the local police force and the partnership to highlight the needs of older people and to address their concerns about crime and the fear of crime. They try to make it a fun day. The most recent event was focused on VE-day celebrations, with many people bringing along memorabilia from the last war. Some people dressed up in costumes, although I did not participate in that. They had a lot of fun, but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;got across some key messages about how to make people feel safer. Invitations were given to a wide range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of local groups that work with older people, and about 650 people attended, in a fairly small community centred around the town of Swadlincote, with some people bussed in from outside. It was a marvellous success.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para3"><a name="stpa_325">I have already touched in other parliamentary exchanges on the safer homes initiative, which pays for a joiner who is uniformed and uses a branded van, and is therefore clearly identifiable as part of the initiative. The joiner travels around installing burglar alarms and better home security, checking on windows and doors, and so on. I visited some people who have benefited from that scheme, and they were tremendously impressed by both the professionalism of the individual and the comfort they gained because this was someone 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 249WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
with whom they felt they could work in their home. Through that initiative, we have had 54 alarms fitted, and 120 homes fitted with additional security.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para4"><a name="stpa_326">That initiative was focused on vulnerable older people, and older people who have experienced a burglary in the past. Regrettably, as I am sure the Minister is aware, it is common that once people are burgled they tend to be burgled again, because unless the culprits have been apprehended, they know perfectly well where the weak points are, and what they left behind. It is very important that target hardening is done, and that initiative has been a tremendous success, which I know has been greatly appreciated by those who have benefited from it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para5"><a name="stpa_327">There are also other matters, such as the use of section&nbsp;30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 in Melbourne, a pleasant small town in South Derbyshire. I should say straight away that South Derbyshire has, generally, a low crime rate, and is a very pleasant place to live; I live&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there, and I enjoy doing so, as do most of my constituents. However, there are problems from time to time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para6"><a name="stpa_328">Melbourne certainly had problems with youths, mainly from outside the town, congregating and causing nuisance. I recognise that there has been some controversy about the use of section 30, but the imposition of that section allowed the police to step in, talk to young people, check on what they were doing, and, in some cases, send them home. Some 100 notices were served in the first three to six months of the use of section 30, and there have been a small number of arrests under it. As a result, calls to the police for attendance in that town were reduced dramatically, and that made a considerable impact on police time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para7"><a name="stpa_329">There are a number of urban parks in the town of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swadlincote, and they are attractive legacies, mostly&nbsp;dating from the Victorian era or the turn of the 19th century. However, they were a neglected asset, and sometimes a focus for antisocial behaviour. The introduction of park patrols&#151;again, the partnership was involved&#151;has started to make them not only more attractive places, but places that people feel comfortable visiting. They recognise that they are walking around in a safe environment. It is reassuring to have a presence there, so that people think, &quot;There&#039;s someone in charge of this place.&quot; That also reassures regular users, such as the bowls community.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para8"><a name="stpa_330">Another past initiative was the successful intelligence-led project focusing on potential drug offenders in a particular part of Swadlincote. That had a significant impact on crime rates in the town for some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considerable time. In a small town such as Swadlincote, a rather small number of people tend to commit a very large proportion of offences, and that sweep, based on additional support for intelligence, was highly successful in reducing crime.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para9"><a name="stpa_331">I now come to a future initiative that is just about to&nbsp;start. I am proud to say that South Derbyshire is not the antisocial behaviour order capital of the UK. We do not use them except in pretty extreme circumstances. Nevertheless, I feel that there is more scope for the use of ASBOs. We are setting up a hotline, so that people troubled by antisocial behaviour can come forward and give information, and get the appropriate co-ordinated response. If they need to keep time sheets about 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 250WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
particular activities or report incidents to other agencies, the hotline will be their guidance point. That should produce a more coherent policy response to antisocial behaviour.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para10"><a name="stpa_332">As for measurable outcomes, in the past year crime in South Derbyshire has fallen by 10 per cent. Detection of crime has risen by 9 per cent., burglaries are down by 2&nbsp;per cent., auto crime is down by 7 per cent. and violent crime is down by 8 per cent. That is pretty much a clear message from the community, working through the partnership and the local police to address the problems that we face in South Derbyshire with a high degree of efficiency. We can always do better&#151;and I always urge all the agencies that I deal with on this issue to do better&#151;but progress has been marked.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para11"><a name="stpa_333">I am looking forward to future measurements of perceptions and fear of crime in the community. One of the problems in South Derbyshire was the fact that although crime rates were low, people&#039;s perception of them, partly fuelled by what they read in the newspaper or saw on television, meant that they were worried about the subject. One of the critical tests of the sort of work that has been done is whether that fear of crime will start to drop, as well as the crime rate itself.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para12"><a name="stpa_334">Let me try to draw some lessons. First, local partnerships in our area work. That is partly down to the local people, not just to an organisational structure. As I gently pointed out to the Minister at the start of my speech, this partnership can comfortably be held up as the best in Derbyshire; there are others that do not work as well. It is therefore perfectly fair to say that the success of that partnership stems from the way in which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local people solve problems together. South Derbyshire is a very pragmatic community, and if there is a problem, people talk about it and want to find a solution; they are not tremendously interested in posing and saying, &quot;I represent this group. Let me have my say before anyone gets on with the job.&quot; Local people want to find solutions, and all credit must go them for the way in which they have worked together to produce solutions. That suggests that such a partnership works well if we find the right people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para13"><a name="stpa_335">Secondly, there is now greater confidence that the initiatives that are being taken suit local priorities. Instead of the top-down processes of controlling crime and crime prevention, we have a process that picks up the concerns raised by local people themselves, which is helpful.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para14"><a name="stpa_336">Thirdly, we are building networks of information. If we start building confidence about how things work, people start talking more about which solutions they see as valuable. That is positive too, because it builds local resilience. Parts of South Derbyshire&#151;a former mining community&#151;have not tended to see the flowering of organisations that develop their own way of solving things. Robust locally led initiatives build that confidence, leading people to say, &quot;We can do other things, too.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para15"><a name="stpa_337">The last point is that we need to analyse what works. I have set out some of the things that I think work in&nbsp;South Derbyshire, but I have a suspicion, which is borne out a little by the inspection of the Derbyshire constabulary, that the analysis of what is working and what may not be working is not being done as rigorously as we would like. I am sure that that is a problem nationally, not just in that county.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para16"><a name="stpa_338">In the last few minutes, I want to touch on the future. I confess that I have concerns about the suggested reorganisation of policing in my area. First, it is being&nbsp;suggested that Derbyshire will be merged into one unit with Nottinghamshire or into a much larger east&nbsp;midlands force. I have no problem with increasing co-purchasing activity and sharing specialist services within policing, and Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire already work together on a helicopter unit. It is perfectly obvious that many other policing units should be shared across forces, because they would be much more efficient. In any reorganisation, however, I would want to make sure that local successes were not endangered by the top-down model of a larger force and an attitude of, &quot;We do things like this. Your way doesn&#039;t quite fit.&quot; Our way does fit in my community, and I do not want to lose that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para17"><a name="stpa_339">Secondly, I am concerned about the possible focus of the larger unit. It would be natural for a larger force to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, &quot;Where is crime greatest? Let&#039;s focus all our endeavours and our best resources on addressing the problems there.&quot; As I have already accepted, people in South Derbyshire can, I am glad to say, generally walk the streets without fear and get on with their lives without hassle from others. Although I understand the desire to focus on bigger things, I would not want to lose the focus on success in local areas such as mine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para18"><a name="stpa_340">I have some concerns about future funding. Representatives of the Derbyshire constabulary will be coming down to meet Derbyshire MPs shortly to discuss their expectations for the future budget, and the indications that I have seen are that they may well face a very tight year. I would want some reassurance that those early indications are false, and in particular, that basic command unit funding, which has been one of the successes in supporting initiatives in my community, will be retained and raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para19"><a name="stpa_341">Finally, police community support officers have just arrived in my area. Generally speaking, they have been a success. There are strong arguments for giving them greater powers. Some nuisances, such as traffic offences relating to parking and speeding, would be well addressed by PCSOs. That resource is not readily available in my community at the moment, because they do not have the powers to do that particular job, but I&nbsp;would like to see their powers extended.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para20"><a name="stpa_342">The partnership is a local success, which should not be endangered by changes driven from the centre, or top-down from above. Local people have the confidence to make it work, and I hope they can continue to do so.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51101h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham) </b> : I congratulate my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon.

I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for doing that and for rewarding those working in his constituency who make a success of such matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para21"><a name="stpa_343">In his characteristic way, my hon. Friend painted a positive picture of the work that local agencies have in hand to reduce crime and disorder. Partnerships, when 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 252WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
they are genuine and when people come to the table wanting to make things work, can achieve more together than individual agencies can. That is the essence of a true partnership. We have something to learn from what my hon. Friend described; crime and disorder reduction partnerships throughout the country could usefully listen to what he said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para22"><a name="stpa_344">My hon. Friend&#039;s constituency and mine share some characteristics, as both are former mining areas. I strongly agree with what my hon. Friend said about the collapse of traditional industries in those areas; they left a legacy of social problems that we are still grappling with today. The loss of the traditional fabric of those communities and their destruction left social problems in their wake that we are only now beginning to understand and to deal with. What my hon. Friend said has a resonance that goes much wider than South Derbyshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para23"><a name="stpa_345">The solution to these problems cannot be achieved by just one agency; everything is not all the fault of the police, or all the fault of the council. The answer for local people should be about making sure that the whole community accepts responsibility for dealing with such issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para24"><a name="stpa_346">I will say more later about my hon. Friend&#039;s constituency, because it is interesting, but first I want to say a few words about the overall picture. As he rightly said, crime is low and going down, but the perception of&nbsp;crime remains high. That has something to do with how newspapers and other media report crime. In fact, crime&nbsp;has being falling dramatically for the past decade. Since 1997, overall crime, as measured by the British crime survey, is down by 35 per cent., with significant reductions in crimes such as burglary and vehicle crime. According to the BCS, violent crime, which is subject to much media comment, fell by 34 per cent. in the same period. That is not to say that there have not been increases in police-recorded violent crime, which has attracted comment, and that has driven some of the reporting and public perceptions. But those increases have largely been due to changes in the way in which such incidents have been recorded, and to increased police activity, as a result of which more minor violent offences are being reported and recorded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para25"><a name="stpa_347">None the less, we recognise the disproportionate impact that crimes of violence can have on a victim&#039;s confidence and that of their community. We therefore introduced the Violent Crime Reduction Bill&#151;as foreshadowed in our manifesto, on which my hon. Friend and I stood for election&#151;to give the police and local communities the powers that they need to tackle guns, knives and, importantly, alcohol-related violence and violent crime. Those measure are as important in South Derbyshire as they are in Greater Manchester, and when the Bill comes into force it will further empower organisations such as the Safer South Derbyshire partnership to bear down on some of the problems described by my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para26"><a name="stpa_348">The figures therefore represent a significant achievement, which is often overlooked in the general desire to comb crime statistics for the most negative news. As a result of the reduction in the number of crimes, many fewer victims have had their lives ruined by destructive criminal behaviour. The risk of being a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 253WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
victim of crime is now down by a quarter since 1997. That means that 3.3 million fewer people fall victim to crime every year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para27"><a name="stpa_349">There is also, of course, the low-level crime and antisocial behaviour to which my hon. Friend alluded, which the figures do not always pick up&#151;but I believe that we are getting a grip on antisocial behaviour and low-level disorder and thuggery. Strong partnership working, and using legislation, has helped to make our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streets and communities safer. As my hon. Friend knows, the Home Office has been developing the respect agenda since the general election, and there will be further measures associated with that soon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para28"><a name="stpa_350">Overwhelmingly, people want to live with peace of mind, and to be free from nuisance and low-level thuggery. We need to carry on introducing the necessary measures so that people have that peace of mind. According to the British crime survey, people&#039;s fear of crime has lessened in the past few years, and we should be proud of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para29"><a name="stpa_351">We are not resting on our laurels, however. The Home Office&#039;s five-year strategic plan sets out an ambitious programme of reform to continue to reduce crime. Key elements of the programme include the prolific and other priority offenders strategy, which, as my hon. Friend rightly said, targets existing prolific offenders and the young people who are most at risk of joining them. His constituency will be not unlike mine in that there is often a hard core of troublemakers, around whom another fringe will gather. That is often the pattern of antisocial behaviour in a particular area, and as he said, we can have a real bearing on reducing crime by targeting those most prolific offenders.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para30"><a name="stpa_352">We have the ambitious target of reducing overall crime by 15 per cent., and this is the first time that a Government have set such a challenging target. We have also established the National Offender Management Service to oversee the end-to-end management of all offenders, which will help to reduce reoffending and rehabilitate offenders. We are taking action to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder, and the selling of alcohol to those under 18, and there are other measures in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to introduce sanctions against the possession of illegal firearms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para31"><a name="stpa_353">Having set out the general context within which the Home Office is developing policy in this context, I shall use the remaining time to talk about the local picture in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Derbyshire. All the measures that we are introducing in this place&#151;I believe that my hon. Friend would agree that we have introduced many in recent years&#151;will be meaningful only if there are strong partnerships at local level that aim to do something with those powers, and to use them in a targeted but proportionate way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para32"><a name="stpa_354">I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend said about South Derbyshire not being an ASBO capital. Indeed, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asked that very question when I prepared for the debate and examined the figures on ASBO use in South Derbyshire, which show that, given the overall crime picture in the area, ASBOs are being used carefully. The threat of the sanction of an ASBO is obviously being used proportionately and in a targeted way. That is interesting, compared with what happens in other parts of the country, and it is worth reflecting on.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 254WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para33"><a name="stpa_355">My hon. Friend mentioned several initiatives in which the Safer South Derbyshire partnership has been involved. I am convinced from what I have seen that it is making extremely good progress in tackling crime and disorder. Its strategy, which is available on the internet, shows a confidence and a willingness to engage with local communities, and an openness about priorities and how they will be tackled. It is commendable that people have ready access to that document.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para34"><a name="stpa_356">For the next three years, the partnership&#039;s priorities have been identified as including measures to address domestic burglary, vehicle crime, antisocial behaviour, domestic violence, drug and alcohol misuse and the fear of crime more generally. It has a strong structure and an ethos of partnership working that is the envy of many, and is a model for my hon. Friend&#039;s area. Key posts are occupied by motivated and experienced people, which is one of the key strengths of its work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para35"><a name="stpa_357">My hon. Friend mentioned a football league project. He knows that he was preaching to the converted there, because I have long believed that sport can be a key diversion away from crime. He and I would probably share the view that we do not use sport enough to take young people away from crime. The success of the partnership may begin to break that mould, and may help to introduce the use of diversionary sport more widely. I have witnessed the success of the midnight leagues project in parts of the north-east, which is partly funded through the Coalfield Regeneration Trust. That is a fantastic scheme, with which we can do more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para36"><a name="stpa_358">I was interested to read in my briefing for this debate that the Safer South Derbyshire partnership has a &quot;youth engagement through sport&quot; officer. I cannot believe that many other partnerships have such a post, and I think that it is a fantastic idea; I should like to meet that individual if my hon. Friend ever brings him or her to Parliament. There is a strong team of people, with clearly defined functions within the partnership. That must be part of its success.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para37"><a name="stpa_359">I was interested in what my hon. Friend said about the work with old people and the liberation day project. I&nbsp;am aware of similar projects in my area. It is important to bring young and old people together to communicate, to hear about each others&#039; lives and to get a better mutual understanding. There is a tendency in parts of the media&#151;perhaps politicians should bear some of the blame for this&#151;to demonise young people and characterise them in a particular way when there are many decent young people, just as there always were. By bringing the two groups together we can do more to facilitate inter-generational understanding, and thereby address the fear of crime. I was interested in what my hon. Friend had to say about that, and I would endorse it entirely. The safer homes project seems a fantastic scheme. Again, other partnerships could usefully look at that.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para38"><a name="stpa_360">My hon. Friend also asked me to reconsider the reorganisation of local policing. He wanted to be sure that local success was not endangered, and that is a key factor. Whatever structure emerges&#151;and I urge him, and his local communities, to express their views in the consultation on policing reorganisation&#151;local success must be maintained. He will know that the Government&#039;s commitment is to neighbourhood policing, and it is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 255WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
entirely consistent with that that local, strong, bottom-up policing can sit within a broader strategic police force. That is crucial, but I hear what he said on that point.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para39"><a name="stpa_361">My hon. Friend also spoke about the focus of a larger force, and about not losing touch with a more rural area, or a low crime area, when that focus is quite broad. That is true, and that factor needs to be borne in mind. We could make further progress in reducing crime in such areas, perhaps more than in the more challenging areas, and we should reflect further on that idea . He also asked for more powers for PCSOs. Those issues have been 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>1 Nov 2005 : Column 256WH</b>

raised, and as PCSOs become more established members of the policing family, the case will begin to be made. I heard what he had to say about that, too, and I will relay those comments to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101h05_para40"><a name="stpa_362">Finally, funding is an issue that preoccupies all police forces. I will be interested to hear what my hon. Friend has to say when the representatives of the Derbyshire force come here to brief our colleagues.
