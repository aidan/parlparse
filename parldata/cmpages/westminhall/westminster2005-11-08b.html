<a name="stpa_0">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Cawsey.]

</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51108h01_spnew0"><b> Sir George Young  (North-West Hampshire)</b>  (Con): I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome the opportunity to debate the Electoral Commission&#039;s report, &quot;The Funding of Political Parties&quot;, which was published last December. I commend the authors for a thorough and well researched report, which they submitted along with their recommendations to the Department for Constitutional Affairs. Nearly a year has passed without it being debated in the House and without any response from the Government. I therefore welcome the opportunity to take the matter forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) in the Chamber. He has written extensively and with insight on the subject. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendry) is here and I welcome the Minister. She has her plate full, with the Electoral Administration Bill being discussed in the House later today. I am also pleased to see the spokesman for the Liberal Democrat party here.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">At business questions on 16 December shortly after the report was published, I asked for a debate on the report. In response, the then Leader of the House said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;I am very sympathetic to the idea of a debate on that&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">He also showed a bit of ankle by saying,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;It might be possible, on an all-party basis, to move towards extending&#151;not introducing for the first time, but extending&#151;public funding for parties in designated areas&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">and said specifically:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;In that respect, it is interesting that the Electoral Commission has recommended tax relief on donations of up to &#163;200. We can consider the proposals in due course&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">Due course, by any reasonable interpretation has come and gone, but there has been no consideration.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">During the exchange, another hon. Member referred to &quot;maverick millionaires&quot;, and said that such matters were


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;not doing any good to the battered reputation of Parliament&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">The person who said that was the then Liberal Democrat spokesman, now Lord Tyler, speaking before Mr. Michael Brown&#151;a maverick, if ever there were one&#151;appeared on the scene with his cheque book. In response to Paul Tyler, the Leader of the House said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;We can move forward on a consensual basis on this and the Electoral Commission provides an interesting way of doing so.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16 December 2004; Vol. 428, c. 1822&#150;25.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">I followed up such matters on 14 July by asking the current Leader of the House for a debate. He played a straight bat and said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;These matters are important and the House should discuss them.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14 July 2005; Vol. 436, c. 968.]</p>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">He was supporting the end, but not providing the means.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">Hon. Members may wish to focus on many recommendations in the report, such as spending limits&#151;national and local&#151;political donations, policy development grants and the extension of freepost to local elections. I shall focus on the recommendations that would improve the viability of our political parties and put matters into context. It is common ground that all is not well with our parliamentary democracy. Turnout has fallen in general elections&#151;an important barometer of political engagement. If turnout continues to decline, it could undermine the legitimacy of our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament. Our main parties have declining membership. The Labour party is down from more than 400,000 in 1997 to about half that number now. In 1977, we had a membership of about 400,000 and it is now down to about 300,000, most of whom are opening their envelopes as I speak.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">Collectively, politicians are held in low esteem, somewhere near that of journalists and estate agents, although I note that local Members of Parliament, as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals, are more highly regarded. There is widespread cynicism and apathy about the political process with young people, in particular, disengaging. Abstention from elections is something that they boast about rather than apologise for, and there are signs that their disengagement is becoming permanent as they grow older.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">There is no off-the-shelf remedy that will restore the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health of our political system. We need a variety of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solutions. The Puttnam report, commissioned by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hansard Society, has some radical proposals for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improving the interface between the House of Commons and the world outside. We need to continue examining how we conduct our business within the House. We must make it more relevant and accessible to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whom we represent. We need to reform Prime&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister&#039;s questions. Parliament needs to be more representative of society as a whole. We need to do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more of the work that my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden has been doing at universities and with young people. Ministerial conduct needs to be beyond reproach. We must make intelligent use of technology to interact better with our electorate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">However, part of the solution is healthier, more broadly based, more representative and more active political parties. Political parties are much maligned, but they are essential to the democratic health of the country. They recruit, motivate and train the people who stand for public office; none of us would be in Westminster Hall this morning were it not for our parties. Parties provide policy platforms that give voters a choice of administration at every level, and then seek to deliver that programme in office. They provide a legitimate means of expression for the political, economic and social interests in our society. They are the channels for political and intellectual discourse and debate and for refining new ideas into practical policies. They promote interest and turnout in elections and engage with the electorate both locally and nationally.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">Our main parties have long histories and proud achievements. They have nurtured the great leaders of our country&#151;one of whom needed succour from two parties&#151;and then given them a platform from which to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conduct the affairs of state. However, parties need 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
infrastructure to ensure that they can discharge the demands of the political system. Our parties are hollowing out and dying on their feet. They are heavily in debt. Paragraph 3.34 of the Electoral Commission report says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;it is clear that most parties are having difficulties raising sufficient funds to meet their day-to-day costs let alone the burden of funding major election campaigns. Borrowing appears to be used to meet the shortfalls.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">The report goes on to say that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;It is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no exaggeration to say that if political parties were businesses some could be regarded as trading while insolvent.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">Parties have never been less popular. Fewer people identify with them, vote for them or join them. There are many reasons for that, but the way in which they are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;funded is partly responsible for that disengagement and disenchantment. All parties have been hit by bad coverage deriving from the current regime, which obliges parties to seek large donations from individuals and their companies. Enron, Mittal, PowderJect and Ecclestone have hit this Government; ours was hit by Asil Nadir and others. The Liberal Democrats were hit by Michael Brown. The consequent adverse publicity surrounding funding leads to a vicious spiral; there is then less incentive to join and support the parties that have become so tainted, and that leads in turn to more dependence on large donations. Some 58 per cent. of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donation income received by parties between 2001 and 2003 was obtained from donations in excess of &#163;100,000. Such rows hit not just the party concerned, but the political process. Because of the transparency of the donations on the one hand, and the complexity of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the decision-making process and political networks on the other, it is difficult to allay accusations that no one gives that sort of money for nothing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">Page 15 of the Electoral Commission report includes the proposition that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;Funding parties by voluntary donations is unfair because there is a risk that wealthy individuals, businesses and trade unions can buy&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">votes. That proposition was supported by 70 per cent. of those surveyed. More recently, trade unions have been asking what they get for their money. If a new super-union emerges it, together with Unison, would account for almost half the Labour party&#039;s income; that is an almost unprecedented concentration of power.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">Paragraph 1.6 of the Electoral Commission report summed up the problem as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Despite enhanced levels of public scrutiny of party finances since the introduction of PPERA, there is continuing public unease about the possible influence of large donations on the political process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">I believe that we need to encourage broad-based political parties with a wide membership if we are to reduce dependence on those donations. The measure that I support is not a pretext to put up one&#039;s feet; on the contrary, it is an incentive to get out there and recruit more members.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">There is a way forward; it was outlined by the Neill committee in 1998 and repeated in a modified form by the Electoral Commission in 2004. The Neill committee recommended tax relief, limited to the basic rate, on donations of up to &#163;500 to eligible registered political

<br>&nbsp;<br>
parties. The committee noted that in several countries, including the United States, Canada and Italy, personal donations to political parties qualified for income tax relief, and it suggested that a similar tax relief should be introduced in the UK to encourage an activity that the committee regarded as both


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;meritorious and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a contribution to the democratic process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">In the committee&#039;s view, the principal advantage to such a scheme was that it would encourage a different pattern of political donations, so that parties would not rely for their funding needs on a relatively small number of donors, each making large donations. The committee said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;We have found very widespread support for the view that it is more democratic, and therefore in the public interest, that political parties should be funded by a large number of small donations rather than by a small number of large donations.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51108h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Andrew Tyrie  (Chichester)</b>  (Con): In that case, does my right hon. Friend favour a ban on large donations?
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51108h01_spnew2"><b> Sir George Young </b> : I shall come to whether the introduction of tax relief should be accompanied by a cap on large donations. I think that there has to be a trade-off, and I shall touch on that in a moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">The quotation concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;A system of tax relief which increases the value to political parties of smaller donations is likely to encourage the parties to make greater efforts to obtain them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">In addition, the committee noted that one further advantage to this method of party funding over the direct payment of state funds was that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;the allocation of the relief is in the hands of individual taxpayers and requires a contribution from them.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">I believe that tax relief would give the right signal that engagement with a political party is a civic activity to be encouraged. A citizen should be proud to be a paid-up member of a political party, not regarded as someone from a Bateman cartoon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">I remember the married couple&#039;s allowance, and I do not think that anyone got married to claim that allowance. However, the existence of the allowance was a statement by Parliament that the institution of marriage deserved support and gave stability to society. Likewise, I believe that tax relief would have a symbolic importance; it would be a statement that joining a political party was a worthwhile civic activity. Such a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regime, as I have said, would be taxpayer-led, not Government-led. It would encourage a democratic response and begin to redress the danger of large institutions or individuals gaining disproportionate influence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">The Government voted this recommendation down when we debated Neill. Indeed, I think that it was the only Neill recommendation that they did not implement. These were their reasons:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;the Committee proposed that donations to political parties, below a certain level, should be eligible for income tax relief at the basic rate. The Government is not persuaded by this recommendation. Tax relief would amount to general state aid by another route. A tax-relief scheme would be expensive for the Inland Revenue and political parties to administer relative to the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</ul>



<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 5WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>likely level of take-up. Furthermore, the Government has to balance the loss of revenue (likely to be upwards of &#163;4 or &#163;5 million a year) against other spending priorities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">Of course we have to keep an eye on public expenditure, but any hon. Member worth his salt could&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find &#163;5 million out of the Government&#039;s budget in half a day. The Neill committee rightly rejected the Government&#039;s arguments. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;We are disappointed that you have decided against our proposals in relation to a tax relief system on the ground, amongst others, that it &#039;would be expensive for the Inland Revenue and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political parties to administer relative to the likely level of take-up&#039;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bearing in mind that tax relief is given to thousands of charities, we thought it unlikely that the administrative costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be prohibitive. In a recent Written Answer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bassam of Brighton&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has stated that the administrative costs of a tax relief scheme have not been estimated. We invite you to make such an estimate, and we strongly urge you to reconsider our proposals on tax relief on political donations in the light of your conclusions as to the administrative cost of their implementation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">To date, it appears that the Government have not responded to that request.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">I understand the Conservative party&#039;s aversion to increases in public expenditure and I would not force any party to accept the money if its scruples prevented it from so doing. However, I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden, who may be clutching a hostile brief, that we all voted for the Neill recommendations at the time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">However, I accept a related argument that, if we want more public support, we must put our house in order. There is excessive expenditure at election time&#151;what economists call &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;&#151;and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no objection to the national cap on expenditure coming down, not that we see much of that in my constituency of North-West Hampshire. There are campaigning styles that irritate and switch off the voter, and I would like to see a less media-intensive campaign that cost a lot and more locally based campaigns using volunteers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">Since Neill reported, the position has got worse. We had the slump in turnout in 2001. Indeed, the Neill Committee recognised that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;it was likely that some of our recommendations would inhibit the parties&#039; ability to raise funds and result in additional pressures on the finances of political parties which were already under strain.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">The committee was right to be so worried.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">The Electoral Commission took over the baton from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Neill committee and made a similar recommendation in the report that is the subject of this morning&#039;s debate. Its scheme is built on the gift aid scheme, under which, again, individual donors, not the Government, decide. The purpose is to reduce the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dependency on large donations and to broaden the membership base. After reviewing how such schemes and match-funding schemes had operated in other spheres, the commission recommended:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;A system of income tax relief on small donations to political parties should be introduced. The scheme should be limited to relatively small donations, up to a value of &#163;200 (or the first &#163;200 of larger donations) in any tax year, the value being up-rated in line with inflation. We recommend that tax relief should be given on membership subscriptions and cash donations, but not on benefits-in-kind or on payments which involve a potential benefit to the donor.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">The system should be open only to those registered parties that can demonstrate representation or a significant level of electoral activity at the Westminster, European, devolved or local level.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 6WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">The commission further recommended that donations from non-taxpayers should attract an additional sum to the party, equivalent to the level of tax relief.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">That concept of support for political parties is not new; we have policy development grants, Short money&#151;Margaret Thatcher was the first Prime Minister to be elected using state funding&#151;party political broadcasts, freepost and the free hire of public buildings. The Electoral Commission is advocating a logical and necessary extension of a system that is already in existence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">On the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, I also favour a cap on donations, so that the public can see that money cannot buy influence or leave politicians beholden to funders. I recognise that the Electoral Commission is not pressing for that at the moment, and my hon. Friend might develop his point if he catches your eye, Mr. Taylor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The public seem to want an end to large donations, with all the problems that they involve. However, people need educating about the fact that, if that source of income is cut off, and parties are to continue doing what is expected of them, the shortfall will somehow have to be made good. The proposals that I advocate will not replace such donations, and that is perhaps one reason why we should not ban them at once. If we want to phase them out, however, we need to begin to phase the alternative regime in.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">I understand that a Government who are perhaps not popular might not want to risk further unpopularity by going down that route. A survey commissioned by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electoral Commission showed initial hostility to the proposition of taxpayer subsidy. However 70 per cent. also said that funding parties by means of voluntary donations is unfair, because there is a risk that wealthy individuals, businesses and trade unions could buy influence over parties. Cragg Ross Dawson, which conducted research for the commission, found that the public, after deliberation, were broadly in favour of increased, or total, public funding of political parties, even if it would necessarily be funded through the tax system. The reasons given included less sleaze, the low cost to taxpayers and a fairer system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">The Labour party was the only party to comment on party funding in its manifesto for the general election. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;Having been the first government to take action to clean up the funding of political parties, we will continue to work with the independent Electoral Commission to explore how best to support the vital democratic role of political parties while recognizing that campaigning activity must always be funded by parties from their own resources.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">Just two months ago, in September, Lord Levy&#151;his appetite for raising funds apparently beginning to be exhausted&#151;announced that he would retire from his position as a Labour party fundraiser when the Prime Minister retired. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;I think it is important that an overall review takes place on the issue of party funding. In that framework the issue of state funding should be explored.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">He prompted a brief exchange of letters in <i>The Times</i> and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received support from Vernon Bogdanor, a constitutional expert, who supported limits to individual donations and match funding. I believe that that would be the right move and I am sure that the Prime Minister 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 7WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would welcome it, as indeed would the Minister, if it meant more evenings at home, instead of sitting in a ball gown in Grosvenor house next to some boring but rich potential donor discussing the taxation of offshore oil exploration. The beginning of a new Parliament is the right time to make such a move.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">I rest my case. Two independent bodies have given their verdict, one at the specific request of this Government. The other was a new body that was set up by them and is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charged with examining our electoral system. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government have so far rejected the common recommendation and they have made the problem worse by some of the other actions that they have taken. The right time to take the matter forward is at the beginning of a Parliament, with some political cover from some members of the Opposition. I look forward to a positive and encouraging reply from the Minister.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">I want to pick up on a number of points. My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) has done a superb job in setting out the field. I agree with almost everything that he said and I hope that the Labour Government are listening carefully.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">There is a huge gap between the public image of us and the reality. The reality is that the vast majority of MPs are uncorrupt and the vast majority of British politics is conducted in an uncorrupt fashion. It is probably more uncorrupt than any other major democracy. We have a huge number of people dedicated to public service in this institution. The tragedy is that this is completely swamped and swept aside by the image created as a consequence of a relatively small number of problems which derive from the way in which we run our constitutional and parliamentary affairs. One of them is donations to political parties, which is why we need to address it.

<a name="51108h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">In that regard, there is a stench of political corruption in the nostrils of the electorate. Frankly, it is not all a stench of their imagining: there has been the Ecclestone &#163;1 million; the PowderJect donation; Mr. Mittal&#039;s donation in exchange, it appears, for the letter that went to the Prime Minister of Romania about its steel industry; the Hinduja &#163;1 million donation to the dome, which was alleged to be in exchange for a passport application; and the blind trust, which we still have. How blind can a blind trust be when the key person running it is the doorkeeper to the Prime Minister and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his key assistant for the first half of Labour&#039;s term was the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson)? That does not build and sustain the electorate&#039;s confidence in party donations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">There have also been honours sales on a massive scale: Messrs Bragg, Gavron, Haskins and Sainsbury. The front page of <i>The Times</i> today leads on the story, lest the public are beginning to think that the stench in the nostrils is diminishing. The headline states: &quot;Sleaze

row as election donors get peerages&quot;. So, there have been some more honours sales. Of course, both sides are involved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">The unions have been at this for many years. They have demanded changes in employment policy. For example, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport Workers demanded such changes and said that if it did not get them, it would withdraw constituency support from a number of Labour MPs. The Liberals have had a scandal of their own.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">At this point, a number of hon. Members must feel that I have decided to ignore my party. I am completely devoid of an answer to the good piece of research by the Institute for Public Policy Research into the allocation of peerages prior to the 1997 election, which showed that 50 per cent. of knighthoods and peerages went to companies that made donations to the Conservative party, whereas only 6 per cent. of them went to other companies. I have not been able to think how that extraordinary imbalance could have come about other than its perhaps involving just a whiff of the stench of political corruption in our own nostrils as well.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">The truth is that there is a conspiracy of near silence&#151;a shuffling of the feet on the part of all parties, including the Liberal party and, in particular, the major parties. We need to bring it to an end, and the only way to do that is to ban large donations. It is such donations, whether from unions, rich individuals or companies, that create a bad impression. I would favour setting a cap as low as &#163;1,000, but I have been persuaded that it should perhaps be &#163;5,000.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">If we were to introduce such a low cap, parties would be short of cash&#151;but how short? One of the illusions that we have allowed to develop in the minds of the electorate is that parties are somehow self-funding and that state funding scarcely exists. My right hon. Friend mentioned some of the state funding that exists. If he had turned that into numbers, he would have found that there is a reasonable case for saying&#151;an orthodox view&#151;that, taking into account total state funding in cash or kind, including free access to television and radio for party political broadcasting, and other forms of support such as the free drop during general elections, roughly half of all party political activity in Britain is funded by the state in one way or another. Therefore, we are talking about the other half.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">How much of the other half consists of large donations? It is probably 50 or 60 per cent.&#151;between a quarter and a third of the total cost of party politics. Either we will have to plug that gap or parties will have to operate on rather less cash. British democracy would not collapse if parties had less funding with which to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fight elections. Indeed, another of the Electoral Commission&#039;s proposals to which my right hon. Friend alluded was the possibility of reducing the limits on party funding during elections.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">My right hon. Friend has supported strongly the proposal that there should be tax relief on political donations. I am sympathetic to that view, but I do not think that it is the best way forward. However, I would not allow the best to be the enemy of the good. A matching funding scheme is the most sensible way forward, for several reasons. One is that it is easy to adjust the amount that ends up in the hands of parties because it does not have to be a 50 per cent. match; it 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 9WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
could be a 60:40 or 30:70 match, which would ensure some continuity of funding to political parties. It is also very direct. I could turn up in my constituency and say, &quot;If each of you will raise x, I can get y back.&quot; That is clearer and more direct than saying that people should fill in a form to enable them to get tax relief, so that is the scheme that I favour.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">The Government&#039;s arguments against those proposals scarcely stand up. They say that it is state funding by another route, but we already have huge state funding in cash and in kind. They also claim that it would be too expensive, and my right hon. Friend correctly swept that argument aside with a wave of the hand, saying that they could find a few million very quickly. It is also worth bearing in mind that we already spend a huge amount&#151;far more than the &#163;5 million or &#163;8 million that might be required&#151;trying to bolster the public&#039;s confidence in the electoral system in other ways. For example, increased funding has gone to the Electoral Commission, which probably costs three times as much to run as it cost to administer the task in the Home Office, which ran the system prior to the creation of the Electoral Commission.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">The seismic change has to be the complete banning of large donations. If we do that, we have a good chance of restoring some of the electorate&#039;s faith in political parties and we will certainly make it much more difficult for people to claim&#151;I am afraid with some justification&#151;that honours can buy power and influence and have been bought by party donations. Such party donations are listed on the front page of <i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times </i>today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">I have raised the matter on numerous occasions, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get the standard replies from the Government that have obviously been prepared carefully in the Department. I have also raised it with Sam Younger. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought that he produced an excellent report, but unfortunately it funked this key issue. Only last week, in the Constitutional Affairs Committee, I said to him that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;you shied away from the key recommendation which might have addressed it, did you not?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">He replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is fair to say that we did&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">He then explained why, and I think that this is quite interesting. He said that the trouble is that on the one hand, the electorate said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;We do not like the idea of big money being able, as we see it, potentially to buy influence&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">and that, on the other hand, people said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;&#039;Is it right that public money should go to political parties&#039;, the answer is &#039;no&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">Of course, that is a problem for us. It is a problem for Sam Younger. But is that not what we politicians should be about: convincing the electorate that they already put money into political parties, that it is right that they should and that a modest increase&#151;which is all we are talking about&#151;in return for getting rid of large donations must be a sensible way forward. Is it not important that the Electoral Commission, rather than engaging in &quot;followship&quot;, should try a bit of leadership? Is it not the job of Sam Younger and the Electoral Commission to take a view? Would it not be helpful if, as a result of this debate, the Electoral Commission had a clear sense that it needs to come back to the issue and give us a stronger steer on that key recommendation?

<a name="51108h01_time2"><h5>10.2 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51108h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome)</b>  (LD): First, I congratulate the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) on initiating a particularly timely, as it turns out from today&#039;s headlines, debate on an important subject. I also congratulate him on the content of his speech and the way in which he set out the issue. He was ably followed by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), who added value to the debate and made it plain that the issue should be addressed. I am a little surprised that all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties are not represented in the Chamber this morning, because the matter quintessentially affects us all and we ought to hear a range of opinions on it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">I agree entirely with the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire. There is no excuse for the delay in responding to the Electoral Commission&#039;s proposals. It is an extraordinary lacuna in the Government&#039;s response, particularly in the context of the Bill we will be dealing with this afternoon, which, it might be thought, could have been an appropriate vehicle for some of the necessary reforms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">I also agree that it would be wonderful if we could reach consensus. It would make all our lives, including those of Ministers, easier if we had a common view. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear that that may be a counsel of perfection. It may be that self-interest will get in the way of the interests of the country in providing a proper and effective system that inspires the confidence of the electorate and, at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same time, ensures a vibrant democratic system. There is inevitably a bias in favour of maintaining the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;huge disparities in funding. If we went before the Competition Commission, the clear view would be that some parties hold monopolistic positions in this country. They do so because they can attract funding, and good luck to them, but that reduces genuine democratic competition in this country significantly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">Both hon. Members who spoke made significant points about large donations. I shall address those points, because the effects or potential effects of extremely large donations to any of the parties colours the public&#039;s perception. I say &quot;potential effects&quot; because there is no difference between real and perceived influence in that they both reduce the confidence of the electorate in political parties and the political system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">What are the potential effects of large donations to political parties? There is a perception that they might affect the personnel of parties&#151;people who might be elected in particular constituencies&#151;or, indeed, the party leadership. We need only look at the election of the Conservative party leader&#151;not this one, but the previous one&#151;in which people who donated large amounts made no bones about the fact that they would stop their donations unless the leader of the Conservative party was removed and a new person put in his place. When the new person was put in place&#151;who was equally ineffective in some ways&#151;the large donations resumed. That was a direct influence on the way in which a political party proceeded.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 11WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">Another effect of such donations is one that borders on corrupt practice. It is the perception that if someone gives a large donation to a Government party, or a party that aspires to Government, their business will profit because they will have direct access to contracts or a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more benevolent business environment in which to work. The concern was expressed in both the Mittal and Bernie Ecclestone cases that donations were somehow having an effect on Government policy. Whether that is true or not is almost immaterial to my argument.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">There is a fear that large donations can affect party policies disproportionately in relation to the mood within the party or the views of ordinary party members. If someone has a strong view on a particular policy area and is prepared to back it up with an awful lot of money, that view may prevail.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">There can also be a direct influence on the conduct of elections. We know that a limited number of seats are likely to change hands in an election under our system, so a wholly disproportionate effect can be gained by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application of significant amounts of funding in marginal seats. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said that he saw little evidence of that in his constituency. Well, I am not surprised, but I saw considerable evidence of it in my constituency because it is a perennial marginal seat. It might be described as a safe marginal seat, as I always extend my majority, but by nothing so vulgar as to put it into four figures. There is undoubtedly directed funding. I do not say that political parties should not target seats; we all do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but&#151;we shall explore this when we consider the Electoral Administration Bill&#151;there is a limit to what national parties should be able to put into local campaigns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">Donors can also have an influence by putting money directly into marginal seats to sustain a candidacy during a Parliament, or through third-party advertising or involvement. We saw that with the short-lived Referendum party, which tried to have a direct effect on a number of marginal seats represented not only by Members from my party but by Conservative Members. Those who did not pass the test&#151;those who did not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a true Europhobic attitude&#151;had material distributed in their constituencies, irrespective of whether that party&#151;the word should be in inverted commas&#151;had candidates standing in those constituencies. That, too, had a direct effect on the conduct of elections.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">Another matter touches on the activities of the Referendum party, but it is of far greater concern in connection with the more extreme parties. That is the effect that a large donation could have on a fringe party. A millionaire or multimillionaire could buy a small fringe party lock, stock and barrel, funding it out of all proportion to its membership or following for the direct electoral effect that it could have. Essentially, it would be a party of one&#151;one very rich man who could put&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward an extreme position in constituencies throughout the country. We should be worried about that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">Last is the link&#151;it is more than perception&#151;between patronage and the expectation of honours. One must assume that <i>The Times</i> has the correct information, but as the hon. Member for Chichester pointed out, today&#039;s

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 12WH</b>

edition tell us of the new working peers who are to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created. We read that Sir David Garrard and Sir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulam Noon each made donations of more than &#163;200,000 to the Labour party. Sir David obviously spreads his bets a little; he once donated &#163;70,000 to the Conservative party. He clearly needed to support political parties of one sort of another&#151;no doubt with no expectation of preferment. The new Conservative peer, Mr. Robert Edmiston, gave the party &#163;250,000 last year and happens to find himself on this year&#039;s honours list. I note that Mr. Jonathan Marland, whom I defeated in the 2001 election, is to be ennobled; he was generous with his donations in my constituency when he was a candidate, and he has no doubt made significant contributions to the country&#039;s good since leaving Somerton and Frome and finding new roles elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">I do not single out individuals because, as the hon. Member for Chichester said, a series of honours lists have been filled with people who happen to have been generous benefactors to the various political parties. As has been pointed out, we are going back to the days of Lloyd George. Although Lloyd George did many good things, the way in which he dealt with the peerage lists was not one of the most salubrious aspects of his political career. It was wrong.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">I am almost tempted to say that I would rather have a peer who was preferred by patronage in the 18th century than one who was preferred last week, because the former would be in a more disinterested position. I do not take that view, however, because I want to see an elected upper House. Indeed, I look forward to the day when we have an elected House, as we will not have any of this patronage nonsense. Some people in high positions want to see the whole of the second Chamber put in place by a rotten system in which one pays a lot of money to a political party and ends up making the law, but that is not defensible in any circumstances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">What is the answer? I agree with those who say that there should be a cap on large donations. That is appropriate, and I make no bones about it. However, doing so could cause a funding gap that prevented the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political parties from doing their work effectively. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak for a party that has never been able to raise large donations in any number, despite recent headlines to the contrary. We have always relied on small donations from our members and from fundraising activities. All the political parties could live on less if they tried. We do not do too badly, despite the fact that we have a disproportionately smaller amount to spend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">There is a very good argument, which we have already heard, for the state to recognise the role of the political parties in the political system. As has already been said, the principle of public funding is not new; it emerged years ago. We have Short money, policy development money, freepost, party political broadcasts and public buildings, so it is nonsense for Conservative Front Benchers to continue to believe firmly&#151;I hope that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be proved wrong&#151;that public funding is somehow anathema. They benefit from it enormously. The Conservative Front Bench is paid for out of public funds. I do not argue that it should not be, because the Opposition are part of making our political system work, but it is utter humbug to say that public funding cannot be extended to ensure that the greater political will is done.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 13WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">I do not believe that large donations from public funds is the answer, either. That would be the wrong way to do it. The public would be rightly suspicious if someone simply put their hand in the Treasury, pulled out a large sum of money and said, &quot;Here you are. Here&#039;s some money to spend on your political campaigning.&quot; I do believe, however, that linking funding to money raised from members of local parties or through local fundraising is very appropriate, because it directly links the amount that is being dispensed with the activity levels of the local parties. It has been suggested that there are two ways of doing that, one of which is tax relief. I do not buy for a moment the Treasury line that that is too difficult; as the right hon. Gentleman says, how many charities do we have in this country, and how many political parties? It is nonsense to suggest that that cannot be managed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">I believe that match funding is a better way of raising funds, simply because it is simpler, more transparent and more obvious. We have made the modest suggestion that one way of providing the funding for that, without huge damage to the programme of the Government or future Governments, might be a 10 per cent. cut in the Government&#039;s &#163;200 million advertising budget. That would pay for match funding; that would deal with it. Problem solved. Would the public recoil at the prospect of 10 per cent. less Government advertising? I suspect that they would not. Would they benefit from the political parties being free of the confines of large donors and perceptions of sleaze? Yes, they would. I believe that that is a sensible way forward, and I hope that the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) can match the eloquence of his colleagues and their desire to make a real difference. I hope that the Minister will respond positively, or at least respond, to what the Electoral Commission has said.

<a name="51108h01_time3"><h5>10.18 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51108h01_spnew5"><b> Charles Hendry  (Wealden)</b>  (Con): I, too, congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) on securing this debate on a subject that is long overdue for discussion. It is, in some ways, sad that it is being held in this Chamber rather than in the main Chamber of the House of Commons, but at least we have the chance to discuss the matter today. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) for his challenge. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be hard put to match the eloquence of my right hon. Friend, but I shall try to deal with some of the issues that he mentioned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">My starting point is that I do not believe there to be a public appetite for a massive extension of the state funding of political parties. People would be extremely angry if we told them we know that they could face tax rises or cuts in public expenditure because of the state of the economy, and that it will be a difficult year for the health service and an extremely difficult year for our local authorities, particularly in the south-east, but that, by the way, we plan to change the rules so that we in the political parties have to do less work and will be funded by the taxpayer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">An important distinction should be drawn between supporting parliamentary work and duties, such as that which Short money enables, and a broader support for parties&#039; political campaigning. The electorate would 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 14WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have greater difficulty accepting that, especially when they dislike much of the modern style of political campaigning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">I take on board what my right hon. Friend said about the disengagement of the electorate, but part of that is down to the style of campaigning, which leaves them cold. We need to inspire them, and to appeal to their hopes and aspirations rather than frighten them. There is an advertising belief that elections are won by being negative. I believe that we win elections by showing that we have policies to which people can relate and which they feel represent a better way of doing things. If that advertising theory came through in campaigning, people would feel that they were paying more money in taxes to subsidise such activity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">In this country, voting is voluntary, whereas in some other countries it is compulsory, but we have chosen not to adopt that approach. Why should every taxpayer, including those who have chosen not to vote, be obliged to contribute towards the campaigning activities of political parties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">My right hon. Friend spoke about the decline in election turnouts. Only 13 years ago there was an historically high turnout, so there has not been an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inexorable decline over decades: it comes and goes. A decline in turnout is more likely when people ask themselves whether the election really matters and whether their vote will make a difference. It depends on whether they care or whether they have contempt for the entire political system. They feel disillusioned for many reasons, but no one has ever said to me that they feel disillusioned because of how political parties are funded. As my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, it is part of a wider element, but not one of the key issues that affect voting. The problem will certainly not be resolved if we say to people who are already disillusioned that they will have to pay a little more in tax to fund a system that they dislike.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">In 1992, when we had that historically high turnout, we had the same funding system as we have now. There was a little difference in the amount of Short money available, but the parties were funded through voluntary principles. Some of the extremely rich made significant contributions. That did not prevent people from voting in the election.
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51108h01_spnew6"><b> Sir George Young </b> : Has not there been a significant change since then with the introduction of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which has made it much more difficult for all political parties to raise money from companies?
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51108h01_spnew7"><b> Charles Hendry </b> : Yes, that has made a difference. It is part of the answer to the question to which my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester could not find an answer. Pre-1997, many public companies gave money to the Conservative party, because there were not the same rules on declarations and openness, and they were profoundly concerned about the implications of the election of a Labour Government. It was not surprising that many of those business leaders ended up in the House of Lords, because in those days more companies provided support to the Conservative party. My right hon. Friend is undoubtedly right that there has been a significant change because of that. However, the biggest change has been the perception that donors now get much more in return for a small amount of money.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 15WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">My right hon. Friend also spoke about the declining membership of parties. A significant element of that has nothing to do with the funding of parties, but with the move towards computerisation in our associations. In my association, membership is highest in branches that have a determined troop of people who go round knocking on doors every year. When someone new moves into the area, the first person who turns up is the chairman of the local Conservative branch, who finds out what they are interested in and whether they want to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;join the party. We have the most vibrant branches in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those areas. Computerisation has significantly contributed to that. There is also a general lack of willingness of younger people to join organisations, be they political parties or charities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">If we go down the route of state funding, we will end up with people paying taxes to support the views of parties that they dislike or even abhor. It is difficult to draw a distinction to prevent the British National party from receiving some state funding. We cannot have a system that makes available state funding but only to those parties whose views we happen to like and believe are acceptable. Under the proposed system, if people wanted to vote for it the BNP it would have to be eligible for funding and it is reprehensible and unacceptable that taxes would be used to fund such racist activity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">State funding would undermine rather than underpin our representative democracy. It is unhealthy for parties to be dependent on the state as it limits their freedom for manoeuvre and their ability to talk about what they really think. To consider it from a different dimension, there is a suggestion that there should be funding from the European Commission to parties that are genuinely pan-European. What is worrying is the expectation that it would also require parties eligible for funding to have commitments to various European ideals: essentially, parties can have access to state funding only if they fit into the pot of what we think a political party should be doing. That fundamentally undermines the principles of representative democracy.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51108h01_spnew11"><b> Charles Hendry </b> : We must either have a system of state funding for all political parties or a system that limits state funding. That route leads down the slippery slope; we cannot pick and choose between parties simply because we do not like them. There must be some consistency, which is lacking.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">The voluntary principle is fundamental to how our political parties work and we should encourage it; state funding would undermine it. A typical situation is that each party would receive &#163;2 million in state funding&#151;about 10 per cent. of their election spending. That would undermine their ability to say what they truly believed because to some extent they would be dependent on the state and therefore could not speak as freely as they might wish to.

</p>






<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51108h01_spnew13"><b> Charles Hendry </b> : It comes again to the distinction between support for parliamentary duties to ensure that we can hold the Government to account and operate our organisations within Parliament, and support for campaigning. The public would draw a distinction between them. They want the Government held to account and they want this place to operate efficiently, but there is not a great demand out there for paying extra money in taxes so that we can campaign against each other in elections. Once we started down that slippery slope we would move into a vicious circle whereby people in our constituencies would do a little bit less because more came from the taxpayer. Then they would say, &quot;Come on, give us just a little bit more, because that will enable us to do what we need to do,&quot; which would undermine the principle of voluntary activity in the party.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">The present system under which the parties have to raise their own funds makes them think very carefully how they spend it. They know that if they have only a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limited income and they choose to spend it on advertising on billboards rather than on direct mail, there is less money to spend on other things. It means, therefore, that they must be careful in their choices about how to spend it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">The point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about the targeting of marginal seats is, to some extent, a red herring in this debate. Clearly, parties target their efforts on marginal seats and will continue to do so whether there is state funding or voluntary funding. That is where the election is won. I share the hon. Gentleman&#039;s aversion to four-figure majorities and believe that a five-figure majority is much more encouraging. However, as to the way in which election campaigns will always be run, we must recognise that more effort will go into more marginal constituencies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">As my right hon. Friend said, there is already considerable subsidy for political activity, including, for example, free election postage and the use of air time on

television. We must be extremely careful before we extend that too broadly into a more general approach to political campaigning subsidies. I have great sympathy for the idea of tax relief on political donations. There are grounds for consistency. If people who give money to a charity can be given tax relief on that, I do not see why a distinction should be drawn so that, uniquely among voluntary organisations, political parties are excluded. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be grateful for the Minister&#039;s response about tax relief, which should be part of the way forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">My right hon. Friend touched briefly in his opening remarks on policy development grants. The manner in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which that funding is allocated is flawed. It is not right that the money should be given equally to the parties. For example, the Government have tremendous additional resources for policy development. A key part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Government machine is organised towards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development. To give them the same contribution through the policy development grant is wrong. The allocation should also relate to the level of support for the parties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">There has been some discussion already about whether a cap should be imposed on donations. In a free society people should be able to spend their money as they wish, especially with clear rules on declarations. The argument is a sideshow in the debate.

What is most important is to get rid of the blurred lines from the trails of paperwork, so that the connections between giving funding and receiving Government contracts can be seen, and to deal with issues such as the increasing politicisation of the civil service. Along with that must go a fundamental reform of the House of Lords. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, until there is a majority elected House of Lords, we will not get the transparency that we need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester raised the suggestion that anything over &#163;1,000 should be capped. Even if we were to take the capping route, that would be ludicrously low. In a typical non-election year the major parties will raise &#163;10 million each, and &#163;1,000 is one ten-thousandth of their spending; it is what they spend in less than an hour each day. During the debate the main parties have spent more than &#163;1,000 on general running costs, never mind what they spend on their campaigning in an election. A cap at such a level suggests that someone would gain favours for contributing a small amount that would pay for a political party&#039;s running costs for an hour. That is ludicrous.

<p>
<a name="51108h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">I just wanted to clarify one point. I heard virtually non-stop argument against all forms of extension of state funding. Indeed, so strongly held were the views expressed that sometimes I thought that my party&#039;s Front Bench would voluntarily hand back Short money and the policy funding. Then, a moment later, I heard what I thought was support for the proposal to extend

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 18WH</b>

state funding sharply, by offering tax relief to individuals who donate to political parties. Is that my party&#039;s policy?

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51108h01_spnew17"><b> Charles Hendry </b> : It is indeed. It was the policy that my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) advocated when she was party chairman and involved with the Electoral Commission. It was said that we should aim at having tax relief up to a donation limit of about &#163;500.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">The difference is that a blanket subsidy does not go to a particular political party. That is wrong. It follows the principle that if, people contribute towards a charity they are entitled to tax relief, so why should a political party as a voluntary organisation uniquely be excluded from that process?
</p>






<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51108h01_spnew18"><b> Dr. Whitehead </b> : Is not a short step towards the process of ticking off a small level of support for a political party the use of a tax return? If a person is not well off enough to make a large donation to a party, a small sum, which is under the control of the person making the tax return, can go to the political party of his or her choice. Is that principle in any way different from what the hon. Gentleman suggested when he referred to tax relief in respect of perhaps different donations?
</p>






<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51108h01_spnew19"><b> Charles Hendry </b> : Tax relief is a more consistent approach because it is available to anyone when giving money to charity. The organisation can claim tax back on the contribution. That is the most consistent way forward. It ties in directly with the contribution of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual rather than supporting a blanket contribution from the Exchequer to the individual actions of political parties, which would cause a more fundamental problem for the reasons that I have outlined.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome spoke about problems in respect of caps on contributions when one person funds a political party. We must be careful about such matters. He may have had in mind James Goldsmith and the funding of the Referendum party, which was very much a one-man party. My worry about such an approach is that the party ended up getting well over 1 million votes. It was clearly in touch with what people felt, and which they did not consider was represented by other parties. I absolutely oppose what he stood for, but to say that an individual who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passionately believes in something should not be allowed to support or set up a political party to carry forward views that were not advocated by the mainstream parties is a fundamental denial of people&#039;s democratic rights.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">Even if we disagreed with what James Goldsmith stood for, the fact that more than 1 million people voted for him showed that he was touching an important vein of opinion in society. However, had his party been reliant on state funding or had there been caps on donations, that could not have happened. Such matters represent important issues in our democracy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">All of us in our constituency lives come across a range of voluntary organisations that are struggling for funding.

form filling. People who work in the voluntary organisations will say, &quot;Will you explain why you consider that it is more important to support political funding through a block grant than it is to support us in our work for the homeless and the elderly in other sections of society?&quot; There will be tremendous anger over block grants. Tax relief is a different approach. It recognises the contributions that people have made and it is tied in to individual decisions rather than block grants.

We all have a responsibility to make the case for politics and political parties. However, the right hon. Gentleman rightly said that parties need infrastructure. There we make the choice. Those who believe in democracy believe in political parties as an essential part of that democracy. Political parties need an infrastructure. Do we let political parties wither away or do we let them increasingly depend on donations from big companies and rich men? Or do we do something more? That is the choice we face.

</p>

However, we do see public aversion to the idea that the principle of democracy, which is fundamentally about equality&#151;that each individual has the same say and the same right&#151;should be interfered with by rich individuals or rich companies buying into the process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para106"><a name="stpa_107">Perhaps I should declare an interest. I represent a constituency that includes Peckham. We do not have any millionaires in Peckham, and we probably do not have any people who would donate &#163;5,000. The hon.

However, one should look at the matter from the point of view of my individual constituents and their estimation of what impact and influence they have on the constituency. I have sat round in Labour party meetings as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) will have done in his neighbouring constituency in south London&#151;incidentally, I pay tribute to the huge amount of work that he has done over many years on this subject. During those meetings, there may be a raffle of a few tins of food&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the party, and people give very small sums of money. That is what it used to be like 20 years ago when I was first elected as a Member of Parliament. Local party members will be deterred from making such contributions and will not feel that they have a role in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contributing to the party if they are completely &quot;overfaced&quot;. If they think that donations are entirely the remit of millionaires, they will feel that they themselves do not matter. We should step back and think about those matters and their possible effects.

<a name="51108h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">The hon.

There is also the difficulty of proving a negative.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">Before the hon.

At&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Labour party conference earlier this year, the treasurer moved the motion that the cost of individual membership of the Labour party should be increased from &#163;18 to &#163;36 because, unless the members pay up, the party will inevitably become reliant on rich men.

classes was democracy and participation in voting. The last three elections have seen a change in that: it is no longer the case that people&#039;s propensity to turn out is irrespective of their social class. There is a growing gap between the registration and turnout of better-off people in society and those of poorer people. We have an inequality problem in our democracy, and we must consider how political activity is funded, what people in the country make of how parties go about their business and how they are funded. We must look at it in the context not only of the debate about democracy, depending as it does on political parties, but the debate about inequality.

How we go about our business in the House, making Parliament much more representative, is something that we ought to consider in order to contribute towards public confidence. It is also important that people from individual political parties do not have to rely just on the media. If we cannot afford to communicate directly with our constituents, we must rely on the media. The question is: is there a worse alternative to the current situation? It is important for parties to have sufficient funds to be able to communicate directly with the electorate from which they are seeking votes, instead of having to go through the media. It is also true that turnout is dependent on contact. Apparently the clear evidence is that the more people are contacted individually by parties in a constituency&#151;this is surprising and counter-intuitive, as one would think that people would want to reward us for staying away from their doors&#151;the more likely they are to turn out.

Friend the Member for Battersea which showed that there are some things about party politics that people do not like the idea of paying for and other things that they do not mind so much. We can all agree that people would not like money that they pay in taxes going on negative campaign billboards. Evidence drawn up by my hon. Friend shows that people do not mind supporting research, policy making, and youth activities, and hon. Members have drawn attention to the big problem of non-participation of young people in our democracy. Legitimacy walks away from democracy if people walk away from it. People support youth activities, quite rightly, and councillor training, equipment for offices, and the work of parties in Parliament, including Short money. There is possibly less of a difference between the hon. Member for Wealden and his colleagues than might have first appeared during his comments. The Electoral Commission is doing further work on the matter. We should all agree that there is a problem. In the past, the matter has been placed in the &quot;too difficult&quot; box.

If we get those signals, we must not bury our heads in the sand; we must approach the issue intelligently.

<p><a name="st_29"><a name="51108h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Dismore  (Hendon)</b>  (Lab): May I first declare an interest as the Labour vice-chairman of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends of Cyprus group? I visited Cyprus from 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 October. My accommodation and driver for official meetings were provided by the House of Representatives and by the municipality of Morphou. The Conservative vice-chairman of the Friends of Cyprus, the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale), would like to be here, but he is attending the memorial service for Sir Edward Heath. I have been asked to convey his apologies to you, Mr. Taylor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para0"><a name="stpa_116">The visit was an opportunity to meet political leaders, business people, academics, and people from civil society from both sides of the green line. There has always been a tendency in Cyprus to look back. I do not want to dwell on the failures of the Annan plan today; we debated those on 6 July last year&#151;the last time that we had a full debate on Cyprus. I would rather focus on where we are now, the way forward and what we and the European Union can perhaps do to help.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para1"><a name="stpa_117">We have to start by considering the atmosphere. I felt that there was an air of depression and fatalism about the lack of prospects on the island. There is a lack of trust between the communities, and it is worse than I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have experienced for many years. The Turkish Cypriots feel rejected and abandoned by the Greek Cypriots in the aftermath of the no vote. The Greek Cypriots think that the Turkish Cypriots are trying to get the best of both worlds&#151;the benefits of European Union membership and services in the Republic&#151;without making progress towards a settlement, and that they are perhaps looking towards separation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para2"><a name="stpa_118">There is a real feeling of despair among pro-settlement people on the island. People still cross the green line and maintain contact, but young people do so rather less frequently than before, and fewer people are visiting their homes in the north from the south. There is a degree of clutching at straws; some lawyers on both sides are now talking about making the cost of non-settlement prohibitive; to illustrate that point, I have heard talk of a thousand Loizidou cases. We hear people such as Mustafa Akinci of the BDH party in the north talking about reasserting the Turkish Cypriot rights of the 1960 constitution, because they see no other way forward. Turkish Cypriots are moving to the south to work and, increasingly, to live. Shener Levent, editor of <i>Afrika </i>newspaper, is even talking about standing for the 2006 elections in the Republic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para3"><a name="stpa_119">I have to say that there is some hostility towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Kingdom; we are roundly blamed for the failures of the Annan plan. Whenever the issue of the sovereign base areas comes up, it is a sign of rising discontent with the United Kingdom. We are not seen as even-handed; we are seen as very pro-Turkish, and as not having accepted the outcome of the democratic referendum of the Greek Cypriots. That can be compared with the situation as regards the United

Nations. Sir Kieran Prendergast recently visited Cyprus, and in his report to the Security Council, he made it clear that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;the highest priority concerns which led Greek Cypriots to vote the way they did would most certainly have to be addressed in any future process based on the UN plan&#151;and the Greek Cypriot electorate must have confidence that this would be borne in mind in a renewed process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para4"><a name="stpa_120">The recent visit of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, and the signing of the memorandum of understanding, which asks for a structured dialogue, is an important development. We must build on that and recognise the importance of our joint history of many years. We need to look forward to possibilities for the future outside the diplomatic dance, which is continuing and which has identified a substantial gap between the two communities. As the UN says, we cannot afford another failure after the Annan plan.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para5"><a name="stpa_121">The outside international community can help, but in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the end a settlement has to come from within the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;island, with the consent of both communities. The consequences of the lack of progress are pretty clear. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mention just one&#151;the problem of crime across the green line. There are growing problems of smuggling, people-trafficking, drugs and illegal migration. Perhaps the best example of those problems was the murder in January this year, in the south, of a Turkish Cypriot, Mr. Elmas Guzelyurtlu, and his daughter and wife. The suspects fled north. The Greek Cypriot police have the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence, but are not prepared to hand it over to the Turkish Cypriot authorities because they are not recognised. That sort of problem has to be addressed, otherwise the murderers run free.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para6"><a name="stpa_122">Of course, there are some positive signs. I particularly welcome the start of Turkey&#039;s accession negotiations. We should very much support the process in which Turkey is involved, although it will be a very long one. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was pleased that both Greece and Cyprus supported the start of the process. However, that brings obligations for Turkey. Although we have a possibility of a fresh start after 3 October, it is important that momentum is maintained, and that Turkey is kept engaged. That was not helped by some of the statements about Cyprus that emanated from Turkey at the time of the decision to commence negotiations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para7"><a name="stpa_123">The EU will evaluate progress at the end of 2006. Without progress on Cyprus, there is the risk of an annual crisis if Turkey does not make progress towards a settlement, as there is the possibility of a veto at the opening and closing of every chapter. If Cyprus is not to be a running obstacle, progress must be made; otherwise that veto will be exercised sooner or later by one country or another.
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51108h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Burrowes  (Enfield, Southgate)</b>  (Con): Is there concern about the lack of progress in relation to the pre-negotiations to accession? Now that we have moved on to the accession negotiations stage, the matter could just go into the long grass for many years, and may not reach a speedy conclusion. We all want a sustainable settlement for the benefit of the Cypriot people.
</p>






<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51108h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : I have my own theory about that, which I shall come to in my crescendo at the end. The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point. There are two schools of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 26WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
thought. One is that the EU, Cyprus and the UK presidency should have driven a harder bargain with Turkey. The other is that it is important to get Turkey to sign on the dotted line to maintain the pressure. I, as well as the republic&#039;s Government, subscribe to the latter view; ultimately, that is the best way for Turkey to proceed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para8"><a name="stpa_124">May I also say something rather more positive? We now see more crossing points&#151;for example at the Astromeritis-Morphou road&#151;and it was interesting to attend the Morphou rally, where a symbolic barrier had to be put across the road for us to protest at, as the road is now open. A further crossing point is now to open in Nicosia, which will be of great advantage to both communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para9"><a name="stpa_125">There is a lot of positive movement on the issue of missing persons, with signs of real co-operation between the two communities. I was pleased that Mr. Talat told me that the difficulties that remain would not be politicised or publicised so far as he was concerned. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also pleased that a UK organisation based in Bournemouth, the Inforce foundation, is doing a lot of good work in that respect. There is a risk, which was highlighted by Emine Erk, a lawyer from the Turkish Cypriot human rights foundation, that there will be a determination to punish the perpetrators. A time may come for that, and there may be a time for peace and reconciliation. However, the risk of that sort of talk in relation to, for example, the Tochni murders is that information will dry up. That is not helpful. Money is needed&#151;two million Cyprus pounds&#151;to complete the work, and I hope that we can help with that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para10"><a name="stpa_126">There are also positive signs from the UN&#039;s recognition of the Greek Cypriot concerns to which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;referred. The republic is facilitating the position of Turkish Cypriots in relation to the European Union, with 40,000 Turkish Cypriots now holding Republic passports, 60,000 holding identity cards and 100,000 having their birth certificates. All Interior Ministry papers are now translated into Turkish to facilitate that process, and Turkish Cypriots have access to the range of services provided by the republic. The health service, in particular, is of great importance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para11"><a name="stpa_127">On the positive side for Turkish Cypriots, there is quiet acknowledgment that recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is off the agenda. There is now talk of an end to isolation, but I would question whether Turkish Cypriots are ready for the globalisation that would follow from that&#151;there is a degree of naivety there. There is acknowledgement in the north that direct trade is not going to make a difference; it is not going anywhere, as it would probably be worth only about &#8364;10 million to the economy. I was pleased to hear that there are plans for a census in the north next year. The economy in the north grew by 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. last year, and Turkish Cypriot incomes have doubled over two years. The United Kingdom is supporting public sector infrastructure reform and America is supporting financial infrastructure reform in the Turkish Cypriot community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para12"><a name="stpa_128">We should recognise that Mr. Talat, who is now President of the so-called TRNC, is not Denktash the second. He does support a settlement, but is clearly going to drive a hard bargain. However, his language is not well chosen. His threat of civil war if Turkish accession were blocked by the republic was certainly not 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 27WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
helpful, and nor were his insults of a personal nature. On 12 October, he said that the Greek Cypriots were &quot;racist, chauvinistic and ultra-nationalistic.&quot; That is not the way towards a settlement. Another part of the problem arises from the fact that his party, CTP, is in power. That has relieved the pressure on Turkey in the north, where opposition was organised by CTP and its associates. That pressure has now been diverted towards the Greek Cypriots, and the European Union has become the bogeyman. Clearly, they are not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organise demonstrations against themselves. I am concerned that the pro-solution parties in the north are divided and not able, as they were before, to unite around a single message. The strains between the CTP and AKEL, the south&#039;s largest party, are not constructive.
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="51108h02_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Theresa Villiers  (Chipping Barnet)</b>  (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a very serious problem in northern Cyprus at the moment is the boom in building, much of which must be on land from which Greek Cypriot owners were driven in 1974? That building will make finding a solution much harder.
</p>






<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51108h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : The hon. Lady presages my next remarks. That is an appalling downside of the Annan failure, which has fuelled the building boom on Greek Cypriot land and is the basis of the growth in the Turkish Cypriot economy. Turkish Cypriots recognise that if there is a settlement as far as property is concerned, it will probably be along the lines of the Annan plan. They have therefore worked out that if they build on the land, they will get to keep it, even though they may have to pay compensation to the Greek Cypriot owners. Had the land not been developed, it would have had to have been restored to the Greek Cypriot owners. That will make it harder to reach a settlement. Property rights will become a much bigger issue in any future negotiations unless a firm stand is taken on the building boom on Greek Cypriot land.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para13"><a name="stpa_129">One can draw a comparison with the middle east. Building on the west bank has created facts on the ground that have made it harder to reach a settlement there. Although the international community has gone out of its way to condemn Israel, there has been a blinding absence of any condemnation of that very similar building boom in northern Cyprus, which is, in fact, even worse. At least in the middle east, the homes are for Israeli people to live in. In northern Cyprus, the homes are for holiday makers&#151;generally overseas people, mainly from the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para14"><a name="stpa_130">I should like to report what Mr. Anastasiades, the leader of one of the Greek Cypriot parties, DISY, told me. The night before I met him, he had visited Kyrenia for dinner with Mr. Talat. He was virtually in tears as he described the building boom that he had seen and said that in five years&#039; time there would be no land left.

</p>


<p>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 28WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para16"><a name="stpa_132">My hon. Friend has mentioned the building boom. Does he have a view about the purchase by UK citizens of properties in the north of Cyprus? In particular, what is his view of the advice given by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website to those contemplating such purchases?
</p>






<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51108h02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : My hon. Friend makes an important point. There is the Orams case, which is a serious issue; I met the lawyer involved in that. One of my concerns is that people may well be risking their properties in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UK if they buy property in northern Cyprus that, frankly, does not belong to the person selling it. I am pleased that the Foreign Office has significantly improved the advice on its website, but there is always room for stronger warnings about the risks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para17"><a name="stpa_133">I was talking about the role of the Turkish army. There have been dangerous incursions, most recently in Lourougina, where the UNFICYP commander was threatened at gunpoint as the Turkish army tried to build a new checkpoint. That led to reciprocal protests by Greek Cypriot nationalists, particularly DIKO MEP Mr. Matsakis, who went to protest and tried to pull down the flag, inevitably heightening tension.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para18"><a name="stpa_134">There has been an increase in troop numbers; there are now in the order of 50,000 troops and the Turkish air force continued its incursions on 13 and 14 October. Immediately after the accession process, there were overflights, which put civilian aircraft in danger and potentially jeopardised the safety of a Royal Air Force exercise in the south.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para19"><a name="stpa_135">Greek Cypriot enclaves are being oppressed. Most recently, teachers at the Rizokarpasso school have not been approved, Turkish Cypriots are taking the land, and Greek Cypriots have even been forbidden to use cars unless they are TRNC-registered, although Maronites, who are also in the north, are not forbidden from using them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para20"><a name="stpa_136">Of greatest concern in the north are the recent developments in the Turkish Cypriot chamber of commerce, where elements of the CDP, UBP and DP organised a coup against its highly respected president, Ali Arel, after an attack by Mr. Soyer, the so-called prime minister of the TRNC, on television. One needs to ask why. Mr. Arel was very pro-solution in the north, and he was seen to be rocking the boat. He has argued, as I started to do more than a year ago, that free trade is the best way to proceed. He wants the European Union customs union to be implemented and the green line regulations to be applied properly and made to work. The final straw was probably his refusal, which came to light, to sign dodgy certificates to certify Turkish tomatoes as Turkish Cypriot for the purpose of smuggling. He very much agrees with the need to decouple trade and aid.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para21"><a name="stpa_137">The fact that Mr. Talat recently accused the EU of being biased against Turkish Cypriots is another example of the rejectionist tendency. There has been a power struggle in the CDP between rejectionist elements trying to assert themselves and Sener Levent, the editor of <i>Afrika</i>, whom I mentioned earlier, who has a court hearing on 28 December in which he faces some 100 charges about things that he has written in his newspaper. Moreover, the property rights lawyer, Mr. Candounas, who is acting in the case to which I referred

&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 29WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
in my response to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper), has been harassed, and I am concerned about whether the rule of law is operating effectively in the north.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para22"><a name="stpa_138">Trade is key, and is another issue that we must address. The trade from south to north is now worth some 97 million Cyprus pounds, which is 15 to 20 per cent. of the Turkish Cypriot economy, but it is mainly because of people, not goods. Some 5,000 Turkish Cypriot workers work in the south every day and take their wages back to the north. Between 7 and 12 per cent. of tourists from the south go north, and a quarter of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them stay overnight. Greek Cypriots spend up to &#8364;135 each time they visit the north, apparently in large part on pirated designer clothing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para23"><a name="stpa_139">Turkish Cypriots buy goods in Greek Cypriot supermarkets because of their variety and quality. Electrical goods, for example, are much cheaper. Green line trade remains neglible; I shall discuss the reasons why shortly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para24"><a name="stpa_140">North-south trade is neglible. It is worth only about 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million Cyprus pounds. Business in the north is not competitive. Clothing manufacture in the north has been heavily hit by the Chinese and Indian clothing trade, as it has elsewhere. Turkish Cypriot business people lack knowledge of the business practices of the south. Turkish Cypriot banks will not lend to Turkish Cypriot businesses because they receive a safer and better return on Turkish Government bonds on the mainland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para25"><a name="stpa_141">The market is very competitive in the south, and is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to become even tougher when a French supermarket chain enters it. There is also some market resistance among Greek Cypriots to buying their own oranges grown on their own land. Some of that is real, but some of it is perceived and is, in fact, risk aversion on the part of the supermarkets already in the south.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para26"><a name="stpa_142">The EU VAT rules are, however, a real problem. The Greek Cypriots are blamed for this, but it is not their fault that the EU rules on VAT are enforced. The subsidies make some of the products in the north uncompetitive, and it is not the fault of Greek Cypriots that the hygiene rules prevent the importation of anything that contains animal products. That is why the direct trade argument is a dead end, because the same EU rules would apply whether or not the imports crossed the green line or entered other EU countries. The same problems of competitiveness would arise, so that is not the way forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para27"><a name="stpa_143">Progress can be made in trade by making the Turkish Cypriot economy more competitive. We should consider not direct trade but free trade in the eastern Mediterranean generally. We should get the economists to co-operate, with a view to creating a single economy in which trade leads to partnership, to interdependence, to economic integration and ultimately to political integration along the lines of the bi-communal, bi-zonal federation, which has been the elusive goal for many years. That view has been expressed on both sides&#151;by Ali Arel on the one hand and by economists whom I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have met in the south on the other. It was floated by the Turkish Cypriot chamber of commerce, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that the Republic is also considering it.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 30WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para28"><a name="stpa_144">The Turkish Cypriot economy should be developing itself to shadow the acquis communautaire and to move towards complying with it. Given the answers given by my hon. Friend the Minister before the election, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that the Government also believe that.
</p>






<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51108h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Paul Keetch  (Hereford)</b>  (LD): Does the hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentleman support the call by some Members of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the European Parliament for Turkish Cypriot representation in Brussels to be increased to give a stronger voice to their concerns? They are concerned that the very effective lobbying of the Cypriot Government is not being properly heard in Brussels and they want a greater say for Turkish Cypriots. Would the hon. Gentleman support that?
</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51108h02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : That has to come as part of an overall political settlement. In theory, there was no reason why Turkish Cypriots should not have stood in the European Parliament elections in the south, although they chose not to do so; indeed, the TRNC authorities put barriers in place to prevent them from doing so. There was talk of people standing for election and, as I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said earlier, Shener Levent may stand for the House of Representatives elections in the south next year. However, the way forward must come through the existing channels; there is no way, and no reason, to make new arrangements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para29"><a name="stpa_145">I was talking about the Turkish Cypriot economy shadowing the acquis on issues such as equality and subsidies. It should be making preparations for the implementation of the customs union. If that was done effectively, it would reduce the cost of reunification, which was one of the main problems arising from the Annan plan. The first step in the process was suggested to me by Ali Arel and is very important: the European Union should do research and produce a technical study on liberalising trade on the island, with the goals that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mentioned in mind.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para30"><a name="stpa_146">The key to trade must be the proper implementation by Turkey of the customs union protocol. Turkish ships already call at ports in Cyprus. In the first six months of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this year, trade from Turkey to Cyprus was worth 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million Cyprus pounds. Although that is not a lot, trade has been growing rapidly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para31"><a name="stpa_147">The Turkish ban on shipping with Greek Cypriot connections cannot be allowed to continue. It is much broader than most people realise and interferes with EU trade generally. Let me give an example. The tanker, Hans Scholl, was Liberian flagged and had a German beneficial owner. It was managed by a subsidiary of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German company based in Limassol, chartered by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Danish company and sub-chartered to British Petroleum. It was carrying a cargo of petroleum from France to Turkey without going anywhere near Cyprus. On 6 August, however, it was banned by Turkey from entering a Turkish port, so 27,000 tonnes of gasoline had to be trans-shipped in the open sea off Malta. That cannot be right and cannot be allowed to continue; Turkey must be required to meet its obligations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para32"><a name="stpa_148">Although I would, of course, very much prefer Turkey to recognise the Republic, it does not necessarily have to do so. At the very least, however, the protocol must be implemented wholeheartedly. That is a European Union requirement, and the issue has an 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 31WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
impact on European Union trade way beyond Cyprus. With the opening of the new pipeline, there will be &#163;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion of goods to be shipped. It is difficult to imagine how that can be achieved without Cyprus shipping, bearing in mind that a large part of the world&#039;s shipping fleet is Cyprus-flagged.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para33"><a name="stpa_149">The obligation on Turkey is not only a legal issue: it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the key to unlocking the Cyprus problem. If implemented effectively and wholeheartedly, the customs union could remove the Greek Cypriot arguments that have put up some of the barriers. It could also lead to the opening of the Famagusta port, probably under European Union management; indeed, the Turkish Cypriots are prepared to negotiate on that. It could then lead to the return of Varosha, and wider progress would become possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para34"><a name="stpa_150">A free trade zone started by Turkey wholeheartedly implementing the customs union is one of the keys to making progress. Again, one could call it &quot;sequential unilateralism&quot;&#151;those, I think, are the new buzzwords in foreign policy. That could well be the way to make some real progress.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para35"><a name="stpa_151">We have to be careful, however, in view of the electoral cycle. Elections to the House of Representatives are due in the Republic next May and Turkish parliamentary elections are due in October 2007. There are various municipal elections and by-elections in the TRNC next year and the Republic presidential elections are in February 2008.

<a name="51108h02_para36"><a name="stpa_152">However, the Republic is working hard towards meeting a target date of 1 January 2008 for joining the euro, and President Papadopoulos has made great progress in the economy in the south. When people focus on this issue, they fail to recognise the progress that has been made on domestic policy. The Republic economy is being geared towards that target date, and it will be useful to work towards it to see whether a unified Cyprus could join the euro.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para37"><a name="stpa_153">What is to be done immediately? Some things are relatively easy. Earlier, I mentioned the need to find finance to deal with the issue of missing persons. Two million Cyprus pounds is not too much for the UK to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find, either on its own or with its partners. The census that the Turkish Cypriots have announced is important. They are open to outside monitoring, but no one has asked them so far. We should put it to them that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important to ensure that the census is credible&#151;that the right questions are asked, and that it is set up properly and monitored. We must ensure that there is international involvement, sooner rather than later, from either the European Union or the Council of Europe. This is also an opportunity to begin talking to the south about whether it is time for a census there too, because there are a lot of foreign residents in the south.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para38"><a name="stpa_154">It is important that European Union documentation is translated into Turkish. The EU must find the funds for that. We should also put pressure on Turkey and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkish Cypriots to stop the building boom in the north and to ease the pressure on the enclaved in Rizokarpasso.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para39"><a name="stpa_155">We must recognise the realities and accept that the trade and aid package has to be decoupled. The Turkish Cypriots accept that; indeed, we may be the only ones who are opposed to it. The aid package of &#8364;279 million

<br>&nbsp;<br>
should be rolled over to next year. We must try to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuade the EU to undergo the study on the liberalisation of trade to which I referred and to consider implementing the green-line rules in that context. We should also talk to Turkish Cypriots about the way in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which their checkpoints are used to prevent diplomatic visits by the Greek Cypriot European Union Commissioner and the European Commission delegate to the Republic; because they are both Greek Cypriots, they cannot cross unless they comply with Turkish Cypriot requirements, which they regard as being incompatible with their diplomatic status.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para40"><a name="stpa_156">What is needed&#151;this is the hardest issue because it involves Turkey&#151;is action from Turkey. It should reduce troop levels. If that is too far a step to take, we could consider supervising Turkish troops through greater European involvement in security maintenance, for example. That could be done through NATO or Europe. Turkey has to implement the customs protocol, and we should look to the 2007 date for the republic&#039;s accession to Europe as a target for a comprehensive settlement, because time is short.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51108h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend&#039;s argument. There have been several indications in the press that the United Nations is considering an initiative in Cyprus. What does my hon. Friend think the UN should do to smooth the path to negotiations?
</p>






<p><a name="st_39"><a name="51108h02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : The UN should do pretty much what it is doing. It would be premature to launch a major initiative at this stage because we cannot afford the failure of another initiative. It is important that the UN should continue to engage with both communities, try to identify the gaps between them and start to bridge those gaps. At the moment, the differences are quite wide, and progress has to made in bridging them. It is incumbent on the republic to be a little more specific about its reservations, and incumbent on the Turkish Cypriots to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be more flexible in their approach to negotiations. It is important that negotiations are conducted in the correct framework, as no progress will be made if they are open-ended. The UN is taking the right steps, but there is still a lot more ground to prepare if we are to progress.
</p>






<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51108h02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Love </b> : Many of us are concerned that we seem to be hung up on whether the Annan plan will be central to the process. What does my hon. Friend think?
</p>






<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51108h02_spnew12"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : We debated the Annan plan at length in July 2004, when I was last able to secure an Adjournment debate on this issue, so I do not want to go over old ground and reopen old wounds. We should look forward. Any future framework for a settlement will have to be based on the Annan plan, as there is no point in throwing away work that has been done, but any future settlement must recognise the shortcomings of the Annan plan for both communities, particularly the Greek Cypriot community&#151;the no voters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para41"><a name="stpa_157">Any adjustment must be by consent, and any future plan must be endorsed by the leaders of both communities. We cannot go forward with a referendum on a plan that is condemned by one side or the other. Unless both sets of community leaders can agree, the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 33WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
settlement will not succeed. The international community can help to create the climate and bring the parties together and bridge the gap, but in the end the settlement must come from the people in the island.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para42"><a name="stpa_158">Time is short. Despite all that I have said, recent opinion polling and detailed research by Alexandros Lordos and Muharrem Faiz shows that Cypriot public opinion on both sides is relatively close on the terms of settlement, but will start to move apart if the negotiation process does not begin soon. An example of that was the point raised by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers), which I developed, on the question of property rights. That problem will grow harder as time goes by, as the building boom continues. Property rights were not, as I understand it, a deal breaker in the Annan plan as it was, but they may become one if progress is not made and the problem gets worse.There is a risk that parties&#039; positions will become more entrenched and that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejectionists will come more to the fore, as we saw from the treatment of Mr. Arel. I think, therefore, that although time is short we must recognise the problems.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para43"><a name="stpa_159">Perhaps I may conclude with a statistic. A quarter of the Greek Cypriots who were alive in 1974 are now no longer alive and 42 per cent. of the Greek Cypriots who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are alive today were not born in 1974. In less than 10 years half the population of Greek Cypriots will have no organic link with the north. I should like to give figures for the Turkish Cypriots but I cannot, because there has been no census. However, the longer things continue the harder they get, as the ground changes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para44"><a name="stpa_160">I come back to my crescendo to make a perhaps rather cheeky point, which is that Turkey has an awful lot to do to join the European Union. It must sort out its economy and its political institutions and carry out a huge programme of internal reform. On the face of it, Cyprus may seem a difficult nut to crack, but of all the things that Turkey must do to join the European Union, dealing with Cyprus is one of the easiest, if the political will is there. Turkey should recognise that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para45"><a name="stpa_161">Turkey must decide whether it really wants to be a member of the European Union&#151;or perhaps it is better to say that the Turkish army must decide whether it wants to be part of a modern, democratic state, and withdraw from politics, allowing the will of the Turkish people, as expressed in the previous general election and their continuing support for the Erdogan Government, to prevail, so that Turkey may look to the west and modernise&#151;as the founder of the modern Turkish state, Kemal Atat&#252;rk, with his westernising, modernising approach, would very much have liked. Turkish politics has been ossified for too long. Turkey must look to the west. It is its future. It is the future of Europe to include Turkey in the European Union, but it must solve the Cyprus issue first, and sooner rather than later.

<a name="51108h02_para46"><a name="stpa_162">There have, of course, been diplomatic tensions between the UK and Cypriot Governments since the referendum in April 2004, but, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Annan plan was democratically rejected by an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overwhelming majority, and that was right and fair,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it was seriously flawed. Let us clearly understand that every person who believes in democracy must respect the decision of people in referendums, including the decision that the Cypriot people took in April 2004.

</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51108h02_spnew15"><b> Bob Spink </b> : I am grateful for that intervention, which covers a point I was going to make.

The situation is a little more complicated than the hon. Gentleman portrays it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) explained.
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51108h02_spnew17"><b> Bob Spink </b> : The hon. Gentleman shows great wisdom. The key problem was that Annan did not provide for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reunification of the island. The division was perpetuated. Tassos Papadopoulos stated that as recently as last week. The hon. Gentleman is right that the Cypriot problem is complicated. There are two sides to it, and each side must recognise the other with dignity, tolerance and forgiveness. That is the only way to move forward, which is what the Cypriot people want.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para47"><a name="stpa_163">I hope that Europe will continue to give Turkey all the help and encouragement possible in the accession process. That would be good for Cyprus, for the Kurds, for human rights and for the whole region. Anything less would betray the Turkish and Greek Cypriots and would show that some countries in Europe have not yet grown up enough to put progress, peace, human rights and stability before pernicious self-interest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para48"><a name="stpa_164">Cypriot public opinion is moving positively towards the terms of a just settlement. The international community, including America, must act quickly to grasp that nettle and to ensure that it takes advantage of that time. As the hon. Member for Hendon said, the Alexandros Lordos and Muharrem Faiz opinion polls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showed that movement. That could be used as the basis of an NGO-type constitutional convention, with discussions ahead of or to accompany United Nations talks between the leaders of the two communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para49"><a name="stpa_165">The Turkish accession process must be supported by Cyprus and Greece. They must not threaten to use or actually use their vetoes. In return, Turkey must try to make faster progress and show more good will towards a just settlement of the Cyprus problem. It is very much in Turkey&#039;s interests to agree to a just settlement, because if it does it will have two new and strong allies, Greece and Cyprus, in its EU accession process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para50"><a name="stpa_166">There is a need to move quickly, balanced with a need&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to get the timing right. The UN must begin the settlement process as soon as possible to avoid further entrenchment of both communities. The hon. Members for Hendon and for Edmonton (Mr. Love) implied that timing is everything in politics. Elections to the House of Representatives in Cyprus will be in May next year, and the Turkish elections will be in November. If Erdogan stands and is elected president of Turkey in April 2007, there could be a window of opportunity for Turkey following that presidential election.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para51"><a name="stpa_167">Tassos Papadopoulos&#039;s first term runs out in February 2008, which is about the time when election fever will be hotting up in this House. If there is to be a UN big push, it will need to be in May next year and should run up to the end of 2007.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para52"><a name="stpa_168">A much tougher message needs to come from London on the thorny issue of delivering back property to each community&#039;s rightful, individual, legal owners. The rule of law must prevail, including rights of ownership. Anything less&#151;any other precedent&#151;would be a disaster, not just for the Cypriot people, but for the law-abiding world. It would send out the wrong message to rogue states that possession, not law and human rights, will prevail. That would be detrimental to world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stability and peace in the longer run. The UK Government must make stronger statements about the improper sale and development of Greek Cypriot land in occupied areas. A shop opened in my constituency advertising land for sale in the north of Cyprus, and I hit the newspapers big time telling my constituents what I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought about that, and quite right too!

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para53"><a name="stpa_169">We must make sure that everyone&#151;especially British citizens who are still buying the stolen property&#151;understands that those who bought what amounts to stolen property must take the full loss when the matter is eventually resolved, as it must be. At best, those who buy it are cynical opportunists and at worst they are no better than looters, preying on others&#039; misfortunes. The UK Government have at last woken up to the abuse but are still doing too little, too late. It was wrong to stand by and allow the sale of stolen Cyprus property to be promoted and enacted in the UK. That would not have happened if mere artefacts were involved; the Government prevent that as it is against the law, so why should they allow people&#039;s homes to be sold?

Free rather than direct trade is needed, as the hon. Member for Hendon said. The port of Famagusta needs to be opened with international involvement and the customs union between Cyprus and Turkey should be implemented.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para55"><a name="stpa_171">On humanitarian matters my language may again be slightly intemperate, and I make no apology for that, because it is necessary. We must respect and understand the missing person issue and fund the committee that the hon. Gentleman mentioned so that it can build on recent developments and employ Inforce to do the necessary work. How could Turkey think that it is ready to be considered to take part in Europe or to be respected by the international community if it cannot allow the relatives of the missing persons to have closure? It is an affront to humanity, and it could so easily be resolved. That would be a measure of Turkey&#039;s willingness to change and to do what is right. At last, there are some positive moves in that respect, which I welcome.

<p>
<a name="51108h02_para56"><a name="stpa_172">I pay tribute to the Greek Cypriot community for the care it is rightly showing to the Turkish Cypriots who are going south looking for jobs and to those who need medical treatment in the south. That is absolutely right and laudable. Each community must show compassion to the other and that is happening; it must happen more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para57"><a name="stpa_173">In addition, the Turkish Cypriots must prepare for the European Union by complying with the acquis and shadowing its requirements, which will help them to plan for settlement and reunification. Another key development is to improve the crossing points, which will help both communities. Cypriots from both sides responded to the opening of the green line in April 2003. There have been huge numbers of contacts and crossings as people literally vote with their feet and there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been hundreds of thousands of peaceful, constructive exchanges in both directions. Although that has slowed somewhat, more crossing points are needed, particularly in the shopping area of Ledra street, hopefully linking to a similar development north of the green line.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para58"><a name="stpa_174">In conclusion, the Foreign Office and Government got it wrong after the referendum. They showed disrespect for democracy and sought to deny the self-determination of the people of Cyprus. Their attitude was unsustainable. They did a great disservice to the people of both the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities, but it is now time to put that behind us and to set out on a positive road to a just settlement that will stand up to

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para59"><a name="stpa_175">We are gathered to reflect on a grave injustice that was done back in 1974. In my view, 31 years is far too long to wait for a solution to reunify Cyprus. I take this opportunity to urge the Minister and the international community as a whole to redouble their efforts to help Cypriots find the elusive solution that will reunify their island, and to find a just, balanced and lasting settlement. I emphasise, as others have already, that no settlement will work unless it has the whole-hearted consent and support of both communities. No settlement will stick and last without that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para60"><a name="stpa_176">We should seek a solution that balances the interests of the two communities within a federal structure in a single state, so that we can bring the island back together as it was before the disruption of 1974. Like others, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that the Annan plan 5 is well and truly dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no point in trying to revive it. As parliamentarians, we need to urge the international community to start fresh negotiations between the two communities to work for a new plan that will address the serious reservations of many Cypriots about Annan 5.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para61"><a name="stpa_177">There is no justification for criticism of the result of a democratic referendum. We have to address why so many Cypriots voted no to Annan 5. A particular concern was expressed about security, but there were also serious concerns about long-term restrictions on free movement. The Cypriots would have been deprived of the fundamental rights that one would normally expect to enjoy as a citizen of a European Union member state.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para62"><a name="stpa_178">In particular, property will be an issue that it is vital to get right. It is not simply a financial matter; it is a human tragedy that saw thousands of people driven from the homes in which they had grown up, with, in many cases, nothing more than the clothes on their back. I have heard countless poignant and desperately sad stories about Cypriots going back across the line to see their old homes, and perhaps finding some of their furniture or their wedding photographs carefully stored by those who have occupied the premises. It is vital that we recognise the value of returning people to the homes that they lost in 1974, which they still remember.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para63"><a name="stpa_179">It is vital that we take action as soon as possible. As we have heard, Annan 5 has encouraged a building boom in the northern part of Cyprus that is steadily making it more difficult to reach a solution and deal with the property issues. More and more land owned by Greek Cypriots, from which they were driven in 1974, is being built on. That must increase the urgency with which we address the issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para64"><a name="stpa_180">I intend to keep my speech as short as possible, because I know that many others would like to contribute. The Foreign Office must strengthen its warnings to British citizens who consider buying property in northern Cyprus. It is highly irresponsible

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para65"><a name="stpa_181">It is vital in the EU negotiation process that Turkey is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encouraged to co-operate and make progress on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue of Cyprus. It should clearly recognise the Government of Cyprus. I cannot see how it can negotiate for EU membership with a range of Governments, including the Cypriot Government, if it does not recognise every one of the Governments with which it is negotiating. The authorities in north Cyprus should stop the discrimination that we have seen against enclaved Greek Cypriots, particularly in Rizakarpasso, with the continuing problems that they have had in accessing education at the high school. We should take a fundamentally optimistic view of the future in Cyprus.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51108h02_spnew25"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): There is some concern that the gap between two communities is too wide to start negotiations at this stage. That is primarily because, on one side, there is rejection of the Annan plan and, on the other, Mr. Erdogan and Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talat have made it clear that the basis of a solution has to be the Annan plan. How do we bring those two sides closer together to start that process of negotiation?
</p>






<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51108h02_spnew26"><b> Mrs. Villiers </b> : I was going to explain why I am fundamentally optimistic. My view is based on looking back at the past, where it was clear that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could live happily side by side. I also view it from the perspective of the present, where I can see the huge cultural overlap between the outlook of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, both in the UK and in Cyprus itself. One of the tasks that we face as British parliamentarians is to rebuild that trust. If the communities are allowed to live together, there is no question of violence erupting. They have a huge amount in common, and I believe that they can live and work together harmoniously.
</p>






<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51108h02_spnew27"><b> David Lepper </b> : The hon. Lady mentioned the role of the UK Government in relation to rebuilding that trust. Does she agree that there is a twofold responsibility on the part of the UK Government? First, Cyprus is a member of the EU already, and Turkey is not. That gives the UK a particular role. Secondly, Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth, which gives an additional responsibility to our Government in relation to the legitimacy of the republic of Cyprus.
</p>






<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51108h02_spnew28"><b> Mrs. Villiers </b> : I completely agree. The British Government have always had a pivotal role in Cyprus and should use their influence in the United Nations, in the European Union during their presidency and in the Commonwealth to drive forward the search for a just and peaceful solution of the Cyprus question.

<a name="51108h02_para68"><a name="stpa_184">Many key points have already been covered, and I am conscious of time so I shall be as brief as possible. The Foreign Affairs Committee has received a written response from the Government to many of our recommendations, and I have written to the Foreign Secretary to further pursue developments under the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presidency of the European Union. When the Select Committee published its report, Luxembourg held the EU presidency. The six-month period of the UK presidency is significant for the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper), but also because the UK is a guarantor power. Turkey and the UK are both members of NATO and therefore have a considerable interest in the complications caused in a number of international organisations by the continuing failure to resolve the situation in Cyprus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para69"><a name="stpa_185">At its last sitting, the Foreign Affairs Committee was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;critical in some respects of the attitude of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus to the process of negotiations. The Committee was also critical of aspects of the policies of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot entity. The Committee took a view, however&#151;contrary to what has been said by some earlier contributors&#151;that a modified version of the Annan plan represented the best way forward and that the plan was not dead. It is important to recognise that there may be a need to make changes to that plan.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para70"><a name="stpa_186">The Foreign Affairs Committee was disappointed that the Annan plan was rejected, but stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;In the absence of an early overall settlement, we recommend that the Government&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;support practical measures that will enable Turkish Cypriots to trade with the United Kingdom and other countries&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para72"><a name="stpa_188">The Committee also pressed for free trade within the island, and supported the view expressed by my 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 40WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
hon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend the Member for Hendon. The Committee further recommended that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;in any future negotiations on a settlement based on the Annan plan, the parties be invited to consider accelerating the withdrawal of Turkish and Greek forces and the demilitarisation of Cypriot forces&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para73"><a name="stpa_189">The Committee welcomed the British Government&#039;s offer to halve the size of the sovereign base area territory, but that is only an interim step towards an ultimate solution that deals with the decisions of the Greek Cypriot elected representatives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para74"><a name="stpa_190">It is important that any resumed negotiations take account of significant changes among Turkish Cypriot people, as well as the economic developments that have taken place. The fact that the Turkish Cypriots voted for the Annan plan, despite the position of Mr Denktash, is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of fundamental importance and should not be dismissed. We do ourselves no favours if we see this matter with regard simply to the position in 1974. The position in 1974 is important, and the issues raised by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) and others are fundamental to a long-term solution. However, it must be recognised that the Turkey of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recent past is different from the Turkey of 1974. The decision of 3 October gives the potential for a process of transformation in Turkey. It is not in Turkey&#039;s interests to have a continuing problem with other EU states as a result of its presence on the island of Cyprus. If we take intelligent and practical measures over the coming years, we have a real opportunity to take matters forward. That was broadly what the Foreign Affairs Committee argued in its report earlier this year, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am grateful for the opportunity to refer to it today.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51108h02_spnew30"><b> Mr. Paul Keetch  (Hereford)</b>  (LD): I start by congratulating the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismore) on securing this debate. He has a long record of initiating such debates; his interest in the island of Cyprus is well known and recorded, and he spoke with knowledge. We have seen broad cross-party support for the British Government in recent years, and I hope that it will continue. I shall keep my remarks relatively brief so that the Minister has plenty of time to respond to the important points that have been raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para75"><a name="stpa_191">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) made a robust speech in which he showed his knowledge not only of Cyprus but of the wider Mediterranean area. He raised some interesting points. The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) spoke of balance, something surely needed in a future settlement of the island of Cyprus. It epitomises what we should strive to achieve. The hon. Lady&#039;s predecessor, Sir Sydney Chapman, who often spoke in such debates, would have been proud of what she said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para76"><a name="stpa_192">The hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes), the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am delighted to be a humble member, spoke with the great knowledge associated with that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important position. In an intervention, the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) mentioned the Commonwealth. Yes, Cyprus is a member of the Commonwealth, but Britain has a direct responsibility for its sovereign base areas in Cyprus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para77"><a name="stpa_193">Britain very much welcomes and values the importance of our two important sovereign base areas. We also value the close relationship between the British 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 41WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
military community and the Cyprus community. There have been problems in the past, but those bases are largely welcomed by the island community. The bases at Akrotiri and Dhekelia remain integral to our defence, and we commend the effort and determination of our troops on the island.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para78"><a name="stpa_194">My party believes that Cyprus can succeed as an independent state only with reconciliation and respect for the fundamental rights of the Turkish and the Greek communities. A future settlement of property rights must recognise the legitimate claims of the Greek Cypriot population who were evicted in 1974, but without causing the social injustice that many in the north feel might result. We call for the ending of restrictive Government policies on mobility and property and we call for the settlement of both communities within the islands. The leaders of the two communities must exercise the political will necessary to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establish a democratic, bicameral, two-party federal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state with a single international identity, its independence being guaranteed by the United Nations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para79"><a name="stpa_195">We broadly support the Foreign Office&#039;s and Europe Union&#039;s position on Cyprus, and we regret that the UN plan was not adopted. However, it is hoped that some elements of the plan might form the basis of a future settlement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para80"><a name="stpa_196">I mentioned trade in an intervention on the hon. Member for Hendon. Some in the European Parliament have put forward a case for direct trade to be established with northern Cyprus in order to relieve the economic impoverishment of the Turkish Cypriots; and 24 of the 25 EU member state Governments of the Council of Ministers approved the principle. However, it has been blocked by the Government of Cyprus. We regret that. The Council of Ministers pledged to end the isolation of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;northern Cyprus in the wake of a yes vote for the UN-Annan plan for political settlement, yet despite calls from MEPs there has been no direct trade or financial assistance. We believe that it would have assisted the political settlement and helped to finalise the dispute.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para81"><a name="stpa_197">We call for the increase of Turkish Cypriot representation in Brussels in order to counterbalance the Greek Cypriot voice. It is important that its voice be heard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para82"><a name="stpa_198">Many people believe that the solution will be found only through ongoing Turkish negotiations with the EU. Cyprus was one of the 10 new states to join the EU in 2004, but it joined as a divided island. The Turkish Cypriots are in a strange situation. Since 1976, the island has been viewed by the UN as one island, and it joined the EU as one island. However, even though Turkish Cypriots are viewed as EU citizens, the wider world does not recognise their Government, and thus Turkish Cypriots are not represented.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para83"><a name="stpa_199">We have always maintained that Turkey should be a full member of the EU in order to maintain good trade links and international relations with the country. Those links must be subject to the accountability of the European Parliament, but Turkish accession must also be subject to the appropriate timing of compatible economic and human rights policies. It may be difficult for Turkey to join the EU if it continues to refuse to acknowledge Cyprus as a member state in its own right. That may cause difficulties, but it is unacceptable to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 42WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
expect Turkey, in order to gain accession to the EU, to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make concessions to Cyprus. To do so would deprive Turkish Cypriots of their communal identity. Therefore it is fundamental that the Turkish and Greek Presidents work bilaterally, as well as within the EU, to create a harmonious federal state in Cyprus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para84"><a name="stpa_200">We broadly support what the Government have done. We shall continue to do so, and we look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.

</p>

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51108h02_spnew31"><b> Mr. Graham Brady  (Altrincham and Sale, West)</b>  (Con): It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch). I join him in congratulating the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on securing what has been a good and constructive debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para85"><a name="stpa_201">The hon. Member for Hendon began by speaking about the lack of trust and the air of depression that he had encountered on his recent visit to Cyprus. He moved on, however, to talk about the more hopeful signs that we see on the island. I join him in welcoming those encouraging signs and a more optimistic future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para86"><a name="stpa_202">We frequently find ourselves in the House talking about what is wrong with the European Union. I have had many exchanges with the Minister for Europe on the subject. Differences exist among the parties on the various issues. However, we hold a common belief in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capacity of the European Union to help to build and secure freedom, democracy and rule of law, particularly for new member states. If we can contribute to resolving Cyprus&#039;s problems, we would all greatly welcome that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para87"><a name="stpa_203">The beginning of the Turkish accession talks promises a time of great opportunity in many ways, one of the most important of which is the openings for movement towards a peaceful resolution of Cyprus&#039;s problems. We know that those resolutions will not be easily or quickly achieved. Many hon. Members have referred to the Annan plan and the referendum that followed it. The lesson that must be learned is that a lasting, peaceful reunification of Cyprus cannot be achieved over the heads of its people. As the hon. Member for Hendon said, both communities&#039; consent is required if we are to make progress.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para88"><a name="stpa_204">It is unfortunate that more progress could not be made on the Cyprus question before the Turkish accession talks began. We must therefore recognise where we are and start from there. We must look positively at the influence that can be brought to bear, on Turkey in particular, during the accession process. As my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes) said, it is important that Turkey&#039;s recognition of Cyprus as a member state is not held off until Turkish accession arrives, whether that be in 10 or 15 years. Recognition of Cyprus is an essential sign of Turkish good will and commitment to joining the European Union.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para89"><a name="stpa_205">The accession agreement requires progress on the normalisation of relations. That progress should include measures to tackle the real problems, such as the criminal justice issues to which the hon. Member for Hendon referred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para90"><a name="stpa_206">The hon. Gentleman also made the telling point that, in many ways, the Cyprus question is an easier one for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkey to resolve than some of the other large challenges that lie ahead on that country&#039;s road to accession. I hope that that wise guidance will be heard.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 43WH</b>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para91"><a name="stpa_207">The United Kingdom&#039;s special role and position in its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship with Cyprus has also been mentioned. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore welcome the new, structured dialogue agreed by the Deputy Prime Minister that is due to start in January. Britain should maintain close relations, friendship and dialogue with Cyprus. I hope that the wounds of recent disagreements between Her Majesty&#039;s Government and the Government of Cyprus can be healed. I echo remarks made about the British Government&#039;s response to the referendum, which was unfortunate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para92"><a name="stpa_208">It may be a little surprising that it is the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s diplomatic skills that have been brought to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bear in pouring oil on the troubled waters that were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caused by the Foreign Secretary&#039;s involvement in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the issue but, however surprising, it is none the less&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome, because Britain&#039;s history and close connections give us a vital role in resolving the problems of Cyprus. Those problems are very real, and we have heard a great deal about them this morning. They include the settlement-building that is taking place in the north&#151;possibly fuelled by the Annan plan, which may make a settlement harder to achieve, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) said. There is also a need for proper and full implementation of the EU Customs union. The hon. Member for Hendon was right to say that free and open trade would give considerable impetus for change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para93"><a name="stpa_209">My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spink) spoke passionately about the need for compassion, tolerance and maturity on both sides if we are to move forward. My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet rightly reminded hon. Members of the very real human tragedies of Cyprus, but also of how much the communities have in common. That was a message of hope for the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para94"><a name="stpa_210">I want to leave time for the Minister to address all the issues that have been raised, so I shall conclude by saying that anyone who listened to our proceedings this morning could not doubt the complexity of and the difficulty in finding a solution to the problems of Cyprus. However, I believe that this is a time of real hope. The Government were right to press forward with the start of Turkish accession talks. A resolution of the problems of Cyprus will not be the only benefit of Turkish accession, if that can be achieved, but it should be regarded as an important one.

</p>

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51108h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander) </b> : From the Conservative Front Bench, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) concluded his remarks&#151;not in the same manner as the crescendo that we anticipated and then enjoyed from my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)&#151;by saying that anyone who listened to our debate today would be aware of the complexity of the issue and the challenge that faces all of us in relation to Cyprus. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would add that anyone listening to the debate that we have enjoyed this morning would reflect on the great credit that it brings to the House of Commons that we

<br>&nbsp;<br>
can still&#151;sometimes away from the television cameras and the press reporters&#151;enjoy a debate of such quality.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para95"><a name="stpa_211">I therefore begin my remarks by congratulating my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Rather elliptically, the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) acknowledged the fact that my hon. Friend has some form on Adjournment debates in the House, and is well known for his expertise in that regard. My hon. Friend more than matched that record today by demonstrating his expertise, long-standing interest and concern for the issues of Cyprus, and I pay due regard to that. I am also aware that this Adjournment debate takes place after my hon. Friend&#039;s recent visit to Cyprus between 5 and 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October. I believe that the House is well served in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having individuals with such personal and direct experience, such constituency interest and such expertise as has been manifest in the course of the debate today. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome the opportunity to discuss Cyprus and the points raised in today&#039;s debate. In the time available to me I shall endeavour to cover most of the specific points that have been put to me in the course of the past hour.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para96"><a name="stpa_212">The Government have always worked hard in support of efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in Cyprus, brokered under the auspices of the United Nations. I am sure that the House will agree that the search for a settlement must remain an important priority for the Government&#151;that sentiment was echoed in some of the remarks made by hon. Members today. After more than three decades of efforts to find a solution, it is a matter of genuine and great regret that the island remains divided, and that the communities on the island&#151;about which we have heard this morning&#151;and the stability of the region and the international community as a whole, continue to suffer as a result. The Government firmly believe that every effort must be made to achieve a comprehensive settlement. Time is not on our side, for some of the reasons given by my hon. Friend. Many of the points made in today&#039;s debate have confirmed my belief that the longer the current division continues, the more intractable the issues become.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para97"><a name="stpa_213">My hon. Friend raised, in particular, the concerns of Greek Cypriots about the ongoing situation in the north. I know that the property boom, the presence of Turkish troops and the number of Turkish nationals living in the north are a matter of great concern for many people who take a close interest in Cyprus. All those issues are at the heart of the Cyprus problem and underline the urgent need to achieve a settlement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para98"><a name="stpa_214">On the specific issue of property, which my hon. Friend and other hon. Members mentioned, I can assure the House that we maintain a dialogue with the Turkish Cypriots on all Cyprus settlement issues, including that of property. However, we are not able to prevent property development, and the authorities themselves face powerful economic forces in a perverse political environment. It is a matter of great regret that the island did not reunite on the basis of the Secretary-General&#039;s proposals of last year, with the system of property restitution and compensation that was anticipated by the Annan plan. However, we continue to believe that the difficult and complicated issues relating to property in Cyprus can realistically be resolved only as part of the comprehensive Cyprus settlement. That reinforces 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 45WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;importance of achieving a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the Annan plan as soon as possible.
</p>






<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51108h02_spnew32"><b> Mr. Love </b> : Two weeks ago, the Saturday edition of the <i>Financial Times </i>featured a large article on purchasing property in northern Cyprus. If one read it very carefully, one found a little mention in one paragraph of the fact that legal difficulties might attend the purchase of such property. Should the Government do more to bring to the attention of those who might read such articles some of the difficulties that might occur?
</p>






<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51108h02_spnew33"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : I am grateful for the question, because it anticipates a point that I was going to make on the efforts that the Government are making, and the steps that we are taking in relation to exactly that kind of issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para99"><a name="stpa_215">We do not encourage British citizens to buy property in the north of Cyprus; through our travel advice, our website and in response to queries we explain clearly that property issues are closely linked to the political situation on the island, and we mention the risk to purchasers who could face legal proceedings in the courts of the Republic. We also advise potential purchasers of property to seek independent qualified legal advice and explain that the non-recognition of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the possibility of a future political settlement in Cyprus could have significant practical financial implications for those considering buying property in the north.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para100"><a name="stpa_216">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) made clear the efforts that he has made in his community to bring&#151;rather forcefully, I suspect&#151;to the attention of prospective purchasers the risks facing those who would be persuaded by the kind of advertisement of which my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend spoke. We have a responsibility in Government, and I have sought to explain the steps that we are taking. I urge hon. Members, particularly those whose constituents might be interested in acquiring property in that part of the world, to make their concerns known directly to such people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para101"><a name="stpa_217">In the past year, there have been both encouraging developments on the path towards a resumption of settlement negotiations and some causes for concern, as has been reflected in the debate. Let me address some of the specific questions that have been put to us about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prospects for renewing talks after the result of the referendums.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para102"><a name="stpa_218">We believe that new settlement talks in Cyprus can be initiated only with the support of both communities on the island. The recent report by Sir Kieran Prendergast, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, following his visit to the island in May, concluded that the gap between the stated positions of the parties appears to be widening, while confidence between them&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not high. The point was made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon that that makes the process of establishing common ground extremely difficult. The United Kingdom Government, however, remain committed to achieving a fair, viable and lasting settlement in Cyprus for the benefit of all Cypriots. We therefore maintain our contact with all parties and encourage all sides to show the necessary political will and readiness to negotiate to achieve that goal.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 46WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para103"><a name="stpa_219">On a practical level I know that, immediately following the 30 hours of negotiation in which the Foreign Secretary and I participated on 3 October to secure the beginning of accession talks with Turkey, our Foreign Secretary was in direct contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to explore with him the potential for further action, given the changed context of the opening of accession talks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para104"><a name="stpa_220">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about whether the attitude of the Foreign Office after the referendum was somehow unacceptable or biased. I refute that charge absolutely. Our objective was and remains, as I have said, the achievement of a comprehensive settlement in the interests of all Cypriots, and in that we maintain a close and constructive dialogue with all parties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para105"><a name="stpa_221">The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers) impressed upon me the importance of respecting the democratic nature of the vote that was exercised in relation to the Annan 5 plan. I assure her that we do respect the outcome of the referendum and the fact that many Greek Cypriots expressed their genuine concerns in their rejection of the referendum proposals. However, I repeat that any future changes to the plan will need to be acceptable to both sides. Notwithstanding the fact that that was perhaps not evident in our discussions this morning, it bears heavily on the importance of trying to find a way forward in light of the rejection of which a number of hon. Members have spoken.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para106"><a name="stpa_222">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon raised the questions of the Turkish implementation of the protocol and, in particular, access to Turkish ports. Let us be clear: by signing the protocol, Turkey has committed to implementing its terms. To quote the EC directly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;The European Community and its Member States expect full, non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol, and the removal of all obstacles to the free movement of goods, including restrictions on means of transport.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para107"><a name="stpa_223">In relation to the broader question of crime and drugs across the green line, the European Union has made clear the need to de-isolate the Turkish Cypriots and bring them closer to the EU, fulfilling the mandate from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EU Foreign Ministers last year. Helping Turkish Cypriots to raise standards in the north would, I believe, have a beneficial effect on the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants from northern Cyprus into the Republic of Cyprus and the rest of the EU.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para108"><a name="stpa_224">My hon. Friend raised a specific point about the census, which was echoed by other speakers. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assure the House that we would support the census and stand ready to assist in taking forward that idea.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51108h02_spnew34"><b> Mr. Brady </b> : The Minister referred to the expectation that the protocol should be fully implemented. Could he enlighten us as to what steps are being taken to ensure that and suggest by which date we expect it to be the case?

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51108h02_spnew35"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : I am not able to give a definitive date at the moment, but I can assure the House of my good faith. As recently as the day of the Hampton Court summit, I met Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey and impressed on him the importance of seeing progress on that as well as on a number of issues. That is reflective of a general desire on the part of the British Government 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 47WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to make the Government of Turkey fully aware of their responsibilities under the protocol as well as the need to maintain the momentum established on 3 October to try to drive forward the process. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are using the opportunities available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para109"><a name="stpa_225">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon raised the matter of the recent elections to the Turkish Cypriot chamber of commerce. That is not a matter usually discussed on the Floor of the House, but it is important as it tells us about the dynamics in Turkish Cypriot politics. I will not comment in detail on the specifics of who was elected and who was not and on the internal procedures of the chamber, but I can assure the House that our high commissioner has met the chamber of commerce&#039;s new president, who has stressed his commitment to recognising its responsibilities and relationships with the EU. It is a matter of which we are aware and on which work is under way.

The United Kingdom contributed $50,000 to the work of the committee last year and we are actively considering a further contribution in the light of the important work it undertakes. We are in discussion with other member states about what further steps can be taken at an EU level to encourage that work.
</p>






<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51108h02_spnew36"><b> David Lepper </b> : On the question of missing persons, would the Minister agree that the Turkish army has an obligation to make available the full records of those who were arrested at the time of the occupation in 1974 to enable proper investigations to take place?
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51108h02_spnew37"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : Clearly, difficulties in access to information have been encountered in the past. I hope that the sentiment I have expressed and our financial contribution speak to the fact that we would not support the committee if we did not support its aims, which are that information should be established about all the missing people related to the terrible and difficult events that took place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para111"><a name="stpa_227">Notwithstanding the many challenges, it is also important to maintain a sense of perspective, despite the considerable challenges that still confront us. I was enormously encouraged by the EU&#039;s historic decision on 3 October to open accession negotiations with Turkey. As well as being the right decision on its own grounds, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strongly argue that it is also the right result for the European Union, for Turkey and for Cyprus. Steady progress in Turkey&#039;s accession negotiation process will encourage normalisation of relations between Turkey and Cyprus, as the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West acknowledged. That should in turn help to increase trust and interaction between the parties and provide a sure context for a resumption of those negotiations.

</p>

the centre of Nicosia on Ledra street. The work of the Committee on Missing Persons, with the increased contribution and engagement of both communities, is also promising, notwithstanding the continuing challenges that have been mentioned. We are making every effort to work with the Republic of Cyprus to build a broader base of bilateral co-operation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para113"><a name="stpa_229">During his visit to Cyprus in late October, the Deputy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister signed the memorandum of understanding establishing a structured dialogue on bilateral co-operation, as agreed by the Prime Minister and the President when they met in July. The hon. Gentleman suggested, gently, that there was surprise about the role of the Deputy Prime Minister and the constructive contribution that he is already recognised as having made in that regard. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I personally can testify that not simply internationally but sometimes even domestically my right hon. Friend is able to pour oil on troubled waters. My right hon. Friend was also involved in discussion about the prospects of the resumption of United Nations&#039; negotiations with representatives of both sides of the island during an important and timely visit.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para114"><a name="stpa_230">I am concerned that the stated positions of the parties on the elements that will need to be discussed during a resumption of negotiations regrettably remains far apart. The report produced by UN Under-Secretary-General Kieran Prendergast after he visited the island in May underlined how wide that gap remains.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para115"><a name="stpa_231">I am also concerned that to date the EU has not been successful in meeting its commitments to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, an issue addressed in the wide-ranging contribution of the hon. Member for Hereford. As the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes) said, the Turkish Cypriots showed their continued support for the settlement and for a reunited Cyprus in the EU at the referendums in 2004 and in subsequent elections. But the more the Turkish Cypriots are left isolated by the international community, the more that elements in the north of Cyprus who oppose a just Cyprus settlement will flourish. We must not allow that to happen, so we will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue to do all we can to ensure that the EU lives up to these commitments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para116"><a name="stpa_232">The Commission has put forward proposals for financial assistance and preferential trade. As hon. Members said, it has proven enormously difficult for member states to agree these measures, but our duty while we have the presidency is to make every effort to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do so; we will continue to work to that end with our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Union partners beyond the end of our presidency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h02_para117"><a name="stpa_233">I listened carefully to the contributions from both sides of the House in this wide-ranging debate. I assure hon. Members that we will continue to take forward the work that I discussed when I met the Prime Minister of Turkey and which the Deputy Prime Minister took forward during his recent visit to the island. I assure the House that, not least for all the reasons we have heard&#151;the sovereign bases, the guarantor role, our role in the European Union and in NATO&#151;Cyprus continues to be one of the key areas of priority for the Government.

<a name="time_13">
<a name="51108h03_time0"><h5>12.28 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51108h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this subject. I am not entirely sure whether it has been raised in Parliament before, but if so, it was not in a debate. As you know, Mr. Cummings, aviculture is just another name for the keeping of birds which, in its widest sense, means anything from poultry, pheasants, ducks and owls to more familiar birds such as budgies and canaries and also owls.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para0"><a name="stpa_234">I will concentrate on the more usual types of bird and speak briefly on the history of keeping birds. It goes back a long way, as we can see from mosaics from Ancient Greece and Rome, in which parrots and other such things were depicted. It is only in the past couple of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centuries that bird keeping has become more widespread; before that, it was very much the pastime of the rich, and stately homes would often have large collections. In the 19th and 20th centuries, however, it became much more the pastime of ordinary working men. Latterly, it has been taken up by working women, too, although it is mostly the pastime of working men.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para1"><a name="stpa_235">People kept pigeons or canaries before budgerigars became established in this country. In many mining communities in your constituency, Mr. Cummings, and throughout the country, a lot of people who had very hard lives and worked long hours will have derived great pleasure from looking after and nurturing these living creatures. Keeping birds gave people immense pleasure. It is not just that canaries were kept in the mines; keeping birds was a form of escapism for many people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para2"><a name="stpa_236">When people look after living creatures, they have to make a great commitment to ensure that the animals in their care survive. That requires great dedication, and people tend to their birds daily, if not several times a day.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para3"><a name="stpa_237">I confess to hon. Members that I have kept birds, although I regard myself primarily as a birdwatcher. If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go back long enough, I can remember a time when I was rather keen on having the usual type of pet, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pestered mother and father for a cat or a dog. Wisely, they said that that would not be all that easy, so we settled on having an aviary in the garden. I derived great pleasure from keeping birds and found out a lot more about them than I would have done purely by going walking around the countryside watching birds. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found out about breeding cycles and, despite never having been a great scientist, about different mutations; it was good for a young schoolboy to learn about genetics in a simplified form.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para4"><a name="stpa_238">Interestingly, two of my friends at school also kept birds. Today, I am here, one of my school friends is a wildlife officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the other runs one of the largest bird tour companies in Britain. Although the latter two do not keep birds any more, I am sure that our great interest was spurred on by the fact that we were in close proximity to birds and were able to learn more about them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para5"><a name="stpa_239">I am sure that hon. Members are thinking, &quot;That is all very fascinating, but why on earth is the hon. Member for Uxbridge raising this issue today?&quot; The reason is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 50WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that bird keepers will potentially be affected by several issues and they feel slightly under pressure, although not under threat. One issue is the Government&#039;s impending Animal Welfare Bill. By and large, it is welcome, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come to it in a minute.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para6"><a name="stpa_240">The other issue, which is connected with many of the points that I have raised, is the threat of avian flu coming to these shores. In the past few weeks, there has been publicity about avian flu, including the case of the infected parrot. There is concern that that will worry the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public and that they will think that every budgie in every front room is potentially a harbinger of doom and that the whole family will be wiped out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para7"><a name="stpa_241">I am therefore grateful to the Government for what they have done and particularly to the Minister, who has taken a very responsible attitude to the issue and who has been sending out the right signals. However, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought that it was possibly the time to raise some of these issues on behalf of bird keepers. The bird-keeping fraternity is divided, although some of its members are very active and able to put their views across, and does not always present a universal front. There is a certain amount of in-fighting and it is difficult to get all of its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members together and establish a common view. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought that this might be the forum in which to get them to understand the problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para8"><a name="stpa_242">An important aspect of bird keeping that is sometimes forgotten is the potential it brings to learn conservation skills. I sometimes have to fill in forms&#151;I am sure you do too, Mr. Cummings&#151;in which I am asked who my political hero is. On the quiet, I must say that I do not have a political hero. If I were to have a hero, he would probably be Gerald Durrell, who would probably be thought of today as politically incorrect. Like me, he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was inclined to be a little overweight, and probably spoke his mind a little too much. In his youth, he went&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out collecting animals for zoos; a lot of his books are about that. After a while, he considered the conservation side of things and realised that there was a need for captive breeding populations. Many of the skills that he learned&#151;I believe that he worked at Whipsnade and, latterly, London zoo&#151;helped him to start up his Jersey zoo, in which he had animals such as the echo parakeet from Mauritius, the pink pigeon and other birds and animals that bred in captivity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para9"><a name="stpa_243">Birds and animals do not breed in captivity if they are just stuck in a cage; they have to be nurtured and studied. Even today, some successful reintroduction schemes rely heavily on the expertise and skills of the people who look after the birds in captivity before releasing them into the wild. Around the world, conservation methods for some species include captive breeding for future release when the habitat is secure.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para10"><a name="stpa_244">A more controversial issue, which came to attention with the focus on avian flu, is that of importing wild caught birds. This is not the time to raise that issue, but it needs to be sorted out. I congratulate the Government again on their stance on what is by and large an EU matter, although the mood is turning towards saying that it is not as necessary to have wild caught birds as it once was. Australia imposed an export ban in the early 1960s, and many species are now bred there in captivity. Indeed, some parrots and parakeets are more common in captivity than in the wild because of captive breeding and the impetus of saying that no more wild stock could

<br>&nbsp;<br>
come in, which made breeders and interested parties realise that that would be it if they did not get their acts together.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para11"><a name="stpa_245">I hear arguments about sustainability being important, which it is, but it is also important that we consider whether some communities in developing countries are more likely to preserve habitats if they are harvesting, so to speak, a species of wild bird there, as with butterflies. I am not sure; I see both sides of the argument.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para12"><a name="stpa_246">The vast majority of people who are interested in aviculture or keeping other species such as reptiles or fish are concerned about animal welfare. The last thing that they want is to see any living creature in distress. Some of the pictures that we see on the news go back some way. It is almost as though they are library photographs. There is an image of awful crowded importers&#039; cages in which birds&#039; heads stick through gaps, but such cages have largely been got rid of. That must still be looked into, although for some time there has been quarantine and people have ensured that things have been done properly. Sadly, that is not so all over the world, but Britain has a pretty good record.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para13"><a name="stpa_247">I mentioned avian flu because this is a good opportunity to reassure people that the real threat is from migratory birds arriving in this country and having contact with domestic poultry or wildfowl. It is unlikely that birds in aviaries or cages will become carriers of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avian flu, although we must be careful of that. The Minister has taken a responsible view. His Department has studied the effect of imports and bird shows, and has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken sensible measures. A few weeks ago, the newspapers got themselves into a panic over aviculture, which worried many people. Although avian flu is a serious matter, we must put it in proportion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para14"><a name="stpa_248">Aviculturists justifiably raise the issue of animal welfare legislation and what these days are called pet fairs&#151;when I was younger, I called them bird shows. Breeders and owners show their birds off, rather like the old fur and feather shows that one sees at county shows. They often last only one day. Selling birds worries some of the animal welfare people. These shows are very valuable for breeders, who can swap birds, get new stock and discuss matters. Things have changed since I kept birds. Up to when I was a student, I never went very far; I lived next door to my mum, who has the original aviary, and that is why I still keep birds. What has changed most is security. In the old days, one could put one&#039;s name and address in a classified ad and did not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to worry. People would come and purchase stock. Now people are worried about theft. There are presumably one or two fanatics who object to people keeping birds in captivity. Therefore, buying and selling stock is more often done at these forums, which is why they are important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para15"><a name="stpa_249">Recently, a popular parrot show was held in Stafford&#151;I see the Minister&#039;s Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), is present. There has been concern about that show in the past. I believe that someone from the Department attended the show and there was a telling veterinary report, which said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;Most of the Parrot Society members stressed the importance of the event as a social event. I also witnessed that much time was spent at the members tables discussing husbandry and feeding 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</ul>



<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 52WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>methodologies. I was accompanied round the show by a veterinary student who was keen to absorb as much knowledge as possible from the many experienced aviculturists present. They all took time to answer her questions even though she always explained that she was not buying. This exchange of knowledge is in my opinion very important, especially when it concerns the rarer species.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para16"><a name="stpa_250">The report goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;My conclusion from the inspection on the day, and reading the terms and conditions applying to the members, is that the show is run with avian welfare having high priority. Any problems identified were rectified immediately.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para17"><a name="stpa_251">The top priority of the people who run these shows is their birds, not just because they like them, but because they are valuable, so it is good common sense. However, it is because they care about them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para18"><a name="stpa_252">What I have said about aviculture is equally true of people who keep reptiles, tropical fish, koi carp, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits or ferrets. I have four ferrets; it is admirable for someone in the Whips Office to have a set of ferrets to protect him at all times. It has always struck me&#151;and there are examples from my constituency&#151;that people keep animals or birds in special schools or in prison. The bird man of Alcatraz&#151;Stroud&#151;wrote the definitive work on bird diseases just from sitting in solitary confinement, keeping birds and looking at them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para19"><a name="stpa_253">There is an important social angle. I know of young people who have got involved in keeping birds, not necessarily through a parent. The joy when they see that the birds have laid eggs, and when, 18 days later, the nestlings come out and must be given different foods, and the birds fledge, sets them up pretty well for life. It gives them a sense of responsibility. That is something in today&#039;s world. We are always talking about that in the context of young people, and it is not a bad thing to show them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para20"><a name="stpa_254">I do not think that the Minister needs to worry too much. The bird-keeping fraternity believes, as I do, that he is a very good Minister, particularly with regard to the present topic&#151;so much so that he appears in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latest issue of the Parrot Society&#039;s magazine. It is an excellent picture, in which he looks particularly dapper. If he would like a copy I am sure that the Parrot Society would be glad to help him.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para21"><a name="stpa_255">I know that it is a very busy time for the Minister, with the Animal Welfare Bill, but I should very much like to bring a small delegation of aviculturists to a short meeting, in which they could put across their view in person. They want to be able to assure people that they have made their voice heard in Government.

</p>

<a name="51108h03_time1"><h5>12.47 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51108h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Mr. Ben Bradshaw) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randall) on securing the debate and commend his constructive and informative speech. He is a living example of the lack of contradiction between an interest in observing and enjoying wild birds and an interest in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keeping birds. He is right to point out that bird keeping is a legitimate and old human practice, dating back at least as far as the Egyptians, and probably further.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para22"><a name="stpa_256">The Government estimate that about 2 million people in this country keep birds, and they get great pleasure from it. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, bird 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 53WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
keeping has therapeutic and social benefits. Many birds thrive in captivity better than they do in the wild. Some live longer, and there can be conservation benefits. Some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;species that are rare in the wild have become common in captivity, and aviculture, as the hon. Gentleman also pointed out, has pioneered ways of breeding that are now used to boost the numbers of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several endangered species. Captive breeding by hobbyists, such as the hon. Gentleman, has reduced the need to import wild caught birds.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para23"><a name="stpa_257">The hon. Gentleman alluded to the debate about the whole trade in wild birds, which I am sure will continue and in which I hope he will play a leading role, as the European Union must reach a decision on whether to extend its import ban. It is right to point out that there are two sides to the argument. The point is made in some quarters&#151;including the United Nations convention on international trade in endangered species&#151;that for many of the poorest communities in the world as long as the birds are being harvested sustainably they are an important source of income. The trade in some of those places is an incentive to conserve a valuable resource. However, I am sure that we shall return to the debate and that the hon. Gentleman, with his expertise, will play a leading part in it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para24"><a name="stpa_258">The main job of Government is to ensure that the welfare and conservation of birds will not be jeopardised and to prevent the spread of avian flu between birds or from birds to humans. The Animal Welfare Bill, which was introduced in the House of Commons last month, should help to ensure that the welfare needs of birds kept in captivity in this country are met. As the hon. Gentleman said, the vast majority of owners, who love their birds and care for them diligently, have nothing to fear from the Bill. However, a small number do not come up to scratch, and the Bill will help allay the fears of those animal rights fundamentalists who believe that it is intrinsically cruel to keep birds; we believe that they have nothing to worry about.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para25"><a name="stpa_259">I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Animal Welfare Bill is not about banning anything; it is about increasing welfare. If he is interested, I hope that he will be fortunate enough to secure a place on the Committee that considers the Bill when it eventually comes before the House; his expertise will be a great help to the Committee.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para26"><a name="stpa_260">We have no intention of banning the keeping of particular species, either in the Bill or in secondary legislation. The Bill should not ban anything unless an incontrovertible case can be made that an activity is intrinsically cruel, and we have no evidence to suggest that bird keeping or bird showing, as he described it, is cruel. However, the Government are considering whether more protection should be given on conservation grounds to some of the world&#039;s most endangered species.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para27"><a name="stpa_261">As the hon. Gentleman will know, article 8.2 of the EC regulation that implements CITES provides for member states to prohibit the holding of endangered species, particularly live specimens of the most endangered species. The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight), launched a public consultation in July to seek views on the option to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
regulate the holding of certain species subject to control under CITES. That concluded on 31 October, and the results are still being considered.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para28"><a name="stpa_262">The Animal Welfare Bill should help to clarify some of the controversy surrounding pet and bird fairs to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I was sorry not to be able to attend the parrot show in Staffordshire. It was held on a Sunday, and as a busy Minister and constituency MP, my Sundays are particularly precious, but I hope to attend a similar show in future. However, John Bourne, the head of my animal welfare team who is leading on the Bill, was there, and it may have been his report that the hon. Gentleman cited.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para29"><a name="stpa_263">I would be happy to meet a delegation from the Parrot Society UK to discuss some of its fears. The hon. Gentleman is right that there are some well organised and well funded non-governmental organisations; he is right also that those who keep birds tend to be quiet individuals who are not used to coming together to agitate or to organise political activity. It would be useful to hear their views before considering the relevant provisions in Committee.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para30"><a name="stpa_264">The Government do not have any evidence that bird and pet fairs are intrinsically incapable of providing for the welfare needs of the animals in question. The hon. Gentleman eloquently outlined some of the potential benefits of fairs. People are nervous about putting small ads in papers, especially for reasons of security given the high value of some birds, and such gatherings allow the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange of information; indeed, if our proposals go through, they will be able to license birds. Licensing will be welcomed by most of the organisations that run such events; it would help deal with potential welfare problems, especially in organisations that are not so well run.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para31"><a name="stpa_265">Naturally, future proposals made under the Animal Welfare Bill will be made through secondary legislation. Such instruments will be subject to full public consultation and approval by both Houses. Again, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the hon. Gentleman will play a leading role in those deliberations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para32"><a name="stpa_266">The hon. Gentleman was also right&#151;I am glad that he welcomed this&#151;to highlight the recent temporary EU ban on gatherings like bird fairs and the import of wild-caught birds on health grounds in the context of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avian influenza. I was grateful for his considered response, and I hope that he will continue to be involved in the dialogue on whether a ban is justified and, if so, for how long. It is important when making such decisions that the Government take account of the views of the organisations and hobbyists that he speaks for&#151;I hope that he will continue to do so&#151;as we weigh up the animal and bird risk, and the human health risk associated with avian flu. The ban will be reviewed again next month. However, that does not affect the Government&#039;s long-term proposals for the licensing of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bird fairs or our long-term policy on the import of wild-caught birds. I suspect that the hon. Member for Uxbridge is absolutely right to say that there is currently a shift of opinion on the import of wild-caught birds. In a way, the avian flu outbreak is a diversion from the issues that he raised on conservation and ethical matters, which have helped to spark a debate that will continue as we reconsider the ban in the weeks ahead.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h03_para33"><a name="stpa_267">The hon. Gentleman will know that another result of the discovery of highly pathogenic avian flu at the quarantine facility in Essex has been an independent review of Britain&#039;s quarantine procedures. That was a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensible measure and has raised questions about quarantine procedures, including the practice, for example, of mixing species of birds. Perhaps we should do more to separate species in quarantine. Of course, that is a hypothetical matter at the moment because the import ban is in place, and no birds are being imported. However, were the import ban lifted, we would have to be satisfied that the quarantine procedures are robust and are being correctly implemented and enforced. That investigation is continuing and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has assured the House that she will keep hon. Members updated as and when information comes to light.

<a name="51108h03_para34"><a name="stpa_268">I hope that the hon. Member for Uxbridge will take part in future discussions on the ethical, health and conservation considerations of the international trade in wild birds. Mr Cummings, I would be happy to have the coverage of my activities in the Parrot Society&#039;s magazine mentioned by the hon. Gentleman for Uxbridge. If you have not already seen it, Mr Cummings, I commend a recent profile of the hon. Member for Uxbridge in <i>Cage and Aviary Birds</i>, which was a charming report of both the hon. Gentleman and his mother. There is a picture of him beside his aviary and a picture, I assume, of one of his birds. That report demonstrates nicely the pleasure and sense of responsibility that is derived from keeping birds. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter, and I hope that I have been able to reassure him about some of the concerns that he expressed about the potential impact of the Animal Welfare Bill, the current debate on the import of wild birds and the in many cases unfounded fears of the public about avian flu.

<a name="51108h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Artists&#039; Resale Rights</h3>

<a name="time_15">
<a name="51108h04_time0"><h5>12.58 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51108h04_spnew0"><b> Chris Bryant  (Rhondda)</b>  (Lab): I am delighted to be able to begin the debate rather early. The artist&#039;s resale right has barely been discussed in the House over the last few years, but it will radically alter parts of the British art market. It is a great shame that, until now, we have not had a full opportunity to debate the matter. Indeed, when the Government eventually bring forward their measure, it will probably be in the form of a statutory instrument, which will be debated for an hour and a half in a Committee Room, with no opportunity to amend it. That often happens with European legislation as we incorporate it into British law. I hope that, one day, there will be a half-way house&#151;a third way&#151;between primary and secondary legislation so that we do not have to go through the full three readings process for European legislation, but have a fuller means of exploring issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para0"><a name="stpa_269">I support the concept of an artist&#039;s resale right, although I understand that others disagree. It is important to set the artist&#039;s resale right within the broader context of the art market in the UK. The Government estimated in 2001 that, as of 1999, the UK art market was worth &#163;3,467 million. In France, for the same year, it was estimated that their total art market was worth about &#163;2,115 million. It is probable that, since those figures were arrived at, the British art market has grown somewhat. Latest estimates put the worth of the market in the region of &#163;4.5 billion. Therefore it makes up a significant part of the British economy. It is also a significant employer. There are about 9,500 art dealers and 750 auction houses. Last year&#039;s labour force survey suggested that there are 148,700 artists in the United Kingdom, although that figure probably includes commercial artists and graphic designers. A more conservative estimate is that the UK has 85,000 to 90,000 working artists.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para1"><a name="stpa_270">Many of those artists are partly employed and partly self-employed. The art industry drives many other industries, such as the newspaper and magazine industry, the graphic design industry and a whole series of others. The pure artist&#151;the person whom we might identify with an easel and brush&#151;is still instrumental in ensuring the creative innovation of British industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para2"><a name="stpa_271">It is important that we bear down on some important misconceptions early on in this debate. The first misconception is shared by many people; namely, that artists are wealthy. It is all too easy to see Tracey Emin sell her unmade bed for &#163;150,000 or her slippers for &#163;5,500 and think that artists are doing pretty well.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para3"><a name="stpa_272">Incidentally, Sarah Lucas, another artist who sold her unmade bed as a work of art, once viewed my flat in the east end of London. She offered me less for the flat than she would probably have offered for the bed, had I left it unmade before she came to view it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para4"><a name="stpa_273">In February, Lucien Freud&#039;s portrait of Kate Moss fetched &#163;3.9 million at Christie&#039;s. Damien Hirst&#039;s pickled shark fetched &#163;6.5 million. It is therefore easy for the general public to think that British artists are doing pretty well. Those examples are the tip of a formaldehyde iceberg&#151;they represent one tenth of 1 per cent. of UK art sales. The artists who are coining it are a very small minority. In fact, average contemporary art

<br>&nbsp;<br>
sale prices in 2002&#151;the most recent year for which figures are available&#151;were &#163;382 for a painting or drawing, &#163;198 for a photographic print, &#163;293 for a sculpture and &#163;163 for a limited-edition print. It is good to know that art is accessible to more people in terms of cost than people might think from the figures paid for Damien Hirst pieces. The truth is that half of all drawings and watercolours sold in the UK in 2002 sold for less than &#163;500. Some 43.8 per cent. of all art sales in the UK are for less than &#8364;1,000.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para5"><a name="stpa_274">During my speech, I shall switch between euros and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pounds with rather unnecessary frequency. For that I apologise, Mr. Cummings. The European directive speaks about sale prices in euros, and the Government will end up speaking about sale prices in euros on the matter, so I must sometimes refer to prices in euros, because I have not converted all my figures from pounds to euros. An aspiration may be contained therein for the future of the British economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para6"><a name="stpa_275">Many artists, even ones who are relatively well known and who may have been established for several years, earn extremely small amounts of money from the sale of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their work. Forty per cent. of artists in the United Kingdom earn less than &#163;5,000 per annum. That is below the minimum wage. Many are half employed and half self-employed, so that figure is not regularly in the public domain. None the less, we should bear it in mind.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para7"><a name="stpa_276">The second misconception that I wish to abolish is that the artist&#039;s resale right will destroy the art market in the United Kingdom. When I was a member of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previous Parliament, we did a report on the British art market. Some of the outlandish remarks made by both the auction houses and the dealers suggested that the resale right would be the end of the British art market. No, it will not. For a start, the Government have managed to secure a whole series of exemptions, which will mean that the Commission&#039;s original proposals for an artist&#039;s resale right will not be as onerous as people first thought.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para8"><a name="stpa_277">For a start, there will be a cap of &#8364;12,500 on the amount of royalty that an artist can earn from a work of art, so there is little likelihood of someone choosing to sell a British work of art in the United States or in Switzerland. That was one of the arguments advanced by the auction houses; that someone wanting to sell a Damien Hirst would decide to sell it in Switzerland or the US, where there is no artist&#039;s resale right. I do not believe that to be true, although people sometimes have a nexus of different reasons for believing that a work of art will sell best in a particular country. The owner of a work of art may choose to sell a &#163;6.9 million work in the place where it is likely to achieve its highest price. That may be the US, but the &#8364;12,500 cap is unlikely to be the major factor that determines whether an owner sells the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work in this country or elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para9"><a name="stpa_278">The second exemption that the Government have secured is that no royalty will be payable when art galleries buy a work directly from the artist and resell it within three years for less than &#8364;10,000. Again, that is because a large part of the British art market is selling works of art for considerably less than &#8364;10,000, which is roughly &#163;6,500. That ensures that the impact on the high end of the art market will be pretty minimal. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 58WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Significantly, the Government secured a derogation, which member states can implement, whereby the right will not apply to deceased artists&#039; estates until 2010.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para10"><a name="stpa_279">My concern is for the artists who are arriving on the art scene today, particularly for struggling artists whose income stream is difficult at the best of times, and not primarily for the estates of those who have already died. This row has already gone on in France, Germany and Italy. The derogation, however, gives the Government an opportunity before 2010 to review how the artist&#039;s resale right has worked in operation in the UK before going back to the Commission and discussing further possible changes to the resale right in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para11"><a name="stpa_280">The most important reason why the artist&#039;s resale right will not destroy the art market in the UK is that only about 2 per cent. of the total value of the UK art market&#151;a tiny fraction&#151;relates to the resale of the works of living artists. Even if all the works by deceased artists were included&#151;only another 8 per cent.&#151;that would be only a tenth of the whole art market in the UK, so I suggest that some of the comments of the galleries and the auction houses have been exaggerations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para12"><a name="stpa_281">The third misconception is that a strong UK art market depends primarily on a wholly unregulated market. I shall not talk about the regulation of auction houses because we know all about the problems that the auctions houses have got into over unfair trading in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past few years. More important, the strength of the UK art market relies on the vibrancy, innovation, imaginative quality and strength of the artists&#039; community that underlies it. In other words, it relies on the artists who are making new works of art.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para13"><a name="stpa_282">It is not good enough for us to rely simply on selling Eduardo Paolozzis and Francis Bacons&#151;the great British artists of the recent past. We must have a modern, contemporary art culture if we are to have a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong art market. We will have strengthened the whole of the British art market rather than weakened it if we can ensure a stream of income to artists who are alive today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para14"><a name="stpa_283">The artist&#039;s resale right is likely to clean up some of the dodgy cash-based transactions of some of the UK art dealers about which witnesses told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee last year. That is because artists, who have a financial interest in the resale of their works and will be following their fate with a keen eye when they appear for resale at dealers and auction houses. Furthermore, dealers will have to produce an audit trail and invoices for works of art by contemporary artists. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspect, therefore, that some of the less savoury practices in the art market will be cleaned up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para15"><a name="stpa_284">The Government issued a consultation paper earlier in the year, suggesting that derogations would enable them to introduce a threshold of anything up to &#8364;3,000. That is the point at which the artist&#039;s resale right would kick in and it would be in line with the European directive. However, I believe that we should apply the simple principle of helping as many artists as possible without making the royalty too bureaucratically burdensome to apply. The &#8364;3,000 threshold is too high to help the vast majority of artists. The threshold is set at &#8364;50 in Germany, &#8364;150 in Spain, &#8364;200 in France and &#8364;1,000 in Italy and Ireland. With the Government suggesting that it should be &#8364;3,000, we are sticking out like a sore thumb.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 59WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para16"><a name="stpa_285">Lowering the threshold will not drive sales abroad. The honest truth is that the royalty on a work that resells in the UK for &#8364;1,000 would come in at the princely sum of &#163;27&#151;far less than the cost of packing, shipping or insuring the work, let alone the cost of the complex legal arrangements that may have to be made for it to be sold in the United States of America or Switzerland. We should therefore lower the threshold from &#8364;3,000 to &#8364;1,000.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para17"><a name="stpa_286">Lowering the threshold to &#8364;1,000, as opposed to the German or French levels of &#8364;50 or &#8364;200, would also be proportionate, because that would not impose too heavy a bureaucratic administrative burden on industry. It is estimated that lowering the threshold will bring an extra 72 per cent. of British artists into the scheme. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply ask the Minister&#151;I hope that he will reply in what, for me, is an optimistic way&#151;whether it would not be right to support the many, rather than just the few.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para18"><a name="stpa_287">A classic instance that springs to mind relates to my constituency. A Conservative Member recently asked me what this debate would be about, and when I told him, he said, &quot;I am sure that they talk of nothing else in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Rhondda but the artist&#039;s resale right.&quot; Well, the Rhondda group of artists comprised Glyn Morgan from Pontypridd, who was born in 1926 and who is still alive; Charles Burton, from Treherbert, who was born in 1929 and who is also still alive; and, perhaps most notably, Ernest Zobole, who died in 1999 and who was from Ystrad in the Rhondda. The group was very active; indeed, the two remaining members are still active. However, the vast majority of their works of art would not be caught by the &#8364;3,000 threshold, but only by the &#8364;1,000 threshold.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para19"><a name="stpa_288">I want the Government&#151;preferably this afternoon, and certainly soon&#151;to say that the work of artists such as Charles Burton, Glyn Morgan and Ernest Zobole will be subject to royalty rights under the artist&#039;s resale right because the threshold will be lowered to &#8364;1,000. The Minister might like to know that Charles Burton&#039;s work &quot;Rhondda Bridge&quot; is currently for sale for &#163;1,650 at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Tinney Gallery in Cardiff. I am sure that the family will be delighted to have some artist&#039;s resale rights if it is sold.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para20"><a name="stpa_289">Let me now say a couple of words about the legislative process. The Select Committee made recommendations earlier this year. We thought that the threshold should be lowered to &#8364;1,000. The Government responded in the summer, saying that it welcomed

</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para21"><a name="stpa_290">I hope that the Committee&#039;s views will help the Government&#039;s assessment in the direction of &#8364;1,000.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para22"><a name="stpa_291">Legislators tend to do remarkably little for visual artists. The nature of their work as painters, sculptors, potters or photographers means, quite often, that they work alone. Unlike singers, authors, musicians and composers, they have had few organisations to fight their corner. Remarkably little has been done to secure their economic and moral rights as artists since Michelangelo completed first the ceiling and then &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine chapel in 1541.

suite is perhaps a fait accompli, but it was first introduced in France in only 1920 for auction houses alone. It was a vital step, and I hope that we shall enact it as a fully progressive measure, helping the many and not just the few, as soon as possible.

<a name="51108h04_time1"><h5>1.15 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_71"><a name="51108h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hugo Swire  (East Devon)</b>  (Con): I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryant) for having secured this debate and for allowing me in on it, and to the Minister for agreeing to that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para23"><a name="stpa_292">It is worth making a couple of points. The hon. Gentleman spoke about some of the concessions obtained by the British Government during negotiations. It should be pointed out that one of the principal concessions was when they tried to stop the implementation of a lower threshold. The hon. Gentleman is arguing against everything that the Government have succeeded in doing over a period of five years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para24"><a name="stpa_293">The Design and Artists Copyright Society has mounted an extensive lobbying campaign, and not an unsuccessful one, it would appear. Quite frankly, however, there is nothing to change anyone&#039;s mind. Lord Sainsbury of Turville reminded the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, of which the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Gentleman was then a member, that the administrative costs of imposing the limit of below &#8364;3,000 become an absurdly high proportion of the actual payments to artists. That is the seminal point, and nothing I have heard this afternoon has led me to change my mind.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para25"><a name="stpa_294">The British Art Market Foundation has estimated that the total collection and distribution costs involved if the levy were extended to sales of &#8364;1,000, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman, would come to more than twice the amount received by the artist. The Government have made much of their policy of reducing the burden of costs and administration on business, and it would be entirely consistent were the Minister to resist the hon. Gentleman&#039;s cause.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para26"><a name="stpa_295">Clearly, it would be absurd to involve the thousands of small businesses that make up our successful art&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market in a bureaucratic paper chase that would produce only tiny amounts of money for a small minority of artists. Interestingly enough, the hon. Gentleman will note that an independent survey commissioned by the Government found that the work of only 189 British artists was sold for more than &#8364;1,000 in auctions over a one-year period. That is worth noting.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para27"><a name="stpa_296">Secondly, the Government have known the details of the resale right directive for more than five years. However, less than two months before it is due to be brought into effect the Government have not published their legislation. The artists&#039; resale right has never been imposed on an art market the size of the UK&#039;s, which accounts for more than half the entire European art market. How can that market, which is so vital in this country for all artists of any sort, make the preparations needed if it does not have the details?

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para28"><a name="stpa_297">It is always interesting when we have an artistic debate. We have had colour and texture from my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), and style and form from the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire). We have been treated to some interesting byways of formaldehyde icebergs and dodgy dealers. However, the substance of our debate is crucial to the development of the art market in the UK, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend has highlighted that important issue. I congratulate him on securing the debate, which is especially significant as we are nearing the end of the process to reach a decision and implement the resale right in the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para29"><a name="stpa_298">The UK has a thriving and prosperous art market that makes a major contribution to the economy. In 2001, the UK art and antiques market was worth around &#163;4.4 billion, split roughly 50:50 between auctioneers and dealers. With 25 per cent. of the world market total, the UK market is second only in size to the US and employs 28,000 full-time and 9,000 part-time staff. The Government are determined that it should continue to flourish.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para30"><a name="stpa_299">Of course, there would be no art market without the creativity of artists, and the Government recognise the contribution that they make to the UK&#039;s cultural identity. Art, in all its forms, improves and enriches our daily lives. Visual art is an increasingly significant part of everything we do; it spans a huge range of activity from painting to photography. Art is one of the creative activities that, according to economic estimates produced in August last year, accounted for a significant 8 per cent. of the UK&#039;s gross domestic product in 2002.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para31"><a name="stpa_300">As my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda said, the majority of member states have indicated that they will adopt a threshold below &#8364;3,000&#151;indeed &#8364;1,000 for many. However, other member states do not generally have as successful an art market as we do, which is why we need to consider the issue carefully before reaching a decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para32"><a name="stpa_301">In implementing the directive on artists&#039; resale rights, we must strike an appropriate balance between artists and those selling their work. We aim to introduce a workable scheme that will benefit artists without damaging the strong position of the UK art market. We are particularly concerned that the framework should minimise any risk that sales might be diverted to countries such as Switzerland and the USA where the right does not exist.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para33"><a name="stpa_302">When negotiating the directive, the Government secured a significant number of concessions to reduce the risk of damage to the UK market. The first key concession is the imposition of a cap of &#8364;12,500 on the total royalty payable on any transaction. The original proposal contained no cap.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para34"><a name="stpa_303">The second concession is the derogation under which the UK is entitled to delay the application of the resale right to works by deceased artists until 2010&#151;that date can be extended to 2012. We intend to make full use of that derogation to allow the art market time to adjust to the introduction of the resale right. The UK will apply resale royalties only to the works of living artists from 2006. From 2010, resale royalties will have to be paid on sales of eligible works by deceased artists. The UK may, at this time, make a case to the Commission for the derogation to be extended to 2012.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para35"><a name="stpa_304">The final key concession is an obligation on the European Commission to enter negotiations to make compulsory the relevant article of the Berne convention&#151;an important international convention that sets out the worldwide copyright framework. Such a change would require countries such as the USA and Switzerland to introduce the resale right. To date, such attempts have not succeeded: both countries have said that they do not intend to introduce the right at this time, and the World Intellectual Property Organisation does not consider it a priority. We will continue to press for the international adoption of a resale right, but without any great hope of that happening in the near future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para36"><a name="stpa_305">The concessions dictated by the final form of the directive are crucial. However, other matters about which we have heard today are also critical to the impact of the directive in the UK. To make certain that we maximise the value to artists without undermining the art market, it will be necessary to make the right decisions on two matters on which the directive permits us some flexibility. Today&#039;s debate has allowed us to explore those issues in some detail and has given me an opportunity to set out some of the relevant factors that the Government are carefully considering.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para37"><a name="stpa_306">The first important decision concerns the collective management of resale royalties. The directive allows members states to provide for collective management of resale royalties and to make such management compulsory. The arguments for collective management are threefold: it will secure greater compliance, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally considered to be relatively secure and it is more efficient, particularly through the lowering of administrative costs. Evidence submitted before and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during consultation indicates that costs will be significantly reduced if the right is collectively managed. The main argument against compulsory collective management is that it removes the artist&#039;s choice to administer the right independently. Independent collection may be preferable for some artists who have strong links with particular galleries that sell their works. Compulsory collective management of rights does not generally apply in UK copyright law. We would therefore also need to be sure that such a requirement for artists&#039; resale rights would not set an unwelcome precedent in any other area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para38"><a name="stpa_307">The second crucial decision is whether the UK should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adopt a threshold of &#8364;3,000 or lower for the payment of royalties. Setting the threshold lower would considerably increase the number of artists who would&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benefit from the introduction of resale right. A recent study found that 37 per cent. of artists earn less than &#163;5,000 per year, which means that almost 50 per cent. of all artists and visual creators fail to earn a reasonable living from their art. That percentage is significantly higher among certain groups, for example painters and sculptors. That is part of the background to the decision made in 2003 by the Arts Council of England to give more priority to assisting individuals. That new policy showed a marked shift away from the Arts Council&#039;s earlier policy of awarding grant funding to arts institutions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para39"><a name="stpa_308">The position of some artists at the lower end of the income scale is still not secure. That is why many artists are watching very closely to see what decision we make on the threshold. Our decision could make a real difference to their incomes and livelihoods. However, we

<br>&nbsp;<br>
must be sure that the decision on the threshold does not increase the number of sales at risk of diversion to overseas markets. We have had some very helpful information from stakeholders to help us to determine whether sales of artworks below the &#8364;3,000 threshold might be diverted to other countries. Indeed, the consensus is that the lower threshold of &#8364;1,000 will not significantly damage the art market by driving sales abroad. We believe that the costs of relocating a sale overseas will generally outweigh any royalty payable under artists&#039; resale rights.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para40"><a name="stpa_309">It may be helpful if I give an example. A work of art sold for &#8364;1,000&#151; approximately &#163;700&#151;will generate a royalty for the artist of about &#163;28 if the resale right is at a rate of 4 per cent. That figure will generally be far less than the cost of packing, shipping and insuring the work in order to sell it in another country. We must consider the fact that royalty payments on works selling for less than &#8364;3,000 would be very small. The &#163;28 on a &#8364;1,000 sale may not make an enormous difference to an artist. Against that we must weigh the administrative burden placed on dealers and auctioneers to process the payments. The administration cost to businesses may be significant compared with the benefit to the individual artist. In particular, we must consider the impact on smaller dealers and auction houses.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para41"><a name="stpa_310">We have recently received up-to-date information on the number of artists who would benefit and the costs of administration. Those figures are being analysed to assess the balance between the costs and the benefits that have been so ably presented to us by my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Rhondda and the hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Devon. Both decisions are being made in the light of the helpful responses to the Government&#039;s public consultation exercise on draft implementing regulations, which was undertaken earlier this year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h04_para42"><a name="stpa_311">The formal consultation process has been supplemented by a number of informative discussions with the art trade and those representing artists. Today&#039;s debate has been a useful additional opportunity to hear some of the views that we know must inform our decisions. We expect the draft regulation setting out our proposed framework for artists&#039; resale rights in the UK to be laid before Parliament in the very near future. As this is an entirely new concept in the UK, and resale right has never before been applied to a market as large as the UK, we will monitor its impact following introduction. We will commission further research to compare with that undertaken before the right is in place. That will provide us with information to feed into the commission&#039;s review of the directive, which is scheduled to take place in 2009.

<a name="51108h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Planning System (Local Councillors)</h3>

<a name="time_18">
<a name="51108h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51108h05_spnew0"><b> Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b>  (LD): It is good to have the opportunity this afternoon to raise a subject that is prompted by an individual constituency case, but is of much wider interest to all those involved in local government. To put the matter in context, one of my concerns is that many local councillors feel increasingly powerless. Even if they have been on the council for some time, there are various background trends that make individual local councillors feel that they have less power and influence than they once had.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para0"><a name="stpa_313">I suspect that there is a general trend among central Governments of all parties to want to take powers from local government and to constrain what local councillors can do. The move to a cabinet system of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local government, which we have in south Gloucestershire, is great for those in the cabinet, but many back-bench councillors feel that they have very little say and involvement&#151;that they are lobby fodder and somewhat peripheral to what is going on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para1"><a name="stpa_314">The one thing that councillors can be, and seek to be, and often get elected to be, is a champion for their community. Planning is one area in which they can try to exercise that function. It is important to say at the outset that it is proper and right for a local councillor to try to influence a planning process on behalf of the people he or she represents. As the Nolan Committee&#039;s third report says, at paragraph 288:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;It is essential for the proper operation of the planning system that local concerns are adequately ventilated. The most effective and suitable way that this can be done is via the local elected representatives, the councillors themselves.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para2"><a name="stpa_315">I am sure that the Minister agrees with that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para3"><a name="stpa_316">The question then arises whether that is what is happening, or whether the genuine, legitimate concerns to ensure that planning is done properly have been taken too far and constrained the legitimate democratic acts of local councillors in their attempts to represent their own community. The latter is the case in at least one respect&#151;the consequences, which may not have been intended by the drafters, of the Local Government Act 2000 for the way in which councillors are involved in planning decisions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para4"><a name="stpa_317">The example that I want to give&#151;I shall give the details of a particular case in a moment&#151;is of a councillor who is on a planning committee when a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning application is submitted that relates to their ward. The councillor to whom I shall refer later happened to be the chair of the planning committee, although that is not particularly relevant. Under the 2000 Act, in practice councillors have to make a choice. They can be on the planning committee and cast their vote, but can express no real opinion throughout the entire planning application process; they must sit as sober as a judge when the arguments are presented at the meeting, weigh them up, and come to their so-called independent decision. Alternatively, they can say, &quot;To hell with that&#151;I know exactly what I think about this application and I know what my constituents think about it. No way am I going to keep my mouth shut for the next three, six or nine months. I am going to speak out, knowing that I then cannot vote and cannot be part of the discussions on that application.&quot; In the jargon that is called fettering discretion.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 65WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para5"><a name="stpa_318">Immediately, that becomes a problem; I have come across councillors who have been vilified for sitting on the fence. I am sure that the Minister has also come across that. If a councillor is on the planning committee and people in his or her ward say, &quot;This is a terrible application; it would be dreadful for local people&quot;, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;councillor has to say, &quot;I cannot say anything.&quot; Technically, they can say, &quot;Well yes, I have concerns about this, but obviously I am not going to make my decision until the meeting&quot;, but if there is any sniff that they have made their mind up beforehand, the applicant can appeal, can go to the Standards Board, or can go to the local government ombudsman. Councillors are therefore incredibly nervous about expressing an opinion. That leads councillors to be vilified&#151;I have seen it happen. Also, bizarrely, it leads constituents to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go to the opposition party&#151;whichever party it might&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&#151;because its councillors are under no such constraint and will gladly slag off the planning application. It is a strange situation, in which the person whom the people elected to represent them cannot speak, but the person whom they did not elect can speak. That does not seem right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para6"><a name="stpa_319">However, it gets worse. If a councillor lives in the ward affected by the planning application, the rules say that if that councillor has a personal and prejudicial interest, he or she cannot even speak. Not only can they not vote, or be part of the discussion, they cannot even speak. In other words, the councillor has fewer rights to come along and say their piece than a citizen in their ward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para7"><a name="stpa_320">What is a personal and prejudicial interest? Under the local authorities&#039; code of conduct 2001, it is defined as follows


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;a member with a personal interest in a matter also has a prejudicial interest in that matter if the interest is one which a member of the public with knowledge of the relevant facts would reasonably regard as so significant that it is likely to prejudice the member&#039;s judgement of the public interest.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para8"><a name="stpa_321">Those rules are being applied too tightly; the judgment has to be that the application clouds their judgment so much that they can no longer discern the difference between their interests and the public interest, which may, of course, completely coincide.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para9"><a name="stpa_322">It is not just me who says that the pendulum of prohibition has swung too far, so that it is a kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gagging order on local councillors. Earlier this year, the Committee on Standards in Public Life published a report, in which recommendation 28 stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;In planning decisions the ability of elected members to represent constituents&#039; interests where they have personal and prejudicial interests has been unnecessarily diminished.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para10"><a name="stpa_323">The recommendation was spot on. The point that I want the Minister to reflect on is that it continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;This should be changed to give any elected member the right to speak (but not vote) for their constituents at a planning committee meeting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provided&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para11"><a name="stpa_324">and it then gave three perfectly reasonable conditions. The first is that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;a declaration of personal interest is made&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para12"><a name="stpa_325">the second is that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;the representations are made in an open and transparent manner&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 66WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para13"><a name="stpa_326">and the third is that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;the member making the representations&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. withdraws at the completion of their representations.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para14"><a name="stpa_327">At least councillors can say their piece openly. Everybody knows that if they are affected they ought to be able to do that. Technically, there is a discretionary waiver of those rules, which I will come on to. However, that is the problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para15"><a name="stpa_328">The Standards Board for England consulted on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code of conduct and made recommendations to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister just a couple of months ago. I want to highlight two. Recommending changes in the code of conduct, the Standards Board said first:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">&quot;The Code needs to empower members as community advocates to take the lead on issues where their expertise is greatest and speak out on behalf of their own communities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para16"><a name="stpa_329">I am sure that that must be right. Secondly, the board said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">&quot;The rules around personal and prejudicial interests should be clearer, especially for members who sit on more than one public body.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para17"><a name="stpa_330">The suggestion is that the rules have gone too far and that they are unclear. They certainly need looking at.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para18"><a name="stpa_331">I want to highlight one specific case in illustration, which involves a councillor in my constituency, Alan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bracey. We have a unitary authority; no other councillors represent his area. It is a one-member ward. That is significant, because if it was a three-member ward we could largely get round the problem. The one on the planning committee could keep their mouth shut and the other ward councillors could weigh in, making it clear what they thought. In a one-member ward, that cannot be done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para19"><a name="stpa_332">The area is also semi-rural and the ward is, roughly speaking, the village. In other words, if someone is a ward councillor and lives at the heart of the ward, as is preferable, the chances are that they will be affected by a planning application in that ward. If it has broad impact on the ward as a whole, it is quite difficult not to be affected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para20"><a name="stpa_333">I will not go into great detail about the application, but basically Network Rail wanted to cut down huge swathes of trees to make the tracks safe. A lot of local people were unhappy, including Councillor Bracey. For 12 months, he fettered his discretion, stepped out of the chair of the planning committee, did not vote, but spoke out powerfully and gained some significant concessions. However, he has now been told that because he lives 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yd away from some of the trees, he has a personal and prejudicial interest&#151;if he has, he always did, but he has only now been given the advice&#151;and should not even speak. That feels wrong, and it was not the intention of the legislation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para21"><a name="stpa_334">Councillor Bracey can apply to the standards committee of his local authority for dispensation to speak. However, it will get its legal advice from the same council&#039;s legal advisors who have told him that he should not speak: in effect, it will be an appeal to the person who turned him down. The worry is that that does not provide him with the freedom to go along and speak. Obviously, that is a specific case, but there is a wider issue. As I said, the pendulum has swung too far.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para22"><a name="stpa_335">I want to draw the contrast between the situation for councillors and that for Members of this House. Issues of personal, prejudicial and pecuniary interest apply to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 67WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
us, but the rules are very different. We are governed by the code of conduct for Members and accompanying guide to the rules, and, to paraphrase section 76(1) of that guide, Members may not initiate proceedings in cases in which they have a relevant interest, but may otherwise speak freely on matters that relate to the affairs and interests of a body from which they receive a pecuniary benefit&#151;so it is possible for them to be paid&#151;provided that the benefit is properly registered. Paragraph 70 of the guide to the rules states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">&quot;For the purpose of taking part in any division&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is sufficient for the relevant interest to be disclosed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para23"><a name="stpa_336">So not only can Members speak; they can vote on matters in which they have a personal, prejudicial, pecuniary interest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para24"><a name="stpa_337">Why is that rule good enough for us and not for councillors? I have a sense that it is because we are hon. Members. We would not bend the rules or lobby inappropriately, whereas I do not know what the assumption is about our councillor colleagues, but somehow they need tight rules. As for us, who pass the laws of the land, as long as things are in the book and everyone knows, we can pretty much do what we like. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exaggerate slightly, but there is a great inconsistency, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s comments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para25"><a name="stpa_338">Councillors are in an uncertain position. My hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) asked the Deputy Prime Minister in 2003 if he would


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44">&quot;make it his policy to allow councillors on planning committees to make public statements on planning applications.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para26"><a name="stpa_339">That is the kind of thing that we are discussing. The Minister&#039;s predecessor, the present Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, set out the legal framework and then said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45">&quot;Ultimately it is for individual members to decide how they conduct themselves in carrying out official duties, including whether to make public statements&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>18 March 2003; Vol. 401, c. 742W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para27"><a name="stpa_340">In a sense, therefore, it is up to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para28"><a name="stpa_341">My worry is that councillors are now frightened of tripping over the rules. They are frightened of being taken to the Standards Board for England. There is concern about over-use of the board, maliciously or by people who did not get the outcome that they wanted. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talk to councillors and ask them to speak out, but they say, &quot;I can&#039;t say anything before the meeting, because if I do I will not be seen to be unbiased.&quot; The public do not understand that. I have come across too many cases in which councillors must either be completely straight with their constituents, explaining that they cannot express an opinion at all, or they give a coded message, along the lines of &quot;I can&#039;t really say, but you know me.&quot; It should not be like that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para29"><a name="stpa_342">I will not labour the point. My feeling, and the feeling of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#151;and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that the Local Government Association has similar concerns&#151;is that a well-meaning attempt to make sure that there is probity in the planning system, as there should be, and that cases are decided on their merit, has resulted in community representatives feeling disempowered, the community feeling that they do not represent them, and local democracy not being properly served.

<p>
<a name="51108h05_para30"><a name="stpa_343">I do not expect an instant decision from the Minister, but it would be helpful to receive a suggestion of the response that the Department is likely to give to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submission on changes to the code of conduct made to it by the Standards Board for England in September 2005, and, more generally, some indication that the Department is willing to consider again whether things have gone too far and we are unnecessarily shackling the ability of councillors to represent their communities&#039; concerns.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51108h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Cummings. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Webb) on securing the chance to raise the issue, in general and on behalf of his constituents. It is clearly a matter of wide public interest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para31"><a name="stpa_344">I appreciate the strength of feeling aroused by the case that he raised, but he knows that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the circumstances of an individual case. I do not think that my response will fully satisfy him, but he will, if he waits for my conclusion, hear something about reflecting on the latest assessment of what is happening, which may give him some hope for a pronouncement shortly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para32"><a name="stpa_345">If there are allegations about the behaviour or position of an elected councillor that is, in the first instance, an internal matter for the local authority. Subsequently, as outlined by the hon. Gentleman, such matters ought to be referred to the Standards Board for England. However, if allegations impinge on an individual planning application, it could be referred to the First Secretary of State or one of his inspectors on appeal. In such circumstances, also, I would not wish to say anything that might prejudice the quasi-judicial appeal process. However, I wish to be helpful, so I shall explain some of the rules and guidance on the planning process that apply to elected members, which will reinforce much of what the hon. Gentleman said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para33"><a name="stpa_346">As elected members, councillors may sit on a planning committee; they are responsible for making planning decisions, although a large number of those are delegated to planning officers for determination. Councillors do not act as judges on planning applications; they perform an administrative task. They balance two roles, which are not always harmonious&#151;determining planning applications and representing the public opinion of their communities. The planning committee is normally given background information, applicable policies and a variety of circumstances on an application, with recommendations on the decision to be taken that should guide members in making their decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para34"><a name="stpa_347">The English planning system involves a considerable amount of discretion. As a result, decisions of councillors on a planning committee may be based on a variety of considerations. However, the law defines that decision-making duty. Failure to act within the confines of the law may render the council open to legal challenge by means of judicial review.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para35"><a name="stpa_348">The cornerstone legislation on reaching decisions on planning applications is section 54A of the Town and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 69WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Country Planning Act 1990, which is incorporated into Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Section 38(6) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;If regard is to be had to the development plan for the purpose of any determination to be made under the planning Acts the determination must be made in accordance with the plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para36"><a name="stpa_349">As I said earlier, elected members on a local authority planning committee have to balance the needs and interests of individual constituents and the community with the need to maintain an ethic of impartial decision-making on what can sometimes be highly controversial proposals. The Nolan Committee acknowledged that that dual role can give rise to great tensions, as is clearly the case in the situation that the hon. Gentleman has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought to the House. In response, the Local Government Association issued a guidance note to authorities in October 1997.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para37"><a name="stpa_350">The Local Government Act 2000 introduced a new ethical framework to local government, including a model code of conduct for councillors. The relevant elements of the code are a requirement on each local authority to adopt a local code of conduct for councillors and co-opted members, the establishment in each authority of a standards committee to provide support and guidance to members on the requirements of their local code, and a requirement on the Standards Board for England to arrange for the investigation of allegations of breaches of local codes through its ethical standards officers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para38"><a name="stpa_351">The LGA revised its original guidance in 2002 to reflect the new legislative arrangements. It was further updated in January 2005 in the document entitled &quot;Member Engagement in Planning Matters&quot;, which states that if members have both a &quot;personal&quot; and a &quot;prejudicial&quot; interest, they should not participate in discussions. However, a planning committee member can still speak out against applications on behalf of ward constituents. Nothing in our guidance prevents them from doing so. The consequence is that they do not take part in the decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para39"><a name="stpa_352">Another question is whether councillors should speak out in council meetings and in committees. They should probably not. Chapter 8 of &quot;Probity in Planning&quot; makes it clear that councillors who have openly declared a view on an application should not use their position to lobby other councillors or to organise a caucus to support their position. The decision-making meeting should be planned to give the councillor a say, but one that is similar to that which other stakeholders will get, in order to preserve fairness. Elsewhere in Chapter 8, it is made clear that other political meetings should not be used to organise a decision in advance of the committee that is due to make the decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51108h05_para40"><a name="stpa_353">The document published in January 2005 by the LGA, &quot;Member Engagement in Planning Matters&quot; gives similar advice. The purpose of the document is to explain to members how they can become more engaged in discussions without fettering their discretion. However, if they do the guidance is clear:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;Members who do take an active stand in support or assistance to an application should withdraw from the planning committee deliberations. Responding to lobbying is fully legitimate where a councillor openly admits an interest in the outcome of deliberations and withdraws from the discussions on which they have a particularly strong view and stands down for the period while the item is under discussion.&quot;</p>

<a name="51108h05_para41"><a name="stpa_354">In the event of a conflict of interests arising in a particular case during its consideration by a local authority, it would be for elected members to seek advice from the authority&#039;s own legal staff. They would then provide advice on interpretation of any relevant legislation and on case law. However, as I said, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such a matter.

<a name="51108h05_para42"><a name="stpa_355">One of the Government&#039;s aims in reforming the planning system is to make it fairer and more transparent. Accordingly, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister continues to work with partner bodies such as the Local Government Association to produce advice and guidance for elected members on propriety issues in planning. Indeed, the planning advisory service, an arm of the Improvement and Development Agency, is financed by the Government. Its creation was one of the benefits of the &#163;600 million in planning delivery grant allocation made available to improve the system.

It was produced by the planning advisory service and endorsed by the chairman of the Local Government Association and my noble Friend Baroness Andrews. It too says that councillors should not

<a name="51108h05_para44"><a name="stpa_357">The code of conduct for local authority members requires that members with a prejudicial interest in an issue should withdraw from the council meeting. We are aware of concerns that some people have raised about the effect of the current rules on members&#039; ability to represent the concerns of their constituents. The Standards Board for England has recently concluded a review of the code of conduct and the board&#039;s conclusions from that review include consideration of this issue. The board has proposed amendments to the code of conduct as well as a recent recommendation of the Graham committee on standards in public life and the Select Committee on Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on the conduct regime for local government and the role of the Standards Board for England. We aim to announce our conclusions on proposed amendments to the conduct regime for local government later this autumn.

<p><a name="st_76"><a name="51108h05_spnew1"><b> Steve Webb </b> : Before the Minister sits down, will he provide some clarification? I am encouraged that these matters are being looked at. I read out a couple of general recommendations made by the Standards Board for England. Can he clarify whether the board has made any specific recommendations? I read out one about making the code of conduct clearer. Has the Department received specific recommendations from the board that are, perhaps, in the public domain, or are they at the same level of generality as the one I read out?
