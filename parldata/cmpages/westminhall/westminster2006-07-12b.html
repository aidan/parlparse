Nicholas Winterton (in the Chair):</b> Before I call the right
hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael), I welcome
all hon. Members to this sitting in Westminster Hall. In order that
Members should be comfortable, I am prepared to use an element of
discretion and allow them to remove their jackets. I am showing some
progressiveness that perhaps is not associated with me in normal
circumstances.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000504">9.30
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000011"><b><a name="06071261000532">Alun
Michael (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am
grateful to you, Sir Nicholas, first for calling me to speak and
secondly for your kindness in allowing us not to treat this Room as a
free sauna, given the warmth of the day.</p><p><a name="06071261000012">I sought to initiate this
debate to consider the contribution of wind energy to the national
interest in the broadest sense. The debate is about power and energy,
and about the power of the people linked to the power of the wind. It
is about the empowerment of people and sustainable development, and how
wind power can benefit the environment, the economy and the community.
I am delighted to be joined in the debate by someone who knows a great
deal about these topics, the former environment Minister my hon. Friend
the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley). I am particularly pleased that
my good friend the Minister for Energy will reply to the
debate.</p><p><a name="06071261000013">This debate
comes a day after the statement on the energy review, and it is easy to
despair at the facile way in which energy issues are often discussed
and reported. The complex issues of supply that my hon. Friend the
Minister has been grappling with in the review, which are crucial to
our future and our economy, are reduced to the simplistic question,
&#147;Are you for or against nuclear?&#148; I sometimes despair of
the profession in which I started my working life, before I earned
remission for good behaviour as a youth worker. Another issue that is
reduced to a knee-jerk reaction is the question, &#147;Are you in
favour of wind farms?&#148; That often gets two distinct answers from
the same people at the same time. They say yes in general, but,
&#147;No, if it&#146;s in my back yard&#148;&#151;or perhaps
that should be &#147;No, it it&#146;s on my hill&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071261000014">The picture of protestors
opposing wind generation is all too familiar to us all. They tell
councillors to reject the planning application, as a community united
in opposition. We often do not even bother to read the caption. I want
to test that. I have with me a photograph of a crowd of protestors
outside the council offices in Neath Port Talbot. They are against the
planning application, are they not, and telling the council to turn it
down? No. They are the supporters of 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 432WH</b><br>Awel Aman Tawe, based in Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen in the constituency of the
Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath
(Mr. Hain). They are protesting against the proposal that the council
should turn down their application for a four turbine, 11 MW community
wind farm on Mynydd y Gwrhyd, 20 miles north of Swansea&#151;Awel
Aman Tawe. I also have statements of support from a wide range of local
people, many clearly excited and inspired by the project.</p><p><a name="06071261000015">I shall not go into the
planning issues because there is an appeal underway to resolve the
issue. I know from my hon. Friend the Member for
Aberavon (Dr. Francis) that local opinion is coloured by at
least one local application, I think in the upper Amman valley, which
has sparked opposition in the community as it is believed that it is
being imposed on them from outside with big business deciding the
future for the local community. That is not the case with Awel Aman
Tawe, and that is at the heart of this debate.</p><p><a name="06071261000016">It is clear that Awel Aman Tawe
demonstrates well the three strands of sustainable
development&#151;the environmental, the economic and the social. The
benefits for the local community include more than &#163;4
million over the life of the project for community projects, such as
micro-renewables and energy efficiency, 32 new jobs, and construction
contracts for local suppliers worth an estimated &#163;1.5 million.
It will generate enough clean energy to supply the equivalent of almost
7,000 homes, and last but not least it will help to combat global
warming.</p><p><a name="06071261000017">Although the
planning system is dealing with the appeal, the message of community
involvement is very clear. Indeed, perhaps the planning system should
be able to take much greater notice of factors such as community
ownership into account instead of being neutral on issues of ownership.
The independent body Electoral Reform Services carried out a
referendum on behalf of Awel Aman Tawe and found that
almost 60 per cent. of local residents supported the development of a
community wind farm. Compared with a so-called commercial initiative,
the technology, the benefit, the price per kilowatt and the financial
reward are the same, but for the local community it is not someone from
outside coming in to do something to that community. The community owns
it and controls it, and it is in its hands.</p><p><a name="06071261000018">The situation is the same with
the Baywind energy co-operative, which has grown from a community base
in Cumbria to win the social enterprise award for the environment,
which I was delighted to present to the group. It is the same for the
communities that have worked with Energy4All, which is a spin-off from
Baywind, to enable communities throughout the land to learn from the
Baywind experience and take control of the energy supply from
renewables in their area.</p><p><a name="06071261000019">At the other end of the
spectrum, the Co-operative Group may be the UK&#146;s biggest farmer
but it has shown a sense of community interest. As a Co-operative MP, I
am pleased to see the link between the activities of the big beast of
the co-operative movement and the approach of organisations such as
Awel Aman Tawe and Baywind. The Co-operative Group is the UK&#146;s
largest consumer-owned co-operative business and it aims to drive
commercial success through true environmental and social 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 433WH</b><br>responsibility. In other words, it seeks to live up to the ideals of the
Rochdale pioneers all those years ago.</p><p><a name="06071261000020">In 2004, the group switched its
power supply across 3,000 sites throughout the mainland UK to renewable
energy generated from wind farms or hydropower. Co-operative Financial
Services and the Co-operative Group together now account for 790 GWh of
renewable purchase each year, which is equivalent to nearly half the
UK&#146;s onshore wind output. The CIS&#151;Co-operative
Insurance&#151;solar tower is the largest ever application of
photovoltaic panels in the UK. In Manchester earlier this year, my hon.
Friend the Member for Scunthorpe opened the UK&#146;s biggest
inner-city micro-wind farm, involving 19 micro-wind turbines, on
CFS&#146;s Portland street building.</p><p><a name="06071261000021">The link to Awel Aman Tawe is
that last Thursday, 6 July, saw the official switch-on of the
Coldham wind farm in Cambridgeshire as a joint venture between the
Co-operative Group and ScottishPower, engaging the local community. It
is a &#163;17 million, eight turbine wind farm that will realise
enough green energy to power 9,000 homes and to save 36,000 tonnes of
CO2 per year. That is because the group</p><a name="06071261000482"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;recognises the importance of
involving local people at the outset and giving them direct input into
all aspects of wind farm
schemes&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000022">Those are not
my words, but those of the group&#146;s chief executive, Martin
Beaumont.</p><p><a name="06071261000023">The
significance of that development could increase, because there are
plans to develop wind turbine schemes that could lead to the supply of
100 GW of electricity to the national grid within three years, which is
enough to power more than 20,000 homes. That includes plans for a
second, larger wind farm with 14 turbines at Goole in Humberside, also
on Co-op farm land. That is also why Co-operative Action is supporting
the Baywind energy co-operative. Baywind was formed in 1996, and today,
with more than 1,300 members, owns five wind turbines near Ulverston
and one in Cumbria.</p><p><a name="06071261000024">I am also
pleased to learn that in Wales Energy4All&#146;s manager, Steve
Cranston, is contacting all the developers involved in bidding on
Forestry Commission land to request some aspect of community ownership
as part of technical advice note 8, which is known as TAN 8. Energy4All
is working with Nuon in Wales and hopes to progress an agreement with
Airtricity through Dulas.</p><p><a name="06071261000025">The potential of the
development is huge and growing. I am told that for every community
project that Energy4All is involved in, it receives another 100
inquiries. Yet that sector receives no Government support. I want to
make it clear that I am arguing not for subsidy, but for cash and
support to nurture and help the capacity building that is vital in
community ownership and co-operative developments and for the
Government to get stuck into the nitty-gritty of the work that is
necessary to enable the sector to take off at an even faster
rate.</p><p><a name="06071261000026">Let us consider
some of the projects, such as Westmill wind farm co-operative in
Oxfordshire. Energy4All took over full development of the five turbine
site in August 2005 and raised &#163;4.4 million over Christmas to
build the first onshore wind farm in the 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 434WH</b><br>south-east, which is 100 per cent. community owned. The development of
the project is of significant strategic importance for social
enterprises as well as for onshore wind
use.</p><p><a name="06071261000027">There is also the
case of Beech farm in Tavistock, where a public inquiry is due to be
held in October. The appeal, for two 850 kW turbines, was brought by
the landowners, Mr. and Mrs. Bradford, against West Devon council. The
inspector has requested a section 106 agreement to confirm that the
site will develop as a co-operative if successful.</p><p><a name="06071261000028">If anyone is in doubt, let me
spell out the benefits of community involvement and ownership. It
encourages proactive rather than reactive community engagement and
accountability&#151;the community is not simply being consulted about
something that is done to it; it is involved. It responds to the
concerns and needs of local people, and it ensures the efficient
targeting of investment.</p><p><a name="06071261000029">Community involvement and
ownership raises awareness of the need for action on climate change. We
need to engage the whole of the population in dealing with that issue;
acting alone, the Government will make slow progress. It delivers key
public services in partnership with local authorities. It delivers also
direct accountability for stakeholders and energy consumers. It
develops the capacity for smaller projects, which depend on investors
accepting a lower return. The sites closer to demand may therefore be
on less sensitive sites, and the community will support the
development. </p><p><a name="06071261000030">Such
involvement also delivers direct economic benefits and revenue streams
for members. It brings together and co-ordinates complex relationships
between key stakeholders for biomass and district heating schemes. Such
schemes often fail because of a lack of engagement and support, again
because people feel that something is being done to them. Investment is
mobilised from members and the wider community, which is significant in
meeting the Government&#146;s objectives. It supports longer-term
infrastructure investment.</p><p><a name="06071261000031">Embedded energy is, of its
nature, more efficient. It develops tailored local solutions to project
delivery. It attracts new skills and jobs into the social
enterprise sector at the local level. I believe that those advantages
are enormously important. It is wonderful stuff. The country
that invented co-operation and social enterprise should be proud of it,
yet community renewables have made slower progress in the United
Kingdom than in other north European countries.</p><p><a name="06071261000032">The three key reasons for that
have been identified as finance, time and knowledge. The key is not
massive grants or Government schemes but access to finance and a better
understanding by national and local bureaucracies of how to nurture the
sector&#146;s potential. It is not just a question of looking for the
quantum of wind energy; we need to recognise that engaging people can
release existing potential.</p><p><a name="06071261000033">Energy4All has called on the
Government to give direct funding to the social enterprise sector, to
pay for staff time and to provide risk funding through the revolving
loan fund, which will allow communities to take appropriate schemes
forward. The House should mark my words: I underline and support that
approach. A revolving loan fund does not have to be a 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 435WH</b><br>drag on the Exchequer, but it will not happen without some Government
help to facilitate and accelerate the process.</p><p><a name="06071261000034">There is also a huge demand for
the Government to provide access to renewable energy information and
expertise to ensure that good quality schemes in all technologies can
move forward; thus, we can gain the multiple benefits of rural and
urban sustainable heat and power.</p><p><a name="06071261000035">In summary, community
involvement, accountability and ownership is the key to achieving the
successful integration of distributed renewable generation schemes,
which will largely be below 10 MW. Current support is dispersed and
inefficient, so it cannot deal with the current barriers or meet public
demand.</p><p><a name="06071261000036">Support and
facilitation for community, individual and business-owned renewable
energy schemes has the potential to play a key role in unblocking the
economically viable potential of all technologies. If structured
appropriately, the cost of assistance through information and financial
support will represent considerable value for money, given the
anticipated social, economic and environmental
returns.</p><p><a name="06071261000037">We know the
environmental benefits of maximising the use of wind energy; it will
cut emissions and reduce dependence on nuclear power. However, some
people still think that its impact on the rural environment is
negative. For example, the briefing provided for today&#146;s debate
by the Campaign to Protect Rural England was not wholly negative about
wind energy, but it was disappointing and lacking in vision. It damned
it with faint praise, so I shall take its argument head on.</p><p><a name="06071261000038">I was brought up on the edge of
Snowdonia. I spent years introducing young people to its finest
landscapes. I have had ministerial responsibility for national parks
and areas of outstanding natural beauty in Wales and England. The last
thing that I want to see is a wind farm on Moel Siabod or Striding
Edge. However, I am amazed that people who can ignore the ugly
intrusion of electricity pylons striding across our
countryside&#151;are they invisible, perhaps because they have been
there for decades?&#151;are opposed to wind farms, which can be a
calming and even an inspirational sight as one comes over the brow of a
hill.</p><p><a name="06071261000039"><b><a name="06071261000533">Mr.
David Jones (Clwyd, West) (Con):</b> I congratulate the right
hon. Gentleman on initiating such a timely debate. He spoke of pylons
striding across our countryside, and I share his concern about that.
Would he not concede that if we continue with the current policy of
developing large-scale wind farms of above 50 MW, for example, in areas
on the edge of Snowdonia, even more pylons will be striding across our
countryside?</p><p><a name="06071261000040"><b><a name="06071261000534">Alun
Michael:</b> No, I do
not.</p><p><a name="06071261000041">I have stood at
the roadside looking at a small number of wind turbines on one side of
the valley and seeing pylons further up&#151;pylons not associated
with the wind farm&#151;yet people say that the turbines are ugly,
and that they do not like them. I ask them to compare the two. When one
walks over the brow of a hill and sees the turbines of a wind farm one
can see 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 436WH</b><br>that, in the right place, they are attractive. They generate energy in a
way that is socially and visually attractive.</p><p><a name="06071261000042">What is the reason for that
knee-jerk reaction? Many people have become used not only to pylons but
to the extraction of minerals in some of our most beautiful landscapes;
it does not arouse their anger, yet they have a knee-jerk opposition to
wind farms, even those sited in appropriate locations in the
countryside. I do not understand it. It does not make sense.</p><p><a name="06071261000043">The answer is that it depends
on who is doing it and for whom. If wind turbines are imposed by big
business to make a quick buck&#151;or even, as some perceive it,
imposed by the Government&#151;then resentment will kick in.
Judgments are made, but not always by those who have to live with the
consequences.</p><p><a name="06071261000044">I want
my hon. Friend the Minister to promise two things. First, I ask him to
make it clear that wind energy will be owned by the community and that
if big companies or bodies such as the Co-operative Group want to come
in, they will have to show the community benefit, community support and
genuine engagement. I ask him also to set requirements that will test
objectively whether schemes are community led.</p><p><a name="06071261000045">Secondly, I ask my hon. Friend
to support and promote the practice of community wind farm ownership
that I have outlined. We all know that the principles of community
ownership&#151;co-operation and mutuality&#151;have great power.
They bring long-term benefits. They have the power to move mountains.
However, that approach needs to be nurtured and, as I said earlier,
that involves cash, time and knowledge.</p><p><a name="06071261000046">My hon. Friend will recall that
I supplied him with a copy of a publication commissioned by Peter Hunt
of Mutuo entitled &#147;Community engagement in energy through energy
mutuals&#148;. It was researched by Dr. Gill Owen, and I provided an
introduction. It made two clear recommendations about how to remove the
barriers for community engagement though energy mutuals.</p><p><a name="06071261000047">The first recommendation was
that the Government should take the lead, perhaps through a community
energy unit, in maximising and harvesting the benefits that have been
demonstrated&#151;for instance, by Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
I do not want to suggest a specific solution to my hon. Friend; I ask
him to accept the principle and seek the best way to ensure that the
Government are proactive in nurturing such an approach.</p><p><a name="06071261000048">The second recommendation was
that a renewable heat obligation should be put in place. I am
encouraged by the interest shown yesterday in expressing the output of
the energy industry in terms of heat and light rather than in specific
forms of energy. The Mutuo booklet was ahead of its time in that
respect; I hope that my hon. Friend will confirm that it is now part of
mainstream thinking.</p><p><a name="06071261000049">I have tried to show that wind
energy can provide the classic benefits of democracy, especially when
linked to the key Government principle of sustainable
development&#151;the principle that, in all we do, we should balance
and integrate economic, social and environmental considerations. The
problem is that those factors are dealt with in separate silos of
Government. The publication of the energy review 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 437WH</b><br>report and yesterday&#146;s statement give my hon. Friend a unique
opportunity to take the leadership in bringing those three aspects
together. What better example than community-owned wind generation? If
Whitehall takes it seriously, the Government could have a win-win-win
situation.</p><p><a name="06071261000050">It is
obvious that maximising renewable energy is key to our future. We would
be mad not to support it; it helps feed the energy needs of our
national economy. It is also obvious, is it not, that wind energy
benefits the environment, whether the countryside or our global
future?</p><p><a name="06071261000051">Clearly, a
community empowered to make its own decisions is likely to choose the
wind turbine option, which helps the national and international
interest. Above all, that option would help it meet its own energy
needs, become at best a new contributor instead of a net consumer and
learn to be empowered to make its own decisions in a national and
international
context.</p><p><a name="06071261000052">The issue is
urgent; we are trailing in seventh place on installed wind capacity.
Germany leads the way with 18,400 MW, followed by Spain with 10,000 MW
and the USA with 9,100 MW; capacity is hardly proportionate to size.
The UK has the greatest wind resource in Europe, yet we are not using
it. I want to help the Minister change that picture. Wind
power&#146;s time has come, and I urge the Minister to be brave and
help Whitehall understand the creative opportunity before it. My plea
is that we should enable community wind energy to support the
Government in what they and my hon. Friend the Minister are trying to
do.</p><p><a name="06071261000053">I understand the
Minister&#146;s challenges; he has to balance costs and needs, the
national interest, the protection of supplies and the energy mix
necessary for this country to have a productive future. Will he
acknowledge that the power of the people and the community, linked to
the production of wind energy, has a part to play in his strategy? With
his support and encouragement, people are far more likely to face the
big challenges set out in yesterday&#146;s statement. Let the people
be part of the solution, rather than being perceived as part of the
problem.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000505">9.52
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000054"><b><a name="06071261000535">Mr.
David Jones (Clwyd, West) (Con):</b> Again, I congratulate the
right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) on
securing this debate, which is extremely timely. He may be surprised to
hear that I agree with a great deal of what he said. Clearly, the
thrust of his argument is that communities should be empowered, in the
sense of coming to wind as a source of energy that they wish to
embrace, rather than as one imposed on them.</p><p><a name="06071261000055">Wind energy certainly has a
large part to play in addressing this country&#146;s energy needs.
Once in operation, it is a relatively non-polluting source of
generation. However, it has serious drawbacks. First, it is
self-evidently inefficient because when the wind does not blow, or when
it blows too hard, no energy is generated. That means that conventional
fossil fuel power stations must operate in the background, ready to
kick in when the wind drops.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 438WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000056"><b><a name="06071261000536">Dr.
Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</b> Does the hon.
Gentleman accept that the installation of a number of community-owned
or non-community-owned wind farms throughout the country would
substantially reduce and probably remove the element of variability
that he talks about? The wind always blows somewhere in the country,
and if the wind energy produced fed into the grid, the variability,
aggregated out, would hardly be different from that provided by the
base load of conventional
power.</p><p><a name="06071261000057"><b><a name="06071261000537">Mr.
Jones:</b> That argument is correct, but it presupposes that
we are willing to have wind farms on an industrial scale throughout the
country; I imagine that most people would be extremely reluctant to see
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000058"><b><a name="06071261000538">Martin
Horwood (Cheltenham) (LD):</b> The hon. Gentleman suggests
that fossil fuels are more efficient than wind power. The right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) talked about
microgeneration and community-based generation and power, which are
inherently enormously more efficient because they avoid the more than
50 per cent. conversion losses inherent in large-scale fossil fuel
power
stations.</p><p><a name="06071261000059"><b><a name="06071261000539">Mr.
Jones:</b> My point was that wind power is inefficient to the
extent of being unreliable. Clearly, the wind does not always blow;
sometimes, it blows too strongly. Certain Members would be happy to see
the country littered with wind farms, but many people would
not.</p><p><a name="06071261000060"><b><a name="06071261000540">Alun
Michael:</b> I ask the hon. Gentleman not to join the
knee-jerk brigade and talk down wind farms and wind energy as he has
done. What he says is inaccurate. He needs to take a more balanced
approach.</p><p><a name="06071261000061"><b><a name="06071261000541">Mr.
Jones:</b> With respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I
listened carefully to what he said in almost complete silence. I agreed
with much of it. If he let me develop my argument, he might agree with
something that I have to say. I want to talk about empowering people,
and I understand that the right hon. Gentleman is also interested in
doing that.</p><p><a name="06071261000062">The fact
is that exaggerated, sometimes&#151;dare I say it&#151;overblown
claims are made about the effectiveness of wind farms. Cefn Croes, for
example, is the largest onshore wind farm in Wales; until recently, it
was the largest wind farm in the country. We were constantly told that
it had an installed capacity of 58.5 MW, which in itself is true.
However, its operational load factor is about 32 to 35 per
cent.&#151;about one third&#151;of its capacity.</p><p><a name="06071261000063">Wind is also an extraordinarily
environmentally intrusive source of generation. Although it cannot be
pretended that conventional or nuclear power stations are attractive
structures, they are usually confined to small geographical areas,
frequently in already industrialised parts of the country. By contrast,
wind farms are far more visually intrusive, often covering tens of
square miles located in areas of attractive countryside.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 439WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000064">Wind turbines are becoming
progressively larger. Modern turbines, such as that proposed for the
Gwynt y M&#244;r wind farm off the coast of north Wales, are more
than 500 ft high, taller than the Blackpool tower. Turbine blades now
have a span greater than the wing span of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. Wind
farms have a significant and often adverse effect on open seascapes and
landscapes and often attract a large degree of local opposition. That
should not be dismissed as mere nimbyism, as the right hon. Gentleman
(Alun Michael) suggests. Seascapes and landscapes are valuable national
resources and ought not to be spoiled unless there is a compelling
reason for doing so.</p><p><a name="06071261000065"><b><a name="06071261000542">Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman uses the pejorative term
&#147;spoiled&#148; and says that such things should not be done
without compelling reason. Does he not think that the threat of global
climate change is
compelling?</p><p><a name="06071261000066"><b><a name="06071261000543">Mr.
Jones:</b> My point is that there is a balance to be struck.
The wind farm lobby seems to think that wind farms should be stuck on
any available stretch of countryside, but clearly they should not. This
country has unique and beautiful visual resources, and we must be
careful about where we site wind farms.</p><p><a name="06071261000067">I wish to concentrate on two
matters, which the Government should consider seriously. First, they
should consider the operation of the renewables obligation, which I
have taken up with the Minister on previous occasions. He has
acknowledged to me that the obligation is a blunt instrument. Its
problem is that it makes no distinction between the intrinsic merits of
various renewable technologies. Consequently, it rewards the least
capital-intensive source of generation, which at the moment is wind.
That means that wind farms are virtually certain to continue to
proliferate for as long as the obligation remains unreformed.</p><p><a name="06071261000068">That is a pity, because other
sources of renewable power such as tidal, wave and biomass power, are
far less visually intrusive and potentially much more beneficial. For
example, tidal power is infinitely more reliable than wind power; it is
difficult to think of anything more predictable than the ebb and flow
of the tide. Yet because tidal power is less developed, there is little
incentive under the renewables obligation to pursue tidal schemes. That
is a huge pity, and I hope that, in the wake of the energy review, the
Government will consider refining the obligation to consider other,
less intrusive forms of renewable energy.</p><p><a name="06071261000069">Secondly, I should like the
Minister to address the question of the planning and consent process.
At present, the principal consent route for wind farms of more than 50
MW is section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. Infrastructure
development is governed by the normal town and country planning
processes, as are wind farms of less than 50 MW. The difficulty with
the two processes is that they have been constructed so as to reduce
considerably the right of local objectors to make meaningful
representations. There is no appeals procedure under section 36 of the
1989 Act, and through technical advice note 8 in Wales and planning
policy statement 22 in England, the town and country planning process
imposes a presumption in favour of the development of wind
farms.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 440WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000070">An extreme example of the
consequences was the Scarweather sands development in south Wales. An
inspector decided that the objectors were right, that the farm should
not proceed and that the application should be refused. The decision
was overruled by the Welsh Assembly Committee that considered the
inspector&#146;s report. It decided that the scheme should proceed,
notwithstanding the fact that the inspector had recommended that it
should not, as it accorded with the principles set out in the
Assembly&#146;s planning
policy.</p><p><a name="06071261000071">It cannot be
right that a swathe of local residents supported by technical and
scientific advice and, most importantly, by the planning inspector who
considered the application, were rendered virtually voiceless. Such
decisions give rise to huge resentment on the part of local
communities.</p><p><a name="06071261000072"><b><a name="06071261000544">Alun
Michael:</b> First, I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman
seems to have such disregard for the democratic processes that put
elected representatives in the Assembly. He would rather have an
appointed inspector as the final arbiter on an appeal of that sort.
Secondly, does he realise that he is making my case very well by
demonstrating that if the structures are left to the antagonism between
a local community and a proposal, rather than starting off with the
full engagement of the local community, the events that he is
describing are almost
inevitable?</p><p><a name="06071261000073"><b><a name="06071261000545">Mr.
Jones:</b> Of course I am making that case. That was the whole
point of giving the example.</p><p><a name="06071261000074">The fact is that local people
were disempowered by the planning procedure. My point is that it is
necessary for the Government to be far more sensitive to the concerns
of local people, and to that extent I agree entirely with what the
right hon. Gentleman is saying. If local communities want small-scale
wind farms that are appropriate to their needs, they should have
them.</p><p><a name="06071261000075">The problem is
that the thrust of Government policy at present is to impose schemes on
local communities in complete disregard of often quite proper
objections. If more and more wind farms are to be developed, it is
necessary for the Government to be more and more sensitive to the
concerns of local people. I hope that in the wake of the energy review,
the Government will develop procedures that will allow them to be far
more responsive to the concerns of local
people.</p>

<p><a name="06071261000076">The notice
process has caused extreme concern in my constituency. An application
was made some years ago by Celtic Offshore Wind for the development of
a wind farm at a location that was described as being on the Rhyl
flats. The Rhyl flats is an area that is identified on Admiralty
charts. As one might imagine, it is off the coast at the town of Rhyl.
<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Yes, the right hon. Gentleman for
Cardiff, South and Penarth may laugh, but the point of the story is
that consent was granted, and when local residents carried out further
investigations it turned out that the wind farm was not cited on the
Rhyl flats at all but on another area of sea called the Constable bank,
which is about 10 miles to the west off the town of Rhos-on-Sea. One
wonders why the developers applied the description of Rhyl flats to the
wind farm when it was not on the Rhyl flats but on a totally different
maritime feature. Those of a less 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 441WH</b><br>charitable disposition might suggest that they did that because they
anticipated far less opposition from the townspeople of Rhyl than from
the extremely articulate people of
Rhos-on-Sea.</p><p><a name="06071261000077">The
Government should take steps to ensure that the planning and consent
process is as transparent as possible, that a clear indication is given
in statutory notices of the proposed location of wind farms and that
pain is not caused to people such as those in Rhos-on-Sea in my
constituency, who woke up one morning to be told that a wind farm was
to be placed there and not, as they thought, on the area of seabed
known as the Rhyl flats. One can imagine their concern. I invite the
Minister to address that matter. I have raised it with him previously,
but it is important to raise it
again.</p><p><a name="06071261000078">To summarise, I
support the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and
believe that communities should be empowered and should have a voice. I
believe that they should have a wind farm if they want one, but the
Government have a positive duty to ensure that their voices are heard
and not ignored when large-scale industrial wind farms are to be
imposed on
communities.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000506">10.5
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000079"><b><a name="06071261000546">Mr.
Elliot Morley (Scunthorpe) (Lab):</b> It is a great pleasure
to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth (Alun Michael). We have been co-operating on
a range of issues for 19 years in this House, both in and out of
Government. He has always been a great campaigner for the co-operative
movement, and he made a powerful and articulate case for how
co-operative principles can be used to empower communities and give
them real involvement in sustainable development, recognising the three
key strands of social, economic and environmental
development.</p><p><a name="06071261000080">This is
an urgent issue. We hear of opposition to wind farms and, as discussed
in the contribution of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), the
need for more support for tidal energy. Indeed, there ought to be more
support for all forms of renewables. That was made clear in the very
good statement that we heard yesterday on the energy review in which my
hon. Friend the Minister was
involved.</p><p><a name="06071261000081">However, the
fact remains that wind is one of this country&#146;s most important
resources. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth stated, we have the best wind resources in the whole of Europe,
and it would not make any sense not to utilise and benefit from them.
That means that it is inevitable that there will be many applications
for wind farms and wind
turbines.</p><p><a name="06071261000082">We must
harness that resource. Of course, it needs to be done appropriately,
and we must take into account the legitimate concerns of communities,
but the hon. Member for Clwyd, West was wrong when said that wind farms
are inefficient. This debate is not particularly about advocating the
benefits or otherwise of wind farms but about co-operative ownership
and how we take issues
forward.</p><p><a name="06071261000083">The
Sustainable Development Commission produced an excellent report on
renewables. It exploded some of the myths and made it clear that wind
generation is, in 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 442WH</b><br>fact, one of the cheapest and most efficient forms of energy in this
country. The hon. Gentleman said that wind farms are about 35 per cent.
efficient. The fact is that a coal-burning station is only 30 per cent.
efficient&#151;there is a lack of efficiency in these
things&#151;and wind comes out very well when one takes into account
that it is part of the national grid, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) rightly pointed
out.</p><p><a name="06071261000084"><b><a name="06071261000547">Mr.
Jones:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman concede that nuclear power
stations are approximately 95 per cent.
efficient?</p><p><a name="06071261000085"><b><a name="06071261000548">Mr.
Morley:</b> No, I would not concede that. I would ask the hon.
Gentleman to review the record of output of nuclear power stations,
which is nothing like 90 per cent. They spend a lot of time down for
maintenance, repair and sometimes because of breakdown. It is not the
case that they achieve 90 per cent. efficiency&#151;the figure does
not exist. I strongly recommend that the hon. Gentleman read the SDC
report, as it evaluates all forms of energy and considers efficiency
ratings and such
issues.</p><p><a name="06071261000086">Onshore and
offshore wind energy can make a substantial contribution to this
country&#146;s energy needs. In fact, the proposed London Array in
itself&#151;just one offshore wind farm&#151;will account for about
1 per cent. of the electricity supply in this country and will meet the
whole of London&#146;s needs. Such significant investments can make a
significant
contribution.</p><p><a name="06071261000087">The hon.
Gentleman also missed what was said in the energy review and the
comments yesterday, in that the Government have already said that they
are willing to review the concept of banding for renewables obligation
certificates. I very much welcome that, and there might well be an
argument for a higher rate for offshore wind, as opposed to onshore
wind, because it is more expensive to develop offshore. There might
well also be an argument for a higher rate for tidal energy, which,
like wind and other forms of energy, is on the threshold of
commercialisation. I very much welcome the Government&#146;s
announcement in that regard, because that is absolutely the right way
forward.</p><p><a name="06071261000088">There has
been a lot of debate recently about political consensus, and that is
particularly true of climate change, which is the overriding
environmental threat that we face this century. There is a real urgency
about the need to combat climate change, because the latest science
that we have available&#151;much of it has come from UK scientific
institutions&#151;suggests that the effects of climate change are
worse, and are being seen faster, than was originally envisaged.
Several eminent scientists argue that we are in danger of reaching a
tipping point and that if the concentration of greenhouse gases goes
beyond a certain level, the problem may take a century to rectify. The
longer that process goes on, the higher the concentrations will be and
the more difficult and expensive it will be to rectify the problem. The
consensus is that it will take about a decade to make a real difference
to global warming and climate change globally. I certainly accept that
and very much worry about it.</p><p><a name="06071261000089">There are also planning issues,
as my right hon. Friend mentioned. As all Members of
Parliament and elected councillors know, planning issues and 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 443WH</b><br>arguments are complex. The nimby syndrome is well understood, but we
have moved on from it and towards the banana syndrome, with people
saying that we should build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything.
That has become an established principle, which applies whether we are
talking about a bus stop or a nuclear power station. That is a problem,
and we cannot ignore people&#146;s concerns, but there is an argument
for looking at the planning system and making it more streamlined,
responsive and relevant to today&#146;s needs. I welcome the
Government&#146;s announcement that they will do that. It is not only
that there is an issue about nuclear power stations, which are a
completely separate matter; it is that the planning system and the
planning process need examining.</p><p><a name="06071261000090">I am not saying that people do
not occasionally have valid reasons for objecting to wind farms, for
example. Indeed, several high-profile applications have been turned
down at the planning stage, because the case that local people have
made has been accepted. I do not know the details of the case in Wales,
although I do know that the Welsh Assembly Committee, to which the hon.
Member for Clwyd, West referred, is an all-party committee. It is part
of the democratic process, and I assume that, on balance, it thought
that the arguments, including the inspector&#146;s input, showed that
there was still a case for the wind farm in question. That is the
nature of democracy and the planning system. To be blunt, many people
object to any sort of change because they worry about the impact that
it might have on the price of their houses&#151;that is the big
motivator for many of the objections. However, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors found that although wind farms might have a
short-term impact, they have no impact in the longer term, and people
should understand that.</p><p><a name="06071261000091">The hon. Gentleman is wrong
about public opinion. When people are asked whether they support wind
farms, the polling evidence shows that there is about 70 to 80
per cent. approval for them, so support is actually quite high. That
brings me back to the idea of political consensus. Whenever there is an
application, it is very depressing to see pressure being put on Members
of Parliament of all parties, who feel an obligation to campaign on
behalf of local residents, although that is, of course, part of the
democratic process. During the general election, however, I noticed
that the Conservative candidate in a neighbouring constituency, where
there are quite a number of applications, spent nearly his whole time
campaigning against wind farms&#151;not that it did him much good.
That suggests that although people close to the sites of proposed wind
farms might be concerned, people overall have a much more mature and
balanced outlook on the role of wind in our energy mix.</p><p><a name="06071261000092">I strongly support the thrust
of the argument of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South
and Penarth because giving people a stake in wind farms will empower
and involve them, and it is part of allowing them to make a practical
contribution to combating climate change. I welcome the work that
Energy4All has done on the issue. As my right hon. Friend said, I
opened the wind turbine on the roof of the Co-operative Insurance
Society building in Manchester, and I should like to see many more
tower blocks and office blocks using microgeneration, which 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 444WH</b><br>lends itself well to such developments and is not at all
obtrusive&#151;indeed, it looks quite good. Even factories in
industrial areas have undertaken such developments, and Nissan, for
example, has a wind farm on its factory site in Sunderland. I am keen
to see more of that, and Corus has been talking about undertaking such
a development at its site on Teesside. Urban and industrial
environments are good places for on-site wind turbines that contribute
to the factory&#146;s electricity demands.</p><p><a name="06071261000093">The issue on which I want to
concentrate, however, is how the Government can assist the development
of co-operative wind farms. I strongly endorse my right hon.
Friend&#146;s comment that it is not a question of asking for more
subsidies or additional funding for developments. People need
information about how they can become involved in developments. they
need empowering so that they can get involved and they need the
technical support and finance. The idea of a revolving fund is a good
one, which the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry well
recognise, and there is a strong argument for having such a fund.
</p><p><a name="06071261000094">To return to my
original point, the great beauty of co-operative wind farms is that
they address the core of sustainability. There is the social strand of
sustainability, because people are brought together and empowered.
There is community involvement and there has been great enthusiasm for
such schemes where they have been implemented. There is also the
economic strand, because people gain some economic benefit from such
developments in their own communities. Of course, there has always been
a benefit to landowners. Wind farms have always been quite a good deal
for landowners and have been very popular with them, but it is nice
that communities should be involved, too, and I am strongly in favour
of that. Of course, there is also the environmental strand, because
wind farms are zero-emission forms of renewable energy. We must have
more of those forms of energy because we must reduce emissions in our
own country.</p><p><a name="06071261000095">We must
demonstrate that, as the fourth richest country in the world and an
advanced industrial economy, we can move to a low-carbon economy
without damaging our economic growth, our gross domestic product or our
communities. Indeed, I think that we are demonstrating that. We have
always been a leader in many aspects of technology and science, and
there is no reason why we cannot be a leader in renewable energy and
catch up with countries such as Germany, Denmark, Spain and even the
United States, which has invested significantly in renewables. We have
an advantage because of our wind resources and our science and
technology, and because many communities are well organised and have
strong community leadership. All we need is a little extra help from
the Government on how to tap into the benefits and take forward this
form of co-operative development. That will bring about the benefits
that my right hon. Friend so powerfully outlined&#151;the benefits to
our communities and our economy in terms of the overall issue of
combating climate
change.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000507">10.18
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000096"><b><a name="06071261000549">Dr.
Alan Whitehead (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</b> I should like
briefly to add one dimension to the excellent debate that we have had
about the merits of 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 445WH</b><br>community wind farms and community energy in general. The
Government&#146;s energy review, which came out yesterday, and the
provisional results of the energy review conducted by the Opposition
both mention the future merits of distributive generation at
considerable
length.</p><p><a name="06071261000097">Distributed
generation is not just about introducing into our energy mix a
substantial element of generation within homes, in addition to
generation from big power sources. Certainly, the discussion about
distributed generation has been concentrated on wind turbines on
houses. I was delighted to hear about the progress of the wind turbine
on the house of my hon. Friend the Minister, tiles permitting.
Discussion has tended to concentrate on the fact that distributed
generation is based on the idea that wind turbines on houses, combined
heat and power boilers in houses, solar thermal equipment and solar
photovoltaics on roofs can override the energy requirement in a house
and produce distributed energy for use in the home&#151;and perhaps
export some energy from the home to the grid, if it is not immediately
used.</p><p><a name="06071261000098">A substantial
element, as I am sure my right hon. Friend will agree, is the
contribution that will be possible in the future from generating
programmes that are neither large energy nor domestically-based
sources, but community-sized energy plants. The great advantage of
community-sized energy plants, both in relation to wind farms and other
forms of generation, is that, as my right hon. Friend says, they are
owned, promoted and progressed by local communities, and those
communities, ideally, receive the benefit not only of ownership of the
community energy plant but of its output. Where possible, those
community energy plants can be based on what might be called a private
wire system, whereby on a community basis the output of the plant
overrides national grid input and provides the community with power at
local level. The advantage of that, as has been mentioned in the
debate, relates to the losses that occur with big power. I see that the
hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) has the very informative
Department of Trade and Industry multicoloured chart before him, which
sets out exactly the losses that occur in conventional power stations
between fuel in and power out. I believe that the figure is something
like 63 or 64 per cent. in conventional power stations, and that a
further 6 to 7 per cent. is lost in transmission from those
power stations to the home.</p><p><a name="06071261000099">A very large percentage of the
fuel going in to what might be called traditional big power is lost
even before it has reached the transmission cables; there is certainly
also a loss in the transmission cables. That is not so for community
energy. The power is produced locally. In the case of wind farms, 100
per cent. of the fuel in is converted to power out. Other forms of
local generation are not quite as efficient, but local combined heat
and power generation can be 70 to 80 per cent. effective with
respect to those inputs and outputs. The distribution losses are also
avoided.</p><p><a name="06071261000100">I have an
interest to declare, because I am an unpaid director of a community
energy company in Southampton, Solent Sustainable Energy Ltd., which
will be providing combined heat and power. It will 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 446WH</b><br>serve more than 3,000 homes, as far as heating is concerned, and will
provide electricity output, based on a community power station. There
are different forms of community energy plant, including wind farms,
power stations and other forms of community energy management. It is
interesting to see that where such principles have been applied on a
widespread basis, through the use of plants of the type I have
mentioned in public and buildings and elsewhere, in the borough of
Woking, a reduction of about 77 per cent. in carbon dioxide emissions
has been achieved.</p><p><a name="06071261000101"><b><a name="06071261000550">Mr.
Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b> Simply out of
curiosity, I wonder whether the combined heat and power project that
the hon. Gentleman is involved in is powered by gas. What does he
estimate to be the improvements in efficiency and lower carbon
emissions?</p><p><a name="06071261000102"><b><a name="06071261000551">Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The proposal is that the plant will be
renewable oil-fired, using either rapeseed oil or sustainable palm
oil&#151;bio-oil&#151;and will therefore be effectively carbon
neutral. That underlines the point that I want to make, which is that
some community energy plants, whether they use wind, biomass or
biofuel, have two advantages. First, they are effectively carbon
neutral, and, secondly, they offset all the losses that are well
documented from the way in which big power transmits the fuel that it
uses into the homes that it powers.</p><p><a name="06071261000103">There is a substantial future
for community-level energy plants. I take note of the proposals in the
energy review about the renewables obligation. I hope that the banding
arrangements suggested in the review will take into account the banding
that would be advantageous to the development of such community energy
plants. In the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 there is
a substantial element of additional encouragement for the development
of community energy plants, and the future therefore seems bright for
community ownership and development of such plants. I take the point
made by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) that that should,
of course, be done on the basis of proper consultation and planning
arrangements, and that certain forms of energy are not always
appropriate in all circumstances or in all locations. However, the
fundamental point is right: given that caveat, community energy can
play a substantial role in the energy mix and, indeed, in making the
energy future as close to carbon neutral as we
can.</p><p><a name="06071261000104"><b><a name="06071261000552">Sir

large-scale wind farms, and that household microgeneration and
small-scale community generation are enormously important. He paid
tribute in particular to community and co-operatively owned
initiatives. I join him in celebrating them; the potential of the
co-operative principle is generally neglected in our society, but its
application is valuable in wind energy, and also in biofuels and solar
power. I know of examples of a community-based approach delivering
small-scale energy generation, which, as has been mentioned, is
enormously more efficient than energy generation based in large-scale
power stations.</p><p><a name="06071261000107">The
hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) is, I think, in something of a
minority in his approach, which seemed not so much nimbyist as showing
a psychological aversion to wind power. The Tyndall centre recently
quoted a poll as showing strong public support for wind power running
at 81 per cent. Of the remaining 19 per cent., 14 per cent. still
slightly support wind power. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman falls
into the &#147;strongly against&#148; category, which is 1 per
cent. of the population, so he is in a small minority.</p><p><a name="06071261000108">I also disagree with the hon.
Gentleman about the aesthetics of wind turbines. Last year I was the
guest of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr.
Carmichael) in his constituency, where we admired the beautiful
offshore wind turbines. Going to the lengths of criticising wind
turbines on&#151;to use the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
phrase&#151;open seascape is taking nimbyism to the
extreme.</p><p><a name="06071261000109"><b><a name="06071261000554">Mr.
David Jones:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that there
are no seascapes in this country that ought to be
protected?</p><p><a name="06071261000110"><b><a name="06071261000555">Alun
Michael:</b> Of course
not.</p><p><a name="06071261000111"><b><a name="06071261000556">Martin
Horwood:</b> The right hon. Gentleman took the words right out
of my mouth. However, where appropriate wind turbines can be an
attractive addition to the landscape. I would happily see more of them
in Gloucestershire and am happy to go on the record as saying that. The
hon. Member for Clwyd, West said that tidal power was less intrusive.
It is true that all renewable energy must be approached sensitively,
but I suspect that a tidal barrage across the Severn estuary might be a
lot more intrusive than wind turbines in the local
area.</p><p><a name="06071261000112">There are issues
with wind power. On a large scale, community consent is overwhelmingly
the most important issue. The onus is on companies that are developing
wind power and large-scale wind farms not to attempt to ride roughshod
over local feelings, but to 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 448WH</b><br>consult and involve local people wherever possible. As the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, however, we now have an
opportunity to move beyond consultation and into involvement, and to
see a policy shift that supports and empowers community ownership and
involvement in smaller-scale generation. I would be interested to hear
the Minister&#146;s comments on that. The hon. Member for
Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) mentioned the good example
of Woking district council, where a partly community-owned company has
been instrumental in achieving a radical shift in the reduction of
CO2 emissions.</p><p><a name="06071261000113">There are concerns about
small-scale generation too. I note that even the Energy Saving Trust
has sounded a few alarm bells, particularly about the performance and
reliability of some of the products that are being rushed to market.
Kirk Archibald of the trust is quoted in <i>The Observer</i> on 25 June
as
saying:</p><a name="06071261000483"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;'There&#146;s
a lack of independent, verifiable evidence to support the performance
claims of turbines attached to buildings...There&#146;s been a
lot of hype and a lot of
interest&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000114">The right hon.
Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has rightly contributed to that a
little bit, but we could face a situation in which wind turbines are
rolled out but do not work. One consultant is quoted in the same
article as
saying:</p><a name="06071261000484"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;'We
found the performance of them is on average between 10 and 25
per cent. of what the manufacturers are
claiming.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000115">That is a
cause for concern, because we want microgeneration but we want it to be
as efficient as the manufacturers claim. We want the same regulation
that applies to solar panels to be as tough on wind turbine
manufacturers, so that they do not exploit people&#146;s good
intentions.</p><p><a name="06071261000116">More
worrying is a warning about the lateral thrust of turbines, which, as I
am sure hon. Members know, threatens any large chimney. Indeed, it is
said that a Victorian chimney stack in a high wind would be more than
sufficient to topple a turbine. The right hon. Gentleman might want to
check that the lateral thrust on his wind turbine is not going to
topple his Victorian chimney. If his neighbours are upset now, they
will be even more upset if that happens.</p><p><a name="06071261000117">There are obstacles to be
tackled and overcome, but climate change is on a wholly different
scale. It fundamentally threatens our way of life and our economy, and
the welfare and well-being not only of ourselves but of people in many
parts of the world. It is important that the Government continue their
commitment to renewable energy.</p><p><a name="06071261000118">I welcomed many of the things
in the Government&#146;s energy review yesterday, such as the
increase in the renewable obligations certificates, although there are
questions. I probably do not have time to discuss the matter fully now,
bearing in mind your remarks, Sir Nicholas, but the British
Wind Energy Association and others have expressed concern that in
supporting other renewables through the renewable obligation we should
not undermine support for onshore wind, simply because the others
become more economic in the process.</p><p><a name="06071261000119">Other areas of policy that can
support wind energy also need to be addressed, but as far as I can see
they have not been addressed in the energy review. One is the code for
sustainable buildings, which currently does not 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 449WH</b><br>support microgeneration explicitly and which is not even compulsory in
the energy efficiency measures that it supports. I would like the code
to become compulsory for new buildings and for an element of compulsion
to be included in microgeneration, so that perhaps all new buildings
could contribute to
it.</p><p><a name="06071261000120">Last October, the
Government&#146;s chief scientist called for support to be given for
hydrogen fuel cell technology, which is one way in which wind power
might contribute to the energy of the country without the problems of
intermittence to which the hon. Member for Clwyd, West referred. The
Government&#146;s chief scientist was quoted as saying that
Government bodies, industry, academia and other interests must work
much closer together to push the technology into the mass market. I
would be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on the
progress that is being made with that.</p><p><a name="06071261000121">There is the issue of grants
for microgeneration. In parliamentary answers to me, the Minister said
that the &#147;Clear skies&#148; programme ran for more than three
years and had a budget of &#163;13.25 million for household
microgeneration. Unfortunately, however, the household element of the
new low-carbon buildings fund&#151;which covers more than
households&#151;amounts to only &#163;6.5 million over three years.
That sounds like a halving of the budget for grants for household
microgeneration, but I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification on
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000122">There is also
the issue of nuclear power. As the hon. Member for Southampton, Test
implied&#151;but perhaps did not spell out&#151;the mere idea of
supporting the large-scale new development of nuclear power runs
counter to the idea of a decentralised and more efficient energy
generation system. More localised and distributed generation will be
more efficient, but the Government&#146;s policy towards nuclear
might undermine support for community generation.</p><p><a name="06071261000123">There are many positives to be
taken, however. I absolutely applaud the remarks that the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth made about community and
co-operatively-owned wind generation. I hope that the Minister will
take those remarks on board, but there are other policy questions to be
asked as
well.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000509">10.38
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000124"><b><a name="06071261000557">Mr.
Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b> All of us offer
our thanks to the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth
(Alun Michael) for initiating this debate, in which I hope there can be
a lot of cross-party agreement about what we are trying to achieve for
our country and for our planet.</p><p><a name="06071261000125">Renewable energy technology is
vital to the low-carbon energy future that we must achieve. Onshore
wind is currently the most economically viable renewable in the UK
market and provides more than 2 per cent. of our national
electricity demand&#151;the most of any single renewable
technology&#151;yet many other technologies and carbon-neutral
approaches are being neglected in comparison. Wave technology has shown
great potential, growth in photovoltaic cells is faster than ever
before, geothermal boreholes have the potential to decrease household
energy consumption 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 450WH</b><br>by up to 60 per cent. and we all know the list of other options, such as
biomass, tidal and offshore
wind.</p><p><a name="06071261000126">Yesterday the
Government launched their energy review. I take this opportunity to
congratulate the Minister on having behind him a worthy and
hard-working civil service team, without which I imagine that his
efforts would perhaps have been as desperate as ours&#151;I have had
to manage with one person and the office cat. We all need to reflect on
the stalwart qualities of the British Governmental apparatus in doing
all that hard work.</p>

<p><a name="06071261000127">We
are delighted that the Government have agreed with us and appreciated
the need to reform the renewables obligation, because that instrument
is important in promoting a wide range of renewable sources. We welcome
political consensus on this
proposal.</p><p><a name="06071261000128">In 1997, the
Prime Minister promised to put the environment at the top of the
agenda, but since then we have had nine years, six energy Ministers,
three energy reviews and our carbon emissions have increased. I am
told&#151;it is worth checking&#151;that we have the lowest level
of renewable power in Europe, except for Malta. Britain cannot be proud
of that track
record.</p><p><a name="06071261000129">We want action
across the political divide. Our policy is to try to spark a green
revolution, but we need to consider the regime of incentives governing
this sector. We want a long-term carbon-pricing regime, which will give
incentives for all forms of renewable technology so they can compete
against traditional fossil fuels and will thereby allow them to
flourish. We need reform of the renewables obligation to create the
required incentives for renewable energy
generally.</p><p><a name="06071261000130">Wind is
only one of a number of technologies that we need to help us target
carbon. The Carbon Trust published a report on Monday that damned the
current renewables obligation; it
said:</p><a name="06071261000485"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Without
additional support for offshore wind (and other renewable technology),
the development of offshore wind (and other renewable technology)
installations at scale in the UK will be held back; the UK renewable
energy targets will be missed by a wide margin, carbon reduction
targets will be harder to meet and an opportunity for renewable energy
to become a meaningful component of the UK's energy mix may
pass&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000131">The
problem is that the renewables obligation in its present form&#151;in
respect of which the Government said yesterday that there would be no
changes before 2009-10&#151;provides a significant incentive for
building wind farms at the expense of other renewable technologies. The
renewables obligation does not do enough to incentivise photovoltaic,
geothermal, wave and tidal technologies, and it does not do very much
to stimulate research into technologies that are still at the
experimental or prototype stage. Put simply, the renewables obligation
is the reason why there are so many applications to build wind farms
throughout the country. In some senses, that is a good thing, but it is
a bit of a one-card trick. Given the proliferation of applications for
ever-larger wind farms&#151;illustrated by my hon. Friend
the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr.
Jones)&#151;a level of local opposition is
understandable.</p><p><a name="06071261000132"><b><a name="06071261000558">Alun
Michael:</b> The thrust of the debate has been that local
opposition is not inevitable if the local community is empowered and
does not see it as something that is done to
them.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 451WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000133"><b><a name="06071261000559">Mr.
Duncan:</b> It is inevitable and recurrent, but it may be
overcome. At the moment there is a stand-off between the renewables
obligation pushing for these things and much popular opinion that is
wary of them arriving on their doorstep, but there is no proper
mechanism for marrying the two positions in a way that can engage
people in a proper, effective democratic process. That situation is
illustrated by the difference of opinion in the Chamber today. If the
issue were considered and people were taken to see the sites, there
might be far less disagreement, but the trouble is that that is not
happening.</p><p><a name="06071261000134">Once people
think that a wind farm might be located on a beauty spot, they
immediately resile from ever thinking that it might be all right. That
is what this debate is all about. It is not a simple them and us,
nimby/banana debate. People have fixed views and are either fervently
for or against wind farms. There is a lot of misunderstanding, as is
the case in so many areas of politics, life and everything on this
planet. Wind farms are a classic case of people wanting to protect
beauty spots and thinking that they cannot contribute, but not knowing
how to overcome their suspicions. We have further steps to take if we
are to address this matter properly. Wind has a part to play in a
low-carbon energy future, but over-reliance on it is the wrong way
forward and it may not be letting other technologies get a fair
look-in.</p><p><a name="06071261000135">Changes to
the renewables obligation are long overdue; we have been calling for
them since the last election. Although we have often been criticised by
the Government, they are now going to change things, which is good.
Their suggestion yesterday about creating bands within the renewables
obligation could be a part of the answer, but we should like to see
those implemented before 2009-10, unless there is clear evidence that
they will damage investment risk and decisions that are currently being
undertaken or are in the planning stage. The Government have to be
careful not to introduce new distortions when creating bands. It is not
easy, but we should always fly a warning flag on Government
intervention of this sort, because their action often has unforeseen
consequences. It should be the responsibility of the Government not to
pick the mix, but to create the right framework and the right
incentives.</p><p><a name="06071261000136">I do not
share Sir Bernard Ingham&#146;s view that windmills are all spin and
no substance; that jibe may be mythological, but it sounds like him.
They are good in the right place and are emissions-benign, but,
depending on people&#146;s views, they are either visually intrusive
or attractive. Divided opinion on this matter rests on an aesthetic
argument and a subjective judgment. I did not used to like the things,
but quite near my constituency there is a 10 turbine farm near
Kettering, which, with better technology, is rotating more slowly and
is very elegant and beautiful because it is in the right place.
Ultimately, it is a matter of where these things are and whether the
people who live near or around them find them palatable or
unpalatable.</p><p><a name="06071261000137">Whether
it is a matter of love or hate, nimby or banana, or whatever, the
argument is about scale and place, in trying to get the balance right,
we face asocial and political challenge. I hope that, in terms
of 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 452WH</b><br>financial incentives and the planning process, we can in the decades
ahead ensure that we get it right and let such sources play a part in a
low-carbon energy
future.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000510">10.46
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000138"><b><a name="06071261000560">The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> This has been an
important and timely debate, following the publication of the energy
review yesterday. We have to thank my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) for securing the
debate.</p><p><a name="06071261000139">My starting
point is that wind is a renewable, clean source of energy that is in
plentiful supply in this country. The idea of harnessing the power of
the wind is hardly new; in fact, it is pre-industrial. The presence of
windmills throughout the UK, some hundreds of years old, is testament
to that. I have no idea whether in those far-away days Conservative
Members of Parliament were tilting at windmills. With the occasional
exception today, we have heard a number of powerful speeches in favour
not just of the principle of wind energy, but of the practice. I do not
know whether that is a widespread
view.</p><p><a name="06071261000140">We are not
talking only about windmills, but the cutting edge of electricity
generation technology. The Government recognise that wind farm
developments have an important part to play in our energy mix, both in
the wider context of maintaining the security of our energy
supplies&#151;which is important as a form of home-grown energy at a
time of potentially large energy imports to this country over the
coming decades&#151;and in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.</p><p><a name="06071261000141">Wales is
already making a welcome contribution to renewable energy targets:
almost 25 per cent. of total UK onshore wind farm generating capacity
is located there. North Hoyle, our first large-scale wind farm to
generate electricity offshore, has been operating successfully for more
than two years.</p><p><a name="06071261000142">We
need to put this debate in the context of climate change, as several
hon. Members have done, not least my hon. Friend the Member
for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), whose expertise in this area we
value. A report published earlier this year, &#147;Avoiding dangerous
climate change&#148;, concluded that the risk of climate change is
probably even greater than we thought, but it also showed that much can
be done to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The report
suggests that a rise of just 2 C will be enough to cause a
tripling of poor harvests in Europe and Russia, large-scale
displacement of people in north Africa due to desertification and could
leave up to 2.8 billion people at risk of water
shortage.</p><p><a name="06071261000143">Other
evidence shows that this is not just theory. Global warming is having a
debilitating impact on many people at the moment in the form of rising
levels of children dying from malaria and diarrhoea, as a recent World
Health Organisation report showed. The effects could also include the
total loss of summer arctic sea ice, causing the potential extinction
of the polar bear and the walrus in
future.</p><p><a name="06071261000144">Action now
could help to avert the worst effects of climate change, but we should
not underestimate the scale of the task. Since 1990, global emissions
of carbon dioxide alone have risen by 20 per cent. The UK, however, is
making progress. We are ahead of our 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 453WH</b><br>Kyoto target, with estimates showing that carbon dioxide emissions will
be between 15 and 18 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. At the same
time, our economy has seen a 24 per cent. increase in gross domestic
product since 1997. Our experience shows that decarbonisation need not
damage economic growth, although we obviously need to go further,
improving that important hypothesis. We have set an aim of a 60 per
cent. reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. Nothing less than a
radical change in how we generate and use energy will be needed, and
renewable energy can help to deliver
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000145">Let me comment
more specifically on wind energy. We have set a target to supply 10 per
cent. of our electricity from renewable sources by 2010, and we expect
the largest contribution up to 2010 to come from wind, both onshore and
offshore. Currently, wind is one of the most economic renewable
technologies, which is why it is doing so well. Last year, we saw more
than 440 MW of new wind capacity built&#151;356 MW onshore and 90 MW
offshore&#151;which is a record so far. A further 479 MW is under
construction, including the 90 MW Barrow offshore wind farm, which is
due to be commissioned next month. If we meet our 10 per cent. target,
we will save 2.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, based on 1990
levels if the equivalent had been generated from gas. That is why it is
important that we take action now and why wind is key in tackling the
problem of climate
change.</p><p><a name="06071261000146">Yesterday, the
energy review was published and the Government announced that we were
making changes to the way in which we support renewable energy, to help
us to go further and faster. The renewables obligation has been very
successful so far in driving renewable generation. That has more than
doubled in the four years since the introduction of the obligation. The
cheapest renewable technologies, such as onshore wind and landfill gas,
have done well under the obligation, but there is still a lot of
potential in that respect that we want to tap. However, those
technologies can take us only so far. There are only so many landfill
sites and suitably windy sites for wind farms
onshore.</p><p><a name="06071261000147">To achieve
the step change, we will need to go beyond 10 per cent. renewables and
get towards our 20 per cent. aspiration. We will also need
emerging technologies, especially offshore wind, to do more, but those
emerging technologies are not yet really taking off, because of their
cost. As a result, the Government announced yesterday two major changes
to strengthen and widen the impact of the renewables obligation. First,
we shall extend the obligation up to 20 per cent. renewables. We shall
not do that in fixed steps, as we do up to 15 per cent. Instead, we
shall raise the obligation only when that is justified by growth in
renewables.</p><p><a name="06071261000148">Secondly,
we shall consult on banding the renewables obligation&#151;that is,
providing greater support for emerging technologies and less for
established ones. The hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones) called
for that, and we responded yesterday to that request. In doing that, we
will protect existing investments where possible, to maintain investor
confidence in the renewables obligation.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 454WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000149"><b><a name="06071261000561">Martin

analysis and values: if communities feel that outsiders are coming in

community will be hostile. If the community can be involved in a range
of ways, it is more likely that projects will be
encouraged.</p><p><a name="06071261000156">The
Renewables Advisory Board commissioned a study in 2005 entitled
&#147;Community Benefits from Wind Power: A study of UK practice and

second is on public engagement protocols for wind power projects, and
the third is on bankable models for community ownership of wind farms.

<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 455WH</b><br>Wales. I am pleased that the initiative has been sustained; indeed, in
March the Government announced more than &#163;400,000 of additional
funding for the initiative. My hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe
was instrumental in helping to deliver that. So far, the initiative has
helped 91 community renewable energy projects, and 294 projects are
also nearing completion, so it is an important
initiative.</p><p><a name="06071261000159">I should
also mention the low carbon buildings programme, because we now have
some &#163;80 million to spend on microgeneration. That will enable
us, in different community buildings, not least schools, to bring some
of the ideas about co-operation and community to life. Only yesterday,
I was at the Ashburton learning village, which involves a community
school in my borough of Croydon. There is the most fantastic array of
photovoltaics on the new building. It was a delight to hear the young
students and teachers telling me how they are learning about energy and
the environment through using renewables in their
school.</p><p><a name="06071261000160">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and other colleagues
will see that in the energy review we talk about the importance of
distributed energy. We say that we will
investigate</p><a name="06071261000488"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
potential of distributed energy as a long-term alternative or
supplement&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000161">to our
current highly centralised system. There is much in the review to
encourage my right hon. Friend. I am interested in the themes that he
introduces. It is important, when developments affect communities, that
the communities are on board in one or different ways. Where there can
be community ownership, I would welcome
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000162">I again
congratulate my right hon. Friend and all other contributors to what
has been a useful debate. I am interested in the themes of co-operation
and community involvement and I hope that we can discuss that in the
future both formally, in the Chamber, and more informally with
colleagues.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 456WH</b><br>

<h3 align="center"><a name="06071261000003">Allan
Bennett</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000511">11
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000163"><b><a name="06071261000567">Mr.
Eric Illsley (Barnsley, Central) (Lab):</b> I am grateful for
the opportunity to bring up the case of my constituent, Mr. Allan
Bennett. He is a 67-year-old former social worker who was convicted in
2003 of offences against children in his care that were alleged to have
occurred between 1978 and 1981. I believe that my constituent did not
receive a fair trial and that his treatment since he has been
incarcerated in Frankland prison amounts to nothing short of
harassment. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider some
of the points that I make and look at how my constituent is being
treated in prison. I realise that my hon. Friend has no responsibility
for the courts and the legal service, but by way of background I would
like to say a few words about how my constituent came to be in this
predicament.</p><p><a name="06071261000164">Mr.
Bennett was convicted on the evidence of two individuals who have both
since claimed and been paid compensation, so there was a financial
incentive for them to make the allegations. He was convicted on
evidence that was obtained under the police trawling system that was
prevalent at that time, whereby individuals were offered compensation
in return for making allegations against people in care homes. I do not
condone any sort of criminal activity in care homes, but I feel that my
constituent has had a poor deal.</p><p><a name="06071261000165">My constituent&#146;s first
barrister committed suicide. His second barrister, in whom he had great
confidence, decided two weeks before the trial that he could not take
the case further, because he was involved in another case which he
thought might overrun. His third barrister took on the case at two
weeks&#146; notice, and was refused an adjournment by the trial
judge, despite the fact that evidence was introduced one and a half
hours before the trial began. Needless to say, Mr. Bennett was
convicted. He has since been imprisoned at Frankland prison as a
category B prisoner. He is a 67-year-old pensioner, and he is
incarcerated in a high-security
prison.</p><p><a name="06071261000166">Mr. Bennett
received a sentence of 11 years for offences that were alleged to have
occurred 20 years ago, for which there was no corroborative evidence.
He was convicted on the word of his two accusers. In those
circumstances, such a sentence beggars belief. It was reduced to eight
years on appeal, but when one considers sentencing policy today, which
as my hon. Friend knows is the subject of huge debate, especially in
relation to foreign prisoners, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants,
one must question why a British citizen&#151;even if he did commit
those crimes; he will contest his convictions to his dying
day&#151;should be sentenced to 11 years by a judge after a trial in
which he was legally represented by a barrister for only two weeks.
That seems rather
strange.</p><p><a name="06071261000167">During his
time in prison, my constituent has been subjected to&#151;shall we
say&#151;unusual treatment. My hon. Friend knows that I have raised
the issue of the search and visitors regimes at Frankland prison,
because I have written to him about them. I have received letters from
both the head of resettlement at the prison and my hon. Friend about
the matter.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 457WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000168">I asked the prison governor
whether my constituent should be kept in high-security conditions as a
category B prisoner at the age of 67. The letter of reply of
21 June from the head of resettlement states:</p><a name="06071261000489"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Although this sentence
was reduced to 8 years on appeal, the offences were considered
extremely serious and a serious breach of trust because the victims
were both known to him as a result of his employment in residential
social work. One offence of buggery was against a boy in his care as
Assistant Principal of an Assessment Centre. The other offence of
buggery and indecent assault was brought by a man who had been in the
Children&#146;s Home of which Mr Bennett was Deputy Officer in Charge
in the mid 1970s and with whom he had remained in contact throughout
his life.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000169">In fact, the
reverse is the case. Mr. Bennett had not remained in contact with that
man throughout his life; the man had remained in contact with Mr.
Bennett. Mr. Bennett and his wife were guests at the man&#146;s first
wedding. When that marriage collapsed, the man formed another
relationship and married again, in Suffolk. At that wedding, Mr.
Bennett was introduced as his surrogate father. When that marriage
collapsed, the man came to Mr. Bennett time and again to seek advice
and assistance.</p><p><a name="06071261000170">When
the first allegations against Mr. Bennett were made by the first
individual, he went to the man with whom he had remained in contact
throughout his life to ask for a character reference to put before the
court. He sought that man out to stand as a witness at his trial. When
Mr. Bennett refused to pay him the &#163;5,000 loan for which he
asked and to provide him with a character reference to persuade the
immigration authorities to allow his new girlfriend to enter the
country, he refused to be a character witness for Mr. Bennett
and then made allegations against him. That shows how big a travesty of
justice this case has been, and it is one example of how people in this
country are treated by our legal system.</p><p><a name="06071261000171">Compared with some of the
sentences that are given out these days, it is incredible that a man of
67 can be sentenced to 11 years in a high-security prison. Murderers do
not get 11 years these days; anyone committing murder these days will
be out on the streets well before 11 years is up. My constituent
refuses to admit his guilt&#151;his religious convictions preclude
him from admitting to offences that he did not commit&#151;so he will
not qualify for parole and will have to serve the full length of his
sentence. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister why is my constituent in
high-security conditions? Why is he&#151;a 67-year-old who poses no
threat to anybody&#151;in HMP Frankland as a category B
prisoner?</p><p><a name="06071261000172">Since my
constituent has been incarcerated, he has not been entitled to receive
his pension. Therefore, not only is he being punished for his crimes,
but his wife does not receive the retirement pension that she was
receiving before his conviction. Not only has a financial penalty been
imposed on her, but she has to find the wherewithal to visit her
husband in Frankland prison.</p><p><a name="06071261000173">On occasion, Mrs. Bennett has
complained about the way in which she and her relatives have been
treated when they have visited her husband. Last year, Mr.
Bennett&#146;s daughter travelled from Australia to visit him in
Frankland. On her arrival at the prison, she was told that because the
sniffer dog had become a little 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 458WH</b><br>agitated as she passed it, she would not be entitled to an open visit,
and that she could either have a closed visit or re-book. As she had
come from Australia, the idea of re-booking was a bit of a no-no. She
offered to be strip searched so that the prison authorities could check
whether she had anything about her person that could be regarded as
contraband, but that offer was refused.</p><p><a name="06071261000174">After travelling all the way
from Australia, that situation might be regarded as unfortunate; it
could just be a sad case of having travelled all that way but that,
under the rules, that was the daughter&#146;s lot. However, it
happened again. When Mr. Bennett&#146;s brother-in-law travelled from
Canada to the same prison to visit Mr. Bennett, he, too, was refused an
open visit and told that he could have only a closed visit or re-book.
Why on two occasions have visitors travelling huge distances been
refused visits to a 67-year-old pensioner in Frankland high-security
prison? It beggars belief.</p><p><a name="06071261000175">My constituent is required to
undergo a strip search every time he moves in and out of the visiting
area. We are talking about a 67-year-old man who is made to strip and
to &#147;pirouette&#148;, as he described it in his complaint to
the prison governor. In other words, he must turn around so that his
genitals and buttocks can be examined by a prison officer. That is
degrading and humiliating. The next time that Mr. Bennett was strip
searched after he had complained to the governor, the prison officer
said to him, &#147;Ah, Mr. Bennett, pirouette please.&#148; His
complaint form had been passed to the staff, and they began to deride
him and humiliate him even further by using his exact words. That is
humiliation and harassment of a 67-year-old pensioner who maintains his
innocence.</p><p><a name="06071261000176">Mr.
Bennett also complained that his post had been opened and interfered
with; his airmail letters from his daughter in Australia had been
opened, read and returned to him. When he complained about that, he was
told, &#147;Yes, your letters have been opened. It was a mistake and
we will ensure that it does not happen again.&#148; That is not the
case; this man is being targeted, his post is being opened and
interfered with, and he is being
humiliated.</p><p><a name="06071261000177">Mr. Bennett&#146;s family is
also suffering that humiliation; not just Mr. Bennett but his wife and
children are being punished. Even if he is guilty of the offences of
which he has been convicted, surely his family should not be treated as
criminals in the same way. Surely they should be able to visit him
without having to be harassed; surely when his children travel large
distances they should be able to visit their father without receiving
such treatment.</p><p><a name="06071261000178">I
have made it plain that I feel that this man has been unfairly treated
by the Prison Service, even if he is guilty. I had to telephone him
yesterday, because I was worried that my raising this debate would mean
that the treatment would worsen. A letter that he sent to me on Monday
contained a form that he had been asked to sign by a prison officer
agreeing to the release of information from his file. It occurred to me
that the Frankland authorities were trying to frighten him away from
allowing this debate to go ahead by indicating that their making him
sign that form would mean that information would be made public during
the debate that might embarrass or humiliate him even further. I 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 459WH</b><br>know that the Minister will dispute that, and I hope he will tell me
that the procedure is normal. The way that this man has been treated
tends to suggest that if he complains any further the treatment will
worsen.</p><p><a name="06071261000179">In conclusion,
I must ask the Minister whether the Government really feel that a
67-year-old pensioner who was convicted on uncorroborated evidence of
offences dating back 20 years should be regarded as a high-security
prisoner. Mr. Bennett has indicated that he will serve the full
sentence, because he refuses to admit his guilt. Could the sentence be
carried out in less extreme circumstances than those in which he finds
himself
today?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000512">11.15
am</h5><p><a name="06071261000180"><b><a name="06071261000568">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr.
Gerry Sutcliffe):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member
for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing this debate,
which, as he says, concerns one of his constituents. I fully recognise
and understand the passion and strength of feeling that he has shown
towards his constituent in this case. He knows that in my ministerial
career I look closely at the detail of issues that hon. Members from
all parts of the House raise with me. I hope that he will
understand the limitations placed on what I am able to say about the
sentencing policy. He wants me to go down a particular route that is
not my area of responsibility, and he will know that there has been a
great deal of media awareness about Home Office Ministers talking about
sentencing policy involving the judiciary.</p><p><a name="06071261000181">As my hon.
Friend said, Mr. Bennett&#146;s case has already been the subject of
correspondence between my hon. Friend and myself, and he has also
corresponded directly with Her Majesty&#146;s prison Frankland. The
permission that was sought from and granted by Mr. Bennett to discuss
his case today is normal procedure. If we had not got that permission,
I would not have been able to put lots of things on the record today.
In addition, the fact that Mr. Bennett has no outstanding appeal is
relevant to the remarks that I can make. Had an appeal been ongoing, I
would not have been able to make the comments that I am going to make
today. I thank Mr. Bennett for giving us the permission to enable me to
say the things that I will say
today.</p><p><a name="06071261000182">As my hon.
Friend said, Allan Bennett is a 67-year-old prisoner currently located
at HMP Frankland, a high-security prison near Durham. He was convicted
and sentenced on 16 December 2003 at Sheffield Crown court to 11
years&#146; imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and
sentence, and was refused leave to appeal against conviction but had
his sentence reduced to eight years. His offences, which he continues
to deny, took place more than 20 years ago, while he was working as a
residential social worker, as my hon. Friend said. I do not intend to
go into detail about the offences. However, as a result of Mr.
Bennett&#146;s conviction, he will remain on the sex offenders
register for life and is also subject to safeguarding children
measures.</p><p><a name="06071261000183">On the
subject of Mr. Bennett&#146;s denial of guilt, as I explained to my
hon. Friend in a letter of 27 June, at the time of his trial the courts
would have had the opportunity to hear and consider all the evidence
presented to them. The Prison Service has to deal with Mr. Bennett on
the basis of his being guilty of the serious offences of which he was
convicted.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 460WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000184">Perhaps it would be appropriate
at this stage to say something about the conditions in which Mr.
Bennett is held. Frankland is a high-performing prison, rated at level
4, which is the highest rating available. It has been so since the
ratings were introduced in 2002. Prisons operating at that level are
assessed to be:</p><a name="06071261000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Exceptionally high
performing, consistently meeting or exceeding targets...no
significant operating problems, achieving significantly more than
similar establishments with similar resources&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000186">That does not mean that every decision
made in every level 4 prison is correct, that every procedure is
carried out 100 per cent. correctly or that every prisoner&#146;s
experience of custody is exactly as he or she would want it to be, but
it does set Frankland in context: as a prison which is performing very
well across the piece.</p><p><a name="06071261000187">Mr. Bennett is a category B
vulnerable prisoner located on B wing, the specific needs wing, which
holds and has a regime more suited to elderly prisoners. B
wing has a special needs landing which holds older prisoners who do not
warrant 24-hour health care, although there is a nurse assigned to the
landing. Mr. Bennett is not in employment because he is
retired, but I understand that he attends the gym and undertakes
part-time education three times a week, studying
IT.</p><p><a name="06071261000188">Mr. Bennett denies
his offence, so no offence-related work has been carried out. He was
last asked about his offence in 2004, when he continued to deny it and
stated that he would not take part in the sex offender treatment
programme or the enhanced thinking skills programme because he was
appealing against conviction. Mr. Bennett is on the sex offender
treatment programme database as a denier/refuser. He will be revisited
by a member of the psychology department later this month to gauge his
level of involvement with the SOTP and an assessment will be made by
the end of the month.</p><p><a name="06071261000189">Mr. Bennett&#146;s most
recent sentence plan was completed on 2 March 2004 at Doncaster.
Frankland has a backlog of sentence plans, so Mr. Bennett has not had
one since arriving in 2004, but the prison has undertaken to commence
one in the next couple of weeks. I am sure that both my hon. Friend
and Mr. Bennett will be pleased with that news.</p><p><a name="06071261000190">In his letter to me of 10 June,
my hon. Friend questioned the suitability of Frankland as a location
for his constituent, as he did again today. In my response to him, I
pointed out that, after his conviction, Mr. Bennett was classified as a
category B prisoner and was eventually transferred to Frankland so that
he might participate in offending behaviour work. Although Frankland is
in the high-security estate, it holds a number of category B prisoners.
Indeed, they make up about 75 per cent. of its
population.</p><p><a name="06071261000191">A prisoner
must demonstrate a reduction in risk if he is to move forward by
achieving a lower security category. By declining to undertake any
offending behaviour work, Mr. Bennett has been unable to demonstrate a
reduction to justify a lower security category. Perhaps significantly,
given the comments of my hon. Friend, in the two and a half years
that Mr. Bennett has been at Frankland he has not requested a
transfer. There is no real reason why he could not be transferred to a
non-high-security prison, 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 461WH</b><br>but because he has never applied for a transfer or had a sentence plan,
that has not been considered since his arrival at Frankland. Mr.
Bennett would require category B conditions unless his sentence
planning board advocated a change of category. Prisons closer to his
home area of Barnsley in which SOTP is available are Full Sutton,
Wakefield, Hull and Manchester.</p><p><a name="06071261000192">Mr. Bennett is described, both
by staff on his wing and by others, as polite, courteous and compliant
with the regime. He is reported as saying that he gets on well with the
staff. His level on the incentives and earned privileges scheme is
enhanced. Mr. Bennett has had no disciplinary adjudications
since he arrived at Frankland, and his behaviour while at Frankland is
very much to his credit. Mr. Bennett is subject to Prison Service order
4400, and as such is not allowed children visitors. He has received
visits from a number of adult members of his family, who remain
supportive.</p><p><a name="06071261000193">My hon.
Friend raised the issue of Mr. Bennett being strip searched in a manner
that the latter found demeaning and humiliating. My hon. Friend wrote
to me on 16 May, enclosing two letters from Mr. Bennett; he has already
gone into how Mr. Bennett is searched before and after visits, so I do
not intend to repeat the detail, but it might help my hon. Friend if I
set out the context of the searching of Mr. Bennett. The Prison Service
has a well established policy for the full searching, previously known
as strip searching, of prisoners. It is set out in function 3 of the
national security
framework.</p><p><a name="06071261000194">All prisons
are required to have a searching strategy, setting out the frequency of
searching across the establishment. It is recognised that a good
searching strategy is not just intended to uncover unauthorised items
but to act as a deterrent to prisoners and others. The techniques need
to be thorough if illicit items are to be discovered, otherwise there
would be no point in searching anyone. However, due attention should be
paid to the privacy of the person being searched. The searching
strategy must be proportionate to the potential threat to security or
to the control of establishments. That is why prisoners held in
high-security establishments are subject to more searching than those
in lower category prisons. The full searching of such prisoners is
necessary in the interests of security, to protect the public, and to
provide a safer environment for prisoners, staff and
visitors.</p><p><a name="06071261000195">The full
searching of all prisoners in reception and on leaving a prison are
mandatory requirements of the national security framework. So, too, are
cell searches, which must always be accompanied by a full search of
prisoners. Prisoners held in higher category establishments are subject
to more routine searching. The method used for full searching is the
same irrespective of the security level of the prison. The national
security framework includes step-by-step instructions on how full
searches must be conducted for both male and female prisoners. I know
that when the security manager at Frankland wrote to my hon. Friend on
18 May he enclosed a number of documents that set out the
procedure.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 462WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000196">Essentially, a full search
constitutes a detailed visual search of the body, including ears, nose,
mouth and hair. It must be carried out by two officers of the same sex
as the subject and must be done out of sight of members of the opposite
sex. The top and lower halves of prisoners&#146; clothing must be
removed separately so that the person being searched is not totally
naked at any time. That is the point that I would like to emphasise, as
that was the focus of Mr. Bennett&#146;s complaint. He was treated no
differently from any other prisoner in that respect.</p><p><a name="06071261000197">All searching staff must adhere
to the procedures and are given appropriate training to equip them with
the skills to undertake the task in a sensitive manner. The manner and
purposes for which full searches are conducted are consistent with the
European convention on human rights and prison rule 41(2), which
requires that searches be carried out in as &#147;seemly&#148; a
manner as is consistent with finding anything concealed. Our methods
are still the most effective and least intrusive known to achieve the
ends. My hon. Friend also mentioned the claim that, at a search, staff
used the term &#147;pirouette&#148; to describe the physical
movement of turning around, in order to humiliate Mr. Bennett. The
prison told me that it can find no evidence that the term, if it was
indeed used, was used maliciously.</p><p><a name="06071261000198">As I said at the outset, I do
not doubt the sincerity of my hon. Friend&#146;s compassion about Mr.
Bennett&#146;s case, and I know that my hon. Friend is concerned
about the sentence and what has happened to Mr.
Bennett. He continues to champion Mr. Bennett&#146;s case. My hon.
Friend will know that he needs to speak to other colleagues, perhaps in
the Department for Constitutional Affairs, about the case. On Mr.
Bennett&#146;s treatment in prison, I undertake to look further into
what my hon. Friend has said in light of today&#146;s debate, to see
what can be done.</p><p><a name="06071261000199">There is a good relationship
between Mr. Bennett and the prison staff at Frankland. We believe that
he has not been treated any differently from any other prisoner. The
respect and dignity agenda in prisons has improved the situation
dramatically; it is very different from what it was in years gone by. I
undertake to look again at the circumstances relating to Mr. Bennett. I
know that my hon. Friend will continue to be an advocate for him, not
only in terms of his life in prison, but in terms of the details of the
case.</p><p><a name="06071261000200">I wholeheartedly
agree with what my hon. Friend said about the family. The family should
not in any way be held responsible for the actions of Mr. Bennett. We
should be as sympathetic as possible, but we have to measure that
sympathetic approach against the security conditions in our prisons. My
hon. Friend will know that the prison population, security in prisons
and prison capacity are high on the political agenda. I shall not be
tempted to go down that route of commenting on sentencing guidelines,
but I know that my hon. Friend will have the opportunity to speak to
the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General about
the case. I look forward to hearing what progress he makes. I end by
saying that I do not doubt my hon. Friend&#146;s sincerity on this
matter, and I am sure that we will discuss the case
further.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000513">11.28

another.</p><p><a name="06071261000203"><b><a name="06071261000570">Mr.
David Gauke (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> I am
grateful for the opportunity to speak this afternoon on changes to NHS
services in Hertfordshire. Before I do so, I want to pay tribute to the
many thousands of people who work for the NHS in Hertfordshire and do a
difficult job very well. Although I shall highlight some of the
difficulties that we face with the NHS in Hertfordshire, I do not want
to detract from the great efforts made by those staff.</p><p><a name="06071261000204">The debate this afternoon is
about changes to NHS services in Hertfordshire, but to be honest we
face something that could easily be described as a crisis. I shall
outline some of the difficulties that we face. I shall start with the
primary care trusts, of which there are eight. All eight are in deficit
and under special financial measures, with a cumulative deficit of
&#163;37 million in 2005-06.</p><p><a name="06071261000205">We must bear in mind when
considering such deficits the average per capita allocation to
Hertfordshire. In 2005-06, the average per capita allocation was
&#163;986, which is &#163;109 less than the average in England. If
we had &#163;34 more per head&#151;still &#163;75 less than the
English average&#151;the deficits in Hertfordshire&#146;s PCTs
would be wiped out. There is another way of looking at it, which is
quite constructive when we consider the whole issue. We receive
approximately 90 per cent. of the English average, and if we were to
receive 93 per cent. there would be no deficits in our PCTs and we
would not face the current crisis.</p><p><a name="06071261000206"><b><a name="06071261000571">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> Would not
another way of putting it be to say that if we had roughly the same
amount as the Minister&#146;s constituency we would be
fine?</p><p><a name="06071261000207"><b><a name="06071261000572">Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is absolutely right. There is a broader issue.
To open out the debate for a moment, Hertfordshire is just one example
of a county in south-east England that is facing great difficulties. We
could consider Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of London and
we would find that the difficulties are concentrated in the south-east,
in the areas that receive below average per capita funding. There must
be a question about the formula. I gave advance notice to the Minister
and hope that she will be able to address the issue of the formula that
is used in Hertfordshire and whether there are any plans to change it,
as it seems to me that there is something wrong with the balance. I can
see the argument that deprivation might be a factor, but the balance
does not seem to be right when there is such a concentration of
deficits in counties such as Hertfordshire.</p><p><a name="06071261000208">I come now to the changes that
we are debating. PCTs are having to undertake substantial cuts. A front
page story in the Hemel <i>Gazette</i> today concerns a letter leaked
from a GP in my constituency highlighting that 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 464WH</b><br>there might well be cuts in district nurses and health visitors in
Dacorum PCT. Mental health, too, is an area of enormous concern. I want
to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr.
Walker), who cannot be in the Chamber today because he is in Scotland
on Select Committee business, because he has undertaken two Adjournment
debates and worked tirelessly to raise the profile of the matter.
Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust must reduce its spending by 5 per
cent.&#151;&#163;5.6 million&#151;despite never having been in
deficit because the PCTs require it. We are seeing substantial cuts and
both in-patient and out-patient services are suffering as a
consequence. Another area that has been particularly affected is that
of sexual health services. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for
St. Albans (Anne Main) will catch your eye, Mr. Hancock. She has worked
tirelessly in this field and highlighted the many difficulties we face.
</p><p><a name="06071261000209">The issue of
hospitals is perhaps the most emotive and the one that concerns my
constituents maybe more than any other. Both of our hospital trusts are
in deficit: East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust has a deficit of
&#163;22.38 million and has announced 500 job losses, while my
hospital trust, West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, has a deficit
that is even greater at &#163;28.38 million and has already incurred
about 250 job losses, with another 500 or so to go. In total,
Hertfordshire hospital trusts will lose 1,250 jobs, and we are talking
about not only administrators but health care
professionals&#151;doctors and nurses&#151;whose jobs will be going
as a consequence of the cuts.</p><p><a name="06071261000210">I want briefly to give some
history of the development of hospital services in west Hertfordshire.
A few years ago, there was a process called &#147;Investing in Your
Health&#148;, which considered the reconfiguration of hospital
services in west Hertfordshire. It concluded that the way forward was
to downgrade Hemel Hempstead general hospital to a non-acute site. That
caused enormous concern to people in Hemel Hempstead and beyond, in my
constituency and places such as Berkhamsted and Tring. My hon. Friend
the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) has worked tirelessly to
defend Hemel Hempstead hospital and has been a champion of the people
of Hemel Hempstead on that point.</p><p><a name="06071261000211">The conclusion was reached that
Watford general hospital would be redeveloped and that acute services
would be moved from Hemel Hempstead. I do not intend to re-open that
debate, but I can fully understand why people who use Hemel Hempstead
are worried about services being more distant. There was one
consolation at the time of &#147;Investing in Your Health&#148;,
which was that there would be a fantastic new hospital at Watford, and
that services would not be moved until that hospital was built. The
reality, however, will be somewhat different.</p><p><a name="06071261000212">Services are on the move
already. The birthing centre in Hemel Hempstead has closed, as has a
ward for elderly patients, and there is more to come. Services have
already been transferred to Watford, a hospital that I know well as I
have had two children born there. Nobody, however big a fan they were
of Watford, could say anything other than that it is a poorly designed
site with outdated buildings, which is cramped and has little capacity.
It is right next to Vicarage Road football ground, which I am pleased
to 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 465WH</b><br>say will be a premiership ground next season and is also used by
Saracens. To get to the hospital on a match day is almost impossible,
and even not on a match day it is difficult because transport links are
not good. However, it is proposed that more services should be moved to
Watford now.</p><p><a name="06071261000213">I know,
having asked the chief executive of the hospital trust, that during the
course of the winter there were a number of occasions when notes were
sent out to doctors, GPs and primary health care providers that Watford
hospital was, effectively, full. That was in the winter and came before
the closure of many of the acute services at Hemel Hempstead and their
transferral to Watford.</p><p><a name="06071261000214">How on earth will Watford cope
in the interim period? By spring 2007, virtually all Hemel&#146;s
services will be gone. One might say that it is only an interim period
of six years, but there is now severe doubt that we will get the new
Watford hospital at all. It is supposed to be there by 2013. I will be
grateful if the Minister can throw some light on the process. I know
that one of her colleagues answered a parliamentary question on the
subject in June, but it seems that we may have to wait some time before
finding out whether the private finance initiative for Watford is to
proceed. I sincerely hope that it will, because without it we will have
the worst of both worlds, with Hemel losing its services but with no
new facilities being made available for anyone in west Hertfordshire. I
am greatly concerned about the matter, and I must ask how it has
progressed.</p><p><a name="06071261000215">Not long
after being elected to this place last year, my hon. Friend the Member
for Hemel Hempstead and I met the chief executive of West Hertfordshire
Hospitals NHS Trust and its then chairman. At that point they were
already talking about bringing forward the reconfiguration of hospital
services from 2013, because word had come from the strategic health
authority that deficits had to be reduced; there had been a change of
focus. Indeed, the same would have been said by the primary care
trusts&#151;that there had been a change of focus last
year.</p><p><a name="06071261000216">I have given
the Minister advance warning about my question, but when precisely did
that change happen? I have been here only a year and I hope that I am
not becoming a cynical politician, but we heard little from the
Government before the last general election about the need to balance
the books and to reduce the deficits. That change of focus seemed to
occur, almost to the day, immediately after the general election. That
is something that the Government must answer. Before the last general
election, Labour had five marginal seats in Hertfordshire; it now has
only two&#151;and I hope the number will fall. None the less, the
Government seem to have changed their focus. I should be grateful if
the Minister answered that
point.</p><p><a name="06071261000217"><b><a name="06071261000573">Grant
Shapps (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con):</b> Has my hon. Friend had the
chance to reflect on the fact that only two areas are now promised
investment&#151;Watford and Stevenage. Is there is any correlation
between that and the occupancy of those
seats?</p><p><a name="06071261000218"><b><a name="06071261000574">Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes a characteristically astute
point. He has been a tireless campaigner for the 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 466WH</b><br>new site at Hatfield. I hope that he has the opportunity to raise the
subject later today. It was a PFI site, but it has already been
downgraded and it may not proceed. Again, I hope that the Minister will
be able to speak about that.</p><p><a name="06071261000219">Hertfordshire is being treated
poorly. Its funding formula is working against it, and it has crumbling
and out-of-date facilities that may not be replaced. We have seen
substantial staff reductions and plummeting staff morale, and services
are being cut. The Government have not listened to the people of
Hertfordshire for many years. I hope that they will listen today to
what is happening there, because we are seeing the appalling running
down of our services. As can be seen by the strong showing of
Hertfordshire Members, the people of Hertfordshire will not tolerate it
for much
longer.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000515">2.43
pm</h5><p><a name="06071261000220"><b><a name="06071261000575">Mr.
Peter Lilley (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</b> I echo the
tribute paid by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire
(Mr. Gauke) to NHS staff, who are dedicated, devoted and
hard-working.</p><p><a name="06071261000221">I have
represented a Hertfordshire constituency for nearly a quarter of a
century, and this is the worst crisis that the NHS has ever faced
during that time. The words &#147;cuts&#148; and
&#147;crisis&#148; have been used fairly frequently over the past
20 years, but throughout that time they meant a reduction in the
anticipated growth in spending or employment. This is the first time
that we have known a real crisis.</p><p><a name="06071261000222">It is a crisis of jobs. The two
hospital trusts that serve my constituency each plan to shed 500
jobs&#151;a total of 1,000. That is clearly only the start, because
those cuts meet only a portion of the savings that the trusts have been
told to make. Those cuts include nurses and doctors as well as the
vital staff who back them up.</p><p><a name="06071261000223">It is a crisis of hospitals.
Harpenden memorial hospital in my constituency is to lose all its
hospital beds; effectively, it is to be closed as an in-patient
hospital. It is clear that of the two hospitals that serve the East and
North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, one is likely to be downgraded to little
more than a cottage hospital. The promise of a new super-hospital at
Hatfield that was floated and talked about assiduously before the
election has now been downgraded from one costing &#163;500 million
that would have included a new cancer unit to one that will cost at
most &#163;300 million or &#163;400 million; and within that
envelope it will be impossible to include a new cancer unit&#151;if
it ever goes ahead.</p><p><a name="06071261000224">It
is a crisis of trust. At a public meeting that I chaired last
September, my constituents expressed concern about rumours that the
Harpenden memorial hospital might be closed. The PCT said at that
meeting that it had considered all the options and that it had decided
that it was an economic, efficient and caring way of providing health
care for local people and that it wanted to build on that provision.
Eight months later, it announced that every bed was to go. It is a
crisis of trust in the management of the
PCT.</p><p><a name="06071261000225">It is also a
crisis of trust in the Secretary of State. I asked her the other day
why the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust will have to cut a
quarter of its spending&#151;&#163;66 million of a total of
&#163;267 million over the next three years. She said that the
Department 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 467WH</b><br>did not require any cuts in its budget, just that it should live within
its budget. However, the figures that I cite are from the press release
of the national health service, so someone is not to be trusted. I fear
that the Secretary of State must have been ill-informed. We therefore
cannot trust what she says about our local health service.</p><p><a name="06071261000226">It is a crisis of care. The new
model of care is designed to discourage and if possible prevent GPs
referring patients to hospitals. A target has been set for the number
of such referrals to be reduced by 50 per cent. In six areas, the
target is a reduction of 80 per cent. in the number of patients being
referred to hospitals. I have no objection to people being treated at
home or elsewhere better than or as well as in hospital, or even more
efficiently. However, setting a target rather than saying that the
Department would provide the best form of care, whatever the outcome
may be, is dangerous. It makes clear that this reduction in care is
being imposed as a result of budget stringency.</p><p><a name="06071261000227">At a street meeting last
Friday, my constituents asked one question&#151;why is this
happening? If there has been such an increase in NHS expenditure, why
for the first time in their recollection are 1,000 jobs to go? Why are
hospitals to be closed? Why is care being rationed? They want to know.
I cannot tell them. Will the Minister give us an explanation that we
can give to our
constituents?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000516">2.48
pm</h5><p><a name="06071261000228"><b><a name="06071261000576">Anne
Main (St. Albans) (Con):</b> I almost do not know where to
begin. Many of us share services; we do not all have our own hospitals
or clinics. As a result, many of the cuts to services in other
constituencies will affect my constituents. I was particularly touched
by the tale of a nurse who lives in my constituency. She works in a
thrombolysis unit in Hemel Hempstead. She told me that if that unit is
relocated to Watford, nobody, including the staff, will have any
confidence that the target of getting treatment within the target time
of half an hour will be met. People who need to get there on a match
day will not have that life saving injection into the heart, whereas
the system works in Hemel Hempstead.</p><p><a name="06071261000229">Other shared services include
podiatry and sexual health services. I have a number of letters from my
constituents listing the cuts that they have been asked to face, some
in my constituency and some just outside it. For example, there are the
cuts in mental health services. I am sure that the Minister is only too
aware that Hertfordshire has one of the highest incidences of mental
health problems. We read about the amount of cuts for the adult care
services&#151;learning disability services, drug and alcohol
services&#151;and it beggars belief that that could be care in the
community. Drug care services do not even bother tendering any more;
they were being asked to provide so much that backed up the Government,
even though they involve charities.
</p><p><a name="06071261000230">People with mental
health problems often use homeless services, and they have been cut
back&#151;for example, funding has been cut for the Open Door project
in Bricket Wood. Funding has been cut to Grove House, the hospice in my
constituency. Budgets for the elderly and mentally ill have been
cut&#151;&#163;7.55 million. I have letters about the cuts from all
the 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 468WH</b><br>different services. Those are genuine cuts for my constituents, who do
not understand how there can be extra care in the community and
investment in health. As far as they are concerned, there is no
investment in their health, just a hope that they will go away into a
corner and not create a fuss about what are seen as some of the
Cinderella services of our health
service.</p><p><a name="06071261000231">I have a
letter about staff shortages in the foot health service that
states:</p><a name="06071261000490"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Dear
Colleague...I am writing to let you know about the staffing
problems the Foot Health Service is currently experiencing...In
addition, our current financial position has also exacerbated the
problems and has necessitated the taking of other remedial
action...This equates to a 35 per cent. reduction in the
department&#146;s
staffing.&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000232">that
is, not caring in the community, but an actual reduction in department
staffing. It
continues:</p><a name="06071261000491"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
net result of the staff shortages is that all podiatrists are now
having to accept an increase in their workload and therefore are having
to be more rigorous in prioritising their
workload&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000233">that
is, rationing health
care.</p><p><a name="06071261000234">I have written
to the Minister about the issue of county sexual health promotion
advisers. There used to be five in Hertfordshire; they went into
schools, dealing with the issues at the sharp end, talking to pupils
before they became sexually active. Such pupils may have had queries
about sex or their relationships. We were then down to one last sexual
health adviser post. Unfortunately, it seems that if we try to convince
people that they can access services elsewhere, everybody says that
somebody else is providing them and the post can be cut. The last post
holder lost his job, despite active lobbying by his union and my
writing on his behalf.</p><p><a name="06071261000235">The gentleman in question met
the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Don
Valley (Caroline Flint) at a chlamydia screening conference. She said
that sexual health promotion was a core part of the Government&#146;s
choosing health initiative. We do not see that in Hertfordshire, where
there is no longer a single sexual health promotion
adviser.</p><p><a name="06071261000236">People might
say, &#147;Well, go to your local sexual health clinic.&#148; That
would be interesting in St. Albans; people queue outside the door and
into the car park. As I am sure the Minister is aware, sexual health
clinics do not see only immediate constituents; people, for whatever
reason&#151;privacy, embarrassment or anonymity&#151;will often
travel across borders to go to clinics. My clinic in St. Albans and the
clinic in Watford will serve the majority of people in
Hertfordshire.</p><p><a name="06071261000237">I have
raised our belief that sexual health services in Hertfordshire are
severely underfunded, despite a 1,500 per cent. increase in HIV
infections, as well as other sexually transmitted diseases. As a
result, a MedFash&#151;Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual
Health&#151;review was undertaken; reluctantly, it seemed, but paid
for by the Government. We were all terribly hopeful that it would
deliver what we wanted to happen, but it was not to be. In fact anyone
who knows the well respected Dr. Pat Mundy should be aware that she
resigned because she was being asked to ration patient care and preside
professionally over a service that was unsafe and subject to
cuts.</p><p><a name="06071261000238">Is sexual
health one of the Government&#146;s top six priorities in my
constituency? I do not believe so. The 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 469WH</b><br>trouble is that people wanting to use the services will not understand
when they turn up and doors are locked against them. Are we really
condemning people to an expensive, long illness of HIV/AIDS, for which
we will eventually have to pick up the tab? Are we saying that young
women may end up infertile and perhaps should seek the services later
in life? Are we saying that we do not really
care?</p><p><a name="06071261000239">Today I was
pleased to read in a letter from Dr. Mundy that the 48 per cent.
rationing that was to have been asked for in Watford has been put on
hold. I am sure that the Minister has seen the MedFash report; I urge
her to stress that that is not a temporary political hold for political
expediency and that it is a recognition of the cuts and shortages that
have been going on year on year in health service provision in
Hertfordshire.</p><p><a name="06071261000240">As I
said, we all share many of the services, so when a birthing unit closes
at Hemel Hempstead or a thrombolysis service moves from somewhere else,
or when the cancer services at the QEII hospital go, I care.
</p><p><a name="06071261000241">I shall not take up
too much time, because I know that my right hon. and hon. Friends feel
passionately about the issues, but there is one thing I really care
about. Unfortunately, my constituency, along with that of Hemel
Hempstead, seems to have a cash cow. I regarded it as an excellent
local hospital, but unfortunately it is seen as a wonderful building
site, which may well be used to pay off deficits. I am not talking
about people being put in other areas to make best use of the system.
We have just opened&#151;I know it was not long ago, because I opened
it&#151;a brand new breast cancer unit in St. Albans, but we do not
know whether we are going to keep it. During a hearing for a report of
the Select Committee on Health, David Law was closely questioned by my
hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning). He was asked
about where he was going to find his money and
replied:</p><a name="06071261000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
shall have some redundant
estate&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000243">he was
talking about my
hospital&#151;</p><a name="06071261000492"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
have a good facility in St. Albans with five theatres and beds and that
will become
redundant.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000244">That
facility is going to pay off someone&#146;s debts. I do not want some
bean counter, who has been told to live within his budget, to ration
health care. We are being asked to operate at 90 per cent. below
national average, and we cannot do it.</p><p><a name="06071261000245">St. Albans may be seen as a
wealthy area, because it has high house prices, but I can point to
areas of recognised deprivation, such as London Colney, in my
constituency. They are on my council website. They have high immigrant
populations and poor outcomes on health and cancer&#151;many of the
factors that this Government would accept indicate poverty. However,
because they are in small localised pockets, St. Albans does not
attract the funding as a whole, although the people need the services
just as much.</p><p><a name="06071261000246">I shall
hand over to my hon. Friends now, but we are suffering huge cuts in our
local services. People are not going elsewhere in the constituency, nor
being cared for nicely at home. In St. Albans, we do not have a single
NHS nursing care bed within our age care system&#151;not a single
one. I urge the Minister, please, to renegotiate 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 470WH</b><br>the funding formula to take into account the fact that if we in St.
Albans tried to meet our deficits, we would have no services. That is
how it looks in my
constituency.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000517">2.56

subject of hospital health care in my constituency of Welwyn Hatfield.
That happened despite the fact that the then Secretary of State for
Health, now the Home Secretary, had come to my constituency
and announced a huge, &#163;550 million project to build a
new Hatfield hospital, which was to have been the answer to many of the
concerns of my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Hertfordshire
area.</p><p><a name="06071261000248">We now learn
that that project will involve at best investment of only &#163;250

the last thing a person in such a situation wants to do is travel. That
point comes on to exactly what I was about to say: that we have
recently lost our chemotherapy service at the QEII hospital. That means
that my constituents and others are having to travel 14 miles to the
Lister hospital in Stevenage&#151;a journey that no one wants to make

about the accident and emergency service, the core of any acute
hospital, that is set to be closed.</p><p><a name="06071261000252">I defeated the former Health
Minister because the paediatric service was to have been closed at
night. She said that I was scaremongering, but it is now being closed
in the daytime and stripped out entirely. It is difficult to
comprehend, but all surgery is to be lost from the hospital. I ask the
Minister: if we lose our surgery, our cancer care, our maternity
services, our paediatrics and our A and E, what is left of our
hospital? The Government have talked recently about their intention to
create more community hospitals. Is this the route to creating more
community hospitals? The hospital does not offer fundamental core
services.

Hatfield.</p><p><a name="06071261000253"><b><a name="06071261000580">Anne
Main:</b> As my hon. Friend knows, I defeated the former MP
for St. Albans. During the election, we repeatedly sought assurances
from Ministers that the hospital would be built. The Minister may be
aware that I asked for minutes of the meeting. There have been no
assurances from Ministers, and I believe that the public have been
sorely misled over the status of the
hospital.</p><p><a name="06071261000254"><b><a name="06071261000581">Grant
Shapps:</b> My hon. Friend is right, and we look today for an
assurance about the super-hospital at Hatfield that was promised by the
then Secretary of State for Health in a blaze of publicity. There has
been no publicity around an announcement to reverse the decision, so we
would like to hear that assurance. I invite the Minister to come to
Welwyn Hatfield to explain to the people in my locality when and where
the hospital will be built, and whether, as was originally planned, it
will include the cancer care unit moved from Mount Vernon hospital. Or
has that plan been dropped? Will there be a brand-new teaching hospital
in Hatfield this decade, the next decade or the one after? All the
things that were promised have been quietly dropped now that the
attention and focus are off and there is no general
election&#151;indeed, now that the seat is no longer in
Labour&#146;s
hands.</p><p><a name="06071261000255">It is
understandable that people are looking to their MPs and asking what is
going on. The truth is that, as things stand, we will be left with so
little hospital health care in constituencies such as mine and those of
my hon. Friends that the Government will be putting lives at risk. It
is inconceivable what a constituent who falls over from a heart attack
in Hatfield is supposed to do in a busy rush hour to get themselves to
the Lister hospital in Stevenage, given that the motorway narrows to
two lanes. It is unimaginable how ambulance services, which are being
regionalised and cut, will pick up patient or victims of car accidents
and get them to the health service that they
require.</p><p><a name="06071261000256">It is
extraordinary to my hon. Friends and to our constituents to hear the
Prime Minister and others stand up at the Dispatch Box week in and week
out to reel off numbers that bear no relation at all to the situation
on the ground. What should be discussed are the 500 job
losses&#151;such figures should be stated&#151;the closure of
departments and the broken promises about new hospitals that, when it
comes to it, simply will not be built. I ask the Minister to accept my
invitation to come and explain in
person.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000518">3.2
pm</h5><p><a name="06071261000257"><b><a name="06071261000582">Mr.
James Clappison (Hertsmere) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) on obtaining
this debate and on setting the scene so well. It is no exaggeration to
speak of a crisis in health care in Hertfordshire for all the reasons
that he and my colleagues have given. I shall deal with just one
outcome of the crisis, but that does not mean that I overlook all the
other cutbacks that are taking place in sexual health services, mental
health services and 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 472WH</b><br>hospital care. There are serious cutbacks in clinical care and in the
numbers of doctors and nurses, and there is also the matter of targets
for the use of hospitals by patients, including patients who have
already been seen by their general practitioner. My right hon. Friend
the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) was right to raise
that subject, about which many questions could be
asked.</p><p><a name="06071261000258">The one aspect
that I wish to deal with in many ways epitomises the crisis in
Hertfordshire at present. The Potters Bar community hospital is the
responsibility of the Hertsmere primary care trust, which has a serious
financial deficit. I have asked Ministers about it, and they say that
the PCT must live within its means. However, if that is the case, some
serious cutbacks at the Potters Bar community hospital will be
required.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060712/halltext/60712h0330.htm"/>


<p><a name="06071261000259">The PCT is
consulting on a significant reduction in the capacity of Potters Bar
community hospital, which is a 45-bed community hospital that is barely
10 years old. It replaced an older hospital that was built in the 1930s
but had become dilapidated. The hospital is in a new location. It is a
purpose-built community hospital that provides services for all the
residents of Hertsmere, including, of course, those of Potters Bar.
Although the hospital now serves the whole of Hertsmere as opposed to
just Potters Bar, which it used to do in the past, the PCT proposes
closing 15 of its 45 beds and using the space that is freed up to
relocate services already provided at other premises in Potters Bar. We
must be clear about this: there is no question of providing new or
additional services at Potters Bar community hospital. It is a case of
merging two sites into one to provide both sets of services from the
same premises. The premises that are &#147;freed up,&#148; in the
words of the PCT, will be closed and sold, and the proceeds of the sale
presumably used to address the financial position of the
PCT.</p><p><a name="06071261000260">However, Potters
Bar community hospital will lose one third of its beds for good under
the plans. The PCT has introduced consultation and said what it
proposes to do about community health care to make up for the losses,
but the proposals are being driven by financial cutbacks in response to
a financial crisis. Nobody can say that if the PCT or any other health
service provider were planning the best way to provide health care for
the residents of Hertsmere they would begin by closing a substantial
number of the beds at Potters Bar community
hospital.</p><p><a name="06071261000261">I can do no
better than quote what the Government said about precisely such a
situation. Their White Paper
stated:</p><a name="06071261000493"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Some
community hospitals are currently under threat of closure, as PCTs
consider the best configuration of services in their area. Where these
closures are due to facilities that are clinically not viable or which
local people do not want to use, then local reconfiguration is right.
However, we are clear that community facilities should not be lost in
response to short-term budgetary pressures that are not related to the
viability of the community facility
itself.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000262">That is
precisely the situation with the Potters Bar hospital. Local people
certainly want to use it. They value it for all the reasons that
community hospitals are valued. It is particularly valued by elderly
residents of Potters Bar and Hertsmere and those with chronic
conditions.</p><p><a name="06071261000263">There is
no question about the hospital&#146;s clinical viability. It is a
modern facility. I have to confess that I 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 473WH</b><br>attended its opening, which might suggest that I have been here too
long. In fact, I have not been here too long. It is a modern
facility&#151;it is almost brand-new&#151;and the only reason that
its position is under threat is because of the financial predicament of
Hertsmere PCT.</p><p><a name="06071261000264">My
right hon. Friend was right to say that there is a question of trust,
given what the Government have said about community hospitals. I put it
to the Minister directly that if those words mean anything at all, and
if the Government are to be trusted, Ministers must step in and do
something about the situation at Potters Bar, which corresponds
precisely with what they said. My simple plea is that the Minister will
step in and assume responsibility for the Potters Bar community
hospital to avoid a permanent loss of beds and a permanent loss of a
significant part of the health care that is afforded to my
constituents, which will come on top of all the other problems that
have been outlined. Such a permanent loss to the residents of Potters
Bar and Hertsmere will do serious, irreversible damage to the fabric of
the health service in my constituency. I ask the Minister to step in
and do something about
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000519">3.8
pm</h5><p><a name="06071261000265"><b><a name="06071261000583">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> I join the
general congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) on obtaining this debate on the crisis in
Hertfordshire&#146;s health service. I wish to pick up on the point
about trust that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr.
Clappison) made a moment ago. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) also spoke about
it.</p><p><a name="06071261000266">There are various
categories of trust; for example, there is trusting the
Government&#146;s word in respect of their policies. The Government
spend a great deal of time telling people in the mental health field
that modern mental health provision is about early intervention,
respite for carers, modern therapies and catching problems
early&#151;getting in there to help children and adolescents when
they are pre-onset or at the onset of severe mental illness. I have
taken a particular interest in that issue. In Hertfordshire, however,
the Government are scrapping the early intervention service, the
respite care and the in-patient therapies that are so valued, and they
are cutting the child and adolescent health services.</p><p><a name="06071261000267">The Government say that
community hospitals can be valuable centres in which general
practitioners can do things such as minor surgery. We have a community
hospital in Royston, and there was a plan to develop it in the same
way, but it is now on hold and has been for a long time. I have asked
the Minister about the future of Royston hospital, but she says,
&#147;Ask the PCT.&#148; However, the PCT is being scrapped and is
becoming part of a larger PCT. If one asks the PCT, therefore, it says,
&#147;We don&#146;t know if we&#146;ll even be here.&#148; The
truth is that we cannot trust what the Government
say.</p><p><a name="06071261000268">At the local
level, we were promised a brand new, spanking great hospital in
Hatfield, which was going to cost &#163;550 million, as has been
said. We were told that it would have cancer care facilities, which are
a crucial 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 474WH</b><br>issue in Hertfordshire. Now, however, we are told, &#147;Oh no, you
can&#146;t spend more than &#163;250 million.&#148; The whole
thing is in limbo.</p><p><a name="06071261000269">It
is well known that we have had a structural funding problem in
Hertfordshire over the past few years. Before the 2001 general
election, the then Health Minister, the right hon. Member for
Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), put an extra one-off payment into our
local health system and said, &#147;It&#146;s a structural problem,
and we&#146;ll have to look at it.&#148; However, nothing happened.
Of course, he paid the money, but the Labour party won the election
again, and no permanent review was done of the funding for our local
health system. Every year for the past few years, therefore, a
non-recurrent payment of &#163;10 million has been made to our local
health system. Now, we are suddenly being told, &#147;Oh no, you
can&#146;t have any more money. You&#146;ve got to manage within
your budget.&#148;</p><p><a name="06071261000270">The Government know that there
is a structural problem in Hertfordshire and in the East and North
Hertfordshire NHS Trust&#151;they made the non-recurrent payments.
Now, however, they have the cheek to turn round and say, &#147;Oh no,
you can&#146;t have any more money. You&#146;ve got to
manage.&#148; That means that &#163;66 million has to be taken out
of our small East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust over three years.
Five hundred staff&#151;or 10 per cent.&#151;will go, including 150
doctors and nurses, and we will lose three wards at our two hospitals.
Those are major problems, which the Government knew
about.</p><p><a name="06071261000271"><b><a name="06071261000584">Grant
Shapps:</b> My hon. Friend mentions the &#163;66 million,
but does he agree that the number seems to go up by
&#163;1.5 million a week? The chief executive briefed my hon. Friend
on the issue just before me, but when I had my briefing last week, the
figure had risen to &#163;69 million. Does my hon. Friend have a
projection for the end of the year?</p><p><a name="06071261000272"><b><a name="06071261000585">Mr.
Heald:</b> Well, it will clearly be higher still. We really
are in an appalling situation, and my hon. Friend makes an excellent
point.</p><p><a name="06071261000273">I come to my
last point, because I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure
us, although I doubt it. We are asking for nothing more than common
fairness in Hertfordshire. It is true that the county is better off
than some others, but we pay twice as much tax per head as people in
the Minister&#146;s constituency.</p><p><a name="06071261000274"><b><a name="06071261000586">The

Heald:</b> Yes we do. In our area, the average is
&#163;5,820; in the Minister&#146;s constituency, it is
&#163;2,710. We are therefore paying a lot of tax in Hertfordshire,
but we are not asking for any more than anybody else. We are perfectly
willing to accept that we should have a level playing field and a fair
allocation of resources. However, while the Minister&#146;s
constituency gets &#163;1,362 per head, we get &#163;1,057, which
is &#163;300, or 30 per cent., less per head. In Hertfordshire, there
are many people who are disadvantaged and there are also pockets of
deprivation, as my hon. Friends

problems, and it is just unacceptable to say that we will be treated in
such a mean and unfair way. Will the Minister look at the issue
again?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000520">3.15

Mark Prisk (Hertford and Stortford) (Con):</b> May I, too,
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire
(Mr. Gauke). This debate is very timely, and Opposition Members feel
very passionately about the issues involved.</p><p><a name="06071261000279">As the Minister will recall
only too well, the Secretary of State told the Royal College of Nursing
in Bournemouth in April that the NHS was enjoying &#147;its best year
ever&#148;. That brought howls of derision from her audience, and
rightly so, but it also generated real anger in my constituency. Over
the past year in east Hertfordshire, we have had job losses, which my
colleagues have described. We also face possible ward closures and
longer queues for dentistry and cancer screenings, and there are real
concerns about mental health services. To echo the points made by my
right hon. and hon. Friends, let me tell the Minister quite genuinely
that people in Hertfordshire no longer trust the Government with our
health service&#151;that is the reality.</p><p><a name="06071261000280">In the district of east
Hertfordshire that I try to represent, we face real problems with
preventive services, such as those provided by NHS dentists. The PCTs
tell us that they have tried to address the issue, but the combination
of new contracts and uncertain funding has seriously undermined
confidence among dentists and their ability to do their job. Some of my
constituents travel 20, 25 and, in some cases, 30 miles just for a
basic dental appointment. As a result, many people are being left
behind, and that is particularly true of the elderly, who cannot make
such a journey or afford to do so. I could go into that in greater
detail, but I am aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel
Hempstead (Mike Penning) will want to make a contribution, so I shall
be brief.</p><p><a name="06071261000281">Mental
health services are also under threat. We have heard that the
Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust faces a &#163;5 million cut,
which is 5 per cent. of its budget. When we are told the reason for it,
we find that the irony is that it is because of a general overspend.
However, the trust has always lived within its budget and has never
strayed beyond it in the five years since its inception. The attempt to
cut its budget has seen the trust&#151;</p><p><a name="06071261000282"><b><a name="06071261000591">Grant
Shapps:</b>
Punished.</p><p><a name="06071261000283"><b><a name="06071261000592">Mr.
Prisk:</b> As my hon. Friend rightly highlights, the trust has
been punished. Genuine concern has also been caused among what are
probably the most vulnerable parts of our community. Clouds are hanging
over good services, such as Signet house, Oxford house and the Seward
Lodge day care unit, which are invaluable to our
constituents.</p><p><a name="06071261000284">As hon.
Members have said, the worst news was probably when we were told about
the 500 jobs that would be lost from the East and North Hertfordshire
NHS Trust. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 476WH</b><br>North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) said, 150 of those affected will
not simply be managers, but doctors and nurses. Up to three wards could
well be lost at the two hospitals in Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City.
The best way of describing how people feel about that is a quotation
that I recently read from a local nurse, who said:</p><a name="06071261000494"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Nurses are scared,
upset and demoralised&#151;they feel like they&#146;ve worked flat
out to deliver Government targets and this is their
reward.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000285">With all those
developments affecting the NHS in east Hertfordshire, hon. Members will
see immediately how hollow the Secretary of State&#146;s words sound
to my constituents.</p><p><a name="06071261000286">Part of the problem is the
Government&#146;s obsession with reorganisation. I have been a Member
of Parliament for five years, and in that time the Government have
restructured, de-merged, re-merged and reorganised the ambulance trust
at least once and the PCTs twice. The new strategic health
authority will be in its third incarnation&#151;I thought
that only Dr. Who could change his form so often. The whole
structure of health care in Hertfordshire seems to be up for grabs.
Chairs are delicately moved around, but nothing is done about the
service. Reorganising and restructuring will make no difference if the
fundamentals are not dealt with.</p><p><a name="06071261000287">That leads me to my principal
point. In Hertfordshire, the truth is that patients are not getting
their fair share. NHS spending per person in Hertfordshire is just 90
per cent. of the average for England. On last year&#146;s figures,
the shortfall is &#163;69 per person, which means that my
constituency lost out by &#163;5.2 million last year. For the county,
it is &#163;69 million in one year. Of course, it does not stop
there. England itself is a poor relation when compared, for example,
with Scotland. On last year&#146;s figures, patients in Hertfordshire
got only &#163;614 per person, but Scottish patients received
&#163;855 per person. That is a gap of &#163;241 per person or, in
my constituency alone, &#163;18 million in one year. It is an
iniquity, which will appal many people, and to which I hope the
Minister will
respond.</p><p><a name="06071261000288"><b><a name="06071261000593">Mr.
Heald:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is also odd that
people in the Secretary of State&#146;s constituency get
&#163;1,306 per head, whereas people covered by the PCT that we share
get &#163;1,057 per head? Again, the first figure is 30 per cent.
higher.</p><p><a name="06071261000289"><b><a name="06071261000594">Mr.
Prisk:</b> I think that that leads quite accurately to the
central point that concerns us all. We simply seek our fair share. We
do not want better treatment, but we certainly do not want worse.
Whatever the apparent wealth of our areas, whether that is measured by
house prices or incomes, the truth is that an elderly person&#146;s
worry in Hertfordshire about whether they have cancer is as important
as it would be if they lived in any other part of the country. That is
the iniquity that we are dealing with today. I hope that the Minister
will have the courage not to hide behind the usual platitudes that we
hear from her boss, and to tell us the truth, and give us the
assurances, that our constituents seek.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000521">3.21

care about their health care.</p><p><a name="06071261000291">The national health service was
created as a level playing field. It was there for all those who needed
health care and could not afford to pay for it. On the estates where I
grew up in north London, the hospital was the focal point of the
community, because that was where people could go when they needed
help. Many people in the areas of north London where I was brought up
moved out to Hemel Hempstead in the 1950s, to the wonderful new town
with its gardens, hospital and college, and all the facilities that
they perhaps struggled to get before.</p><p><a name="06071261000292">A wonderful acute general
hospital was built in Hemel Hempstead in the 1950s. Smaller hospitals
were closed and the full acute hospital was created. It fought for 30
years, under different Governments, to find out whether it was safe and
would remain. Eventually, 10 or 12 years ago, it was concluded
that it should be left alone, and investment was put into it, which
meant huge amounts of money, under Conservative and Labour
Administrations. A brand new stroke unit was built; huge investments
were made in the cardiac unit; and a maternity unit was built up, which
then closed, after which a new birthing unit opened&#151;no one quite
understood why, but there was an election in the middle, so perhaps we
may assume that that had something to do with it. That hospital is a
facility that is there to be used.</p><p><a name="06071261000293">Great Ormond Street hospital
was there to deal with the need for specialist care for children, and
people who needed specialist cancer care could go elsewhere. My wife is
presently visiting the Royal London hospital, because it has the best
haematology department, whose services she needs. That is not what we
are asking for in Hemel Hempstead. What we wanted, and what we have, is
an acute hospital.</p><p><a name="06071261000294">I
shall probably be the last hon. Member to speak in the debate before
the Front-Bench spokesmen make their speeches, and that is right,
because what is happening is terminal for Hemel Hempstead. The acute
hospital will go. If the trust gets its way, next spring it will send
the bulldozers in to Hemel Hempstead hospital. It will become a housing
estate. If we are lucky, I am told, we shall have an independent sector
treatment centre&#151;a surgery centre for elective surgery. I have
plainly said that I do not want an ISTC. We have three theatres and an
elective surgery unit. We have five theatres at St. Albans, doing the
job now.</p><p><a name="06071261000295">As I
understand it from the evidence given to the Select Committee on
Health, on which I have the honour and privilege to sit, the rules for
ISTCs are that they are not permitted to create a demand; an ISTC is
supposed only to replace something that is missing. What is happening
in our part of Hertfordshire is that a demand for an ISTC is being
created by knocking down a hospital and five theatres, an out-patient
department and an elective surgery department at St. Albans. We must
ask why.</p><p><a name="06071261000296">Several of
my hon. Friends have discussed the fairness of the funding formula. I

some constituencies get as much as &#163;1,600 per head. That is
shameful when it is to be hoped that patients will, in the end, be
treated similarly for the same ailments and problems.</p><p><a name="06071261000297">I have a problem in Hemel
Hempstead because, as a London overspill town, it has areas of serious
social and economic deprivation. That is not just because of the
Buncefield disaster&#151;after which the hospital&#146;s emergency
services did fantastically well in treating the injured; God forbid
that the hospital should not have been there, which would have meant
going to the emergency centre at Watford. Perhaps some of those people
would not be alive now, because two people were very seriously ill
after the explosion.</p><p><a name="06071261000298">What would it take to clear the
deficit and to decide, &#147;We do not need to do this&#148;? The
chief executive, in the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire, said that the closures would not take place
if there was no financial problem. What is happening is not
reconfiguration; it is cuts. We are trying to get more out of less. It
is that simple. We will move all acute services to Watford; we will not
go ahead with the promised private finance initiative building; we
shall put in portable buildings. Eventually we dragged from the chief
executive the truth about the life expectancy of those buildings. It
was 40 years&#151;instead of the promised new
hospital.</p><p><a name="06071261000299">The
residents of Watford, Welwyn and Hatfield, St. Albans and
other parts of the country were duped. They were made promises that
there was no intention of keeping. The funding formula
problem&#151;the deficit&#151;has existed for years. Ministers in
Select Committee and chief executives of other trusts have argued that
the problem is one of management. The managers are not doing their jobs
properly. How can that be, when the trust has been changed three times,
the PCTs have been changed and the whole of the strategic health
authority has been changed? They cannot all be bad, surely. Surely
there must be one good manager somewhere in the NHS, because, clearly,
they do not have such a problem in other areas. There is clear
evidence, however, that areas without so many problems get a lot more
money.</p><p><a name="06071261000300">I want to close
by explaining exactly what will happen to the Hemel Hempstead hospital.
We have a full acute hospital with out-patients, elective surgery and,
most importantly, as was explained earlier, the acute blue-light
facilities, for those who need them. There are 250,000 people relying
on the accident and emergency unit at that hospital. It is proposed
that all of that should go by next Easter. The whole site will be up
for redevelopment. I know that, because I was lucky enough to find out
that the trust had had meetings with my local council asking what it
could build on the site; I know, because eventually at the Select
Committee I dragged from the chief executive the information that the
land and facilities will be surplus to requirements. Surplus to
requirements&#151;it is a general hospital, which people rely
on!</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 479WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000301">Lives are at risk. I am
conscious of the need to leave time for the Minister&#146;s response,
but we are not playing a numbers game. We are not saying that some
people are nasty and some are good. We are talking about ordinary
people, who deserve the NHS that was created many years ago as a level
playing field. Watford is in the premier league; it is a fantastic
result. The Saracens are doing very well. Hon. Members might like to
try going down the A41 from Hemel Hempstead at any time without a blue
light. I drove blue-light emergency vehicles and I know how difficult
it is. They will not get there. The Government are putting lives at
risk.</p><p><a name="06071261000302">My hon. Friend
the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) invited the Minister to
visit the hospital in his constituency. I shall not do that, because
thousands of my constituents have invited the Secretary of State, but
she is too busy. I asked to see her diary and she was too busy to show
me that, too. It is a disgrace, and lives will be
lost.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000522">3.29
pm</h5><p><a name="06071261000303"><b><a name="06071261000596">Dr.
John Pugh (Southport) (LD):</b> I congratulate not only the
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) but all hon.
Members who have spoken so emphatically about their fears for their
services. I shall not comment in detail on the local
circumstances&#151;I defer to their greater knowledge on that
subject&#151;but I shall make some general remarks, as the issues
affecting Hertfordshire emphasise some familiar themes and common
problems that occur
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06071261000304">The hon.
Gentleman originally drew to our attention two problems. One was the
problem of underfunding, which seems to affect all services across the
piece, and the other was the problem of hospital reconfiguration, with
the hospital trusts having substantial deficits, in excess of
&#163;20 million. The Government&#146;s response to deficits is
usually that trusts should get a grip and balance the books, which of
course always travels with a presupposition that we already have a fair
formula across areas and even within areas, between institutions.
However, I see no evidence that we have yet arrived at that
state.</p><p><a name="06071261000305">There is also
another common phenomenon in Hertfordshire, which is that of a number
of smallish hospitals in clusters, with pressures on all
services.</p><p><a name="06071261000306"><b><a name="06071261000597">Mike
Penning:</b> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has been
to my part of Hertfordshire, but we do not have a small hospital. The
Watford general hospital is not a small hospital and neither is the
QEII hospital. They are massive acute hospitals, not little community
hospitals, as he is describing
them.</p><p><a name="06071261000307"><b><a name="06071261000598">Dr.
Pugh:</b> I was not suggesting that they were community
hospitals, but the descriptions are relative, and we could compare them
with St. Thomas&#146; hospital over the river from here.</p><p><a name="06071261000308">I am familiar with the
scenario, because I come from an area where there are two hospitals
that I would describe as relatively small in NHS terms and that are
separated by the sort of distance that separates some of the
Hertfordshire hospitals. I am fairly familiar with the problem&#151;I
know that hospitals belong to distinct communities, I know that travel
between them is rarely ideal and I know that there is strong community 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 480WH</b><br>resistance to changes in local hospitals. I also know that when change
takes place, there is an unconvincing process of local consultation
that satisfies nobody and buys nobody off.</p><p><a name="06071261000309">There are usually two drivers
for reconfiguration. A clinical driver to do with the concentration of
expertise is usually cited in evidence, and there is usually a
financial driver. The financial drivers on hospitals involve not only
deficits but other things, such as the working time directive and the
junior doctors&#146; contract, which put additional pressures on
hospitals in all areas. None the less, people in Hertfordshire are
quite justified in fearing reconfiguration, because reconfiguration and
all that it evokes has a pretty poor reputation across the
NHS.</p><p><a name="06071261000310">Looking at the
SHA consultation on reconfiguration in 2003 from an external point of
view, I thought that an attempt was being made&#151;although probably
not a successful one&#151;to give everybody a little piece of the
action or to satisfy everybody, if I may put it like that. Clearly that
effort failed and was replaced by something much more unacceptable. In
my neck of the woods, with two hospitals separated by the same sort of
distance as between Watford and Hemel Hempstead, we have already lost
obstetrics and paediatrics in Southport.</p><p><a name="06071261000311"><b><a name="06071261000599">Anne
Main:</b> The hon. Gentleman talks about the same distance as
between Watford and Hemel Hempstead, but would he agree that the
Minister should ensure that if any service is to be moved to Watford,
the road configuration should be altered&#151;which is exactly what
we were promised&#151;before any development of the hospital takes
place? Perhaps the Minister knows better than I do, but I have yet to
see any details of that road configuration or that road
investment.</p><p><a name="06071261000312"><b><a name="06071261000600">Mr.
Mike Hancock (in the Chair):</b> Order. That sounds like
another
speech.</p><p><a name="06071261000313"><b><a name="06071261000601">Dr.
Pugh:</b> That is absolutely the point that I would
re-emphasise, as similar problems are faced in many areas. In my neck
of the woods, where two hospitals are owned by the same trust, the road
is an issue and travel is the one thing that is most
ignored.</p><p><a name="06071261000314">I was not
surprised to find, on looking into the matter, that the offer that was
originally made in the 2003 consultation has been further downgraded.
At one stage there was talk of having a birthing unit in Hemel
Hempstead and using it to spread good practice elsewhere, but I
understand that that is now unlikely to happen. As the hon. Member for
Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) said, the best that will happen is that
an ISTC will emerge. That is a common pattern in different places, with
the same meaningless consultation forming a backdrop. Scrutiny and
review sections of councils debate things, but the financial position
continues to
deteriorate.</p><p><a name="06071261000315">We can
anticipate the Government&#146;s response, which is also fairly
familiar. In most such debates, the Government will say that people
ought not to be wedded to bricks and mortar, that services can be
delivered in the community and&#151;to a lesser extent&#151;in
secondary care, that institutions have to co-operate, 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 481WH</b><br>that clinical networks have to be delivered and that people will travel
for the best possible
service.</p><p><a name="06071261000316">However, that
aspect of Government policy does not hang together with something that
was cited several times in the consultation, which is the
Government&#146;s own policy of keeping the NHS local, which produced
a well-known pamphlet that is much cited but rarely acted upon. That
policy recognises that although people are ready to travel for
specialist care, they expect to find many services locally,
particularly A and E services and those that look after people with
chronic conditions that involve repeated journeys to hospital.
Additional travel in such cases means extra trauma. Someone who has to
go further to an A and E department might not arrive with a
long-lasting problem or even with a major trauma, but for someone
travelling with a child to A and E who is not sure what is wrong, every
extra mile is a very unpleasant experience.</p><p><a name="06071261000317">People do not mind clinical
networks, if that is what the Government want, but they want the
clinical networks that suit them and their clinical needs. As it is,
reconfiguration across the piece normally results in health authorities
presenting a menu, a rather bogus form of consultation taking place
and, when it is completed, people often choosing to go in unexpected
directions, rather than to the hospitals to which they were expected to
travel in the first place. As many hon. Members have said, the backdrop
is often the need for a quick financial fix, which discredits any
reconfiguration proposal
whatever.</p><p><a name="06071261000318"><b><a name="06071261000602">Mr.
Lilley:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Hancock. Is the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s speech in order, as it is not about
Hertfordshire?</p><p><a name="06071261000319"><b><a name="06071261000603">Mr.
Mike Hancock (in the Chair):</b> The hon. Member is entitled
to put a view about the consultation, but I remind hon. Members that we
are about to have a Division and it would be appropriate to give
everyone a fair chance to speak in this
debate.</p><p><a name="06071261000320"><b><a name="06071261000604">Dr.
Pugh:</b> I shall finish shortly, as I said I would, although
I also said that I would make some general remarks that would probably
apply to Hertfordshire, as well as to other
places.</p><p><a name="06071261000321">If there is a
mistake&#151;as there must be&#151;it is not beginning with
community needs. The public are not stupid; they know that they cannot
have everything everywhere. However, they want good quality, timely and
accessible services but, as hon. Members who have voiced their opinions
so far have made clear, Hertfordshire is not getting
them.</p>

O'Brien:</b> Having congratulated my hon. Friend on securing
the debate, I also pay tribute to the measured, serious way in which he
presented his overwhelming and unquestionably cogent case on behalf of
his constituents, demonstrating his concern for their health and
well-being.</p><p><a name="06071261000326">We have
heard from the massed ranks of Conservative Members of Parliament
representing Hertfordshire this afternoon; eight out of nine have
contributed to this debate and the ninth would have attended, but for
being away necessarily on Select Committee business. It is notable that
the two Labour MPs who represent Hertfordshire are absent. The Liberal
Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh),
concentrated on general points because, thankfully, Hertfordshire, like
Cheshire, is a Liberal Democrat-free
zone.</p><p><a name="06071261000327">I make no
apology for focusing on the financial issues, because those lie at the
heart of so many of the points that have been raised and have real
effects on patients and the constituents of my right hon. and hon.
Friends, as we have heard. It is right for us to debate financial
issues today, because those are in the power, remit, gift, discretion,
authority, responsibility, duty&#151;whatever people want to call
it&#151;of the Minister and the Secretary of State; there is no
escaping
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000328">Bedfordshire and
Hertfordshire strategic health authority, which is now subsumed into
the East of England SHA, has had to make significant savings in an
attempt by the Secretary of State to mitigate the NHS deficits. In
month six of 2005-06, the SHA was predicting a surplus of
&#163;18,000, which was 0.2 per cent. of its turnover. In month 12 it
delivered a surplus of more than &#163;19 million&#151;20.7 per
cent. of its turnover&#151;which was generated by a mere
&#163;200,000 underspend on administrative budgets and enhanced by
underspends on training at &#163;3.5 million, the national programme
for IT in the NHS at &#163;3.9 million, central budgets of &#163;6
million, a carry-over of &#163;2.6 million from the 2004-05
underspends and an allocation from the national health service bank of
&#163;3 million.</p><p><a name="06071261000329">As
a total health economy across all the NHS organisations in this area,
the SHA had a total deficit of &#163;107.9 million in 2005-06. I
found that figure, which breaches the SHA&#146;s control total by
&#163;33 million, in the financial report of 20th June 2006,
presented at the final board meeting of the Bedfordshire and
Hertfordshire SHA before it was subsumed into the East of England SHA.
The SHA has been given a control total deficit of &#163;80 million
for 2006-07, necessitating savings of &#163;150 million, which is
enough money to employ just over 8,000 nurses a year and is
eye-watering by any
standards.</p><p><a name="06071261000330"><b><a name="06071261000607">Mr.
Prisk:</b> My hon. Friend rightly highlighted many of the
financial issues, but is he concerned about the constantly changing
figures coming from the Government? People working in health care keep
being asked to do new things and change, which is debilitating for many
of them.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 483WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000331"><b><a name="06071261000608">Mr.
O'Brien:</b> My hon. Friend is correct. Anybody with any
management experience would know that that is precisely the
case.</p><p><a name="06071261000332">I am delighted
to inform hon. Members that the hon. Member for Watford (Claire Ward)
has had a baby. I congratulate her on behalf of the Conservatives. That
is the best excuse for not attending a debate. However, there is no
excuse for the hon. Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett), who has not
had a baby.</p><p><a name="06071261000333">The
savings that I have mentioned, which are equivalent to 8,000 nurses a
year, are so high risk that the SHA has told the Department of Health
that it requires a control total of &#163;99 million, but expects
that downward pressure will be applied to the control total requested
by the SHA. With that cash squeeze, it is unsurprising that the SHA
area is resorting to drastic measures. In 2006-07, the SHA is reducing
education places by 12 per cent. on the previous year&#151;a total of
122 places&#151;and is looking to shed 1,100 whole-time equivalents.
In addition, underspends are not being returned and the primary care
trusts are required to deliver 3.5 per cent. in cash-releasing
efficiency savings. Cuts to mental health services were ably described
with deep concern by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). We are also talking about cuts in podiatry,
a transfer of thrombolysis services and cuts to sexual health services.
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main) also cited a long
list of services knowledgeably, robustly and
compassionately.</p><p><a name="06071261000334">The
situation is so bad in the west Hertfordshire quadrant that the auditor
issued a public interest report in April 2006, which highlighted the
apparent weaknesses in the arrangements established by the PCTs to
ensure effective financial governance and the poor financial
information being presented to the board. The auditors also highlighted
the adverse impact of the considerable uncertainty caused by NHS
restructuring. Most of all, the auditor&#146;s report shows that
Ministers have failed in their duty to oversee our NHS, as my right
hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) ably
illustrated in his
contribution.</p><p><a name="06071261000335">This
crisis did not happen overnight. For example, the West Hertfordshire
Hospitals NHS Trust&#146;s deficit grew from &#163;4.6 million in
2003-04 to &#163;14.6 million in 2004-05 and &#163;43.2 million in
2005-06. In both 2003-04 and 2004-05, the Audit Commission&#146;s
relationship manager for the SHA reported on the weaknesses in
financial management and the structural issues contributing to the poor
financial standing of all bodies in the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire
SHA area.</p><p><a name="06071261000336">Furthermore,
the public interest report constitutes one of the 20 referrals in 2006
of NHS bodies to the Secretary of State under section 19 of the Audit
Commission Act 1998. There were seven referrals in 2005, two in 2004
and none in 2003. This is a worsening picture. In addition, auditors
posted 93 qualifications on the accounts last year&#151;accounting
for the doubling in the forecast NHS deficit for 2004-05&#151;53 in
the previous year and none in any year before
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000337">The problem of
NHS deficits has not suddenly appeared; it has been allowed to worsen
because of the failings in the Department of Health and among its
Ministers. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 484WH</b><br>and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) quoted the Secretary of State talking about
the best year ever. He also observed rightly that reorganisations are
often the Government&#146;s only retreat to try to escape
accountability and blame others. Above all, failed managers are being
recycled, thereby demoralising the best, who move on and out. We have a
downward spiral of morale and
performance.</p><p><a name="06071261000338">Despite
the financial difficulties, it is unacceptable that the former SHA area
should be forced to make cuts to front-line patient services to find
cash, especially where such cuts are driven by financial rather than
clinical
needs.</p><p><a name="06071261000339">Regarding the
West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, we have heard about the scaling
down of services at Hemel Hempstead and the building of an independent
sector treatment centre there. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel
Hempstead (Mike Penning) eloquently described how the argument for the
introduction of the treatment centre puts the cart before the horse.
That is no way to manage our
NHS.</p><p><a name="06071261000340">Does the Minister
find it acceptable that most of a relatively new hospital should be
demolished and turned into a housing estate because it is
&#147;surplus to requirements&#148;? Acute and emergency services
are to be centralised at Watford general. Can the Minister guarantee
that that will in no way affect patient care? The trust has announced
upwards of 700 job losses and 878 bed cuts. East and North
Hertfordshire NHS Trust, which has to save &#163;69 million over
three years, is set to lose 100 jobs and 1,055 beds, as described in a
passionate and sincere speech by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-East Hertfordshire. In addition, services are being decimated at
the QEII hospital in
Welwyn.</p><p><a name="06071261000341">Part of the
difficulty for hospitals has been the financial pressure put on them by
primary care trusts, although it is the organisations that do not have
payment by results, such as the mental health trusts, that are most at
risk from cuts in front-line services by the eight Hertfordshire PCTs,
all of which are in deficit. The effect on, for instance, Potters Bar
community hospital was rightly and graphically described by my hon.
Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison). Two sites are being
forced into one as a
&#147;solution&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071261000342">Above
all, as my hon. Friend and others rightly highlighted, this leads to a
serious collapse in trust in the Minister and the ministerial team,
because of what they have said about community hospitals. There was,
rightly, a huge outcry when confidence was undermined by the various
messages that appeared to be coming out of the Government, but then the
Secretary of State corrected that impression at the Dispatch Box. As my
hon. Friend said, surely this is the time to step in and stop
the permanent loss of services to his
constituency.</p><p><a name="06071261000343">Most
worrying is the fact that the services are being closed down without
hope of substitutes. Both the private finance initiative rebuild at
Watford and the PFI super-hospital at Hatfield seem to be frozen. The
latter has already been downgraded and there is no indication that
either will ever
arrive.</p><p><a name="06071261000344">Auditors have
highlighted problems with financial management in the Hertfordshire
area, but the struggle 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 485WH</b><br>in that area is symptomatic of an NHS that has been centrally
mismanaged. The fact that deficits are arising in places such as
Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, Thames Valley and Surrey and
Sussex&#151;the areas that are hardest done by in the resource
allocation&#151;reflects the fact that those areas are becoming too
underfunded. Constant central restructuring has contributed to the
difficulties, as has the scandalous political meddling in the PFI
programmes, such as the one at Hatfield, laid bare in the powerful
speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant
Shapps).</p><p><a name="06071261000345">However much
the Secretary of State and her Ministers may dislike the south-east and
middle-income Britain, is there any credible effort that the Minister
can make in her speech now to start rebuilding the trust between them
and the people of Hertfordshire, represented so passionately and ably
by my right hon. and hon. Friends? Do this Government govern for all or
just for the reducing number of Labour voters in this country? Will the
Minister now commit to a simple ministerial duty&#151;fairness to
all&#151;and correct here today the deep, damaging unfairness that
has been done to the people of Hertfordshire&#146;s health under
Labour?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000526">4.3

changes, but there is no doubt that they could not have taken place
without, first, the hard work and dedication of NHS
staff.</p><p><a name="06071261000348">Secondly, the
changes could not have taken place without the increased investment
that has gone into the NHS. I believe that there is actually quite a
lot of political consensus on the fact that investment in the NHS has
increased from some &#163;33 billion in 1997 and will increase to
some &#163;92 billion in 2007-08. The combination of increased
investment and the changes 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 486WH</b><br>that have been made because of the work of NHS staff has led to real
improvements in health
care.</p><p><a name="06071261000349">Hertfordshire
has been a beneficiary. Whatever is said at the moment, there is no
doubt that there have been increases in resources. A number of hon.
Members mentioned the funding formula. It is true that PCTs in
Hertfordshire receive less funding per person than the national
average, but that is because a formula has been put together to address
the health needs of an area. That means that in some of the more
deprived areas there are higher levels of funding. I would be amazed if
the Conservative party was saying that it wanted to adopt a policy
whereby it ignored the fact that some areas have greater health needs
than others and that therefore it would reverse the efforts made to
tackle health
inequalities.</p><p><a name="06071261000350">The hon.
Member for Hemel Hempstead talked about the establishment of the NHS,
which was about providing equal access to health care throughout the
country. Inevitably, that means that in some areas there are higher
levels of funding, but that does not mean that PCTs cannot target
funding within their overall area to tackle health inequalities. That
is why the Government have put a lot of emphasis on tackling health
inequalities. No matter what we say, right hon. and hon. Members in
this Room know that a boy born in Manchester, for example, is likely to
die eight years earlier than someone born in, I think,
Dorset.</p><p><a name="06071261000351"><b><a name="06071261000610">Grant
Shapps:</b> I appreciate what the Minister is saying about
health inequalities, but surely the way to tackle inequalities is not
to drag down an area where, in the past, the position may have been
better, by closing down important services such as cancer care,
maternity and accident and emergency services. That seems to be the
approach that the Minister is
taking.</p><p><a name="06071261000352"><b><a name="06071261000611">Ms
Rosie Winterton:</b> No, that is not the approach that I am
taking. The approach that I am taking is to challenge the assertion
that has been made by the Conservative party that it is wrong to
channel funding into areas where there are greater health inequalities.
I am challenging that belief because it would be completely the wrong
approach to the NHS. The new formula takes account of the impact of
deprivation on health need in ways that were not possible before. It
also considers unmet need. In certain areas, there may be
people&#151;for example, people from ethnic minorities and
socio-economically deprived groups&#151;who are not receiving health
care services to the same level as others. If the Conservative party
decides to reverse that approach, it will reverse everything that we
have been doing to tackle health
inequalities.</p><p><a name="06071261000353"><b><a name="06071261000612">Mike
Penning:</b> I do not think that anyone here is saying that
everyone in every area should get identical funding. We want a level
playing field in relation to the areas that the Minister has described,
such as Manchester, where people die earlier. In our part of the
world&#151;the debate is about Hertfordshire&#151;more people are
living longer, and that costs the NHS more. When people get old, they
get ill and need health care, no matter where in the country they
live.</p><p><a name="06071261000354"><b><a name="06071261000613">Ms

Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), that is exactly what
the Government did in the financial year 2001-02, when the figure was
103 per cent. Why has that not been possible in subsequent

that position and that it will somehow go away. That would be quite the
wrong approach. We need to look at how services are delivered. The
worst thing for staff, patients and services such as mental health
services would be to continue such a process. If the Conservatives were
to adopt a policy of ignoring those deficits and making no effort to
deal with them, that would not do patients or staff any good. We need
to say, &#147;This is the problem that we are facing; we should look
at this in light of the extra resources that have gone in.&#148; The

Chamber.</p><p><a name="06071261000374"><b><a name="06071261000630">Greg
Mulholland:</b> I am very pleased to have secured the debate,
and to have this opportunity to raise this increasingly important issue
in the House. As I have already made clear to the Minister, I wish to
focus specifically on the practice in which a number of disreputable
companies and individuals around the country are engaged: the
misrepresentation and mis-selling of greenfield land, which is becoming
a critical issue in many rural and semi-rural areas. Before I expand on
that, I want to make it clear that my purpose today is to ensure that
after the debate the Minister and the Government will agree to work
with me and MPs from all parties who are also concerned to address this
issue. I shall make some suggestions later as to how that could be
achieved.</p><p><a name="06071261000375">Let me
define precisely the relevant issues. In broad terms, land banking is
simply the practice of purchasing undeveloped land for future
developments or resale. That investment often comes in the form of land
investment companies or partnerships buying land, subdividing it and
then encouraging secondary investors to buy individual plots. If the
land value increases, the investment companies gain a high return, and
the secondary investors also benefit. In the vast majority of cases,
for the value of the land to increase substantially, a &#147;change
of use&#148; must be accorded to the land, which means that local
councils must grant permission for it to be developed. If it is green
belt land, there needs to be a change in status.</p><p><a name="06071261000376">For those of us with rural and
semi-rural land in our areas, this is a highly contentious issue. It is
particularly worrying that there appear still to be individuals and
partnerships buying up large areas of undeveloped green belt land and
deliberately suggesting, or at least giving the impression, that
permission for that land to be developed is likely&#151;often, they
give the impression that it is very likely, or a done deal&#151;when
that is far from the truth. I have an example from my own constituency
which illustrates how that practice works. It is how I came across the
issue in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06071261000377">As I stated in
the House when I introduced my ten-minute Bill in November last year, a
company called English Land Partnership bought and owns a piece of
undeveloped greenfield land, Cookridge pastures, on the edge of an area
of housing. The land is designated green belt land, and Leeds city
council has categorically stated that permission for the development of
Cookridge pastures is extremely unlikely to be given for the
foreseeable future. Yet I 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 490WH</b><br>have seen copies of a video and its accompanying letter and a website
that give a very different impression.</p><p><a name="06071261000378">I was pleased that the BBC in
Yorkshire did a special report on the Cookridge pastures development on
its &#147;Inside Out&#148; programme. I will share some of that
with the Chamber to show that English Land Partnership explicitly
claimed to investors, in private, that the local council would award
permission for development. I shall quote an English Land Partnership
employee, Paul Hudson, who was secretly filmed as part of the BBC
investigation. He
said:</p><a name="06071261000495"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We would
submit the application by the end of next year, within 12 months, then
it would take another year, 14 months for them to say yes, so we are
talking about 2, 2 and 1/2 years
tops!&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000379">He went on to say
that those who invested would be
getting</p><a name="06071261000496"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;one of the best
deals on the
market&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000380">Just to leave no
ambiguity about how ELP views Cookridge pastures, I must point out that
Hudson said:</p><a name="06071261000497"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;you are
going to be making &#163;100,000, you are going to be asking me,
&#145;where is the next
project?&#146;&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000381">That
claim is clearly outrageous given the advice that we have had from the
council and the Government; it is incorrect and misleading. Companies
are doing that sort of thing up and down the country. Even after the
airing of &#147;Inside Out&#148;, English Land Partnership
continues to market the development potential of Cookridge pastures.
Its website proclaimed that it is a wonderful &#147;potential future
development opportunity&#148; at the heart of
the</p><a name="06071261000498"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;fastest growing city
in
Europe&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000382">Such
an approach has caused great dismay to local residents and to those who
have been duped into investing in the schemes. It is not an isolated
case. Since introducing my ten-minute Bill last year, I have been
inundated with correspondence from people up and down the country. They
told me of similar schemes, of communities worried about the effect
that the practice will have on their locality, and of investors who
feel that they have been ripped
off.</p><p><a name="06071261000383"><b><a name="06071261000631">Tim
Farron (Westmorland and Lonsdale) (LD):</b> I shall give an
example from another part of the country, as I am sure my hon. Friend
is about to do. It relates to a brownfield site in my constituency. The
site of Sedbergh livestock auction mart, which has planning permission
for that very purpose, is on the market having been temporarily closed.
The excellent farmers&#146; co-operative is hoping to buy the site
but, of course, the site is on the open market. There is every chance
that a company such as the one that he mentioned could purchase the
site, sit on it entirely legally for years with the intent to use it
for something other than what it has planning permission for, and
blackmail&#151;or rather, browbeat&#151;the local authority to
change the permission in years to come. That would cost the community
its local auction mart and would be a blow to it. Does my hon. Friend
agree that that example adds to his case?</p><p><a name="06071261000384"><b><a name="06071261000632">Greg
Mulholland:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for another useful
example. I am also working closely with the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr.
Drew), who alerted me to the practices of Gladwish Land Sales Ltd in
his constituency. In the past few weeks, <i>The Observer </i>has 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 491WH</b><br>exposed land banking scams right across the country and is also calling
for urgent action to stop innocent investors being exploited and local
communities being damaged by the swindles. I am calling for the
situation to be addressed by the Government.</p><p><a name="06071261000385">I acknowledge that, at this
stage, local councils are taking action. Indeed, the Local Government
Association has urged them to make use of all existing available
legislation, including article 4 notices, to respond to the schemes.
However, those notices, which are one of the few weapons that councils
have, only restrict the erection of posts or fences on undeveloped
land. They do not restrict the sale of the land or its mis-selling,
which is what I am focusing on today.</p><p><a name="06071261000386">The LGA also urges councils to
contact trading standards and the Department of Trade and Industry to
inform them of misleading and illegal trading practices. However, there
is confusion over the issue. I contacted the DTI last year and was
informed that because land banking firms such as English Land
Partnership are partnerships and not companies, the DTI does not have
the jurisdiction to investigate the mis-selling practices of such
firms.</p><p><a name="06071261000387">I come to the
specific proposals, for which there are precedents in other parts of
the world. As the Campaign to Protect Rural England has highlighted, in
Australia in December 2005 the European Land Sales Partnership stood
accused of grossly misleading potential investors over its ability to
obtain planning permission and the likelihood of planning permission
being granted on the tracts of land that it owned. The key difference
in that case was that the state government of Victoria was able to act
quickly and decisively to bring a halt to the mis-selling. The state
legislature obtained an interim injunction order against ELSP, which
prevents it from engaging in a range of promotional and marketing
activities until there has been a full hearing into its activities,
which is due to take place in the Victoria Supreme Court this year. So
far, no such decisive action has taken place in the UK. The only course
of action for investors who feel that they have been sold land on a
false premise or been the subject of misrepresentation would appear to
be to pursue cases individually through the courts.</p><p><a name="06071261000388">There is a strong coalition
working on this matter. As I mentioned, I am working with the CPRE. I
am also working with several MPs from all parts of the House, and I
have been contacted by reputable land investment companies, including
possibly the largest such company in the United Kingdom, UK Land
Investments Group. Firms of that nature are concerned, because they
invest large sums to ensure that land is bought and sold legally and
without misrepresentation. They wish to see fly-by-night organisations
brought to book for their scandalous practices and the damage that they
do to the industry.</p><p><a name="06071261000389">We
may need new legislation for that to take place or we might simply need
the extension or clarification of existing legislation. Sufficient
powers might already exist but they might not be being used. What is
clear is that, because of loopholes in the law, a lack of law, or a
lack of action on the part of the Government, firms are being allowed
to escape unpunished, despite engaging in practices that are misleading
and misrepresentative. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge
that.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 492WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000390">In addition to challenging the
Government to consider legislation, I propose the setting up of an
independent, self-regulating body to monitor the actions of land
investment firms to ensure that they are not engaging in the kind of
practices that I have mentioned. Such a move could include the
establishment of an accreditation scheme to ensure that firms act
responsibly and correctly. Only where organisations are found to be
acting accordingly with agreed guidelines would they receive
accreditation and thus be allowed to persist in investing in, and
selling on, tracts of land.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060712/halltext/60712h0332.htm"/>


<p><a name="06071261000391">It might also be useful to have
professional advisers, either directly employed by the regulatory body
or employed on a consultancy basis. They would review the submission
from any company registered to the accreditation organisation to ensure
that any sales and marketing claims are credible. To ensure that that
is accurate, independent assessment could be carried out on an
accredited company&#146;s sites in line with a planning and technical
analysis provided by the accredited company to the professional
advisers. That could include a statement of forecast detailing the type
and time scale of promoting a site for re-allocation and an assessment
of the financial viability and potential customer returns of the
site.</p><p><a name="06071261000392">Another
suggestion would be for all accredited companies to pay a bond of, for
example, &#163;100,000. Should problems occur and a land banking
company be unable to fulfil its obligations on promoting a site or
gaining outline planning permission, the bond would be released to the
accrediting board or organisation, to ensure that a credible planning
application is submitted for the benefits of clients. Furthermore, each
accredited company could be forced to submit, possibly on a semi-annual
basis, an action plan&#151;detailing actions that had been taken on
its obligation to investors and those that it would be taking to do
with the site over the following six or 12 months. If those were
unacceptable, at the board&#146;s discretion accreditation could be
removed and the value of the bond released in order to proceed with a
planning application.</p><p><a name="06071261000393">I hope that those suggestions
will push the debate forward, because the simple fact is that there is
currently little or nothing to stop dishonest and unscrupulous
organisations, partnerships and individuals swallowing up huge tracts
of greenfield land in the middle of local communities and selling it on
to unsuspecting investors on the basis of unsubstantiated and false
promises, with little or no regard to the effect that those practices
have on those
involved.</p><p><a name="06071261000394">Today, I am
tabling an early-day motion, which is co-sponsored by the hon. Members
for Stroud and for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), which I
hope many hon. Members will sign. I ask the Minister and the Government
to take the issue seriously and to acknowledge that there is a problem
that needs to be tackled. The situation has been allowed to persist for
far too long, and urgent action is needed to stop companies,
partnerships and individuals ripping off their investors and damaging
our communities. I hope that the Minister and the Government will work

and expressed his concern about the selling, usually on the internet,
of small plots of land on which, in most cases, there is no realistic
chance of development being allowed. The Government share the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s strong disapproval of plot sale enterprises that
exploit people&#146;s eagerness to build homes in open countryside,
often at the expense of their limited knowledge of planning laws and
policies.</p><p><a name="06071261000398">The
Government recognise the harm and adverse consequences of the
subdivision of land in the countryside. Some of those consequences
arise from open land being divided up with pegs, stakes, or fences,
creating an eyesore that detracts from the appearance of the
countryside. When plots are sold and are no longer in agricultural use,
it can lead to neglect. That is especially difficult to put right if
plot owners cannot be traced.</p><p><a name="06071261000399">The mis-selling of land can be
tackled in a variety of ways. Depending on the nature of the deceit,
instances of mis-selling might be dealt with by the police, the Office
of Fair Trading, local authority trading standards departments or the
Department of Trade and Industry. The latter has powers under the
Companies Act 1985, and can investigate companies if there is reason to
suspect fraud, dishonesty or any other objectionable conduct, and can,
in the public interest, take proceedings to wind up a company and/or
disqualify its directors.</p><p><a name="06071261000400"><b><a name="06071261000635">Greg

Government, and therefore cannot reply on behalf of the DTI. I urge the
hon. Gentleman to talk to Ministers in that Department and to take the
issues up with them. As I said, there is more 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 494WH</b><br>than one way of dealing with the problems, and the provision relating to
companies is only one way. If the hon. Gentleman looks back at the
<i>Hansard</i> record of this debate, he will see that there are a
number of other ways,
too.</p><p><a name="06071261000402">It may be helpful
if I set out the parts of planning law that govern the use of land in
the countryside. The key concept&#151;the trigger for planning
control&#151;is whether something is &#147;development&#148;,
which is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as</p><a name="06071261000499"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the carrying out of building,
engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land, or
the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other
land.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000403">Some
rural land is designated green belt, and there is generally a
presumption against inappropriate development on such land. National
planning policy on green belt is set out in planning policy guidance
note 2. It states that acceptable uses of green belt land are those
that help to fulfil the following objectives: providing access to the
open countryside; providing access to outdoor sport and recreation near
urban areas; retaining attractive landscapes and enhancing landscapes
near to where people live; improving damaged and derelict land around
towns; securing nature conservation interests; and retaining land in
agricultural, forestry and related uses. However, the most important
attribute of green belt is openness, and that has to be the primary
consideration when any different land use is proposed.</p><p><a name="06071261000404">The planning system is not
designed to supervise land ownership or to protect the unaware from
ill-advised purchases. A primary concern of the planning system is the
impact of development on amenity. It would be impractical to place an
added burden on local government in respect of the oversight of the
sale of rural land. However, planning has an important part to play in
limiting harm to rural land.</p><p><a name="06071261000405">In a written statement to the
House on 19 April 2004, the then Minister of State for Housing and
Planning, the right hon. Member for Streatham (Keith Hill), addressed
the concern&#151;expressed here and elsewhere&#151;that farmland
was being subdivided into small plots for sale over the internet. The
statement referred to measures that the Government could bring forward
to enable local planning authorities to take more immediate action as
soon as evidence of abuse was suspected or emerged. At the same time,
we issued a letter to remind local authorities of the powers already
available to tackle planning problems associated with plot sales. That
letter encouraged local planning authorities to advertise, or to use
the internet, to give prospective plot purchasers a realistic idea of
the likely development potential of their plots. The letter also listed
enforcement powers available to local planning authorities to control
unwanted development on rural
land.</p><p><a name="06071261000406">Some development
is given a permitted development right&#151;that is, a general
planning permission&#151;that removes the need to put in a planning
application. Any permitted development right can be withdrawn if there
are strong planning grounds, using powers in article 4 of the Town and
Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. Such
directions may be used if there is a significant, specific and credible
threat to an important amenity. On farms and green belt, a direction
would be subject to confirmation by the 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 495WH</b><br>Secretary of State. Article 4 directions do not forbid development; they
merely require the submission of a planning application for works or
uses otherwise allowed by the order.</p><p><a name="06071261000407">We are working on proposals to
amend the procedures for making article 4 directions, in order to
enable local authorities to bring into effect more quickly and
efficiently a direction to prevent subdivision of rural land. We
propose to increase the scope of local authorities&#146; powers to
remove permitted development rights without having to wait for the
Secretary of State&#146;s approval. We also plan to allow local
authorities to bring article 4 directions into force more quickly by
serving the relevant notice on the land by site display in cases where
one or more owners cannot be identified or located, or where the
numbers of owners or occupiers makes it impractical to serve a notice
on every individual. The planning system is concerned with land use and
the impacts of development; it does not deal with how land is sold, the
ethics of the vendor or even who owns the land and how they might
behave. If there is no development involved, there are no controls to
invoke.</p><p><a name="06071261000408">In conclusion,
we are committed to the protection of the countryside against
inappropriate development and, in particular, to the protection of
green

on the future of open-cast mining in Leicestershire, having requested
it for some time. Tenacity is a much underrated virtue in this
place.</p><p><a name="06071261000414">Rather like the
ghost in Dickens&#146;s &#147;A Christmas Carol&#148;, I shall
look at open-cast coal mining past and present, before considering its
future. In my part of Leicestershire, 25 May 2006 dawned as a cool,
damp morning but rapidly turned into a bleak, black day for the
north-west Leicestershire villages of Ravenstone, Packington, Normanton
le Heath and my lifetime home, Heather. On that day, the Government
announced that they were accepting the planning inquiry
inspector&#146;s recommendation to overturn a Leicestershire county
council refusal of the Long Moor open-cast application to extract
around 750,000 tonnes of coal from an attractive, greenfield site
surrounded by the four places I
mentioned.</p><p><a name="06071261000415">The first
such planning decision taken in the newly created Department for
Communities and Local Government perversely blighted the lives of
numerous communities and flew directly in the face of all three tiers
of local government, which are totally and vigorously united in their
opposition to the plan. I shall try to explain why so many people in
the locality are astonished and
dismayed.</p><p><a name="06071261000416">This is not
a case of nimbyism. Our backyard has been actively worked for
generations and north-west Leicestershire has been quarried and mined
for minerals for centuries. The nation has looked to us for coal, road
stone and clay. Mining gave us jobs, shaped our landscape, and produced
and named tight-knit communities such as Coalfield, but it also created
vistas as bleak and desolate as that encountered by Neil Armstrong on
21 July 1969. The American astronauts saw a lunar landscape of the sort
that we had endured for many decades prior to their historic
flight.</p><p><a name="06071261000417">The worst
environmental offender in the family of industries linked to the
extraction of minerals is open-cast mining. In essence, it is quarrying
relatively shallow seams of coal at depths such that colliers of the
past had to use deep mine techniques or leave them unworked. In the
1940s, a great deal of outcrop coal was removed from land in the
vicinity of the four villages to which I referred. The impact of those
workings is still visible today despite attempts at
restoration.</p><p><a name="06071261000418">In the
early 1970s, the open-casters returned for two huge schemes which
removed many million tonnes of coal from the Coalfield farm site
between Ravenstone and Heather and operating within 120 yd of my home
for much of that time. The latter site was ultimately restored as the
Sence valley forest park and locals were 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 497WH</b><br>beginning to hope that the days of open-casting were over at long last.
However, like a half-forgotten comet on a 30-year orbit, the shadow of
planet open-cast returned in the new millennium. Its gloom engulfed the
mosaic of fields, hedges and trees running up to Normanton wood, under
which lie 8 million tonnes of
coal.</p><p><a name="06071261000419">We tolerated
such strip mining 60 years ago because our nation needed energy to
rebuild an economy and a society stricken by war. We endured it under
duress and with protest in the 1970s as a life support for a declining
deep-mine industry which has, I am sad to say, virtually expired.
However, enough was enough. The case against Long Moor was irrefutable
and we thought that in our fight we had the support of the newly
elected Labour Government, because in the long run-up to the 1997
general election my party&#151;our party&#151;had rightly
identified open-casting as a key issue in numerous marginal
constituencies in the English midlands and Yorkshire.</p><p><a name="06071261000420">Our then environment spokesman,
my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank
Dobson), produced a new policy paper entitled &#147;Open Cast Coal
Mining&#151;Too High a Price&#148; in late 1996, which contained a
bleak but accurate description of the effect of open-casting on the
environment and local communities. That welcome document promised that,
if elected, a Labour Government would revise the relevant planning
framework for such applications&#151;minerals planning guidance 3.
That overdue manifesto on open-cast mining incorporated a 10-point plan
for reducing its impact and promised that an incoming Labour Government
would, inter alia, prohibit open-cast working, except when it was of
benefit to the local community and local environment, allow rejection
of open-cast applications which prejudiced efforts to attract local
investment, restrict repeated applications for development of broadly
similar sites or extensions of existing workings, require any future
consents to set strict and more enforceable environmental standards
and, finally and centrally, reduce the national reliance on open-cast
as part of our overall energy policy. So far so good, although a few
problems did start to emerge.</p><p><a name="06071261000421">There was
predictable hostility from sections of the now privatised mining
industry. Some minerals planning authorities predicted difficulties
with fashioning a new MPG3. Even the Prime Minister, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), began to soft pedal on
open-cast controversies in his own patch. Nevertheless, there was
optimism in the heady early days after 1 May 1997 that the Dobson plan
could be made to work. The newly fashioned Department of the
Environment, Transport and Regions published its consultation paper on
planning guidance for open-cast coal applications in late July. I shall
fast forward over a long period of intense lobbying.</p><p><a name="06071261000422">The revised version of MPG3 for
England was eventually published in March 1999. It was a dilution of
the 10-point programme promised to communities threatened by open-cast
proposals in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and elsewhere, but it tightened
controls and made concessions to long-term opponents of open-cast, such
as me. The key changes, to which I shall return shortly, were that the
need for sustainable 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 498WH</b><br>development was stressed, as was a presumption against development
unless the application satisfied a number of tests, the key one being:
is the proposal environmentally acceptable or can it be made so by
planning conditions or obligations and, if not, does it provide local
or community benefits that clearly outweigh the likely
impacts?</p><p><a name="06071261000423">It seemed to
me then, as it does now, that the changes were adequate to allow local
planning authorities, without fear of lost appeals, to refuse open-cast
coal applications on greenfield sites, especially as decisions can
reflect the cumulative effects of adverse consequences in areas like
north-west Leicestershire, which has long endured surface coal
extraction.</p><p><a name="06071261000424">Let me
summarise the history of the application that I plan to describe in a
moment. British Coal had sought permission in 1990 for the whole of the
enormous Coalfield West site with 8 million tonnes of open-cast coal
lying between the post-war excavations near Packington and 1970s, 1980s
and 1990s workings in Heather and Ravenstone, all of which were
eventually restored in 1995. That proposal was seen off by a huge tidal
wave of opposition, led magnificently by a local protest group, Fight
Open Cast in Leicestershire&#151;FOIL&#151;to whose work I
regularly and sincerely pay admiring tribute.</p><p><a name="06071261000425">A later, smaller Thorntree
application in the same area by RJB Mining for 5 million tonnes of coal
over six years from 500 acres was also rejected after a long community
campaign in 1998. In late 2003, along came UK Coal with an even smaller
proposal, seductively entitled Long Moor. This was an application to
take out in just three years a small amount of coal, 725,000 tonnes,
from a site of only 175 acres. I am, of course, speaking ironically. It
gave a commitment that when the site was finished and restored with
extra woodland, wetland and grassland&#151;who would not want to
visit that?&#151;UK Coal would go away and never return.</p><p><a name="06071261000426">The county council refused the
application in July 2004 as it said that it would have</p><a name="06071261000500"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;an unacceptable cumulative
environmental impact which would adversely affect those who live, work
and pursue leisure activities in the
area&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000427">which</p><a name="06071261000501"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;would
not be outweighed by the benefits the proposals would
bring&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000428">The final phrase
was crucial. UK Coal appealed in that November and a public inquiry was
held at Snibston discovery park, Coalfield last autumn. Time is not
available this afternoon, nor is this the appropriate place, to cover
in any detail the powerful case against Long Moor made by FOIL,
Ravenstone open-cast opposition group, parish councils, villagers like
myself and Leicestershire county council. However, I shall give a brief
outline in an attempt to demonstrate that our Government's new criteria
for refusal of open-cast coal applications were amply met.</p><p><a name="06071261000429">Our four villages lie within
the 200 square miles of the National forest, which has for 10 years
been a major driver for environmental restoration and economic
regeneration in a large part of the east and west midlands. Much of the
land in and around the site is in active agricultural use and is
overlaid by a network of mature hedgerows, copses and dense woodland.
No 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 499WH</b><br>wonder so many local people value their recreation on those quiet rural
byways. This is not brownfield land crying out for restoration; it is
an area of green fields crying out to be left
alone.</p><p><a name="06071261000430">There is a real
fear that Long Moor will accelerate the return of the stigma linked to
a century and more of mining and minerals working, which would slow and
probably put into reverse the positive changes and improvements that we
have recently experienced. There is anxiety about the health risks
associated with the extra noise, dust and traffic. They will have a
major impact on Ravenstone, and especially nearby Woodstone primary
school, which opened just a few days ago and lies downwind of Long
Moor. There is concern that the site will threaten important local
businesses involved in horticultural production, as they are vulnerable
to the dust cocktail that open-casting tends to generate. The headline
in the <i>Leicester Mercury </i>just a day or two ago said
&#147;Opencast mine will ruin our businesses&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071261000431">There is no special need for
such coal, which the inquiry heard was of a poor quality. It is clear
that the tonnage projected is too small to be an important national
benefit, significant to the coal-trade balance or essential to
industry. A coal-fired power station would burn the four years&#146;
production of that site in as many weeks. The site would be
loss-making, and it would weaken the already imperilled UK Coal with
major implications for operational performance, completion and final
restoration.</p><p><a name="06071261000432">I have
thought about this issue a lot, and the only commercial motive for the
site must be a covert expectation that planning attrition in 2010 or
beyond will lead to successive phases of work, so that salami-slicing
of the adjacent Coalfield West reserves to the south will generate
profits to justify the substantial infrastructure costs that Long Moor
cannot in any way fund. The site will not generate profits, and it will
certainly not pay for overheads.</p><p><a name="06071261000433">I am concerned about news that
I received today. The July issue of <i>Coal UK</i> refers to a round
table meeting organised by the Department for Trade and Industry for
representatives of the open-cast coal industry. I hope that it is not
part of a process to soften up the Government, especially in relation
to MPG3. The journal seemed to take the line that the industry will
have a chance to encourage local councils to be grown up about
open-casting. Grown up about open-casting? I have grown up surrounded
by open-casting. All my life there has been open-casting in my area, so
I do not need any encouragement from the coal producers to be grown up
about it.</p><p><a name="06071261000434">As we heard
in the Chamber from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
yesterday, we need secure, sustainable and clean energy in this
country. Moreover, with the vast majority of dirty power generators
being coal-fired power stations, local authorities and, by extension,
planning inspectors and the Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government, ought to have particular regard for policy planning
statement 1, 2005, which, in paragraph 13(ii) of its key principles,
states:</p><a name="06071261000502"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Regional planning
bodies and local planning authorities should ensure that development
plans contribute to global sustainability by addressing the causes and
potential impacts of climate change&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 500WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000435">I look forward to hearing the Minister
reply to that.</p><p><a name="06071261000436">PPS1
should lead inexorably to the rejection of the vast majority of
open-cast applications, as the democratic means of processing
applications will ensure that any open-cast application offering
immense economic and other benefits to the local community&#151;that
community being supportive&#151;could still be given the green light.
Paragraph 41 of PPS1 makes it abundantly clear that a key principle of
sustainable development is
to</p><a name="06071261000503"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;involve the community
in developing the vision for its area.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071261000437">Returning to Long Moor, in the
two years between published application and public inquiry, there was
as remarkable a cross-party and cross-community display of unity,
energy and determination to defeat the application as I have seen in
more than 35 years of public life. Our collective vision for the area
did not and could not embrace the reintroduction of such a damaging
activity as open-cast coal mining, the effects of whose impacts are
being overcome only now, many years later. If that is not cumulative
and unacceptable adverse impacts, what on earth
is?</p><p><a name="06071261000438"><b><a name="06071261000641">Judy
Mallaber (Amber Valley) (Lab):</b> I understand my hon.
Friend&#146;s despair at the decision, which I shared, having heard

UK Coal for the Lodge House site in my constituency. We still await the

have hope.</p><p><a name="06071261000439">Did my
hon. Friend make the argument about the cumulative impacts on his area,
and the despair and horror felt by people who have experienced them
time and again? In one case in my area, they have been experienced for
50 years, on and off. Does he share my concern at what seems to be a
misinterpretation by the inspector of paragraph 18 of MPG3 about the
way in which cumulative impacts should be taken into
account?</p><p><a name="06071261000440"><b><a name="06071261000642">David

concerns. I regret to say that I reach my 60th birthday on 22 August. I
have lived in the same village all my life, and in all that time, my
village has had contact with active or fairly recent open-casting. We
know what open-casting is about, and it is cumulative and unacceptable
in every sense.</p><p><a name="06071261000441">In
light of the Long Moor effects that I have described, UK Coal&#146;s
proposal would have had to offer some extraordinary incentives to the
local area to receive planning approval from the minerals planning
authority or the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government on appeal. It manifestly did not, so within the revised
guidelines, it had to be rejected. Incredibly, it was not, which brings
me full circle to my opening remarks.</p><p><a name="06071261000442">It is now 48 days since the
recommendations of the inquiry inspector and the Government&#146;s
tame acceptance of them dropped on to local doormats and into e-mail
inboxes. I am still as baffled now as I was then how the chief
inspector should have so readily bought UK Coal&#146;s specious
arguments, swallowed its flimsy case whole and so lightly set aside the
tightened framework for dealing with such applications which, as I have
tried to describe, was assembled with such care 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 501WH</b><br>in the run up to and after 1997. She set at naught local concerns. There
was no rhyme, reason or rationale in the inspector&#146;s astonishing
decision. It was sloppy and it verged on the incompetent. It was
utterly detached from the clear environmental manifesto on which our
Labour Government were elected in 1997, and from the subsequent
planning and regulatory regimes that we have put in place to implement
those commitments and policies.</p><p><a name="06071261000443">It is now 48 hours since I
started to research this speech, and in that time I have reflected a
great deal on the role of Ministers, who must of course take the final
responsibility for what has happened. I hope that whoever lifted the
application out of their red box fully understood the policy background
to that complex and crucial planning decision and knew about the
precedent being set. I hope that it does not influence the decision in
Amber Valley, just a few miles to the north of my constituency. I hope
also that the Minister concerned appreciated the importance of the
matter to communities in English coal mining areas. In Wales and
Scotland, it is a devolved matter.</p><p><a name="06071261000444">If the decision was signed off
in haste or without proper consideration the Department for Communities
and Local Government must be held to account for a deeply depressing
rejection of the views of rural communities and the apparently casual
disregard of the local government system that represents them and
exists to protect them. Communities and local government are the raison
d&#146;tre of the new Department, and it seems as if that
raison d&#146;tre has been forgotten.</p>

<p><a name="06071261000445">I shall finally say a word or
two about the performance of Leicestershire county council. I should
state that I am a former employee of the authority pre-1997, although
not in planning. For the care with which it consulted the community,
the professionalism of its assessment of a lengthy and complicated
proposal and the robustness of its submission at the inquiry, it
deserves the highest commendation. At the inquiry, the concept of
cumulative impact was at the core of every day&#146;s
evidence from every witness. I am glad that the council has taken the
Department to judicial review. If the council is successful, the
Department must take note, so that future greenfield open-casting in
Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire and elsewhere will finally be
laid to rest.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071261000530">4.58
pm</h5><p><a name="06071261000446"><b><a name="06071261000643">The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) on
securing the debate. I should like to take this opportunity to assure
colleagues once again that the Government firmly believe that access to
a range of energy sources is essential to ensure security of supply.
There will be a continuing role for coal in meeting our energy needs
for years to come, provided that its potential environmental impacts
can be managed satisfactorily.</p><p><a name="06071261000447">We also believe that there is a
future role for UK-produced coal in meeting our total coal needs. This
country still has substantial coal reserves, and they represent an
important national asset that we 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 502WH</b><br>must put to optimum use. However, we have to face facts: coal, like
every other mineral, can be exploited only where it is found. For that
reason, we must strike the right balance between the legitimate
interests of the coal producers, the potential environmental impacts of
development and the needs of the community in the immediate area and at
national level. That is not always an easy balance to strike, of
course. It is true both of coal at depth, suitable for underground
mining or coal gasification, and of shallow reserves suitable only for
surface working.</p><p><a name="06071261000448">That
is not to say that all coal must be worked at all costs or regardless
of the impact on local communities. The planning guidance for England
clearly states that unless development proposals are environmentally
acceptable, can be made so through conditions or offer compensatory
benefits there should be a presumption against approval being granted.
Similar guidance is in place in Scotland and is expected shortly, I am
advised, in Wales.</p><p><a name="06071261000449">All applications for new
underground or surface mines must be assessed against those guidelines
and those that meet them should be approved. I am unable to comment on
the specific application that affects my hon. Friend&#146;s
constituents, but I understand&#151;and it has been confirmed
today&#151;that it has been considered through the full planning
process, including a public inquiry and an inspector&#146;s report,
which the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
accepted, and that it is now the subject of a challenge in the High
Court through judicial review.</p><p><a name="06071261000450">I understand that the
application is for permission to work some 725,000 tonnes of coal from
the site. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Coaling is expected to take about two
and a half years out of a total site life of about four years, to be
followed by a further period of management of the restored site.
Previous unsuccessful applications, which related to areas that include
the smaller site that has now been approved, were made in 1990, 1992
and 1997. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The last two were permissions to work
4.8 million and 5.3 million tonnes of coal respectively over a site
life of six years. There are other unworked coal reserves in the
county.</p><p><a name="06071261000451"><b><a name="06071261000644">David

Government have demonstrated their support for the coal industry by
making more than &#163;200,000 available in coal aid since 2000. Some
&#163;18 million of that was paid to surface mine operators under the
UK coal operating aid scheme to cover production losses during 2001 and
2002. No surface mine has benefited from coal investment aid. Despite
that support, the total UK output fell by 18 per cent. in 2005
to 20 million tonnes of coal. That 
<br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 503WH</b><br>included deep mine production of 9.5 million tonnes, of which 9 million
tonnes were produced at English mines, and surface mine production of
10.4 million tonnes, of which only 1.5 million tonnes were produced in
England. Leicestershire&#146;s contribution was a little under 95,000
tonnes of surface-mined coal, down from 412,000 tonnes in 2004 and
almost 600,000 tonnes in 2003. Some 50 direct mining jobs have already
been lost in the county as a result of that decline. The 2005 output
was from a site which is due to close in October this year with the
potential loss of a further 22 jobs.</p><p><a name="06071261000456">The main customers for all UK
coal production are the coal-fired generators. They consistently stress
the importance of reliability of supplies in contract negotiations, but
deep mining is inherently higher risk, because of the potential
geological and technological problems, and the assurance of steady
production from surface sites is vital to give the generators
confidence that UK production can continue to help to meet their needs.
That is why it is important for everyone with the best interests of the
UK coal industry at heart to recognise that the deep and surface mine
sectors are not in competition and that they need each other to
maintain the critical mass of the industry and to secure its
future.</p><p><a name="06071261000457"><b><a name="06071261000648">David

Government&#146;s belief that there will be a continuing role for
coal in meeting our energy needs, particularly as cleaner generating
technologies come on stream, and that UK-produced coal&#151;deep and
surface mined&#151;can continue to play a part in meeting national
coal demand, provided that it can be worked in an acceptable
manner.</p><p><a name="06071261000460">I understand
my hon. Friend&#146;s frustration, but I have been trying to set out
something of a national context to balance the arguments and to try to
reflect the views of those who hope for a future for British indigenous
coal, as the energy review reiterated yesterday. I can understand, too,
why he would be frustrated, but given that the planning controversy is
now subject to judicial review in the High Court it would not be right
for me to comment on the rights or wrongs of the case or of any other
planning controversy. I hope that my hon. Friend will understand
that.</p><p><a name="06071261000461"><b><a name="06071261000650">David
Taylor:</b> I understand perfectly well that the Minister will
not be able to comment on the planning merits or otherwise of the Long
Moor application. However, when he says that open-casting is an
important economic contributor to employment, does he recognise that
the presence of an open-cast site in the vicinity of an area that is
being restored environmentally and rebuilt economically can be a hurdle
and a weight around the neck when it comes to trying to attract new
firms with high-tech, highly skilled and highly waged jobs? They will
look at a despoiled area that has been wasted by minerals working.
Open-cast mining has a net negative effect on the local
economy.</p><br><notus-date day="12" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>12 July 2006 : Column 504WH</b><br><p><a name="06071261000462"><b><a name="06071261000651">Malcolm

Friend. I also recognise, of course&#151;it is plain common
sense&#151;that with any plans for any community or area, the pros
and cons of different industries can be argued in terms of the impact
on the labour market and job opportunities. I hear what he has said,

for any area, and one use might help or hinder other job opportunities

would not be right for me to comment on the particular proposal. It is
actually a matter for the Department for Communities and Local
Government and not my Department, the Department of Trade and
Industry&#151;I think that I am answering this debate because of the
coal mining issues. I am at pains to say that if we are serious about
British indigenous coal having a future, there has to be some balance
between deep mining and surface mining, but that it is not for me to
make a judgment about whether it is appropriate in the hon.

Burgon (Elmet) (Lab):</b> I am aware after reading <i>Coal

coaling companies later this month. Will the Minister assure us, as
this might cause wider reverberation on the Labour Benches, that there
will be no slipping away of support from MPG3? Many of us are engaged
in a struggle to implement it and if we see any backsliding by our
Government on the issue, we will be&#151;how shall I put

strike the proper balances. I am not quite sure exactly what that
meeting will entail, but we meet a wide variety of energy interests and
hear a variety of views about surface mining, its future and its
non-future. That is as far as I can go. There are no plans to change
the policy and the practice.</p><p><a name="06071261000466"><b><a name="06071261000654">David
Taylor:</b> The Minister is being most generous in giving way,
and he knows that I genuinely hold him in the highest regard in his
departmental role. On the Floor of the House yesterday, I acknowledged
the welcome role for coal that the Secretary of State spelled out in
his statement, but I said that, in the long time frame for the
investment needed for carbon-capturing clean coal, a greater role for
coal in generation is likely to be dealt with only through the
expansion of imports and of open-cast mining, the second of which is
unacceptable to local communities.</p><p><a name="06071261000467"><b><a name="06071261000655">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> That, of course, has been the burden of my hon.
Friend&#146;s remarks. The question is whether it is unacceptable in
the wider economy and among all local communities. The figures that I
have given, not least for Scotland, show that surface mining now plays
a significant part. We have to get the balance right. I am not talking
about Leicestershire, as I have been at pains to stress, but we have to
get the balance right if we are serious&#151;I think we want to be
serious&#151;about British indigenous coal having a future.

with the energy infrastructure, whether it is onshore or offshore wind
farms, future power stations, or even the infrastructure that we might
need for carbon capture and storage, is to have a body of Members of
Parliament who will agree to things and not simply object to them. My
role in such debates is often to hear objections to wind farms or
whatever it might be, but if we are to have the necessary energy
supplies we must think through the investment needed in Great Britain
as a whole. That is not a comment about surface mining or about
Leicestershire, it is a general comment.</p><p><a name="06071261000469"><b><a name="06071261000656">David

that we do not yet fully comprehend. No one is trying to avoid making a
