<a name="31021h01_para0"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Gillian Merron.]</i>
<P>

<a name="31021h01_time0"><H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew0"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: Today's first debate is initiated by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). The subject is important, particularly for London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew1"><B> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham):</B> 
 I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this subject in Parliament. There may be debates on Crossrail back in the archives, but I think that this is the first debate in modern times on the subject. As you say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the project is enormously important to my constituency and many others. I shall speak in support of it, but I also want to open up debate on some of the issues that it presents.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para1">I have a parochial interest in that my constituency lies on what I think is called corridor 6&#151;one of the branches that will spin off from the spine of the Crossrail project and go through Richmond, Twickenham and Kingston. That has the potential to benefit my constituency enormously, but I am not introducing this debate in a parochial spirit: the project has major implications for the whole of London and the region. There are other major spines, running to Reading and Maidenhead, Aylesbury and Buckingham, Watford, and Brentwood in Essex. Probably most important in terms of development is the north Kent route from Dartford. The project will primarily benefit the parts of London around Whitechapel, which is one of the focal points of the project. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber will get an opportunity to express their point of view on the subject.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew2"><B> Dr. Jenny Tonge  (Richmond Park):</B> 
 My hon. Friend knows that there are huge benefits to be gained across London from the Crossrail project, particularly in my constituency, as there will be much improved access to central London, the City and Heathrow from Kingston and Richmond. However, there are concerns among some of my constituents about the loss of the District line beyond Turnham Green. Does he agree that, as we go forward with the much needed Crossrail project, full consultation with all involved is essential, so that people understand the implications and can advance their point of view?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew3"><B> Dr. Cable </B> 
: Yes, that is a sensible and helpful contribution. I note that my hon. Friend is a member of the new all-party Crossrail group, which is chaired by the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Linda Perham). My hon. Friend and I both support the project and envisage great benefits from it for our constituencies.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para2">As is inevitable, people are beginning to look at the detailed implications of the project and discover potential problems with certain stations. I will come to <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 184WH</B></P>
the issues that my hon. Friend raised later, but her key conclusion&#151;that there has to be proper consultation&#151;is absolutely right. I am sure that when that consultation takes place, those residents expressing concern will be reassured that the project will be greatly to their benefit.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para3">I enlarge that point to suggest that the project now has broad support. That is significant. The project is a joint venture between the rail industry, embodied in the Strategic Rail Authority, and Transport for London, which expresses the collective view of the Mayor and the Greater London Assembly. It has the support of important London organisations such as the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Corporation of London, which has said that the project is extremely important for the London economy. The Crossrail project has, as far as I am aware, attracted the support of all London boroughs, or at least all those potentially affected by it. In addition, as I have mentioned, it has wide support in the House. The all-party Crossrail group has just got off the ground and so far has the support of 100 MPs and peers. The project has wide support, and I expect that support to grow.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para4">I shall not spell out the implications in great detail, but the rationale behind the project is environmental and economic. The Secretary of State for Transport broadly accepted the transport case in his statement on 14 July. When Crossrail is complete, it will take about 160,000 passengers at peak hours, diverting them from other, highly congested, routes. In a report last week, the Select Committee on Transport pointed out the massive economic cost and personal discomfort stemming from the current level of overcrowding, and said that the creation of the additional service would reduce those factors by speeding up journey times and increasing the flexibility of journeys. Considerable transport benefits will flow from the project.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para5">Crossrail will not proceed unless those transport benefits are translated into a positive economic cost-benefit return. A study that is now with the Department for Transport and which will, I hope, be in the public domain soon&#151;I have seen only fragments of it&#151;suggests, based on fairly modest assumptions, that the considerable cost of the project, estimated to be between &#163;10 billion and &#163;15 billion, depending on the assumptions made, is considerably exceeded by the economic benefits, which will amount to &#163;20 billion or more. Complex issues relating to discounting and the measuring of the economic benefits of big infrastructure projects remain, but Crossrail seems to be a project with considerable net economic and transport benefits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew4"><B> Linda Perham  (Ilford, North):</B> 
 The hon. Gentleman might go on to cover my point, but I hope that he has also considered the possible negative impact if Crossrail is not built.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew5"><B> Dr. Cable </B> 
: That point was implied in my previous comments. If we do not go ahead with Crossrail, the economic benefits will not be realised. One or two more modest projects have been proposed, probably to circumvent some of the inevitable practical and political difficulties that the Crossrail project faces, but there is a danger of taking the line of least resistance and forgoing the considerable economic benefits of Crossrail.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para6">There are areas of potential controversy. First, who will provide the considerable funding needed? The promoters of the project are realistic and wise to suggest <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 185WH</B></P>
that the majority of funding must come from private sources. In their initial statements, they acknowledge that the Government will be asked to provide quite a large pump-priming contribution of about &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion. However, the bulk of funding must come from the private sector, which is right given that most of the benefits will be realised by private business and, potentially, private investors.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para7">The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has made some useful suggestions about where the money might come from. A large amount might come from equity finance and from long-term bond issues in the tradition of the big Victorian infrastructure projects, which makes sense in today's low inflation environment. There is clearly support for that from some financial institutions already.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para8">The people who directly benefit from the appreciation of property values and developments along the line might also contribute. That is a slightly more controversial idea, which I instinctively support to some extent. A development levy or supplementary business rate charged on some of the beneficiaries has been proposed. There are practical problems with the proposal, but the London government are sensible to consider it as a supplementary source of finance. At this early stage, it would be interesting to find out how the Government see the balance of funding between charges made to beneficiaries, private finance and Government finance.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para9">The second controversial area is the project's timing. The London Mayor is specifically committed to getting Crossrail, or its basic spine, running by 2011 or 2012, in time for the Olympic games. I am not here to argue the pros and cons of the Olympic games. The advantage of having such a timetable is that it might help to prevent the endless slippage that has affected other big projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew6"><B> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge):</B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman concede that the Olympic bid is not at all dependent on the Crossrail project going ahead, and that it would be doing a disservice to that bid to imply in any way that that might be the case?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew7"><B> Dr. Cable </B> 
: I think that that argument applies in both directions: the Olympic bid is certainly not dependent on the Crossrail project, and I certainly do not want the Crossrail project to be dependent on the Olympic bid. Each stands independently on its own merits. The Crossrail project offers potentially more permanent and more substantial benefits, and we should be arguing for it on its own. None the less, it is useful to have the discipline of a time framework; otherwise deadlines slip, as they invariably have on big projects in the past.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para10">It is more important to discuss the usefulness of the approach that the project promoters have set out. Instead of going through the traditional route of a Government White Paper, a public consultation and a long planning inquiry process, what is proposed is a Government response followed by an enabling Bill, which would enable the project to proceed with full parliamentary authority. That would foreshorten the process as well as give it democratic legitimacy. My understanding of the timetable is that if that Bill were to <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 186WH</B></P>
be put to Parliament next year, legislation would be in place by 2005, giving a five to seven-year time horizon for the project to be initiated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew8"><B> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham):</B> 
 Will the hon. Gentleman tell us his and his party's thinking on the type of vehicle to hold the assets that should be proposed in such legislation? Would there be any state guarantee of the project, directly or indirectly, through such a vehicle?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew9"><B> Dr. Cable </B> 
: The honest answer is that we have not yet developed a dogmatic view on what that vehicle should be and whether there should be a state guarantee. The project promoters envisage that with the combination of finance that I have already described&#151;some state funding and some market funding&#151;the project may well be viable in its own terms. However, I am sure that there will be pressures to provide guarantees. The right hon. Gentleman probably had long experience of the Eurostar project and all the underwriting pressures that came from that, so I understand why he poses his questions. The honest answer is that we have not defined a detailed policy response. My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), who I know will want to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, may want to develop the issue a little more.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para11">As the project proceeds, we shall uncover the detailed difficulties. As groups of residents become aware of the project, they will see that the service affecting their particular town or village is not quite as they envisaged. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) has already pointed out that the highly articulate and aware residents of one district served by Kew underground station have already spotted that under the proposals they might lose their District line service, which could have the effect of making them change trains. That is a minor inconvenience that we have to take into account and on which we have to consult with them, but I do not see it as a massive problem.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para12">I am worried that local politicians, particularly the GLA member for my area, are jumping on the bandwagon and creating a degree of unease and division that is not merited. I hope that we will all try to approach the matter responsibly and recognise that there are considerable net benefits to our respective communities from the project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew10"><B> Miss Anne McIntosh  (Vale of York):</B> 
 I believe that the hon. Gentleman is now the Treasury spokesman for his party. Does he imagine that there will be any charge to the public purse, and if so, what that charge would be and from which budget it would come?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew11"><B> Dr. Cable </B> 
: I am delighted that my Conservative colleague has noticed my new role. I have been in it for three days and no doubt I shall be working out the financial implications of the project during the next 18 months. To be frank, I have not yet worked out the details of how the Crossrail project will affect our general election commitments in the public finance field. I have already explained that the common understanding is that the Government will be expected to make a pump-priming commitment to the project, although most of the money will have to come from the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 187WH</B></P>
private sector. In my new role, I am certainly not looking for expensive public expenditure commitments, nor do I think that Crossrail is one. The Crossrail project will fly on its own merits.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para13">The key point to stress&#151;from which I was slightly distracted by that intervention&#151;is that there are potentially enormous benefits from Crossrail, but it will create difficulties for particular local communities, which provides all the more reason to initiate a detailed process of public consultation. Those in charge of the project have made an effort to consult individual households, but consciousness of Crossrail is only just beginning to sink in. I hope that those of us who are committed to Crossrail and think that it will have enormous benefits will begin the process of getting communities engaged and persuading them of the merits of a brave and important infrastructure project.

<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew12"><B> Linda Perham  (Ilford, North):</B> 
 I welcome this debate, and congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing it. He mentioned the formation of the all-party group on Crossrail, which I chair, and its membership of about 100. It includes Members from both Houses, and not just London Members but representatives of other parts of the country, including the hon. Gentleman himself and several other hon. Members present today. It was perhaps a coincidence, and certainly a fortunate happenstance, that the all-party group was set up literally days before the Secretary of State's announcement on 14 July of the Government's support in principle for the project. The all-party group wants to be a focus in Parliament for support for the Crossrail project as it progresses to completion in the next decade.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para14">The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) referred to public consultation. There has already been a public awareness campaign, and full public consultation started this month. An information exhibition for the central London boroughs was held at Church house in Westminster, and one for the eastern boroughs will be held at the museum of docklands. There is a programme of dates, venues and visits covering places as far away as Heathrow in the west and Dartford and Gravesend in the east. Consultation in the hon. Lady's constituency will take place at the end of November, so I hope that that reassures her.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para15">As the project will have such an effect on the future of London, there is a move to involve and interest young people in the project. There is even a "Young Crossrail" newsletter. Secondary school students in my borough are being invited to take part in a competition to design a Crossrail carriage. Cross London Rail Links is obviously trying to ensure that everybody knows about the project, gets behind it and raises any problems that they have with it.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para16">From my point of view, it is vital that Crossrail is built in north-east London. Just how important it will be to easing congestion and overcrowding became even more obvious at the beginning of the year, when we lost the Central line for three months. I have eight Central line stations in my constituency, and the only rail alternatives are the First Great Eastern via Ilford and the Jubilee line from Stratford. My borough is one of <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 188WH</B></P>
those that export the majority of their work force into the City and central London, so there is a pressing need to improve the transport infrastructure, as well as to cope with the population and economic growth that the Thames gateway regeneration plans promise to deliver.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew13"><B> Mr. Randall </B> 
: I represent the other end of the Central line. Does the hon. Lady not think it rather sad that we are talking about this project at a time when not only the Central line but the Northern line is being disrupted? I think that she is making the point that we should get our act together to ensure that existing rail services also work properly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew14"><B> Linda Perham </B> 
: I agree. The London underground has been running since 1863, and some would say that it is doing rather well for such an old system. As the hon. Gentleman says, there is a need for investment in London's rail services. That would benefit not only London workers, but everyone who comes into the capital for tourism and other reasons. London needs a good rail system.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para17">In January this year, a study of the wider benefits of Crossrail was carried out for Canary Wharf by the Centre for Economics and Business Research. It estimated that, by 2023, Crossrail could stimulate an extra 181,000 jobs in London, of which 115,000 would be diverted from outside the United Kingdom. That would provide opportunities for some of London's most deprived communities, leading to lower dependency on benefits, reductions in health problems and crime, and improvements in educational attainment and housing in seven London boroughs, with my borough, Redbridge, being one of the greatest gainers. The study concluded that failure to invest in London's rail network would slow the growth of London's gross domestic product by 2 per cent. per annum and lead to a haemorrhage of about 500,000 jobs. Crossrail is vital to all Londoners, not only those in my area, and to people who travel into London for work and leisure, or who visit the city from throughout the country and the world.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para18">London's position as the engine of the UK economy and its future existence as an international business and financial centre will be strengthened and enhanced by Crossrail; without it, both will be threatened. Other UK regions should not regard investment in Crossrail as yet more resources being spent on the capital. People outside London and the south-east should welcome the fact that there will be an increase in the 4 million jobs that London already generates in the rest of the country and additional demand for goods and services from London, as well as benefits to the whole UK economy, including an increase in the net fiscal contribution that London makes each year to the Treasury, which is currently estimated to be about &#163;20 billion.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para19">As the hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned, funding is the key issue. How do we pay for this exciting project? A large investment is required&#151;perhaps as much as &#163;15 billion. Contacts that I, as chair of the all-party group, have pursued with the business community&#151;in particular with London First and Canary Wharf&#151;have confirmed that business in general is convinced of the benefits of Crossrail, but that business people need to know as soon as possible the direction the Government wish to pursue in finding the funding. I am glad that the Government have set up the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 189WH</B></P>
expert panel under Adrian Montague, which is due to report by the turn of the year on the financing options for the project.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para20">I congratulate the Government on taking the important step of backing the Crossrail project. One estimate dates its origin back to 1948, which would make it slightly younger than me. Investment in Crossrail is essential. I fear that if the present commitment to the project is not carried through now, it will be too late to save London from overcrowding, congestion and environmental damage. If the investment is not made, improved transport facilities, more jobs, better housing, the regeneration of the Thames gateway area, the wider benefits to the country as a whole, and London's place in the world, will all be put at risk. I urge the Minister not to lose the opportunity that was squandered by previous Governments to embrace, in co-operation with the business community, the potential presented by the exciting Crossrail project.

<P>
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew17"><B> Mr. John Redwood  (Wokingham):</B> 
 The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) has done us a great service in securing the debate. The state of the railways is lamentable; they are in financial chaos, thanks to the Government's stupid intervention and partial renationalisation of the system. We have also been done a service because the Liberal Democrats have demonstrated that, as always, they are all hot air and good intentions, with no sensible plans whatever for putting the system right. It was quite extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman should have gone to the lengths of securing the debate and, presumably, preparing for it and yet be quite unable to answer the most elementary questions.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para21">What is the cost likely to be and how could it be paid for? The hon. Gentleman cannot tell us how much public subsidy or grant the Liberal Democrats would recommend the Government pay to get the project pump primed. He cannot tell us whether there needs to be an implicit or explicit Government guarantee on all or part of the other moneys, and he cannot say how much revenue subsidy there should be. He cannot explain how his suggestions would integrate with the existing Network Rail system and the London underground. He concedes that it could be embarrassing if part of the underground service were no longer available, but he does not know how he would handle that. He had nothing to say about the financial chaos on Network Rail at the moment, which is the backdrop against which we must judge the plans and ideas.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para22">My interest is twofold. First, I am interested as a Member of Parliament from the Berkshire area. Some of the commuters from that area who currently use rail services would benefit if trains went beyond Paddington <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 190WH</B></P>
into the west end and the City; they would rather make their journey on a single train, without having to change. Many of my constituents might use such a service if it was better than their current service and available in all senses. Such a project could add to the charms of a rail service. However, I have been led to believe that the Reading area is no longer to be linked into Crossrail&#151;there have already been cuts before there is a proper plan. My constituents and I naturally find that disappointing.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para23">Secondly, I am interested in the financing of the project. I do not think that this country can afford to increase the amount of public subsidy for the railway network. One of the biggest financial disasters so far under the Labour Government was the decision to bankrupt Railtrack and take over responsibility for the funding of much of the railway network. There have been huge escalations in costs, guarantees and actual subsidy paid and, at the same time, a deterioration in service standards and quality.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para24">Until the Government solve that problem it is difficult to get going on exciting new projects that could expand and improve the network. I hope that my party will state clearly that we want Crossrail, but that it will have to be a proper private sector project and there will not be public money available for large pump-priming subsidies or guarantees covering all the capital and revenue losses that could ensue if the project miscarried.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para25">In previous debates on railways in Westminster Hall and the main Chamber, Ministers have led me to believe that under the new Network Rail regime Wokingham would get a new station, which it desperately needs. There is currently an inadequate, small set of station buildings that are in an advanced state of decay and need to be replaced. We owe it to the long-suffering commuters to offer them better facilities. The station does not live up to the general standards&#151;it sticks out like a sore thumb in a town that is otherwise well provided for, where the private sector institutions reinvest and maintain their properties. I should like more of my constituents who want to use the railways to do so, but we need a more welcoming station if they are to do so. In addition, there must be a proper transport interchange with better links to the railway so that more people are encouraged to use it.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para26">I want reassurance from Minister that whatever decisions are made on the public finance contribution and on other big projects, such as the west coast main line, which has a more immediate claim on the Government's resources, there will be resources available for more modest but none the less important projects, such as the redevelopment of Wokingham station. A better service could thereby be offered to people who are currently paying for the railway.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para27">My constituents are paying many times over for the bungled mismanagement of the railway system. Those who use the railways pay dearly through the fares levied on them, in addition to which we all have to pay substantial taxes, which are being guzzled up by the cash guzzler that is Network Rail. I hope that the Minister will comment on the current financial situation of the railways. He may be able to tell us that their management are beginning to get to grips with their cost overruns and heavy losses. It is against that background that we must examine such large projects.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 191WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para28">If the Minister is wise he will say that it would be better to spend what money there is on improving the performance and asset base for existing service users. Crossrail is a very desirable large-scale new project, but it should be entirely privately financed because I do not think that the state can afford another big loss-maker on the scale of Network Rail. I have declared my interests in the register; I do not think that they are relevant to the debate, but I shall do so for the sake of good form.

<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew18"><B> Jane Griffiths  (Reading, East):</B> 
 Thank you for the opportunity to take part in this important debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing it.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para29">I have been involved with Crossrail in one way or another since first hearing of it as a newly elected councillor in Reading in 1989. Little did I know when I heard about the proposal that 14 years later we would still be talking about it and there would have been no further progress, despite hundreds of millions of pounds having been spent on various reports, investigations, consultations and lobbying exercises.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para30">Fourteen years ago people in Reading were excited about a proposal that would connect us by a cross-London rail line to east London and Essex. One can see why we were excited: such a link would provide further transport improvements to Reading, which owes its success to its transport links. So far, however, the only people in Reading to have benefited from the scheme are local councillors who at their respective local government conferences have been on the receiving end of hospitality from the proposers of previous versions of the Crossrail scheme. The fringe meetings held by the proposers of the scheme became notorious for the quality and quantity of free food and wine.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para31">The Crossrail proposal is important to me for reasons other than past hospitality. One of the many Transport Ministers who had a role in this sorry affair in the mid-nineties was the then Member of Parliament for Slough. He sought a safer berth than Slough and was selected to fight Reading, East, which at the time was a safe Conservative seat. In April 1996, the then Secretary of State for Transport announced that the scheme would come in priority terms behind the Jubilee line extension, Thameslink 2000 and the channel tunnel rail link. I could not thank the Minister enough for providing me with a perfect local story and photo opportunity when I laid a wreath at Reading station commemorating the demise of the Crossrail scheme. Little did I know then that, seven years later, I would be pointing out that nothing has happened since.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para32">I should not really be surprised by that&#151;none of us should. In a previous debate in the House, I raised the history of the failure to invest in rail services west of London. That has left us without electrification, and the high-speed trains that were a stopgap before electrification are now more than 30 years old. The train companies are looking to invest in new versions of the high-speed trains. Now, however, the situation has become even worse.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para33">Throughout the history of the Crossrail proposal it has always been intended that Reading would be at the western end of the scheme. Crossrail originally appeared in a post-war plan in the late 1940s and reappeared in the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 192WH</B></P>
Barran plan of the 1970s. It was put forward in October 1990 by British Rail and London Transport, who envisaged a line running from Shenfield and Romford in the east to Aylesbury and Reading in the west. A report into the scheme following the 1993 Budget confirmed the financial and engineering viability of the scheme and the then Prime Minister announced that it would go forward. However, parliamentary progress was put on hold while further studies were carried out.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para34">It was reported in January 1994 that the scheme had been approved by consultants, who had rejected alternative routes. After four years and lots of money spent on preparing plans, parliamentary activity, sumptuous lobbying, and consultants to look again at the proposals, it was confirmed that the 1990s plans were fine and should go forward. Everything should have been fine for Crossrail&#151;but no, the four MPs who were supposed to take the Bill forward refused to do so, saying that the proposers of the scheme had failed to make their case. In particular, they said that the number of people travelling by rail had declined since the scheme was proposed in 1989. As Homer Simpson might have said, "D'oh!" It is widely understood that the number of rail journeys made reflects the level of activity in the economy, so taking a four-year period to determine whether an investment in the railways is justified is stupid, especially when those four years contain one of the worst recessions of the past century.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para35">That exemplifies the problems that we have had to put up with in investment in public transport schemes. Far too often, the time scale over which the return has been sought has not been long enough for public transport. We will not emerge from our transport problems until it is understood that it takes 30 years to make a significant difference to any situation. There will always be short-term schemes that give a payback, and no one says that they should not happen, but schemes that take longer to earn a return should not be refused solely for that reason. Crossrail is a prime example. As we have seen in investments in other public transport infrastructure schemes, if they go ahead they generally prove the economic modellers wrong and generate much better returns than had been predicted. Another problem with the 30-year period needed to make a serious difference in transport is that the people involved in the scheme at the beginning are usually not around at the end to say, "I told you so."
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para36">The Crossrail scheme was killed off because we were in the middle of a recession. Commendably, the Government of the time continued to seek ways to take the scheme forward, so in January 1995 there was another study by a different set of consultants to see if there could be progress with smaller-scale alternatives. Yet again, it was concluded that there were no cheap alternatives to Crossrail. Not happy with that report, Government officials carried out another review, taking account of financing levels and funding post- privatisation of British Rail. That concluded that the project had a good cost-benefit ratio, that it was resilient to pessimistic levels of demand and cost, that the level of central London employment was not critical, that powers to proceed with the scheme would have to be obtained before private finance was sought and that private finance could not meet the whole cost. The Government of the time made no response to that <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 193WH</B></P>
report&#151;the Montague report&#151;but said that Crossrail came after the Jubilee line extension, Thameslink 2000 and the channel tunnel rail link in priority terms.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para37">Railtrack was asked to consider the project further once it was in the private sector, but an answer to a parliamentary question in January 1999 revealed that, three years later, Railtrack had not even considered the scheme. The Corporation of London did not forget about it. It could see the benefits brought by the Jubilee line, and realised that Crossrail could deliver equally for residents and companies in London. I worked with the corporation after 1997 to try to keep the scheme alive. It published a report in February 2001 that showed that there had been a 50 per cent. increase in the direct economic benefits over cost in the five years since the Montague report, and that had Crossrail been built, it would have been carrying 12 per cent. more passengers than even the most optimistic of the original forecasts had suggested. Many other reports&#151;in 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2001&#151;all showed that the proposed route was the best and that the scheme would deliver a return.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para38">The Government called for another report in May 2001. Just before the 2001 general election, some of us were otherwise occupied, but it was hoped that the scheme would begin in 2005&#150;06, so yet another study was undertaken and &#163;154 million set aside for it. That produced a report that included the options of a tunnel below London and a route to Reading in the west, with a number of new route options, some of which hon. Members have already mentioned. In February 2003, a business case was presented to the Secretary of State and it was decided that an expert team had to be set up to assess the proposals. I suggest that Crossrail be used at the Civil Service college as an example for training mandarins in how to kill off an idea by review. Future Sir Humphreys could learn a great deal from the example of Crossrail about how not to make a decision on a matter that involves a large amount of money.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para39">Until recently, Reading was one of the fixed points of the Crossrail scheme, and the proposal would have brought electrification to Reading. We had been told that electrification at Paddington would cause too much disruption to that important station, so Crossrail was a big problem&#151;but then came the Heathrow express, which someone else was willing to pay for, so electrification at Paddington was suddenly not a problem. Any sensible person would think that electrifying a further section of the Great Western route would be seen as a benefit, but no such luck.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para40">I pay tribute to the current issue of Railfuture's magazine for a cogent analysis of the current position. It refers to the madness of trying to remove other services to Richmond and replace them with Crossrail, delivering no new services at all, and the barmy mission growth that has occurred, with other tunnels and schemes being thrown in. More sensibly, there is the suggestion of getting back to basics&#151;another old favourite from the 1990s&#151;and returning to the original east-west proposal involving Shenfield, ideally Stansted, and probably Ebbsfleet in the east, and Heathrow and Reading in the west.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para41">Crossrail has shown all that is wrong with project planning and implementation in this country. A simple scheme, which has been around for decades, and which <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 194WH</B></P>
offers excellent value for money, has been killed off by report after report. It has now been taken over by those who have vested interests, who have come up with a barmy version that does not serve the best interests of the travelling public. Other schemes, which offer less value for money, have been developed because someone will pay for them rather than because they represent real value for money.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para42">We now have a chance for the Government and the civil service to redeem themselves. Dump the scheme proposed by Cross London Rail Links, return to the original proposal and get on and implement Crossrail. The message is simple: let us have Crossrail and let us have it soon.

<a name="31021h01_spnew19"><B> Mr. Mark Field  (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> 
 I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing this timely debate. As a central London Member, I am clearly going to be affected by whatever route it is finally agreed Crossrail should take. Within the multitude of proposals for Crossrail, there has never been a suggestion that central London should be missed out.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para43">To touch on some constituency interests, Hanover square residents have expressed grave concerns about the lack of consultation on the current proposal for a route through Mayfair. Notwithstanding the catalogue of disasters iterated by the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths), the residents feel that there has not been enough information about potential disruption and the ongoing blight that would affect that part of my constituency.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para44">One of the key issues is the eventual route of Crossrail. Understandably, colleagues have argued in favour of their own, perhaps narrow, political corridors and proposals that would affect their constituencies. My view is that it is of key importance to link in the east London gateway corridor, as well as places such as Dartford, Shenfield and Grays.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para45">The spectre of the Olympic bid has been raised. I did not entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) when he said that the two issues had to be kept entirely apart. Crossrail investment will, in practical terms, be of key importance to any sensible and successful Olympic bid. Clearly, time is running out if the Olympic bid is to be made by July 2005.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para46">I am also worried about the rather high barrier that the Government have erected in their most recent thinking on Crossrail. They have said that it
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"needs to be feasible from both operational and engineering points of view, environmentally acceptable and value for money."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para47">It has been rightly pointed out by all right hon. and hon. Members that the key consideration is how Crossrail will be funded. The hon. Member for Reading, East was absolutely right to point out that the Crossrail project was first mooted in 1948&#151;it might have been her colleague the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Linda Perham) who pointed that out. The catalogue of delays since the project was shelved during the recession of the early 1990s has also rightly been mentioned.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para48">It now seems clear that the Treasury will not be willing to provide funding up front, and the Secretary of State for Transport has given a fairly clear indication <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 195WH</B></P>
that Crossrail is pretty low on his list of priorities, especially in view of his task of clearing up the mess created by his predecessor during the botched renationalisation of Railtrack in October 2001&#151;rightly mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)&#151;which will apparently take up an additional &#163;1.5 billion per year of public money. It is therefore difficult to see how Crossrail will be in any way a priority for the Government in considering their rail projects.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para49">Londoners seem to receive a poor return, as a number of London Members have pointed out. London is a massive contributor to the public purse. How can Britain's only globally competitive city continue to shine internationally if the infrastructure investment that is demanded of such a global city cannot be taken for granted? The Government's anti-London bias is damaging the UK economy, and we will see the results of that in the coming decade.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para50">The talk is of a private sector consortium for Crossrail, which is the only realistic game in town. Several consortiums, comprising for the most part property and construction businesses, have discussed the matter and put forward innovative plans, but there are two key flaws. First, they anticipate that the Government will ultimately be the guarantors of last resort. Secondly, there is no proper risk-transfer test for public-private partnership projects. Conservative Members have consistently pointed out that that makes a mockery of the Government's prestige projects, for which we will all pay in higher taxes during the next decade and a half. The risk is that private consortiums will cherry-pick the most economically desirable routes. They might discuss stage B development but will shelve it later, probably for good. Prior to world war two, for example, there were great plans, all of which have been permanently shelved, to build tube lines to places such as Cranleigh Gardens and Muswell Hill.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para51">One of the ways forward on funding is to examine the notion of value capture, which was touched on by the hon. Member for Twickenham. I cannot do justice to the concept in this brief speech, but the proposal by the Conservative mayoral candidate, Steve Norris, to add a 2 per cent. levy to the business rate in the vicinity of the new line over the next 20 years to allow the cash flow to be securitised and to ensure that the capital works come into play has at least some merit.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para52">When I first read Don Riley's book "Taken for a Ride", I found it persuasive. He is one of my constituents, and he gave me a proof copy of the book a few weeks before the general election when I was out canvassing in Morton place, where he lives. His thesis is simple: when taxpayers invest in a new transport system, many landowners are given accidental windfall fortunes. He argues that the leakage of publicly created income into private hands explains why railways have not been self-financing. The thesis is fairly, but not entirely, persuasive.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para53">Various bandwagons have jumped on to value capture. Some people&#151;particularly left-of-centre politicians&#151;think that it will be an enormous property tax. With the fast-deteriorating public finances, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has got his eyes on a range of property taxes&#151;as predicted 18 months ago by many hon. Members who worked on the then Finance Bill. I am concerned that great injustices will by done by taxing <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 196WH</B></P>
windfall gains. The great worry is that if the sums are not properly ring-fenced, there will simply be more money in the Exchequer's pocket. There is also a large question mark about the practicality of taxing windfall gains. It is not clear how far away from a railway line the benefits would extend. There would clearly be losers, and a sense of injustice on the part of those located right on the edge of affected areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew20"><B> Mr. Redwood </B> 
: My hon. Friend touches on an important point. It is easy to see that there is a gain if a property owner realises an asset that has gone up in value or decides that he can enhance his business because a new line is coming or has arrived. However, an existing property owner who wants to use his property for the same purposes or whose business is not enhanced will simply suffer higher taxation. That problem must be sorted out when we implement such schemes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew21"><B> Mr. Field </B> 
: I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend that there is a great worry that such a levy would simply be a stealth tax.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para54">Although I appreciate that he is not a Treasury Minister, I hope that the Minister here today can indicate the Treasury's intentions. If we look upon new property taxes as a means of clobbering landowners rather than as a specifically ring-fenced way to finance projects such as Crossrail, we will see some of the conspicuous disadvantages that arose in the 1990s during the construction of the Jubilee line extension. Clearly, one has to follow the money, which is the great problem with Crossrail.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para55">I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to the comments of the hon. Member for Reading, East, because there is a worry that we are being inundated with yet more reports as a way of kicking the issue into the long grass. From where will the funding come? Understandably, given the problems with Network Rail, the Treasury may feel that insufficient funding is available in its coffers in the short term for the Crossrail project. If so, can we at least get some indication of the preferred route forward, so that we can ensure that in 14 or 15 years' time we are not still debating the issue, without any further progress having been made?
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para56">I appreciate that at least one other speaker wants to get in. I look forward to sharing a platform with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) tonight in Covent Garden, although I cannot imagine why he wants to come to my constituency to discuss these matters. It may have something to do with an election in the middle of next year. I look forward to hearing his comments and those of the Minister.

<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew22"><B> Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to take advantage of the debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). As a London MP for 20 years, I have had an interest in Crossrail for some time, like the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths). It has been on the agenda all the time that I have been involved in London politics. The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) referred to other <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 197WH</B></P>
reasons for my interest: I now share with my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham responsibility in my parliamentary party for London issues, and I expect to be the Liberal Democrat candidate when London has a mayoral election next year.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para57">From all the evidence, the Crossrail proposal has unprecedented general support not just from all the local authorities and residents in the capital but from the business community. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Confederation of British Industry and London First have not just supported it but have persuasively, strongly, regularly and consistently lobbied for it. They understand the economic importance of a new west-east cross-London line. Without exception, the project is now the number one business issue for those groups. That is what they tell me, and I sense it from talking with their members as well. Surveys of businesses in London indicate that half of all businesses think that it will benefit them and that they are positive about it. There is hardly a single voice expressing concern about the project.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para58">Obviously, there are strategic Government and regional government reasons to support Crossrail, not least the development of the Thames gateway, which will create new investment in the jobs and housing that that area of London needs and that I hope it will get. We in London argue that the country works better if London works better. I believe that the rest of the country understands that, if London is more efficient, the country of which London is the capital will be more efficient and prosperous as well.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para59">I welcome the Minister and have some questions for him. I look forward to further conversations on the issue with him and his colleagues in the months ahead. There has been a considerable amount of commentary on the nature of the statement given by the Secretary of State for Transport in July. Was it a statement of conditional support or of clear, unequivocal support? In the words of one commentator, was it a statement with lots of ifs and buts, or was it a statement of Government support? It would be helpful if the Minister put on the record whether the Government support the Crossrail project.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para60">Can the Minister update us on the likely date of the report of the expert panel that was set up this autumn to carry our specific work? The report was intended to be published at about the turn of the year, but it would be useful if he gave the date for the conclusion of that work. In that context, to pick up a point made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), the details of the route outside the core route should be properly worked out as a result of the consultation that is now taking place. My colleagues believe in that consultation process, which should deal with precisely such matters. The consultation is being carried out enthusiastically and well and is receiving responses. I hope that it will produce the best result for areas such as south-west London, where there are clearly important issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew23"><B> Mr. Redwood </B> 
: Surely, before any of that, the important questions that need answering are how will the deal be structured and who will pay for it? Will the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 198WH</B></P>
hon. Gentleman spell out his and his party's policy on how much public money will be used, how many guarantees are needed, and how it will be paid for?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h01_spnew24"><B> Simon Hughes </B> 
: I hoped that the right hon. Gentleman would expect me to deal with those matters, and I will answer him in a moment.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para61">I have dealt with the question of Government support. The second question relates to the project's timetable. The opportunity in the Queen's Speech to announce a Bill in the forthcoming Session has been missed. A hybrid Bill is needed, but the window of opportunity has gone. Will the Minister confirm without qualification that the Government are willing to provide the time for a Bill, even if there is no time in the forthcoming Session, and to support a Bill in the Session after next? If that is the case, do the Government agree that the core project from Paddington to Liverpool Street or to Stratford could be completed before 2012?
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para62">There is no inevitable link between an Olympic bid and the project, but if an Olympic bid were successful in 2005, there would be huge advantage in getting the core of the project in place before the Olympic games. I am meeting Crossrail representatives today&#151;I have met them before&#151;and I want to ensure that we can deliver a core Crossrail link before 2012, because it must enhance the prospects of our Olympic bid. Even if we do not win the bid, the Government should not resile from either a commitment or a timetable. None of us knows whether we can win the bid, and that is why my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham and others say that the bid and Crossrail stand separate, but there will be an additional benefit if we win. It would be helpful if the Government were willing to countenance support for a proposal that delivers the core project before 2011. I believe that technically it can be delivered; I remain to be persuaded about some of the details but I hope and believe that it can be delivered.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para63">Funding is a central issue and I accept the questions from the right hon. Member for Wokingham. I also accept the importance of the two background elements that he described, which are the funding of the rail system across the United Kingdom and, as alluded to by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, the regional take and spend across the UK. I have secured an undertaking from my party to re-examine the Barnett formula and regional allocation. The issue is public sector spend ability in all regions. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham&#151;just appointed to his new brief leading our Treasury team&#151;and I will discuss it and come up with some answers. He has been in his new post for about a week, as have I, but we have started conversations and I undertake to the House and beyond that we will answer those questions.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para64">The direct answer to the funding question is that we already have one small element of Government-guaranteed funding, which is &#163;154 million for the initial work. It would be helpful if the Minister were to guarantee that that money at least is ring-fenced, as we need it to be. It should not be subject to any cuts, bearing in mind that the Strategic Rail Authority has stated that it must reduce its budget. Beyond that, I accept that the best proposition is for the private sector to finance the rest of the spending on Crossrail. That is my starting point, and the business community believes that it is achievable. There are questions about the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 199WH</B></P>
Government's guarantees, and they need to be ironed out. I must consider that before next year's mayoral election, and my hon. Friend and I will work it out.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para65">We are left with some private sector mechanism options. There is a perfectly honest debate within the business community, which has considered four options. They include a bonds option, which is reasonable and viable, and the option referred to by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, which was proposed by his constituent, Mr. Riley, who runs businesses in my constituency and has also given me a copy of his book, "Taken for a Ride". Those who benefit from the windfall increase in land value because they are next to the line should make a contribution. There are questions about boundary definition, which I understand, but as the Member of Parliament with the largest section of the Jubilee line going through his constituency, I have seen the accidental benefit that accrues to some people. In that end, the project had a good outcome, but it may well have been possible for those who benefited from the line to have partially funded it.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para66">I would like the Minister to address my next point specifically: am I right in saying that the Local Government Bill allows Transport for London to borrow in the private sector? My understanding of the Government's view is that local government should be able to borrow from the private sector. That applies to the London government and the GLA. I would be grateful for a reassurance that TFL and the GLA can borrow as much as they want in order to put the money in the system. The most recent proposal, floated by the Conservative candidate for the London mayoralty, is that there should be a levy on particular businesses. That idea is less popular than some others but the argument is on the table none the less.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para67">My hon. Friends and I will make clear our preferred proposal in good time for the election, once we have had the consultations with colleagues. The Government must guarantee that the current money is ring-fenced, and tell us that TFL can borrow from the private sector and that the Government have advanced work on the idea of a levy on those who gain windfall profits. If we had answers on those points, we would know that the Government were serious. If we had an unconditional response on their support for the project, we would go away from the debate much happier.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) for securing this important debate. I congratulate him on the way in which he set out the important issues, particularly the many implications that the Crossrail project has for redevelopment, and on mentioning the support given by all the boroughs and the Corporation of London.

<a name="31021h01_para68">I also thank my hon. Friend for giving me the opportunity to have my first outing on transport matters since I, like some other colleagues, assumed new responsibilities a week ago. Coming as I do from the far north of Scotland, I almost feel as though I am intruding on something private in discussing this very London-centred project. A mere 10 days ago, I was blissfully unaware of most matters to do with transport. I was, as <P>

are so many people, a simple, straightforward user of public transport&#151;sometimes a very frustrated one, when using public transport in London.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para69">Since then, I have had an opportunity to meet a great many people and have done a considerable amount of reading. Having done my homework as best I could, I found that the Crossrail project shines out as a scheme that deserves to succeed and has clear benefits, including cost benefits. It is also an example of what should be right in transport policy but is often marred by the vacillation and delay of successive Governments. In that regard, I must say that the Conservative Administrations deserve just as much blame as anyone else.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para70">The project in its current guise was first proposed in January 1989 by the central London rail study. The reasons then advanced for it were the increase in central London employment in the 1980s and the pressure on rail links; those reasons are just as valid today. The cost in 1993 was estimated at &#163;1.8 billion, but afterward there was much to-ing and fro-ing&#151;we have heard about some of that this morning. The project was supported by the then Prime Minister, but thrown out by the then Secretary of State for Transport, Mr. MacGregor, who made it subject to the Transport and Works Act 1992 procedure.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para71">Two reports were made. What was known as the Montague report was produced in 1996, and it said that the project had a good cost-benefit ratio, that it was resilient to pessimistic assumptions about demand and cost, and that private finance could not meet the whole cost. As the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) said, the project has been dogged by too many reports. Another, undertaken for the Corporation of London by the technology strategy centre at Imperial college, estimated in 2001, first, that there had been a 50 per cent. increase in direct economic benefits over cost in the five years since the Montague report and, secondly, that if Crossrail had been built by 1999, as originally envisaged, it would already be carrying 12 per cent. more passengers than the most optimistic original assessments. It is clear that there is a strong and growing case for Crossrail and the reasons for it have stood the test of time.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para72">Transport is the critical lubricant that allows the cogs of commerce to grind smoothly. It is the duty of Government not simply to maintain the status quo, but to have a clear vision for future development and make those happen. Crossrail is such a vision and it should happen. It is up to the Government to lead. The Liberal Democrats stand strongly behind Crossrail. We back it because it is vital to the redevelopment of east London, especially its economically deprived communities. I urge the Government&#151;particularly the Treasury&#151;to give full support and grant the powers that are necessary for Crossrail to raise its own finance through bonds, if that is required.

<a name="31021h01_para74">Although Crossrail is not essential to the Olympic bid, it would at least be extremely helpful to it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said, neither project should depend on the other. There is, however, much synergy between them. When researching that report, I came across a memorandum submitted in evidence by Crossrail that stated that it:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"expects the application for statutory consent for Crossrail Line 1 to be ready in November. It is hoped that this is the beginning of a programme and timetable that will lead to a construction completion date that is"

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"time for 2001, subject to obtaining powers, finance and procurement. The Line 1 train service itself would be in place by May 2012."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para76">Even in the early part of this year Crossrail anticipated that it could ready in time for the Olympics. Perhaps the Minister can say why there has been such slippage on that programme and whether it is retrievable. The Olympic bid is an engine of regeneration for the Thames gateway. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimated that by 2016 there would be some 295,000 new jobs and 95,000 new houses in the area. If the Olympics go ahead they will help to accelerate and underpin that. Both Crossrail and the Olympics could help regeneration.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para77">The critical issue, as hon. Members said, is funding. When considering funding, two things become clear. First, the longer the project is held in abeyance, the more it will cost&#151;the cost has risen from &#163;1.8 billion in 1993 to some &#163;10 or &#163;11 billion today. Secondly, there will be a benefit to business if the project goes ahead. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham said that the London economy would benefit by some &#163;20 billion. That is important.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para78">We must consider how the project could be financed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) said, I hope that the majority of the finance, if not all of it, could come from the private sector. We must consider bonds and the securitisation of revenue streams, which is a straightforward way of securing finance. As the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) said, we must also consider whether it is possible to use taxation and employ the increase in value arising from development to produce revenue streams for the project.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para79">The Crossrail scheme merits such support. If it requires an amount of Government funding to make it happen, whether seed money or a small percentage of the overall cost, we should not shy away from committing that money to it. When he conducts his spending review, I shall press my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham to permit inclusion of that in our plans.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para80">If we are looking for reasons for Crossrail to go ahead, we need look no further than the fact that the current cross-London links are at saturation point. The District line can take no more trains, and without a new artery London will begin to clog up. It is time that the Government came clean and were honest with Londoners. They should accept the compelling case, say yes and get on with it, or admit that the Treasury is <P>

trying to block the project and kick it into the long grass. I hope that the Government will answer in the affirmative and do so with dispatch.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing the debate. I join my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) in declaring an interest, but unfortunately it is not worthy of register. I am a one-time shareholder in Railtrack, Eurotunnel, British Airways, BAA, BAE Systems and First Group.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para81">I recently heard that a new definition of "cross rail" is a passenger who travels with Virgin Rail on its new Voyager train and arrives in Penzance, but his luggage arrives by road several hours or days later.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para82">Almost an hour and a half into this debate we are still no clearer about the Liberal Democrats' policy on the Crossrail project, even though we have heard three speakers from that party. Their answer seems to be, watch this space. Furthermore, it is clear that one proposal has secured all-party support over and above the competing proposals, but we seem to be no clearer about what the total cost or the start date will be. The Secretary of State for Transport enjoys one thing in common with the newly appointed Liberal Democrat transport spokesman: both believe that transport is so unimportant that it should be a part-time responsibility, held alongside responsibility for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para83">During Transport questions on 15 July, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clearly, the precise cost will depend on the route and the construction of the service. As I made clear in my statement yesterday, the Chancellor and I intend to consult London businesses and others to ensure that we secure the best and most effective way of funding the project."&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 July 2003; Vol. 409, c. 141.]

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para84">As the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) said, we are still no further forward&#151;from either 14 or 40 years ago, depending on which historical account one accepts&#151;in knowing the total cost.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para85">I agree that Crossrail will bring huge benefits to London, as my hon. Friends have said. It will cut overcrowding on existing services and will provide a more rapid and efficient method of transport across London. The perceived &#163;10 billion cost is, however, too heavy a charge to put on the taxpayer. In the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins), the Conservatives will
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para86">Indeed, our mayoral candidate, Steve Norris, has suggested several imaginative ways for funding based on projected increases in property values.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para87">Whichever project is chosen, once the many reviews have been conducted and have reached their conclusions, it must be technically and economically viable and the Government must in the meantime allay fears among the public about existing rail infrastructure, in particular those about the London underground and responsibility for the track post-privatisation. It is clearly unacceptable to have two potentially major disasters within three days, and so soon after that track has been privatised.

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para88">Confidence in the railways collapsed when the then Secretary of State forced Railtrack into administration. The Minister need not take my words for it, but those of their own appointed rail regulator, Tom Winsor. On a number of occasions, he has put on record his personal regret that the move into administration of Railtrack led to a lack of accountability of Network Rail and has removed the shareholder discipline, replacing it with a loose group representing 100 disparate rail interests. That is a hopeless situation&#151;yet it is the backdrop against which Crossrail is being considered. Does the Minister accept that the 10-year transport plan is in tatters, especially as we have heard that railway performance is no longer expected to improve before 2010?
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para89">The debate raises a number of questions, and I would be grateful if the Minister addressed them. Will any public funds be attached to the project? If they will, what will be their nature&#151;will they be national, or does the Minister think that European Union funds would be attracted to a potential trans-European network? Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham, I was astonished that the hon. Member for Twickenham had not given that any thought, even though he was fortunate enough to secure the debate. Are the Government confident that private sector support will be sufficient to pick up the whole cost of Crossrail? Will the Government be prepared to guarantee any of the debts that may flow from its construction? Following construction, who will be responsible for maintaining the line?
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para90">My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) and the hon. Members for Reading, East and for Ilford, North (Linda Perham) spoke about connections across London, most notably the connection to Heathrow. It has been put to me that the Heathrow express&#151;a recent and very successful project, which was privately financed&#151;might be jeopardised by Crossrail. Can the Minister give an assurance that whichever Crossrail project is secured, it will have no implications for the Heathrow express&#151;that people who access that airport from central London will continue to enjoy the Heathrow express? Will the Minister take this opportunity to put our minds at rest on these matters? In addition, will he give a date when the review team appointed by the Secretary of State will reach its conclusions?
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para91">All Opposition Members are determined that Crossrail will take shape. I would hate this country's bid for the Olympics to be dependent on the Crossrail project, but it would be ideal if they could be linked. Can sufficient private funding be secured? Will any public funds be attracted to this project and, if so, will they be national or European?

:  Underneath all the sound and fury and the usual Liberal Democrat opportunism, this has been a serious debate. The hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) just touched on what I was going to refer to&#151;with no unkindness intended&#151;as the dog that didn't bark. We dwelt on one Montague&#151;Nick&#151;who was responsible for the earlier report. The Montague that matters is Adrian, along with the review that the hon. Lady alluded to at the end of her comments.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 204WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para92">I was going to start by making a laboured joke about the fact that I am going to the informal Transport Council in Verona on Thursday&#151;although I will not see much of the city&#151;and that this debate was more Montague versus Montague than Montague versus Capulet. I am glad that I did not do so.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para93">Serious matters have been mentioned. However, the context that we must be clear about is receipt of final business case from Crossrail in June or July, the response from the Secretary of State in July, and the subsequent appointment of the Montague team, with it being given a clear undertaking to report by the turn of the year&#151;probably in the new year, but as close to the end of this year as possible. Does that mean that the scheme or any discussions or preparations for the scheme, should be held in abeyance, as one or two hon. Members have suggested? No, it does not. There were extensive talks with Crossrail prior to the appointment of the Montague review team.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para94">I have learned from previous debates not to try to say CLRL too often, for fear of being accused of a lack of sobriety early in the day. I shall refer to it as the Crossrail team&#151;people will know who I mean. There has been constructive engagement with the team and a host of questions has been asked on an array of fronts. One would think from the way that some hon. Members were referring to the important Crossrail project that all we had to do was go to Hamley's and buy a train set. The scheme encompasses substantial infrastructure projects and they should be accorded due importance.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para95">One opportunistic speaker, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes), asked, in his finest mayoral voice, whether he could have an assurance that the Government support his party on the matter. He should read paragraph 8 of the original statement: it says that the Government remain wedded in principle to the notion of a cross-London link. The statement could not have been any clearer in its support. We were then asked whether we could give an assurance that there will be a hybrid Bill in November. I would like to give such an assurance, but I cannot. Why not? Because the review has not reported yet. To deal with such serious matters in such a shallow fashion ill becomes the House and is an insult to it.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para96">Montague needs to determine whether the proposals are likely to deliver to time, scope and budget, whether the business case proposals will offer value for money, the extent of Government funding that can be justified in the context of value for money, the proportion of the funding required from non-Government sources and a range of other matters.

 May I press my hon. Friend on funding? He will not be surprised to hear that only 7 per cent. of businesses back a property tax. Some 24 per cent. back a tax-based solution, 33 per cent. back a bond and 36 per cent. back a share issue. What is the Government thinking on the matter and when will it be announced?

I shall also consider whether there are any other ways of delivering a Crossrail project that would offer better performance than the proposals set out in CLRL's Business Case."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para99">Adrian Montague has been asked to report as soon as is practicable. We hope that he will do so by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para100">We are told that there has been a great deal of slippage on the scheme. In fact, there has been none. The Crossrail business plan submitted in July talked about 2013 and rolling out for 18 months as the start of the process, so the siren voices suggesting that there has already been slippage are fundamentally wrong. If the Montague report stacks everything up in terms of funding and the nature of the line and all is well, I would hope that we would be on schedule for a hybrid Bill in November. I cannot say that for sure, because I do not know what the review will report, nor does anyone else in this Chamber&#151;certainly not aspiring third, fourth or fifth-placed mayoral candidates. CLRL has always intended to open over 18 months.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para101">I am astonished to discover that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is now an engineer, among other things, but the central core going under the Cities of London and Westminster was always the most difficult of the engineering feats. We are told that we could pop back to Hamley's and buy one and get it in place for the Olympics&#151;absolute, unremitting twaddle. Barbara Cassini has said that the Crossrail project has nothing to do with the Olympics and does not fit in with the Olympics. I ask all those suggesting that it does, or that somehow one project will fail without the other, to mind their words. To talk down London's Olympic bid and the success or otherwise of the Crossrail project does no one in London any service. I ask people to reflect before they make such remarks simply for cheap, opportunistic gain, even though that is not unnatural for the third party.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para102">I am delighted&#151;I think that that is a first&#151;that we have here the Liberal Democrat parliamentary version of the three tenors. We have three third party minor spokespersons representing various portfolios, and it is nice to see them. I especially look forward to working with the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) on the transport brief. However, there was some confusion. The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) has gone to open a sure start scheme in her constituency&#151;I hope that she thanks the Government for that and that it is there when she arrives, as she once went to open a hospital but found <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 206WH</B></P>
that it was not yet built, although that is by the by. The hon. Lady said that there are many concerns about the loss of the District line beyond Turnham Green. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) also made various points. I know that there are concerns there, but let us see what the final model will be, so that we can see whether all those concerns stack up.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para103">Typically for a Liberal Democrat, the hon. Member for Richmond Park demanded consultation. Well, there has already been a roadshow and the formal consultation on the business case will start next Monday. I do not know whether she will put out a press release saying that she demanded consultation on Tuesday and that on the following Monday, Crossrail buckled and there was consultation.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para104">I know that Reading, Wokingham and other places outside London are being examined in the context of the Montague review to see what will be best for London. I assume, although I shall discuss this with him, that when the hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned a study in the Department of which he has seen fragments, he meant the fuller business case, not the summary, in which case I urge him to look in detail at the summary and report.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para105">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Linda Perham) on the establishment of the all-party Crossrail group. Everyone&#151;but everyone&#151;is signed up and wedded to the notion that the scheme should happen, so the opportunistic point of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was ill made. We are now collectively looking at the details of how to get the scheme off the ground. Today is part of that.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para106">I found the funding issues raised very interesting. All and none of those suggestions are on the table. There was some confusion over whether it is to be 100 per cent. public sector or 100 per cent. private sector. I know that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) is on record as saying that he wants to explore a fully private sector-funded scheme. In the context of the Montague review, we shall examine how that could happen. Without getting a brick thrown at me by my Department, I can say that the only certainty is that we can rule out a 100 per cent. public sector-funded scheme. I think that I can do that&#151;touch wood&#151;with some degree of certainty. All the elements suggested by hon. Members are on the table.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para107">Rather than waste precious time now, I shall write to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) about a new station for Wokingham and a proper interchange there. I understand the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) about why Reading and a western expansion outside London fell off the agenda. I think that that had fallen off the agenda by February 2003, in the interim business plan for the current proposals, so that really is a matter for others. She should blame not me, but people who were responsible for the scheme prior to that date. If she wants some comfort, very early in this round of the game there was a plan for a lovely line through to Amersham and Watford. One option took it through Harrow and Wealdstone and one through Harrow on the Hill, both plumb in the middle of my constituency, so I, too, do not gain under the current business case, and I share her concerns.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 207WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h01_para108">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) should not dwell on supposedly novel ideas. Last year when I was in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, I was told that betterment levies and value capture were all brand, spanking-new civil service ideas. To my certain knowledge, they are at least 40 years old, if not considerably older. When I was a Minister responsible for housing, I thought that it might be useful to read the first chapter of Dick Crossman's diaries, on when he held a similar post. By page 3, he was discussing the betterment levy and capture when there was a windfall gain. All those elements must be in play if we are collectively, across the parties, serious about securing a very substantial contribution from the private sector, which will be needed if the scheme is to prevail.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para109">It is not fair to use the Jubilee line as an example to suggest that Crossrail will somehow dribble into the sand because it is a public sector-private sector mix. The channel tunnel rail link was completed on time, on budget and is a paragon of British engineering success. All of us&#151;in the public and private sector&#151;should be very proud of it.
<P>

<a name="31021h01_para110">We want Crossrail to happen, and we want to do all that we can to assist. There are a number of things going on with the team that mean that the project is not being held in abeyance, and I urge all those present, and all those who have London's welfare at heart, to examine the Montague review carefully when it is published in all its glory in January or February next year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h02_spnew0"><B> Mr. Elfyn Llwyd  (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy):</B> 
 From the outset, I should declare an interest in that I was a solicitor for 20 years and have been a member of the Bar for six. In all of those years, I have not come across anything like the case of my constituents Dr. and Mrs. Donnelly of Hengwm, Tal y Bont, Barmouth in my constituency.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para0">The matter arose due to complaints being made against two of the large solicitors firms in Belfast namely McCartan, Turkington, Breen of Chancery house, Victoria street, Belfast and Parnell Kerr Forster of 22 Great Victoria street, Belfast. The complaints arose out of their conduct in relation to the acquisition of a limited company, Stagecoach Inn Limited, which I shall refer to as SCIL. It was owned and operated by people in Belfast, and the Stagecoach was one of the best-known public houses in Northern Ireland. The company's issued share capital was 60,000 ordinary shares at &#163;1 each, of which my constituent had 14,500. In addition to being a shareholder, Dr. Donnelly was also a director of SCIL, being appointed in 1979. The day-to-day management of the licensed premises was undertaken by a Mr. and Mrs. Davidson who were also shareholders of SCIL. Due to difficult trading conditions, a decision was taken during 1984 that SCIL should be sold.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para1">A purchaser, Mr. Conor Kelly, was found and the company's shareholders instructed Messrs Parnell, Kerr and Forster to act on their behalf, and the purchaser also approached them. Mr. Conor Kelly then duly instructed Messrs Heneghan and Company, solicitors, to act on his behalf. Mr Kelly, via his solicitors, negotiated with SCIL's shareholders' solicitors, Messrs McCartan Turkington and Breen, and matters progressed well, with all parties looking towards completion. During the transaction, its nature changed from being a pure sale of the freehold and the premises to a sale of actual shares in the company&#151;a total sale in other words. That indeed happened, and was completed on 1 November 1984.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para2">It was not until about 12 years after completion of the sale that Dr. Donnelly became aware of the identity of the purchaser despite being a vendor of the company. That followed a company search, which revealed the identities of the new directors, who were also purchasers. Dr. Donnelly knew of the transaction as a whole, but did not know the identity of the purchasers. At no time were his views solicited in relation to the terms of the share sale agreement, in particular in relation to price and its ultimate calculation or the mechanism for payment of any consequential liabilities.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para3">More surprisingly, and unknown at the time to my constituent, the purchaser appeared to be a consortium comprised of a number of partners of McCartan, Turkington and Breen&#151;Mr. Turkington and Mr. Breen becoming directors of SCIL&#151;and, incredibly, Parnell Kerr Forster, who were the solicitors acting for the company. Mr. Francis Gerard French of that firm also became a director of SCIL.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para4">The following terms were agreed in the share sale agreement. A notional sum of &#163;225,000 was to be paid to the shareholders, equating to about &#163;3.75 per share. That was payable as follows: first, &#163;15,000 deposit on <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 209WH</B></P>
the 12 November 1984; secondly, the sum of &#163;135,000 on account on completion on 1 November 1984; thirdly, there was to be subtracted from the notional sum of &#163;225,000 the losses that had occurred within SCIL recorded to 31 August 1984, together with further losses that had occurred between 1 September 1984 and 31 October 1984, as calculated by the auditors, PKF, and certified in audited accounts; and, fourthly, further sums were to be deducted in respect of fees incurred by J. A. Whelan Best, PKF, and McCartan Turkington Breen, where two of the partners were purchasers.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para5">To facilitate completion of the sale, Dr. Donnelly received a telephone call from Mr. Courtney of PKF indicating that his presence was urgently required in Belfast in connection with matters arising from the proposed sale. I have seen a letter from 2 October 1984 written by Mr. Courtney to Dr. Donnelly and enclosing a copy of a power of attorney, which Dr. Donnelly subsequently executed. A copy of the power of attorney has been made available to my constituent and is dated 29 September 1984. It is signed by Dr. Donnelly, and witnessed by his mother and an Andrew James Wilkinson of PKF. The power of attorney is general and is not limited in scope simply to signing the share sale agreement.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para6">In relation to post-completion matters, in my constituent's letter to the firms on 29 November 1984, he confirmed his telephone conversation the previous day with Mr. Courtney and, in particular, his instructions as to how the proceeds of sale from his shares in SCIL were to be dealt with. Those instructions were as follows: sale proceeds of 12,000 of those shares were to have their cash equivalent remitted to him, and cash proceeds referable to the sale of a second tranche of 2,500 shares were to be invested to provide an income for his mother, by which I understand that he meant that the money was to be invested in trust for her.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para7">Notwithstanding those instructions, Mr. Courtney wrote to my constituent on 21 December 1984 enclosing a schedule setting out how the proceeds of sale had been, or were proposed to be, appropriated. Consideration of that schedule showed that in addition to losses and costs certain debts were also taken into account prior to the distribution being made to my constituent. It appears that the following amounts were deducted: a Stagecoach/SCIL debt of &#163;27,175, taxation of &#163;17,185, and a bank loan of &#163;14,031. I cannot see any contractual provision contained in the share sale agreement that confirms that those deductions were authorised. At no stage was my constituent consulted and he did not have an opportunity to corroborate the amounts.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para8">In the event, my constituent received from PKF the sum of &#163;12,000, plus &#163;5,000 of bonds, and confirmation that the balance due, the sum of &#163;17,880, was owed to Dr. Donnelly by his mother. It appears that that balance was paid directly to my constituent's mother without any express or implied authority from my constituent to deal with that money in that way.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para9">It would appear that the complaints against both firms arise out of their failure to advise properly in relation to the meaning and implications of the general power of attorney. That pertains particularly to Brian Courtney and the representation of my constituent in relation to the share sale transaction. There was also a <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 210WH</B></P>
failure to give any advice in connection with the share sale agreement and, in particular, with potential personal liability, valuation and price per share, the effect of the warranties contained within the agreement, the identification of the purchaser, potential personal liability pursuant to warranties, undertakings concerning competition, and the meaning and effect of confidentiality covenants. Also, there was a failure to give any notice or request any instructions about the appropriation of the proceeds of sale and to act upon my constituent's written instructions concerning how he wished the proceeds of sale to be received and accounted for.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para10">Finally, there were various conflicts of interest including a potential conflict of interest between my constituent and his mother in how the proceeds of sale were to be appropriated; a clear potential conflict of interest in the way in which PKF acted on my constituent's behalf while also apparently acting as expert in the production of completion accounts for the purposes of identifying losses that were to be subtracted from the sale price, given the involvement of a partner as one of the purchasers; and, finally, a failure to give proper advice on how the calculation of such losses was undertaken. There was also a failure to obtain instructions, notwithstanding the existence of a general power of attorney in respect of the apparent change of purchaser.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para11">One of the difficulties that Dr. Donnelly faced was that his mother was suffering from multiple sclerosis, which had been diagnosed in 1977. Her condition had deteriorated. She was unable to draw any of the benefits to which she otherwise would have been entitled because of the capital sum that had been paid over to her without Dr. Donnelly's authority.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para12">Dr. and Mrs. Donnelly have subsequently been in protracted correspondence with the Law Society of Northern Ireland. In a letter dated 1 January 1999, they asked whether the Law Society would say that professional ethics were central to proper standards of behaviour; whether it was professional or ethical for a solicitor in Northern Ireland to act for both owner and purchaser; whether it was professional or ethical for a solicitor in Northern Ireland to act for both vendor and purchaser and also to be involved in the transaction personally; whether it was ethical for a solicitor in Northern Ireland to accept a general power of attorney if he was acting for both buyer and seller and if he himself was one of the purchasers, and not to investigate the provenance of that power of attorney, considering that the document was drafted by an accountant whose partner was also a purchaser, a future shareholder and a witness to the signing of the power. Almost incredibly, the letter did not elicit any action from the Law Society.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para13">In August 1999, my constituent asked the lay observer, Professor Vincent Mageean, to look at the failure of the Law Society to investigate Mr. Turkington and to maintain standards in the profession. He was asked repeatedly to investigate conflicts of interest that the society may have failed to declare, as my constituent felt that the Law Society was protecting Mr. Turkington.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para14">The lay observer stated in his report that he was always given information that he requested from the Law Society. He declared that he had no reason to believe that Mr. Turkington had held any office in the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 211WH</B></P>
society. Two years later, in 2001, we discovered that Mr. Turkington had been a committee member of the Law Society for many years and had been a past president in 1986, just over a year after what has been put forward by my constituent as an alleged fraud. When faced with the evidence, the lay observer wrote that he did not feel that that constituted any form of conflict.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para15">Correspondence continued with the solicitors disciplinary tribunal between 1999 and 2002. The secretary, Donal McFerran, informed my constituent that he needed a copy of the 1980 solicitors practice regulations to draft a formal complaint to the tribunal. Mr. McFerran claimed that none of the lawyers on the tribunal had a copy of the document. One lawyer, Michael Wilson, was about to send a copy to my constituent when Mr. McFerran prevented him from doing so. Mr. McFerran wrote that there is strict impartiality in the tribunal and no connections with the Law Society of Northern Ireland. We later discovered that Mr. Butler was a lecturer and examiner for the society and that the entire tribunal is chosen by it. There is no impartiality whatsoever.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para16">Correspondence continued with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Two years later, Brice Dickson finally decided that the commission could not help. The fraud squad agreed to investigate the matter if my constituent found a lawyer who was willing to bring a case.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para17">The situation is dire and every effort has drawn a blank. An individual, the Law Society of Northern Ireland or the lay observer can refer matters to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal for Northern Ireland. My constituents complained that the individuals and the Law Society saw nothing wrong because they were shot through with conflicts of interest, while the lay observer would not take up the matter.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para18">That leaves my constituents absolutely nowhere after all those years of hard work going from pillar to post. I secured an Adjournment debate similar to this one about 18 months ago. I am not making conspiratorial accusations, but it was disappointing that two days before the debate took place, a Government Minister rang me and said, "Because of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the matter is devolved and is not within the Lord Chancellor's Department", which effectively pulled up the stumps for that debate.That is not a back-door accusation against anyone, least of all the Minister concerned, whose position I fully understood. Following that telephone conversation, I even corresponded with the Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but nothing came of it.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para19">I am terribly disappointed on behalf of my constituents. There has been not only misconduct but something worse. We are discussing a group of fairly high-powered lawyers and accountants in Northern Ireland taking proceeds of sale, taking over a company and running a business with no regard for the rights of those to whom the business belonged. That cannot be right. It is nearer fraud than it is a disciplinary offence.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para20">I urge the Minister to do his best to ensure that some justice comes my constituents' way. It has been said that because of the length of time that has elapsed the statute of limitations would probably bar legal actions for recovery of the funds owed. That may or may not be true, but where fraud is involved there is no statute of <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 212WH</B></P>
limitations, so the matter is still at large. I contend that one should go to law only when all other avenues have been fully examined. My constituents have examined most of the avenues, but the door has been peremptorily shut in their faces at the end of each and every one of them. I urge the Minister to examine the problem anew. I know that it is fairly new to him and I am not expecting cast-iron guarantees, but I ask him to examine the issue carefully and to liaise with his colleagues in Northern Ireland and the LCD.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para21">I shall conclude with a quotation:

<a name="31021h02_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland   (Mr. Ian Pearson) </B> 
:  I congratulate the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) on securing this debate on what all of us in Parliament hope will be a momentous day in Northern Ireland's political history. He outlined a serious complaint made by his constituent relating to a legal transaction conducted by solicitors practising in Northern Ireland. He has done so in a typically cogent and forceful way and I applaud his diligence.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para24">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the matter is new to me. I cannot comment on the detail of the case. Notwithstanding events occurring across the water, however, what is said and placed on record today will benefit his constituents and keep open the arguments on the complaint.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para25">The hon. Gentleman referred to difficulties encountered with the Law Society of Northern Ireland and the lay observer&#151;both have statutory roles in connection with the regulation of solicitors in Northern Ireland. I shall begin by setting out the arrangements for the regulation of that profession because the regime differs from that operating in other UK jurisdictions.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para26">The relevant legislation is the Solicitors (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, as amended by the Solicitors (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, under which there is self-regulation, with a complaints procedure administered by the Law Society of Northern Ireland. Complaints made to the Law Society are dealt with in the first instance by its secretariat and then by the client complaints committee, formerly known as the professional conduct committee, which investigates the background to the complaint and allegations made about the quality of services provided by a solicitor. The circumstances underlying complaints include undue delay, withholding or loss of documents, bills and accounts, disclosure of information, dissatisfaction with advice and ethics and inappropriate behaviour.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para27">The client complaints committee may issue guidance, directions, admonition or warning, or it may refer a complaint to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal, which <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 213WH</B></P>
has extensive powers and a range of sanctions, including admonishing the solicitor, imposing fines, restrictions on practice and suspension, striking off, and ordering payment of costs or restitution. A client or member of the public may also bring a complaint to the tribunal and there is scope for the lay observer to refer complaints to it in certain cases.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para28">I have some direct responsibility for the role of the lay observer, who is appointed under article 42 of the 1976 order, as amended by Article 17 of the 1989 order. The Department of Finance and Personnel makes an appointment after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. It is important to recognise that the lay observer is not a solicitor, barrister, or Government official. He provides independent oversight of the Law Society's handling of complaints and has a monitoring and reporting role. The Department may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice, give general directions to the lay observer about the scope and discharge of his functions. The Department does not intervene in his consideration of the complaints handling process in any individual case.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para29">The functions of the lay observer are twofold. First, he reports on the nature of the complaints made to the Law Society of Northern Ireland about the conduct of solicitors and how they are dealt with by it. Those reports are furnished to the Lord Chief Justice, the Department of Finance and Personnel and the council of the Law Society. They are also laid before the Northern Ireland Assembly. Secondly, he examines any written allegation made by, or on behalf of, a member of the public concerning the society's treatment of a complaint about a solicitor, or employer of a solicitor, made to the society by that member of the public or on his behalf.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para30">If, during the examination of any such allegation, it appears to the lay observer that questions arise about the professional conduct of the solicitor and the quality of professional services provided, he may make an application to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal about the solicitor concerned, as the hon. Gentleman outlined. He may do that if he thinks that it would be appropriate for the tribunal to consider the quality of professional services provided, with a view to determining whether it should exercise any of its powers to impose sanctions under article 51A. Sanctions for inadequate professional services relate to the determination of costs and setting time for the completion and rectification of errors, omissions or deficiencies at the expense of the solicitor.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para31">The yearly report of the lay observer provides statistical information about the nature of complaints and their outcomes. In the report for 2002, some 286 complaints were made to the Law Society&#151;a decrease from 309 in the previous year. The report does not deal with the details of any individual complaint. The lay observer does not comment on the merits of individual cases, because his responsibilities are confined to the complaints handling process.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para32">When the report is received it is laid before the Assembly. The council of the Law Society is required to consider any report and notify the lay observer of any action in consequence of the lay observer's comments or recommendations. In addition, substantive responses <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 214WH</B></P>
are submitted from the Department. The lay observer assesses those responses and, where appropriate, returns to the issues in his next report and indicates whether he is satisfied. In that way, a measure of transparency and accountability is achieved in the system.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para33">The complaint to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred, as he fully outlined, involves a transaction entered into in 1984 for the sale of shares in a company, and allegations of conflicts of interests and improper advice arising at that time. As I have suggested, I am unable to comment in detail on the circumstances of an individual case and hon. Members will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to do so. I shall therefore outline for the hon. Gentleman the procedures that have been followed to date.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para34">I have been informed that the Law Society's professional conduct committee considered the complaints in 1998. The committee did not accept the arguments and allegations put forward by the complainants and took no further action in relation to the two firms involved. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the handling of the complaint was examined by the lay observer in 2000, and after lengthy examination and due deliberation he decided that the Law Society had acted properly and that he would not make an application to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal for its consideration. However, he advised the complainants that they had the right to contact the tribunal themselves directly. He also decided to make some recommendations of a general nature to the Law Society on the subject of client care, which had arisen from his examination of the documents in the case. The complaint was not, in the event, referred to the tribunal by the complainants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h02_spnew1"><B> Mr. Llwyd </B> 
: As a matter of record, it was. I refer to the secretary, Donal McFerran, who said that he did not have a copy of the appropriate regulations under which a complaint should be handled. The tribunal was therefore contacted, but it was not interested in taking the matter forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h02_spnew2"><B> Mr. Pearson </B> 
: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I am sure that they will be drawn to the attention of those that need to know. I am also aware that the complainant referred the case to the police, but that no criminal prosecution was brought. Currently, no other legal proceedings are being instituted.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para35">The hon. Gentleman has made some serious allegations and it is important that we consider them further. They also raise a more general issue about regulation of the solicitor profession. It is recognised that there is a need for a review of the system of regulation for the provision of legal services in Northern Ireland. The Department of Finance and Personnel has said in its response to the lay observer's report for 2002 that it would want to explore all of those issues. The best context for doing so would be the devolution of justice functions in Northern Ireland, which would facilitate a thorough evaluation and allow the Northern Ireland Administration to take a comprehensive view of the whole area. Following elections and restoration of the Assembly and the full implementation of the Belfast agreement, that will be possible.
<P>

<a name="31021h02_para36">It is true that the system is different in England and Wales, as the hon. Gentleman will know from his background as a solicitor and barrister. The legal <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 215WH</B></P>
services ombudsman provides independent supervision of the self-regulatory process. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Department for Constitutional Affairs recently announced proposals to bring into operation provisions in the Access to Justice Act 1999 to establish a legal services complaints commissioner. There are powers in England and Wales that have no parallel with the situation of the lay observer in Northern Ireland. That is something that a devolved Assembly and devolved Ministers will want to pursue in due course and that may well be the best way forward for the hon. Gentleman's constituents.

<a name="31021h03_spnew0"><B> Paul Flynn  (Newport, West):</B> 
 The national insurance fund, along with the national health service, was the supreme achievement of social welfare legislation in the 20th century. It was an act of great courage by Lloyd George to face down his many enemies and introduce an insurance fund reform, which has delivered five generations from the worst effects of poverty. We contemporary politicians should be ashamed about what we have done to the fund over the past 25 years. The purpose of this debate is to list the recent damaging changes that have disfigured the vision of the pioneers. The scheme has been neglected, looted, distorted, undervalued and degraded.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para0">When I was reading a website called "Gathering the Jewels", I was struck by an example of how people used to feel about social legislation. The website contains a poem written in praise of a parliamentary Act. Sadly, that does not happen these days, with landfill tax legislation and the aggregates levy for example, although the poet laureate might address himself to that. I will quote one stanza of the poem, in Welsh first:

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para2">If only we could get our constituents to appreciate our efforts in such terms in these pedestrian days.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para3">David Lloyd George sold the national insurance fund to a suspicious public, particularly the well-heeled, articulate and prosperous, by saying that people would put in fourpence and get out ninepence. That is the way in which the system worked for a long period. It was very good value: fourpence was put in by the employee, the employer contributed thruppence and the Treasury tuppence. When the scheme began, it was very popular. It was reformed in 1948.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para4">The fund is the essential part of our body of social insurance. The system operates on a pay-as-you-go basis: people of working age and their employers pay national insurance contributions based on their earnings. By doing so, they earn the right to pensions and other benefits. Because it is a pay-as-you-go system, it is never possible to identify a particular pot of money <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 217WH</B></P>
or a share in the fund as belonging to a particular contributor. That does not make the rights earned by contributions any less real. In the long run, the system can work efficiently only if all concerned believe that it will be administered fairly and openly, and that the money paid in will be used for its intended purposes. The way in which the fund has been manipulated during the past 25 years has done little to encourage that belief.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para5">The fund works by collecting national insurance contributions, paid by employers, employees and the self-employed, to pay national insurance benefits, of which by far the most important&#151;and the main reason for this debate&#151;is the retirement pension. This year, national insurance benefits are expected to total about &#163;55 billion, of which &#163;46 billion will be for retirement pensions. What happens with the fund affects all those receiving retirement pensions. Part of the fund's job is to retain a relatively small balance, enough to ensure that it remains solvent in unforeseen circumstances, such as a fall in the number of people in employment, which would mean a fall in the number of people paying contributions.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para6">The Government Actuary's report states annually how much is in the fund and how healthy it is. That ensures that the expected income for the coming year is sufficient to cover the cost of the benefits, and leaves what is described as a "reasonable working balance". The Government Actuary views as reasonable a balance of one sixth of the previous year's total benefits. It is important to understand that to realise the extraordinary position that the fund is in today, with a vast, unneeded surplus. In recent years, the fund has been collecting far more in contributions than it has needed to pay the benefit.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para7">An early-day motion of February 1999 noted that the balance at the end of that year was expected to be &#163;5.9 billion. It suggested, usefully I thought, that the unneeded surplus could be used to increase the basic pension to the level of the means-tested minimum income guarantee. That would be a useful way of ensuring that the many people who do not claim their full entitlement&#151;the genuinely poorest pensioners&#151;got their pension as a right and did not have to become supplicants in asking for it. Unfortunately, that was not done and the surplus has continued to grow.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para8">The Government Actuary's latest report shows that by March 2004 the fund will have a balance of &#163;29.3 billion, which is more than three times the recommended level. The unneeded surplus will have risen to more than &#163;20 billion, so it is far from being a pay-as-you-go system. It is a profitable enterprise, which is fine&#151;we are very happy with profits in classic Labour. However, the profits should be applied in a sensible way, because the source of the fund's profits is the money paid in every week by working people and their employers to meet current benefit costs. However, a significant part of that money is no longer used for that purpose; it is being salted away in Government stocks.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para9">The main effect on the fund came with the breaking of the link between pensions and earnings. It is fascinating that the Conservative party has now espoused the restoration of that link. For five continuous years, early-day motion 1 on the Order Paper sought the restoration of the link. I have looked back through the signatures&#151;<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 218WH</B></P>
there were usually more than 100 each time&#151;but not one Conservative Member signed during those years. From 1980 to 1997, having broken the link, the Conservatives kept it broken. If there were a Nobel prize for shameless political opportunism, it would go to the Tory party, which claims to be the apostle of the restoration of the link.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para10">I welcome the Tory party's espousal of the policy&#151;as a non-Government organisation, it can be a useful pressure group to advocate new policies. I speak today in the hope that it will take up the restoration of the integrity of the national insurance fund as another brand new policy. What happened with the breaking of the link was significant and simple. National insurance contributions are calculated as a percentage of earnings, and as earnings rise, the fund's income from contributions automatically rises by approximately the same percentage.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para11">Until 1980, the state pension also rose roughly in line with average earnings. The earnings link itself was only a statutory requirement for a brief period of five years but, in practice, pensions and earnings rose broadly in line with inflation from the war until 1980. Of course, if contributions and benefit levels rise in that way, the effect is entirely neutral. That was the happy situation until 1980, when the earnings link was broken. In what was the grandmother of all stealth taxes, contributions continued to rise in line with earnings, but benefits rose only in line with prices. That went on for 17 long years of salami cuts for pensioners. That was extremely lucrative for the fund, and led to there being so much money in the fund that in 1987 the Conservative Government decided to abolish the Treasury contribution.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para12">Before the Treasury contribution was abolished, fourpence came from the employee, thruppence from the employer and tuppence from the Government. That tuppence was taken out. That is the most significant change to the fund in the past 25 years. The Treasury contribution was 18 per cent. of the combined contributions of employers and employees&#151;a very substantial sum. That was paid in for most of the second half of the previous century. In the first part of the century, a similar amount was paid in. The Treasury contribution stayed at 18 per cent. under both Conservative and Labour Governments until it was phased out in the 1980s. There is now no Treasury contribution as such.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para13">Legislation provides for a Treasury grant to be paid in if the fund looks like going into the red. That happened for a brief period after the fund had been looted for the 2 per cent. bribe used to promote private pensions in that dreadful mis-selling disaster started and inspired by the then Government. That legislation still exists. However, with a surplus of nearly &#163;30 billion in the fund, there is not much risk of that at the moment.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para14">There is a strong case for the Treasury contribution to national insurance to be restored. Although the entitlement to benefit has rested mainly on the individual's record of contributions&#151;one gets what one pays for&#151;it was recognised from the start that some allowance must be made for periods when a person did no paid work; hence the system of contribution credits which, as much as anything, distinguishes social insurance from commercial insurance. The recently introduced state second pension, with its generous <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 219WH</B></P>
system of credits for carers and disabled people, is an excellent example of that, and is a justification for the Treasury paying the supplement. However, if people are to receive, on the ground of social justice, benefits for which they have not paid through their own contributions, by far the fairest way of financing those benefits is through general progressive taxation&#151;by a direct grant from the Treasury&#151;not taking it out of the contributions of those putting money in for their own benefit later.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para15">Reintroducing the Treasury contribution at the level at which it stood before it was phased out would increase the fund's income by about &#163;11 billion in the current year&#151;enough to pay for an increase in the basic pension from &#163;77.45 to &#163;95.60 a week. We are talking about enormous sums. There would be vast consequences for pensioners. A Treasury contribution would also result in similar increases in widows' and incapacity benefits, without even touching the existing &#163;20 billion surplus in the fund.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para16">Another painful period followed the 2 per cent. bribe that was offered after the abolition of the Treasury contribution. That was one of the most shameful episodes in the career of that Parliament. In that disastrous campaign to sell dodgy personal pensions, people were invited to accept what was claimed to be a gift from the Government of &#163;5,000. Part of that was a bribe of a 2 per cent. reduction in NI contributions, which was made at the expense of all those people&#151;the majority&#151;who stayed in the state scheme.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para17">More recently, the fund has suffered massive losses through the introduction of a series of new taxes. I believe that we all admire the new laws that encourage environmentally responsible behaviour by employers. First, there was the landfill tax, then the aggregates levy and, most recently, the climate change levy. In each case, the Government decided to compensate employers as a whole by reducing labour costs, and the simplest way to do that was by reducing employers' NI contributions. That may make administrative sense. There may be a good reason for doing it that way and putting on a charge. It may be the most efficient way to do it. Regardless, the Treasury collects the money.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para18">As a result of recent questions to discover the extent of the loss to the NI fund, I discovered that the fund will lose &#163;1.2 billion this year in compensation for the climate change levy and &#163;0.4 billion for the aggregates levy. I have been told that the effect of the landfill tax on the fund cannot be calculated, but it is entirely safe to assume that the three taxes together are costing the fund some &#163;2 billion a year in reduced employers' contributions, although none of them has the slightest relevance to national insurance. Why on earth should a fund that is devoted mainly to rewarding pensioners for their contributions be looted in that way to pay for the whole country's responsibility for environmental taxes? It is entirely perverse and damaging that that should happen.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para19">There has been a further obscure loss to the fund that is, perhaps, surprising. I believe that we would all agree that we should pay more taxes for the health service. However, when the extra 1 per cent. contribution for the NHS was introduced, the idea as promulgated was that it would simply be handed over to the NHS and that the amount of money available for pensions and other benefits would not be affected in any way.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 220WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para20">The truth was revealed in paragraph 10 of the Government Actuary's report of February 2003. It explains that, although the extra 1 per cent. employers' contribution is payable only on earnings above the secondary threshold of &#163;89 a week, the amount paid to the NHS is defined as a percentage of all earnings, not just earnings above the threshold. It is difficult to believe, but the result is that an extra &#163;1 billion a year over and above the 1 per cent. contribution is being transferred from the NI fund to the NHS. Again, that is without logic or sense. It is grossly unfair to the principal beneficiaries of the NI fund.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para21">What all that amounts to, adding up the results of all those changes, is that the current annual income of the NI fund has been reduced by some &#163;13 billion a year and its annual expenditure increased by another &#163;1 billion&#151;a total loss of &#163;14 billion a year. That is almost exactly one third of the total bill for retirement pensions. It is a vast amount that, if it were available, would easily allow the minimum income guarantee to be at the same level as the basic pension. The basic pension would then be paid.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para22">As many hon. Members have said in the House, the great problem with the poorest pensioners is that they have lived their lives in self-respect and dignity and never taken a handout. Many pensioners will say with great pride that they have done that and never had to seek any handout from the state. When they reach retirement age, they say that they are not going to start doing it. They say that they have paid their dues&#151;their contributions&#151;and they see no reason why they should ask for income support to raise their income to what the Government define as a basic necessity of life.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para23">Now we are in government, we have exchanged scripts from when we were the Opposition. I remember a Government spokesman saying that we must not talk about stigma, because that was a bad word and would discourage people from claiming income support&#151;the same thing was said before 1997 by the Tory Government. That group of people still remains. Although we do not know the precise number, there are probably around 500,000 of the poorest pensioners living below the level of the minimum income guarantee.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para24">Despite all the losses that the fund has taken and all that has gone on, there is still a massive and steadily growing surplus, which currently stands at &#163;20 billion. That is over and above the working balance recommended by the Government Actuary. Is it any wonder pensioners reject the argument that says that an increase in the basic pension to the level of the minimum income guarantee is unaffordable? Is it any wonder that young people have so little confidence in a state system that says that they will be paid adequate pensions, as promised, when we see the chicanery that has happened under Labour and Tory Governments in recent years?
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para25">If the Government are looking for new ways to spend the huge surplus, there are many ways they could do it. One of the most heart-breaking situations is the suffering of Allied Steel and Wire pensioners and, to a lesser extent, those of Bell Lines in my constituency. Those people paid into their occupational pension funds and expected something at the end of it. They now feel that they will be short-changed, or that they may end up with no pension at all.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para26">It would be far more appropriate if the Government found out what the finite amount involved is and decided&#151;exceptionally, for a limited period&#151;to <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 221WH</B></P>
compensate those who have lost their pensions for no reason at all. There would be a very small amount involved, compared with the sums of money in the national insurance fund at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew1"><B> Kevin Brennan  (Cardiff, West):</B> 
 My hon. Friend's argument is compelling and reveals a lot. Is he aware that one of the arguments advanced about why Allied Steel and Wire workers, and others in the same position, cannot be compensated is that the Government do not stand behind private pensions? He has, however, revealed to us this afternoon that the Government of the day raided the national insurance fund to subsidise dodgy private pensions, rather than the rock-solid private pensions that workers were told&#151;indeed, compelled&#151;to join when they went out to work. Would not it be much better to use any surplus in the national insurance fund to compensate those workers, thereby restoring confidence in occupational private pensions?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew2"><B> Paul Flynn </B> 
: That is entirely right. We know the Government's objection to having a bottomless pit of compensation that might go on and on. However, the law could be changed to ensure that the disaster of Allied Steel and Wire would not be repeated in future. If there is any cause precisely associated with the social insurance fund that must be at the top of everyone's list, it is the one I am talking about. That is far more relevant than the green taxes, which have no connection with the national insurance fund at all.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para27">After the sad effects of the past 25 years, we must make a move to restore people's faith in social insurance. A group known as Catalyst published a pamphlet called "Better Pensions: the state's responsibility". It suggests one possible way of restoring faith in our social insurance system. It proposes the appointment of a national insurance commission consisting largely of representatives of contributors and pensioners, which would be responsible for fixing benefit and contribution rates and proposing structural changes to the benefit system. The Government and Parliament will still have the final say, but if the Government want to impose changes to benefits or contributions that are contrary to the views of the commission, they would have to lay before Parliament a full statement of the reason, which could then be debated by the House.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para28">That proposal is similar to one that was published a while ago by Tony Lyons in a booklet called "Our Pensions". He made a persuasive suggestion that the whole national insurance fund should be placed at arm's length from Government, so that they are not tempted to interfere with it when dealing with matters that are entirely extraneous to the fund. The fund should be divided into two sections: one that is invested and one that is kept as a static fund. Managers of the fund should be rewarded on the successes of their investments and on the contributions that they manage to pay out. That is where we stand.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para29">David Lloyd George introduced a marvellous and brave law, but we are now far away from the bright new dawn that was then envisaged. There are dark clouds over the pension industry and pensions themselves. There is a way out, and that is to rebuild confidence in <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 222WH</B></P>
the social insurance principle, so that people know that if they put money in they will get it out at the end. Instead of getting ninepence for fourpence, sadly, the deal for many people is that they put in ninepence and get fourpence. All parties in the House should combine to restore the full confidence that the national insurance fund enjoyed in the past, and to recreate it on a fair, just and reasonable basis.

<a name="31021h03_spnew3"><B> Mr. Steve Webb  (Northavon):</B> 
 One of the joys of these extended Westminster Hall debates is that they provide the opportunity to think and reflect. We should all thank the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) for giving us the chance to do just that this afternoon and congratulate him on a thorough presentation and documentation of what has been happening to the national insurance fund since David Lloyd George&#151;who is his forebear as much as mine&#151;introduced it 100 years ago.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para30">I broadly agree with the hon. Gentleman's analysis of the problem and of where we have got to, but I part company from him when it comes to where we should go from here. I agree that national insurance has become, to all intents and purposes, another tax. It raises a pot of money that Governments feel free to dip into for whatever purpose suits them at the time, and a lot of what goes into the fund does not earn any entitlement anyway. Employer contributions, which are of course greater than employee contributions, earn no rights whatsoever, but are just a payroll tax. Class 4 national insurance contributions accrue no benefit rights; they are just another tax. Much of what goes into the fund is tax by any other name. The examples that the hon. Gentleman gave of what is done with the money&#151;relieving employers of payroll burdens for green taxes and that sort of thing&#151;is further evidence that we simply have a pot of money with an historic boundary around it, which is increasingly hard to justify.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para31">I also agree that there are plenty of good things that we could do with the money. We can all think what we might do if we had &#163;20 billion. There is sometimes the sense that this is free money and that we can spend it without it costing us anything&#151;I do not accuse the hon. Gentleman of that. We need to remember that every pound spent from the national insurance fund using up that surplus is another pound on aggregate Government borrowing. If Government raised another tax and spent that money, it would have the same effect. I am not sure that we can spend that pot of money in any meaningful sense. The money is being raised through a direct tax and if we put the Treasury supplement back in, we would have to raise other taxes to pay for it. It is certainly not free money, and we must be careful not to give that impression.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para32">If national insurance has effectively become a tax like any other&#151;I suspect that that is the way that we have gone&#151;what do we do about that? The hon. Gentleman's principled position is that one restores the original intent of the national insurance fund and recreates social insurance. My problem with that is that social insurance has become a system of exclusion. Social insurance today involves a set of rules that stop a set of people from getting benefits.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para33">By and large, men pay national insurance; virtually all who work earn above the lower earnings limit, therefore virtually all accrue pension rights. A number of women <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 223WH</B></P>
do not do so. Many women who have two part-time jobs below the lower earnings limit accrue no pension rights at all. The rights of carers are limited. Although the state second pension gives rights to carers when their child is up to five years of age, a mum who is not earning, or not earning up to the lower earnings limit, and whose child is six gets no protection.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para34">National insurance today excludes a subset of people, predominantly women, and predominantly the low-paid. Do we really want to reinforce that structure, or do we want to develop a new one? We should move away from a situation where people's retirement pensions are linked in a complicated way to their record of national insurance contributions during their working lives. All that does is create a lot of infrastructure and administrative cost to keep a small number of people out. That is what national insurance does&#151;it excludes a minority.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para35">Henceforth, we should have a citizenship-based pension whereby each year one accrues a right to a year's worth of state pension&#151;or a 40th, or whatever the percentage is&#151;on the basis of having been a citizen of the country. The effect of that would be to bring in women who work part-time, are low-paid or carers and so on. That would ensure that people are getting a good pension in their own right, rather than excluding people.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para36">The reason I suggest that now when it would not have been the right system 100 years ago is that Lloyd George's model for the pension was that what was needed&#151;this was particularly true post-war with the Beveridge model&#151;was that the pension should be enough to support the man and his dependants, not to support women in their own right. In other words, it did not matter that women were excluded from national insurance because they did not need pensions&#151;they depended on their husbands. We do not want to reinforce such a structure.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para37">We want a citizenship model that allows people to earn pension rights through being a citizen. Therefore, social insurance ceases to be relevant to the basis of entitlement for pensions. Under that system, men and women are treated equally and we do not have a bureaucracy to keep contribution records only to exclude a small number of people. It is an inclusive agenda and once everyone is getting a citizenship pension, the political cost to any Government of mucking about with it is much greater.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para38">As the hon. Gentleman graphically demonstrated, because the present system in so complicated&#151;no one really understands how it works&#151;Government after Government and scheme after scheme can dip a billion here and there out of the national insurance fund and get away with it scot free as it has no political visibility. A citizenship-based pension that is nothing to do with complex social contribution rules, with people knowing that they as citizens have a right to a certain level of pension, would be a much better way of doing things.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para39">Having said that, I accept that hypothecation&#151;that is not what Lloyd George would have called it&#151;has an important part to play. Hypothecation makes taxation more acceptable. People are more willing to pay any given level of tax, or any tax increase, if they know where the money is going, and it is going on something that they want it to be spent on. That is why the Liberal <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 224WH</B></P>
Democrats have increasingly come to the view that we should hypothecate the entire national insurance pot to the national health service.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para40">There may be all sorts of arguments against that. Once a pot of money has been hypothecated to the health service, what do we do if we have a bad year and there is no national insurance? Do we cancel operations? We have a model. The Treasury does not set its goals from one financial year to the next; it sets them over the cycle. It says that that is necessary to satisfy certain economic rules over the cycle, not in each financial year. If one hypothecated the entire national insurance pot to the health service, one could have the independent commission that the hon. Gentleman suggested. It would set the national insurance rates so that over the cycle the national health service would have the funds that it needed for the spending plans that Parliament had set.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para41">If, for example, the public wanted an improvement in the health service, politicians could say, "We will put your national insurance up," and by statute that money would be ring-fenced for the health service. Evidence shows that if the public believe that money is going where they want it to go, they will be more willing to accept an increase. A policy that lowers the political cost of putting more money into public services has to be good for those hon. Members who are positive about progressive taxation and an active public sector.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para42">The Chancellor's increase in national insurance last year for the benefit of the health service was a watered-down version of what I am discussing. I used e-mail to poll hundreds of my constituents about the extra penny on national insurance and about two thirds said that they liked the idea provided that the money went to the health service. I did not ask them to say that&#151;it was an unprompted response.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para43">The principle of hypothecation is good. It reduces the political cost of providing enhanced public services. In a modern setting, the principle of hypothecation must not be to reconstruct state pensions based on an insurance model that excludes those who are too poor to pay insurance. It must be the basis of payment for the national health service&#151;a different sort of national insurance.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para44">The hon. Gentleman mentioned a couple of areas on which he would spend the surplus. We share a lot more common ground on that point. We share the view that the value of the basic state pension is wholly inadequate and that it is not good enough to re-link it to earnings from its present inadequate level. Keeping the state pension at its current percentage of average earnings will leave it substantially below the means test indefinitely, if the test is earnings linked. If it is price linked, the poorest households will lose out. We must increase pensions before considering indexation rules.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para45">I am relaxed about whether that increase is made through a national insurance rise or a tax rise because the structure of national insurances is such that employee contributions are still effectively capped. Paying for a state pension rise through national insurance, which is capped, is less progressive than paying by income tax, which is not. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the ends of an enhanced basic pension but I am not sure about the means. I am not sure whether clear and honest direct taxation is not more <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 225WH</B></P>
progressive than a contribution system in which those earning above &#163;30,000 pay no more than those earning below.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para46">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the position of people whose company pensions have been inadequately wound up and asked where we can find the money for them. I agree that we must find the money, but I question whether the national insurance fund is the right place. One would be asking employed earners&#151;primarily those who are not in private schemes&#151;to compensate those in private schemes. They might feel that that is unfair. If the general taxpayer funded the system, it would be fairer. Anything funded by national insurance is by definition funded from a subset of the population. It is not clear why that subset&#151; those earning in particular income bands in particular employment&#151;should pay, rather than taxpayers as a whole. That distinction does not help us any more.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para47">I back what the hon. Gentleman said about compensation for people in schemes that are wound up owing to inadequate funding. It is unacceptable for the Government to say that in a few years they will protect people but that those who fall foul of a wind-up tomorrow will be completely abandoned. The Government are worried that there would be an element of retrospection if somebody whose pension fund had been wound up were compensated. However, compensation is by definition retrospective. Somebody cannot be compensated for an event until it has happened; it would not be compensation if somebody were paid before an event. Governments have always compensated people when things go wrong for example as a result of the legislative framework being incorrect.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para48">To give an analogy&#151;I am not straying from the topic, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;when people had blood transfusions that were not properly checked for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the Government said, "That is not right. We are going to do something." The action was retrospective in that it occurred after the event, but it was compensation and properly so. Likewise, given that people are sometimes forced to join pension schemes as a condition of employment, when the Government introduced the Pensions Act 1995, which states that if a scheme goes belly up people have got practically no rights, they took responsibility for it.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para49">Retrospection is not an issue. Compensation should be paid and the hon. Gentleman is right about that. I do not care two hoots whether the compensation is from the national insurance fund or anywhere else. The Department for Work and Pensions has identified surplus funding for the coming few years in unallocated spending, and that is where I should like the money to come from.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para50">The hon. Gentleman is right that we have come a long way from the founding principles of national insurance. The question is whether we rebuild that structure or build something new. My concern about rebuilding is that we live in a world in which women should be treated not as their husbands' hangers-on but as people in their own right. I do not want to rebuild a structure that treats women as second-class citizens. I would base the pensions system on citizenship rather than on contributions, which would help women, carers, the low-paid and the disabled, but preserve the idea of <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 226WH</B></P>
hypothecation&#151;a ring-fenced tax for a ring-fenced purpose&#151;and apply it in the 21st century to the health service as it was applied in the 20th century to pensions. The hon. Gentleman has done us a service by raising the issues because there is too little scrutiny of what happens to the national insurance fund. The House owes him its thanks this afternoon.

<a name="31021h03_spnew4"><B> Mr. Howard Flight  (Arundel and South Downs):</B> 
 I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) on securing this valuable debate. I thank him for his analysis of the history of national insurance. I should like to focus on a few historical points before examining the political issues more closely in relation to this and previous Governments' uses of national insurance funds and, more generally, taxation.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para51">I spent a period of my life studying the economic history of the 19th and early-20th centuries. As the hon. Gentleman outlined, national health and unemployment insurance was introduced by the National Insurance Act 1911 with mutually owned bodies and friendly societies operating the health aspects of the scheme and with contribution levels laid down by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para52">Interestingly, substantial pension arrangements and health finance had previously been provided by friendly societies and trade unions. Although there is debate about how serious the situation was, the concern was the big jump in life expectancy at the end of the 19th century, when cholera and typhoid were finally conquered. It was feared actuarially that those bodies would go bust, and the focus was therefore on what to do about it. Members will know that both Churchill and Lloyd George went to Germany to study what Bismarck had done. The subsequent campaign stated that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A Healthy Empire needs Healthy Bodies".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para53">The provision was promoted not as a socialist measure, but as part of the heady imperialism of those days. Indeed, Lloyd George spoke about
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"putting Britain ahead in this field on a level with Germany; we should not emulate them only in armaments".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para54">It was a competitive imperial strategy.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para55">Until 1948, our system was a bit like German health insurance today in that membership was not compulsory. As late as 1960, I can remember asking why one of my grandfathers got a state pension and the other did not. The gist of what I learned was that the one that did not had an income in the 1920s and 1930s when he was not obliged to participate in the system, as was generally the case, and the other one did not earn as much. As the hon. Member for Newport, West will know, for more than the first half of the previous century, it was not a universal scheme at all. Some changes in the 1960s brought everyone in to qualify for state pensions, even if they had not necessarily paid their contributions.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para56">I was never clear whether the original intent was that that should be funded like an insurance scheme, or whether it should be a pay-as-you-go system from day one. There was some controversy on that question at the time, but the fact is that it has become a completely pay-as-you-go system, not a funded one, with individuals <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 227WH</B></P>
paying money, at least in theory, into a general pot. Governments have for a long time treated that in reality as just another form of tax revenue, but with entitlements to what one can draw in benefits. Those are partly determined by contributions, but another category of welfare benefits is not determined by contributions. Since the 1960s, we have had a complete mish-mash in terms of what entitlement across the broad range of welfare benefits rests on. Some go back to the Churchill and Lloyd George measures and some date from Wilson's measures, when the concept was brought in&#151;by accident, as I have always understood it&#151;of rights to welfare.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para57">In the community, there are very different views. If one talks to people of 50 or over, including me, they broadly still think that it is an insurance scheme, where we have paid our national insurance and are entitled to our benefits, and they get extremely annoyed when Governments fiddle around with it. They might greatly support the hon. Member for Newport, West in the argument that Governments have raided the scheme. However, people in the younger age group broadly see the scheme as just another form of taxation levied under different rules. In that sense, the whole accounting is something of an illusion. It needs to be done, but it is really going through the motions while the Treasury get at a particular source of taxation. Some people in both main parties have argued for merging national insurance and income tax, and I have spent a fair amount of time during my life examining such proposals. Largely on pragmatic grounds, I have concluded that that would be a bad idea, not to mention the problems that transition would cause for entitlement if any Government sought to do that.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para58">I have sympathy with the hon. Member for Newport, West on the point that the integrity of what was originally intended has been undermined and made into grey territory. Talking about unused money in the fund is an accounting illusion, and it is not on politically to revert to a truly integral arrangement. If one were to do that, it would be necessary to consider a funded arrangement, for it to stand alone. National insurance receipts are treated today very much as part of general tax revenue. They are not invested and there is no separate fund. When national insurance was introduced, the Liberal Government were anxious not to raise income tax, and were looking at a way of solving a problem that had emerged with the financial difficulties that the friendly societies and some of the trade union welfare arrangements had encountered as a result of improved life expectancy.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para59">In place of the Liberals, we have today a Labour Government in a very similar situation. They do not want to raise income tax, for fear of alienating voters, so we have had the politically convenient measure of increasing national insurance contributions by 1 per cent. without any ceiling, which is patently simply a tax on earnings and employment. Business leaders, as well as my colleagues and I in the Conservative Treasury team, have attacked the Government for those increases, which have been levied since last April. At the time they were introduced, people had forgotten about the tax increases that were already in the pipeline following the previous Budget and had quite a major shock when they opened their April pay packets.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 228WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para60">It is absolutely clear that, because NICs are levied on business and personal taxpayers, the perception is of a tax on jobs and pay. Indeed, for the first time in a long time, disposable incomes after tax are falling, with the overall tax take in the current year, specifically boosted by national insurance, up by 7 per cent. and about &#163;27 billion in aggregate.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para61">The evidence suggests that it was slightly an unwise form of tax at a wrong time. Last week, Britain's biggest bank advised that it was going to shed 4,000 jobs, at least partly as a result of increased employment costs, which were put up by the national insurance rise. When the figures are not interfered with by changing to a different system, they show that we have a background of an 85,000 fall in private sector employment in the past year, matched by a larger rise in public sector employment. Therefore, increasing the costs of employment is, as expected, serving to reduce jobs.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para62">We should not be surprised by that negative impact. The Treasury said in 2000:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Lower National Insurance Contributions will act to promote employment opportunities"
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para63">and businesses will benefit from the cut in employer's national insurance contributions, which will enable them to employ more people. In the last general election campaign, the Prime Minister gave his word and spoke against any increases in national insurance charges. When asked whether any reasonable person would suppose that the Labour Government might increase national insurance charges, the Prime Minister replied that "they shouldn't" so suppose.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para64">The hon. Member for Newport, West commented on recent Conservative announcements on state pensions. The thinking that lies behind those announcements, which is perhaps a little different from his thinking, is that the Government have got the country into a nightmare situation in which all incentives to encourage private sector pension saving, such as the stakeholder initiative, no matter how well intended, are completely negated by the pension tax credit.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para65">More than half of the nation would be foolish to save for a private pension. They would have to save about &#163;180,000 to be in a situation equal to that which they would enjoy under the pension tax credit. Yet, for the good of the economy as a whole, and as the Government's own target has set out, there is the desire to increase the proportion of private sector pension provision as a proportion of the total.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para66">People are greatly discouraged from saving privately for pensions because they do not like the idea that, by 75, they will have to part with all their savings, buy an annuity and take a chance on whether it is a good time to do that and whether inflation or interest rates are rising.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para67">The only solution to those two massive problems is to get the basic state pension up to the minimum income support level. That would mean that both measures would no longer be necessary. In that context, we concluded that the only way in which that could be done is by restoring the earnings link to allow basic pensions to rise. It will take some time to do that and it would be too expensive to do it more quickly. For the sake of clarity, that is the fundamental objective. The key to restoring better levels of private sector pension saving is a basic state pension that means that there is no longer a need for the pension tax credit, or to force people to buy annuities.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para68">May I say a little about NICs and health spending? Again, such is the myth about NI that one can say whatever one likes. I recollect that the 1 per cent. increase was presented as hypothecated to the health service. However, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer presented the actual figures in the relevant Budget, it was broadly shown that half of the increase would go to finance the health service and half would go to finance tax credits. Precisely how much of the extra NIC levy is in any meaningful way financing additional health spending is not clear. The reality is that it was a smokescreen for levying more tax on income and employment to pay for higher Government spending in aggregate.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para69">Here lies the problem. The sudden and dramatic shift to tax and spend three years ago is failing dismally to deliver improved public services. Indeed, on the Government's own Office for National Statistics figures, 83 per cent. of the 50 per cent. increase in public sector spending since 1997 has gone on public sector inflation, which has risen from 1.6 per cent. to 6.5 per cent. and is now nearly 7 per cent. It is that failure that will be the main determinant of the next general election result.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para70">For too long, health funding has been used as a political badge of honour or banner, rather than seen as a serious subject that affects the good of the country. Major reforms, not just ideological rhetoric, are needed to enable better delivery of health services. Above all, the Government should be concerned about output and delivery, not just spending. One could vastly increase spending and not get any material improvement in output.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para71">In this territory, the Liberal Democrats seem as bad, or worse. Earlier this year, the then Liberal Democrat spokesman on Treasury issues, the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor), committed his party to a permanent ring-fenced tax for the NHS, without mention of the necessary reforms to enable the NHS to deliver better services. He said that he wanted to replace NICs with an NHS contribution tax to fund the NHS. I was not entirely clear from the contribution of the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) whether that is still Liberal Democrat policy, after its changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew5"><B> Paul Flynn </B> 
: May I clear up one point? The hon. Gentleman says that the reason why his party now supports restoring the link is not that it wants what pensioners tell me that they want. Pensioners want a guarantee that their income will not decline with inflation. They want reassurance that, whatever happens, their income will continue at least at its present level. However, I understand that the hon. Gentleman's main reason for restoring the link is to boost the private pensions industry, which benefited so well from the previous Tory Government, particularly from the 2 per cent. bribe and the way in which the state earnings-related pension scheme was cut in half. Personal pensions were actively promoted with the result that at least 6 million people were mis-sold pensions. Would he not embark on a disastrous road in making another <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 230WH</B></P>
attempt to support the private pensions industry, which is inefficient, wasteful and very costly to administer compared with the NI fund?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew6"><B> Mr. Flight </B> 
: Of course, restoring the earnings link does just what it describes. The point that I was making was different from the sweet but inaccurate little caricature that the hon. Gentleman sketched. There is consensus across all parties that if private sector pension saving in whatever form is not increased&#151;the Government's target is to move from 40 per cent. to 60 per cent.&#151;the outlook for the overall economic welfare of our people and the ability to deliver welfare will be threatened. The economy will become bogged down like that of Germany with excessive levels of taxation, and will be unable to grow fast enough to produce the necessary growth to finance improved welfare. Therefore, the question is: how can the country move in the right direction? The present major barriers to increasing private sector pension saving are emerging as, first, the pension tax credit&#151;no matter how well intended it is, it is a major disincentive&#151;and, secondly, the obligation to buy an annuity.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para72">No one denies that there were serious problems with private sector pension saving, but the hon. Gentleman would be mistaken if he did not realise that this country, prior to 1997, was to some extent the envy of the world in having achieved greater pension saving and greater participation in private sector saving, which was roughly at 70 per cent., than any other economy, and in having the economic advantages that went with that. The issue of tackling the proper selling of pensions, how they should be invested and managed, and other measures are being addressed and broadly enjoy cross-party support. If the hon. Gentleman believes that we can all have better welfare without the economy growing to a level that can finance that, he is deluding himself.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para73">I close by going back to the issue of the debate. It has raised the major question: does our country stay with our rather mongrel national insurance arrangements, which in many ways are, on one side, merely another form of taxation but, on the other, a measurement of entitlement? Do we consider moving back towards what was originally intended, or even to a funded arrangement, or do we look in the other direction of merging national insurance and income tax?
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para74">My conclusion is that there should be a little more integrity, but the arguments against&#151;in either direction&#151;are rather more powerful than the criticisms of the present arrangements. Although the points of principle raised are perfectly justified, I certainly do not see an easy or powerful path without problems that would take us back to where national insurance came from in the beginning. However, I will certainly heed the hon. Member's words, and I think that the concept of a funded arrangement is well worth looking at.

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para75">It is probably worth starting with a few words of background about the national insurance fund. It was established in 1911, reformed in 1948 and it assumed, broadly, its current form in 1975, when the national insurance industrial injuries and the national insurance reserved funds were merged with it. It lies at the heart of the national insurance system, which was inspired by William Beveridge in his 1942 report and introduced by the post-war Labour Government in 1948. The Beveridge report set out the principle on which the fund is based. I quote from it:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Every citizen of working age will contribute . . . according to the security that he needs . . . benefit in return for contributions, rather than free allowances from the State, is what the people of Britain desire."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31021h03_para76">In debates on the 1946 National Insurance Bill, James Griffiths MP said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have no hesitation in saying&#151;I have said it before outside and I will say it now in the House&#151;this scheme is the best and cheapest insurance policy ever offered to the British people, or to any people anywhere."&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6 February 1946; Vol. 418, c. 1751.]
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h03_para77">That is what it has been ever since: an insurance policy for every working family, ensuring that they have a right to benefits when they cannot work because of unemployment, incapacity or age, financed by contributions to the fund by employees, employers and the self-employed. As has been mentioned in the debate, it is based on a pay-as-you-go principle, which means that those working today are supporting those claiming contributory benefits today.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para78">The national insurance fund provides security for those contributory benefits. It is ring-fenced and cannot be used for other Government expenditure. It is reviewed every year by the Government Actuary, who reports to Parliament on the effect of any changes to contributions or benefits and on the state of the fund. The Government Actuary also reports on the prospects for the fund every five years. The latest quinquennial review is due to be published shortly. The accounts to the fund are audited by the National Audit Office and published annually. The national insurance fund is, therefore, a clear and transparent mechanism for demonstrating the link between national insurance contributions and contributory benefits.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para79">My hon. Friend has pointed to what he calls the fund's vast, unneeded surplus. I take issue with some of his comments. The fund is clearly in a healthy state. Income from contributions is more than enough to cover expenditure on benefits. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the Government Actuary's latest report shows that the balance at the end of 2003&#150;04 is likely to be nearly &#163;20 billion. That number needs to be set in context. During the current year, the fund's income is expected to be &#163;63 billion and expenditure on benefits about &#163;60.5 billion, 80 per cent. of which will go on retirement pensions. The difference, which is added to the balance, is only about &#163;2.5 billion. Last year, the difference was &#163;3 billion, and that is a small proportion&#151;about 4 per cent.&#151;of the amounts flowing through the fund.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para80">As my hon. Friend said, the then Government were sufficiently confident of the state of the fund in 1989 to abolish the Treasury supplement. However, by 1993&#151;<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 232WH</B></P>
just four years later&#151;legislation had to be introduced to provide for a Treasury grant to prevent the fund from running out of money. That clearly illustrates how wrong it is to take a short-term view of the fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew8"><B> Paul Flynn </B> 
: I think that my hon. Friend is defending a situation where contributions were going up at a high rate&#151;the rate of the level of earnings&#151;which led to increases in prices. Funds were built up between 1980 and 1987 by that method, but using such a system was fraudulent for the beneficiaries. However, following the introduction of the fund in 1911, the rate of money going in and coming out was roughly the same and matched inflation. I do not think that my hon. Friend is defending the Conservative position, but there is no question but that the surplus is unneeded. The surplus is defined. I have watched, as many others have, the surplus go from &#163;5.9 billion in 1999 to &#163;20 billion now, over and above the contingency fund. Surely, the surplus is not needed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: In no sense am I trying to defend the decisions taken with regard to benefit levels during the 1980s. However, even when there is a positive surplus in the fund, it is tempting to think that it will persist indefinitely. In fact, events can mean that the surplus disappears quickly; between 1989 and 1993, in the space of just four years, the surplus that had led the Conservative Government to abolish the Treasury supplement disappeared so dramatically that they had to introduce legislation to allow a Treasury grant to supplement the income of the fund. I am arguing that, although a surplus might appear very large at any point time, it is not right to assume that it will not be needed for the purposes of the fund in future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew10"><B> Paul Flynn </B> 
: There was a call for Treasury funds in the early 1990s because of a self-imposed double whammy from the then Government. There were two losses to the fund. The 2 per cent. loss in contributions was caused by the bribe to persuade people to take out personal pensions. The reason for the shortfall was, therefore, because of a loss of income to the fund, which was to the great advantage of the private pensions industry. Those were peculiar circumstances, which are unlikely to be repeated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew11"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: We will not have to wait long to discover the Government Actuary's view of the current surplus in the fund. Events&#151;some of them, perhaps, inspired by the Government, in which instance there were obviously aggravating factors&#151;can mean that the surplus turns around very quickly. I am cautioning against viewing a surplus above the 16.7 per cent. margin that the Government Actuary specifies as unnecessary and available to be spent.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para81">There is a more significant point. The balance on the fund is not wasted. The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) made that point. Any surplus in the fund is used to buy gilts, which provide security for contributory benefits and reduce the Government's need to borrow elsewhere. It is a mistake to think that there is a pot of money that could be used to fund spending on another purpose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew12"><B> Mr. Flight </B> 
: The point that the Minister has just made&#151;if there is a surplus, it goes to fund other <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 233WH</B></P>
Government activities by buying gilts&#151;is in essence the mechanics under which the illusion of a separate fund is maintained, because the overall economic effect of national insurance revenues is that they come out just the same as any other form of tax, even though they are accounted for separately.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew13"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: I do not think that that is the case. The money that is built up in the fund is based on a system of contributions; the hon. Member for Northavon made it clear that people earn entitlements built up through the national insurance fund. The fund, and the availability of the capital in it, is protected and ring-fenced for contributory benefits. Because of the gilt system, the borrowing requirement is reduced elsewhere as well.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para82">This debate touches on our pensions policy in general, and whether it is right to restore the link to earnings or to follow a different approach. Many challenges face us now and in the future. The most important of them are to combat pensioner poverty and to ensure that all of today's workers can provide a decent income for themselves in retirement.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para83">More of us are living longer. Birth rates are falling. At current trends, in the middle of the century, pensioners will outnumber children: there will be a mere 10.1 million children, compared with 14.6 million pensioners. By 2020, 40 per cent. of our population will be over 50. There will be more older people with fewer working age people to support them. That has serious implications for the Government and for society as a whole.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para84">When people decide to retire&#151;they should be allowed to retire later, if they so wish&#151;they currently have to face a retirement of about 20 years. As the century progresses and life expectancy increases, retirements may last up to 20 per cent. longer. People must consider how they plan to achieve their required income in retirement. They have to ask themselves whether they are on track to achieve their target level of income. Will they need to work longer or save more? The Government must put in place systems to ensure that our pension system remains sustainable, and that services are in place to serve an ageing population.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para85">Our reforms are about tackling poverty and helping people to plan and to save for their retirement. For the past three years, we have increased the basic state pension by significantly more than the legal minimum requirement. We have guaranteed that for the rest of the current Parliament we will increase the basic state pension by 2.5 per cent., or the retail price index if that is higher. That stands in marked contrast to previous Conservative party policy. When it was in power, it increased the basic state pension only once, to compensate pensioners when it introduced extra VAT on fuel. The Conservatives left millions in poverty: they expected pensioners to live on just &#163;68.80 a week. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West and other hon. Members will be aware that we also introduced the &#163;200 winter fuel allowance and several other mechanisms to help pensioners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew14"><B> Paul Flynn </B> 
: The Government have certainly increased pension levels beyond the rate to which they would have <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 234WH</B></P>
risen had the link been restored in 1997. Is it not a matter of regret that the perception of pensioners is different from that? The lack of transparency in the fund and the fact that it does not exist as a separate unit has led to confusion in the public mind. If there were a simple, transparent system, where people put money in and got something out, it would be greatly appreciated.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para86">Had the Government restored the link, which would have cost them nothing because of the large increase in 2001 and low interest rates, that would have been to their enormous benefit politically. It would also have given some satisfaction to pensioners to realise that the totem policy of restoring the link had been achieved at virtually nil cost to the Government between 1997 and now.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew15"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: It is worth reminding hon. Members that the pension credit was introduced only this month. If the present situation is compared to the 1997 system, one sees that, on average, pensioner households will be &#163;1,250 a year better off in real terms as a result of Government measures, including the pension credit just introduced. That is about &#163;24 extra a week. The poorest third of pensioners will have gained about &#163;1,600 a year in real terms. If people had to choose between that and a rise in the basic state pension linked to earnings, they would choose to have the extra average &#163;24 a week. Of course we can debate the matter, and I know that my hon. Friend holds his views close to his heart.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew16"><B> Paul Flynn </B> 
: My hon. Friend is being very generous with time in allowing me to intervene. Will she address the position of the very poorest pensioners: those who are entitled to income support to raise them to the level of the minimum income guarantee, but who do not claim it?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew17"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: Yes. We have a take-up campaign to try to get people to claim the benefits to which they are entitled. However, one of the aspects of the pension credit is the Pension Service system, which means that the pension credit becomes an entitlement for pensioners and that they no longer have to use the old-fashioned means-tested system. As they approach the age of 65, pensioners will start to receive the credit as a matter of course for a period that is fixed for up to five years. The system and the culture surrounding it are changing, so that pensioners will view that credit increasingly as part of their normal retirement income.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para87">Restoring the link between pensions and earnings would be unaffordable, unsustainable and unfair. It was not long ago that the Opposition spokesman for work and pensions, the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts), called restoring the earnings link

<a name="31021h03_para91">That was something that he was keen to pronounce not very long ago. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West, said, if there were a Nobel prize for shameless political opportunism, the Conservative party would certainly win it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew18"><B> Mr. Flight </B> 
: I rise merely to comment that since then my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has costed that and found that it is affordable. He has set out precisely how we would pay for it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew19"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: If the hon. Gentleman explores his party's policies and scrutinises them more closely, he will see that the hon. Member for Havant proposes, for example, to abolish the new deals for lone parents and for young people, which institutions such as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research have said pay for themselves.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para92">The policy is completely uncosted, but more than that, it is unfair. Under the Tory plan, as the shadow Chancellor has conceded, nothing will be done to help the poorest pensioners, who will fall further behind and see any increase in the basic state pension knocked straight off their pension credit. That also fails the basis test of fairness towards poorer pensioners. We believe that the foundation of the state pension system on pension credit, the minimum income guarantee and increases in the basic state pension is a much fairer way to proceed.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para93">We are also looking after the interests of future pensioners. The state second pension, which was introduced in April 2002, reformed the state earnings-related pension scheme. That, too, follows the theme of aiding the poorest. It allows greater accrual rates for the lower paid&#151;those earning less than &#163;11,200 a year are being treated as if they had earned that amount.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para94">The accrual rate applying to earnings up to &#163;11,200 is double the rate that applied under the state earnings-related pension scheme. For the first time, carers, people with disabilities and those with broken work records are helped to build the state second pension. When that is compared to SERPS, it provides extra help for retirement for around 20 million people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew20"><B> Mr. Webb </B> 
: Surely, it all depends what it is compared with. Mothers who receive child benefit get complete protection in the basic state pension but, under the state second pension, once their children are five, they do not. Mothers with children over five would have done better with all that money on a decent basic pension, rather than on a state second pension, under which they do not qualify for credits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h03_spnew21"><B> Ruth Kelly </B> 
: Even the hon. Gentleman does not dispute the fact that some 20 million people will benefit from the state second pension and many groups of people in the circumstances he mentioned would not benefit from the basic state pension.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para95">We have not only been active on the state pension. To return to the point that was raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Newport, West and for Cardiff, West <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 236WH</B></P>
(Kevin Brennan), we must protect the position of occupational pensions. Good occupational pension schemes play a major part in boosting income in retirement. We are taking action on that, too.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para96">The most important question that was raised is: how do we protect the pensions promise? One of the proposals that we intend to take forward in the pensions Bill is to help to protect people in occupational pension schemes, if they are at risk of insolvency. For the first time in this country, our reforms will introduce the pensions protection fund to protect victims in such situations.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para97">I understand hon. Members' concerns about the workers at ASW. Indeed, I met a delegation from there. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions made it clear that we will consider any sensible, reasonable scheme put forward to help those people. The last thing I want to do is raise false expectations in people who have suffered a major blow to their hopes of a decent retirement income. We are very sympathetic to their concerns. However, the pensions protection fund is an insurance fund that looks forward to protecting people in future, rather than capturing that group of employees. We would, of course, always welcome suggestions on how we might help them.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para98">The other strand of our pensions savings policy is informed choice. If people are to save, they need clear information, so that they can make informed choices. The Pension Service already provides forecasts for the state pension on request. Now it is going further. Having started with self-employed people last May, we are extending the automatic issue of state pensioner forecasts, so that people can see clearly what pension they will receive in retirement. We also want to extend the coverage of combined pension forecasts, which for the first time bring together information on an individual's state and occupational or private pension entitlement, to allow people to see more clearly what pension they can expect to receive when they retire.
<P>

<a name="31021h03_para99">I believe that, when people see their forecast income in black and white, they will take action and save more where they need to. We are committed to ensuring that people have the information that they need when they need it, through as many channels as possible.

<a name="31021h04_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire):</B> 
 Much of South Derbyshire is impacted by the activities of East Midlands airport. In positive terms, the airport provides jobs to local people both directly and through a variety of on-site and adjacent associated businesses. It also offers a fairly limited range of travel destinations. The negative aspects, however, are substantial. Aircraft noise affects the lives of my constituents along the flight paths to the west and south-west of the airport in communities such as Melbourne, Ticknall, Weston-on-Trent, Swarkestone, Milton, Barrow upon Trent and Findern. Although most people judge that acceptable in daytime, the increasing strength of the airport and its chosen core market of dedicated freight traffic have greatly increased night flying. No formal restrictions are in place through planning consent conditions or national regulation. That is unacceptable in its impact on local residents and its distorting effect on the freight marketplace. This debate gives me the opportunity to expand on both aspects.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para0">Just-in-time logistics have driven faster delivery demands, met by specialist freight integrators. Globalisation of sourcing and trade liberalisation have prompted longer supply chains, particularly for high-value products. Airfreight thus carries a disproportionate 20 per cent. of our exports by value. Airfreight has expanded rapidly in the past few years, doubling between 1969 and 1989 and doubling again between 1989 and 1999. Growth is expected to accelerate, with forecasts of 8 per cent. growth per annum during the next 10 years. At present, 70 to 80 per cent. of freight is carried in the bellies of passenger aircraft. Provided that capacity is available, it is anticipated that dedicated and express freighter services will grow in importance. Considerably more than half the cargo flights from East Midlands take place at night. To ensure next-day delivery, night flights are necessary. That also helps to spread the stress on the surface network that is a critical part of the distribution of airfreight goods.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para1">The Select Committee on Transport, when advising the Government on aviation after its consultation, stated
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the UK were to reject night flights altogether"&#151;
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h04_para2">one can recall the court case at Heathrow, which suggested that that might happen&#151;
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it would be rejecting a key means of support for modern industry . . . There are significant risks to the UK economy and its relative standing in Europe in the air freight market if no solution can be found."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31021h04_para3">However, one should not exaggerate. Constraints on market channels to meet demand will prompt innovation. During the 30-year period covered by the Government's airport consultation, many adventitious innovations will impact on products, demand and market channels. It is worth noting that the recent huge growth in airfreight would not have been predicted in a similar Government study 30 years ago. A leading freight integrator has confirmed that to me. It is accepted in the Government's consultation on the future development of air transport that the modelling of airfreight demand is primitive.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 238WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h04_para4">East Midlands is comfortably the largest freighter airport in the United Kingdom. It is claimed that expanding operations there will bring 26,800 extra jobs to the region over 30 years. A balanced approach to the development of the airport and its disadvantages, as well as advantages, is therefore necessary.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para5">In the Government's projections, East Midlands airport's freight volume is expected to grow between tenfold and fifteenfold by 2030. Very little of that volume is expected to be carried in the bellies of passenger aircraft.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para6">There are DHL, TNT and UPS bases at East Midlands, along with nearly 30 freight-forwarding and airfreight service providers. The largest users of those services are the fashion industry, professional services, engineering, telecommunications and aerospace, which are all core sectors of the midlands economy. The economic value of a typical airfreight air traffic movement is three to five times more than an equivalent passenger flight. However, airport slots are not allocated on economic value and returns from passenger sales increase the value of passenger traffic to airports, which, of course, allocate the slots.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para7">Thus, predicted growth in passenger traffic will squeeze out freight at the margins. That is a certainty with the costs of passenger air travel expected to fall by 1 to 2 per cent. per year in real terms over the 30-year period, prompting more rapid passenger volume growth. Restricting airport growth will accelerate that trend if there is no market intervention. Capacity for freight traffic is already limited by night-flight restrictions at many airports, and I have emphasised that night flights are critical in providing express airfreight services.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para8">Again, the Select Committee highlights that point. It states that there is a need to
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"identify the extent to which night operations can expand at existing airports without compromising noise protection standards. This is likely to affect the location and nature of future development of the air freight industry."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h04_para9">If capacity at UK airports is constrained&#151;the Government's consultation suggests that it may be&#151;prices will rise and, if decisions are left solely to airports, slots will be allocated to those flights that attract the highest value to an airport. More marginal activity will be displaced first to less favoured airports and then entirely. It is clear that freighter traffic will be impacted by constraints, forcing up prices for freighter use and prompting greater selectivity in the use of that transport mode, which is welcome in terms of sustainability. The airfreight of relatively low-value items is not justifiable in terms of the environmental impact of the transport mode. That squeeze process is also likely to focus express freighter traffic at airports with minimal night noise regulation.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para10">One of the thrusts of the Government's consultation on the future development of air transport is that East Midlands airport will further strengthen its already dominant position in the freighter market. That is not in the interests of airfreight users, as I will explain, and the Government should not encourage it. The current market share of East Midlands already poses competitiveness concerns. Further steps towards the monopoly supply of freighter slots would be unacceptable.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 239WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h04_para11">Freight integrators told the Select Committee that they would like to use an airport closer to the south-east since that is where most freight comes from and is destined for. A Federal Express spokesman told the Committee,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Three of us operate out of Stansted and we have got a major investment there . . . simply because over the years we have been forced to move out of Heathrow and Gatwick",
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h04_para12">which bears out a point that I have already made.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have a major concern for the South East because if that happens at Stansted as well we will not be able to offer businesses in the South East generally, particularly in Central London, meaningful services that we do now because we will be going too far away to another airport."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31021h04_para13">Furthermore, in terms of surface logistics East Midlands is a poor choice on which to base the whole strategy for airfreight. Surface communications to East Midlands airport are poor. There is a proposal to open the Donington loop to passenger traffic permitting a rail station at Castle Donington. There is also the long-delayed proposal for a station adjacent to the M1, but neither of those proposals would provide freight access to the airport through rail. The lack of provision ensures that all freight traffic to and from the airport travels by road or is moved on by air through the hub.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para14">Road links are also poor. The airport lies close to one of the most congested sections of the M1. Although the A50 offers reasonable routes to part of the west midlands, links to the east are poor and rely on the M1. Accepting that further airport growth at East Midlands is achievable within the current built environment, it is essential that surface links are improved. The airport owners should meet the cost as a condition of meeting a set benchmark point of traffic growth.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para15">National strategy needs at least one other airport that could absorb freighter growth and would be attractive to operators in logistics terms. I hesitate to commend an airport option that might well have impacts of which I am unaware, but an airport much closer than East Midlands to the south-east and well located for east-to-west and north-to-south movements would be appropriate. That airport would have to be permitted on the basis of freight use to prevent the squeeze by passenger services. It would also be wise to consider intervening in how airports allocate slots between freight and passenger services to protect freight access to some areas.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para16">A large part of freighter activity necessarily takes place at night and has used the oldest, noisiest aircraft. The attractiveness of East Midlands to that sector is explained in large part by the consistent failure of any level of government to impose night noise controls similar to those at equivalent airports. The Government consultation notes the local night noise issue but hints that, since the area around the airport is relatively sparsely populated, it should be of no great concern.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para17">The implication of the highest forecasts of freight traffic from East Midlands would suggest a flight every three to five minutes from the airport. That density is unacceptable. Even modern aircraft produce significant noise while climbing at low altitudes. It is essential that a reasonable night noise regime encompassing both flight quantities and noise volume is agreed between the airport and local representatives&#151;if that is facilitated by the White Paper&#151;or failing that, is set by <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 240WH</B></P>
Government. The current voluntary framework endorsed by Ministers is inadequate to deal with anything like the growth forecast.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para18">I have already pressed the Minister to define at what point the current regime should be reviewed. The local planning process on airport growth will not fill the gap in regulation. There is already significant capacity for growth without major runway or building development, let alone a second runway. The lack of effective controls skews the freight market in favour of East Midlands and this is not in the interests of the local residential community or, as I have argued, the wider economy.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para19">It is suggested that international environmental controls will save the day. Chapter 4 applies to all new aircraft manufactured after 2006&#151;the first new noise standard agreed since 1977. Chapter 3 reduced noise only modestly and there is no agreed date for phasing out chapter 3 aircraft. With replacement rates of 20 to 30 years and given that freight aircraft are generally older than passenger aircraft, one could expect only gradual implementation on freight routes. Since most new aircraft now meet chapter 4 standards and it took 25 years to move from chapter 3 to 4 it would not be reasonable to expect much further progress from international regulation in the next 20 years. We should focus on the potential for accelerated European implementation of chapter 4.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para20">The UK needs a thriving airfreight sector. It should bear appropriate environmental burdens and be forced to adopt modern technologies. The Government have an important role in driving development and the adoption of more demanding international aircraft noise standards. It is neither economically nor logistically sound to focus freighter traffic growth at East Midlands. The current light noise regulation of the airport distorts location choice for integrators and that trend will accelerate as other airports fill with passengers.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para21">Although night flying is an essential part of freighter activity, the scale of growth projected at East Midlands would have unacceptable noise impacts on our communities even with the most modern aircraft. Some growth at East Midlands is inevitable. There should be clear and close benchmarks at which the need for formal regulation is reviewed. The Government should intervene in slot allocation to protect freight use of other airports and should identify a suitable south-eastern location for core freight activity so that we have a logistically coherent strategy, not one driven solely by where night slots are available.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para22">Most of my constituents appreciate the needs of a growing airport; they seek a more balanced approach. Their interests and that of the wider economy largely coincide. I hope that the Minister will reflect further on how to proceed in providing for the freight sector and responding to local concerns.

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) and to the Minister for allowing <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 241WH</B></P>
me to make a brief contribution to this short debate, as East Midlands airport is located in my constituency, although it is close to the Derbyshire border.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para23">When the aviation White Paper is published in a few weeks' time, will the Minister reassure us that, when spelling out the future of airfreight in the midlands, the document will properly reflect the existing social and environmental impact of aviation on local airport communities in the three counties affected by East Midlands airport?
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para24">The contribution of air transport, in particular aircraft arrivals and departures, to greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise was recently calculated in a Treasury report to cost more than &#163;1.4 billion per year, of which many millions are inflicted on my area.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para25">As my hon. Friend said, the difficulty with East Midlands airport is that it is unique in the United Kingdom. It operates a very high volume of freight aircraft and a rapidly increasing number of passenger aircraft with few, if any, conditions imposed on it by local authority planners to protect nearby villages. The Government have so far declined to designate it under the Civil Aviation Act 1982 to restrict the impact of noise at night.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para26">Although East Midlands airport has attempted to ameliorate the adverse effects of its operations by using noise-preferred routes, noise penalty schemes and sound insulation grants, that is not making a sufficient difference to the thousands of people whose human rights are infringed and whose sleep is seriously disturbed by freight aircraft at night.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para27">Although economists shy away from putting a figure on such environmental blight in their cost-benefit calculations, will the Minister ensure that the White Paper takes a balanced view and prohibits any extra regional airport capacity without a common protective environmental framework being implemented?
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para28">Britain's airports must be removed from their fiscal cocoon and required to deal much more effectively with the adverse consequences of their night freight operations. "Things can only get noisier" will never be a sustainable aviation strategy.

<a name="31021h04_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport   (Mr. Tony McNulty) </B> 
:  I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) on securing the debate. The issue is important and it is made more so by the imminent publication of the aviation White Paper. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) for his contribution. I had a useful discussion with both of them en route to East Midlands airport recently. Happily for them, they went off to do whatever they were doing for the rest of the day, while I stayed at the airport until about 11.15 pm seeing the pleasure that is DHL and its operations, as well as being entertained over dinner.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para29">As my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire said, freight is important to this country and business is increasingly international. We depend on our export services and on high-value goods, and as a freight-<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 242WH</B></P>
specific airport, East Midlands is unique. It ranks third in the country for net volume of freight handled, but those airports that are respectively first and second deal with belly cargo in passenger planes only rather than dedicated freight.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para30">We depend on export services and high-value goods. In the 21st century, many of those exports depend on aviation and that trend is increasing. Set against that, our major airports are full or filling up rapidly, as my hon. Friend mentioned. In the south-east, which handles more than half our passenger traffic, Heathrow's two runways are full for most of the day, and so is the single runway at Gatwick. Those issues will be addressed in the forthcoming aviation White Paper. As the Secretary of State said when he announced the air transport consultation, doing nothing is not an option. It would be positively the wrong thing to do.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para31">Although I do not want to dwell on the White Paper, it provides the necessary backdrop to our debate about the future of East Midlands airport. The key consultation questions on which we sought views were: how much, if any, additional airport capacity is needed; where could or should any new capacity be located; and, given what my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire asked, what measures will be needed to control and mitigate the environmental impact of airport growth.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para32">As and when the White Paper comes to fruition, we would very much like to develop a package for each and every airport covered by it in respect of their existing functions and role in the local economy, whether or not there will be expansion of capacity. In that context, especially if there is to be expansion, yes, it does mean a key package for surface logistics&#151;the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire referred to surface access&#151;for noise abatement and mitigation, for environmental impact mitigation and for all the other elements to which both my hon. Friends referred.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para33">The White Paper will most emphatically not be about one here, one there and half of one there. It is supposed to be about developing a framework for aviation in this country for the next 30 years and, in that context, must be done responsibly, above and beyond simply the allocation of capacity.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para34">Yes, airport development is a matter of national interest and there are wide-ranging implications for people and the environment, as my hon. Friends said. It is right that the Government should look ahead and make plans to ensure that we can develop a sustainable airports policy and, equally, along with that and within the context of the Treasury's view, the economic instruments for aviation.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para35">We must follow that approach everywhere. Clearly, London and the south-east is a key area, but we have examined in detail a wide range of options for the midlands as well as elsewhere in the country. All the options that we concentrated on have strengths and weaknesses. There is no perfect answer and, as I have told my hon. Friends on several occasions, we have made no decisions yet&#151;the White Paper is in genesis, to say the least. We must consider the 400,000 responses that we have received.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para36">The consultation highlighted a very important issue that we are now considering; namely, the future of the UK airfreight sector. That industry is worth a total of <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 243WH</B></P>
about &#163;5 billion to the UK economy. It accounts for some 50,000 jobs directly and as many again in indirect employment. It is vital for the success of British businesses in an increasingly competitive international marketplace and, as my hon. Friends have mentioned, it is growing. Airfreight traffic at UK airports has doubled in the past 12 years and we have forecasts of a sixfold increase by 2030.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para37">The fastest growing area within the sector is express freight, which is expected to comprise more than half the UK freight market by 2030. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire said, some of the main players have a significant presence at the East Midlands airport. I am sure that many companies in the region find it invaluable to have on their doorstep the means to dispatch consignments for delivery almost anywhere in the world within 24 hours.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para38">DHL and UPS have suggested to me&#151;I exclude TNT simply because I have not met representatives of that company&#151;that they need slots closer to London precisely for the express market. The fact that the express end of the freight sector is expanding does not necessarily mean that all the expansion has to be at East Midlands. A strong case has been put by UPS and DHL for at least an early and night flight into and out of Stansted, where they are based&#151;whether they stay there is neither here nor there&#151;to deal with the express market. The entire sixfold increase will not go to the East Midlands airport.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para39">However, as my hon. Friends said, such capability comes at a price. Night flights are essential to operation of the international next-day delivery market, and that means night noise. East Midlands airport is in a fairly rural area. It would be very easy to regard noise impact there as a lesser issue than at, say, Heathrow or Birmingham, but be assured that we recognise that it is a very real issue every night for the people in communities such as Kegworth, Melbourne or Diseworth. As my hon. Friends said, the airport company clearly takes the noise issue seriously. It has made good progress in implementing the enhanced noise control scheme agreed last year.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para40">However, if East Midlands is to expand to accommodate growth in the freight market, further measures will be required. That is why we will want to consider the airport's proposals for mitigation of aircraft noise problems before we reach any decisions. Its proposals include property purchase and noise insulation. Indeed, I would go further. As I said earlier, given the capacity to expand that already exists at East Midlands, apart from any greater capacity, we shall consider how that expansion, should it come&#151;it is not necessarily an issue for the White Paper&#151;can be done in a sustainable and mitigated fashion. It is not simply about no management at all of that particular capacity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h04_spnew3"><B> Mr. Todd </B> 
: May I press the Minister slightly? He and I have exchanged letters about setting precise benchmarks at which one could reasonably review the current regulatory environment at East Midlands airport, foreseeing growth in the future. Will he reflect a little further on that? I have just received his latest letter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h04_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty </B> 
: I shall certainly reflect on the matter a little further, but I am unable to do that with my <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 244WH</B></P>
futurologist hat on, in the sense of the expansion that there may or may not be to the existing airport or any expansion that we permit or otherwise in the White Paper. I assure my hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire that, whatever the future road map&#151;if that is an appropriate phrase&#151;for East Midlands airport, there does need to be a notion of a development or growth brief in terms of expanding the existing facilities or any subsequent expansion of capacity.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para41">As with all the decisions that will be taken on our new runways and our existing airports we must, as both my hon. Friends have suggested, strike a balance between maximising the economic and social benefits of more capacity and minimising environmental impacts such as noise, air quality and, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire said, greenhouse gas emissions. The consultation exercise is helping to inform us where that balance should lie and answers on the Government's thoughts will be forthcoming by the end of the year in the White Paper. I reassure my hon. Friends that we are on schedule to publish the White Paper by the end of the year. I know that in terms of the stretch and import of the White Paper, their constituents in the east midlands as well as people throughout the country seek, if nothing else, some clarity about what that future will be, with or without extensive capacity.
<P>

<a name="31021h04_para42">I reiterate that, regardless of what happens at East Midlands airport, we will keep under review the essential package that is in place to control noise, which was mentioned my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire. It involves phasing out noisier freight aircraft, especially DHL; a marked reduction in flight tracking noise level infringements; a noise charging regime; operational procedures to promote quiet operations; instigation of a noise insulation grant scheme; and extensive stakeholder and community outreach to build consensus about noise amelioration proposals. Those elements are constantly kept under review and that will continue. Whatever the future for East Midlands airport, I will continue to reflect on what amelioration package is needed given the expansion or capacity increases that there may be.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h04_spnew5"><B> Mr. Todd </B> 
: May I press the Minister on one other point? I mentioned ensuring the availability of slots in other parts of the country where it is necessary to provide express freight locations. As he said, it would be foolish to base the entire growth in the east midlands. That would not work logistically. How can we ensure that other slots are kept available for freight?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h04_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty </B> 
: Certainly in the express freight market, which is where the real significant growth is, market forces are doing that as we speak. I suspect that my hon. Friend cannot continue to push beyond that this side of the White Paper. I would resist that up until then. The notion of the White Paper being about more than simply the allocation of any airport capacity that we determine is real. It is about regional access to the London and south-east hubs, and a consequential, managed development of the freight sector. In that context, I am sure that the sort of issues that my hon. Friend raised will be considered. However, there is nothing that I can say today to my hon. Friend that will move the matter on further.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 245WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h04_para43">I congratulate my hon. Friends on their contributions. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire is twitching, but I will not give way to him as we are running out of time. This is a serious issue, and I am sure that we will address it again after the White Paper has been published.

<a name="31021h05_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Reid  (Argyll and Bute):</B> 
 During my summer tour of my constituency, the most common complaint raised by constituents was difficulties obtaining television reception. The matter kept cropping up in all parts of Argyll and Bute. It is a problem that does not affect only the highlands and<i> </i>islands. Since I was granted this Adjournment debate, many Members from throughout the country have contacted me to say that their constituents experience it.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para0">The fundamental problem is that the terrestrial analogue signal does not reach many parts of the country. Many constituents who cannot receive a decent reception from terrestrial signals sought to solve the problem by buying a Sky digibox. Until recently, they were able to receive the five terrestrial channels from a BSkyB satellite via their digibox on a free-to-view basis using a Solus viewing card. However, the BBC has decided to end its contract with BSkyB, and it has moved its digital services to a new satellite. The effect of that is that BSkyB can disable those Solus viewing cards at any time. If that happens, those viewers will no longer be able to use their Solus card to receive ITV1 and Channels 4 and 5. Unless they pay a subscription to BSkyB, their cards could be disabled at any time and then they would be able to watch only the two BBC channels.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para1">In addition to buying a Sky digibox, many of those viewers also paid a year's subscription to BSkyB because its adverts led them to believe that their contract with BSkyB would allow them to view the five terrestrial channels indefinitely at no further cost, after the expiry of their year's subscription. Having paid a licence fee, bought a digibox and paid a year's subscription to BSkyB, they were told out of the blue that they must pay further annual subscriptions to BSkyB to receive the terrestrial channels ITV 1, and Channels 4 and 5.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para2">That is outrageous, bearing in mind that most of the country takes these services for granted. BSkyB, ITV and Channels 4 and 5 are negotiating to try to reach an agreement that would allow viewers with a Sky digibox to continue to view ITV1 and Channels 4 and 5. It is possible that they have already reached an agreement and not announced it yet. Even if an agreement is reached, I am sure that there will still be a cost to the viewers, and there will also be uncertainty about what will happen when the contract between ITV and BSkyB ends.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para3">A fundamental principle is at stake. People who have bought a TV licence should have the right to watch the five terrestrial channels without having to pay more fees to private broadcasters. The present system is chaotic. It is wrong that viewers who have bought expensive equipment and paid up-front costs such as a year's subscription to Sky can be led to believe that they can watch the five terrestrial channels from then on so long as they pay the annual licence fee, only to find that their TV can be blanked out as a result of a deal between major corporations. A deal between Sky and ITV and Channels 4 and 5 may resolve the situation in the short term, but the uncertainty will continue and the Government must sort this situation out in the long term.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 247WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para4">The licence fee is a hypothecated poll tax. The money raised goes to the BBC. Everybody who pays that poll tax should receive the five terrestrial channels in return. Otherwise, taking the licence fee off those viewers is tantamount to fraud.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para5">If the situation with regard to ITV and Channels 4 and 5 were not bad enough, viewers who receive the BBC digitally via the satellite, cannot even watch all BBC programmes. As one of the Minister's responsibilities is sport, I am sure that he will appreciate the anger felt by viewers when I explain that one of the effects of the BBC's decision to broadcast its regional channels throughout the UK is that digital viewers of BBC Scotland cannot watch Scottish football.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spmin0"><B>The Minister for Sport and Tourism   (Mr. Richard Caborn) </B> 
:  I will not be tempted by that.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew1"><B> Mr. Reid </B> 
: The Minister would have a feeling for the scale of the outrage if he found that Sheffield United games were to be broadcast throughout the whole country but blanked out in Sheffield&#151;his postbag would be full. That is what happens in Scotland at the moment. The BBC is blanking out Scottish premier league matches from its digital service because its contract with Scottish premier league says that those matches cannot be broadcast outside Scotland and the digital version of its regional channels are now broadcast throughout the UK.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para6">I find it galling that the BBC can pay millions of pounds of licence payers' money to the Scottish and English football authorities, yet cannot find a solution to the problem. Surely, either a technical solution can be found or the BBC could simply renegotiate its contract with the Scottish premier league. Again, the fundamental principle should be&#151;this is where the Government should step in&#151;that if people pay the licence fee, they should have the right to watch all BBC programmes.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para7">Other gaps in television reception mean that many parts of Argyll and Bute cannot receive the new Freeview service; many parts cannot receive Channel 5. As an example of the frustration felt by my constituents, I shall read out a letter that I received from a constituent in Kilmelford. I received it after I had sent her a copy of the standard letter that the Minister for Media and Heritage, the noble Lord McIntosh, sends out to MPs who complain about television reception in their constituencies. This is the reply to that letter:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Regarding the installation of a satellite dish, I have made enquiries, but it would have to be put on a post 200 metres up the hill from my house at a cost of &#163;220 over and above the Sky charge. I would also have to pay &#163;12.50 per month to Sky and being a pensioner, still paying for my TV licence",
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para8">she says that she cannot afford the additional monthly cost. She continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I would have to get permission from the farmer who owns the field, and according to people I've spoken to in the village they had 'Sky' dishes fixed on posts on the hill and the livestock kept chewing through the cables".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para9">Those are some of the problems that people trying to receive decent television reception in rural areas face.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para10">The standard reply from the Minister advises viewers to contact a reputable local installer through the Confederation of Aerial Industries. A reputable <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 248WH</B></P>
installer will have experience of local reception characteristics and can advise on the location and orientation of a satellite dish. I generally find that when I send on that standard letter to constituents, they have already spoken to a reputable aeriel installer before contacting me, and it is simply not possible to achieve decent quality television reception in many places.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para11">Another cause for concern in rural areas is the Government's plan to switch all the terrestrial television channels from analogue to digital no later than 2010&#151;only seven years away. Many viewers in rural areas, outside the reach of analogue signals, rely on self-help relay schemes to receive the terrestrial channels. Those are small cable systems that carry the signal from an analogue relay station situated on a nearby hill. In years gone by, such schemes received financial support from the BBC, but no longer. Government policy is that no central Government moneys are available to assist in the funding of self-help schemes.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para12">There also appear to be no plans to convert those small analogue relay stations so that they will be able to receive and relay digital signals around the village. Many of the villages served by the self-help schemes are in glens that cannot receive digital signals from the satellite because of the high mountains round about. The self-help scheme is the only way those villages can receive TV.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para13">Unless the Government change their policy of no assistance for the self-help schemes, those villages will be left without TV when the analogue signals are switched off. One of the Government's criteria for the analogue switch-off is that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"everyone who currently receives the main public broadcast channels in analogue form must be able to receive them digitally".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para14">It is not clear from the criteria whether viewers who receive the terrestrial channels via a self-help relay system count as viewers who must be able to receive digital before the analogue switch-off. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that. I hope that he will agree that those viewers should count in the statistics. If he does, will he tell the House that the Government will pay the cost of converting the self-help relay systems to digital?
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para15">Another criteria for the analogue switch-off is affordability. The criteria here is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Switching to digital should be an affordable option for the vast majority of people."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para16">"Vast majority" is a worryingly vague term, whereas other statistics in the Government's criteria involve specific percentages. I earlier explained the vast costs that some viewers have gone to to receive digital TV. But even then the plug can be pulled from their TV set by big corporations doing some deal. Such uncertainty does not encourage viewers to invest in expensive equipment.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para17">I am concerned that we will see two divides in TV-watching in our country. The first will be urban/rural. The urban viewer will buy a TV licence and be able to receive all programmes with no problem. The rural dweller will either have no decent reception at all or will have to pay out vast sums of money to be able to watch TV. The other divide in our rural communities will be between rich and poor. Those who can afford it will be able to buy the equipment and pay the subscriptions necessary to watch TV, but those on low incomes will be left out.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew2"><B> Hywel Williams  (Caernarfon):</B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are further problems in <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 249WH</B></P>
parts of rural Wales? Some people wish to watch Channel 4 because they cannot understand Sianel Pedwar Cymru, S4C, the Welsh language fourth channel and have invested in equipment specifically to watch Channel 4 and Channel 5. With the current proposals, that is a problem for Welsh constituents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew3"><B> Mr. Reid </B> 
: The hon. Gentleman makes a very important point and I agree. The Government should be making available the Welsh TV channel on a free-to-view basis as well as the other five terrestrial channels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland):</B> 
 Can I suggest that this problem is yet a further compulsitor towards the depopulation of the highlands and islands? The families that we want to keep there are those with young children. The inability to receive television signals of the sort that my hon. Friend has outlined will be another factor that they will take into consideration when deciding whether to remain in those communities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew5"><B> Mr. Reid </B> 
: My hon. Friend makes a very important point. The highlands and islands have suffered depopulation for many years. We want to encourage young families to stay and other young families to come and live there. If they cannot get decent affordable television, that will be one reason why they will move away.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para18">The Government should adopt a simple principle. Everyone who pays the licence fee should be able to receive all programmes on all terrestrial channels on a free-to-view basis. I hope that the Minister agrees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew6"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: I believe that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) has sought the permission of the initiator of the debate, the Minister and me to take part in the debate.


<P>

<a name="31021h05_time1"><H5>4.14 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew7"><B> Mr. Roger Williams  (Brecon and Radnorshire):</B> 
 I shall take a short part in the debate. Thank you for your great kindness in allowing me to do so, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I want to build on the point that the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) made about S4C, the Welsh language station, particularly as it relates to my constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) who live up and down the Welsh border. Television viewers receive their terrestrial analogue signal from relay stations on the other side of the border. The result is that they generally receive Channel 4 when they would like to receive S4C, the Welsh language station, to get news and political developments from Wales.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para19">Another issue is that my constituents often receive midlands ITV signals. The regional programmes, and particularly local political issues, are from the midlands rather than from Wales. We saw the digital solution as enabling the people to have a choice between S4C and Channel 4, and between midland ITV and the Welsh independent television service. We would be pleased if the Minister could come to us with a solution. Without such a solution, those facilities will not be available to our constituents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew8"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: The Minister is full of solutions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spmin1"><B>The Minister for Sport and Tourism   (Mr. Richard Caborn) </B> 
:  I was reflecting on the comments made by the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid). I congratulate him on securing the Adjournment debate. As he explained, the issue is important. However, I have just left a meeting about obesity in young children who watch too much television. It shows that one can become schizophrenic in this job if one is not careful. I am grateful to him for raising the issue of rural television.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew9"><B> Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire):</B> 
 We want rural children to have the right to watch too much television in the same way as their urban counterparts, which they sadly cannot do in Montgomeryshire at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
: It is all a matter of choice.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para20">I have a great deal of sympathy for viewers who installed satellite equipment in good faith, who chose to go free to view and who have been told that their Solus cards will not work after a certain date. We have received more than 800 letters about the matter, and we have also received more than 150 letters from MPs, some of which have been cited in this afternoon's debate.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para21">I will give the Chamber an update on how the broadcasters are trying to resolve the issue, but first I want to explain the background to the Government's policy on digital television and the digital switchover, which the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute also raised.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para22">The growth in take-up of digital television is a significant development in broadcasting in this country. We are close to the point at which 50 per cent. of all households have digital television. The current take-up level is 48 per cent., and we believe that it will have gone over 50 per cent. by Christmas.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para23">The successful launch of Freeview and the continued growth of Sky have been central to the increase in digital television. The launch of Freeview has been helped by technical changes to improve the signal since its launch last year. All six digital terrestrial television multiplexes are available to around 73 per cent. of households.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para24">The enthusiastic take-up of digital makes the Government believe that switching off the analogue signals at some time is the right decision for the economy and viewers alike. Indeed, on 18 September my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry published a cost-benefit analysis showing that switchover will bring a quantifiable benefit of between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2 billion in net present value terms.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para25">There is still some way to go to convince people that switchover is the right thing, and this debate provides a timely opportunity to set out the arguments. First, we need to switch off because we can extend DTT coverage more widely because of the limitations of terrestrial broadcasting. Analogue is the incumbent mode of terrestrial broadcast, which means that analogue transmissions have exclusive use of channels that have been cleared internationally for full power transmission.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para26">Digital television uses the same spectrum as that used for analogue television, with digital transmission interleaved between the analogue services. That means <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 251WH</B></P>
that the number of clear frequency channels that can be used for DTT without causing interference with other services, nationally and internationally, is severely restricted.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para27">Those limitations mean that digital terrestrial cannot be extended until the completion of switchover. In planning the current DTT transmitter network, the broadcasters decided to concentrate on developing the 50 main transmitter sites and 30 of the larger relay sites, which would deliver the maximum coverage, given spectrum constraints. Inevitably, that means that at present rural and remote areas fall outside the scope of digital terrestrial coverage.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para28">Secondly, there is the cost of duplication. Broadcasters are spending significant sums on transmitting programmes in analogue and digital form. The terrestrial broadcast network will need major capital investment in the next decade or so. As the majority of households switch to digital, it makes less and less sense to continue with that uneconomic arrangement.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para29">The third factor is the sheer inefficiency of analogue broadcasts in spectrum terms. Digital transmission uses a fraction of the capacity of analogue broadcasts while increasing choice, giving access to interactivity and driving electronic programme guides to help viewers in a multi-channel environment. Switching off will allow us to work the spectrum much harder.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para30">We are clear, then, that the question is not whether we switch off analogue broadcasts&#151;that case has been made&#151;but when. We must ensure that digital is right for all viewers. That is why we have established a consumer experts' group to ensure that there is an effective conduit for working through issues affecting consumers. Ofcom also has a consumer panel, and it will be involved in the exercise, too.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para31">There are many other issues to be resolved before we can set a date. We are still on track for 2010, but progress depends on the response of consumers, broadcasters and other stakeholders.One of the tasks of switchover will be for broadcasters to produce proposals on the level of digital terrestrial coverage at switchover. Their decision will be based on a judgment about the cost effectiveness of a complete conversion to the 1,100 transmitters and the relays in the UK.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para32">The Government and Ofcom will need to review the broadcasters' proposals, and to consider whether sufficient provision is made for those who have no access to digital terrestrial. We will consult on those proposals next year. The points that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute raised about switchover will be factored into that consultation. The decision on when we move to switchover will be based on the outcome of that consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew11"><B> Pete Wishart  (North Tayside):</B> 
 Not much that the Minister has said will be of comfort to my constituents who cannot receive services. Would he be prepared to ensure that Ofcom provided satellite services if we do not make any progress on that issue in the foreseeable future?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew12"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
: Let me complete what I have to say, and then the hon. Gentleman may want to come back to that subject if there is time. What I have to say will probably cover his question.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 252WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para33">One of the main considerations will be the option of free-to-view cards when public service broadcasts are encrypted. That is a particular concern for people in remote areas who may only have access to satellite when switchover takes place.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para34">As has been said, in May the BBC decided to move its broadcast services from the Astra 2A to the Astra 2D satellite, and to enable consumers to receive BBC services in the clear without a viewing card. However, that new arrangement ended payments by the BBC to Sky for provision of Solus viewing cards to digital satellite viewers who do not have a subscription to a pay-TV service. A consequence of that decision was the problem of how access to the free-to-view commercial channels&#151;ITV, Channels 4 and 5&#151;could be maintained on the satellite platform. Sky made it clear that it was not prepared to fund supplying new viewing cards to Solus card viewers, but said it would facilitate a new scheme.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para35">ITV, and Channels 4 and 5 have been working hard to develop a solution, following the representations made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Good progress is being made and we believe that the broadcasters are close to a solution. Indeed, today I am able to announce good news: they have made a deal. The details are not finalised yet, but we already know that those people who have no subscription satellite viewing card, and who wish to continue receiving the commercially funded public service channels without paying subscription to Sky or other broadcasters will be able to get a new card. They will be offered the opportunity to buy a viewing card for &#163;20 plus VAT. Those cards will last until Sky does another card swap-out, and for at least two years if the next swap-out is sooner than that.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para36">Channel 4, ITV and Channel 5 are contributing hundreds of thousands of pounds to cover the overheads of the scheme. Sky is not expected to disable existing cards until the new scheme is up and running. All the affected viewers&#151;those who have not received new viewing cards from BSkyB because they are not current subscribers&#151;will be alerted to the new scheme through an on-screen message, which will direct them to the call centre where they will be told what to do. Those on-screen messages should appear on Monday 27 October or the following week on 3 November. We believe that is a good outcome. It has not been easy to achieve and I want to take the opportunity to thank the broadcasters for their hard work in coming to that solution. We are aware of other issues affecting rural television coverage and those are concerns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew13"><B> Mr. Reid </B> 
: The announcement that the Minister has just made about the &#163;20 plus VAT charge, although a step in the right direction, is still not the ideal solution. The Government provide free television licences for the over-75s. Will they be consistent and offer viewing cards for free to the over-75s?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew14"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
: The difference between being 75 and over and living in a particular area is that of choice. People do not have a choice about being over 75. There is a rationale to the idea and if representations were made, it would be a decision for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is not a decision for the DCMS.
<P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 253WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="31021h05_para37">I was pointing out that the planning rules on the installation of dishes are too restrictive, especially for people living in national parks and other rural designated areas. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published a consultation paper in April outlining options for reform. I understand that the Scottish Executive are to publish a consultation paper shortly and we are also looking at other constraints affecting tenants, particularly those in public sector housing. Those points were raised, and the ODPM will produce a consultation paper.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para38">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute touched on television coverage being part of the wider digital divide. The Government are looking at several possible solutions, such as broadband aggregation and satellite broadband. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are committed to doing everything we can to stimulate the market. The Government have looked at the satellite platform's ability to offer an attractive consumer broadband solution either independently or as part of a combined digital television and rural digital package and that work is continuing. I hope that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will make representations to ensure that we get that right.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew15"><B> Hywel Williams </B> 
: I am still trying to take in the announcement the Minister made about those over 75. Will he answer a simple question? Does he mean that those over 75 will pay twice for the same thing?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew16"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
: There are two clear rules. One applies to those over 75, which was put in place by the <P>




<B>21 Oct 2003 : Column 254WH</B></P>
Government to ensure that they have access to television&#151;because of their age, income and circumstances a political decision has been made that they should have such access. That was made in its own right and on its own merits. We are discussing a totally different issue in this case&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> We are still dealing with those over 75, but if they live in certain areas, conditions apply there. That is no different whether someone is under or over 75. Anyone who is over 75 will deal with those conditions that apply for anyone who is that age in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew17"><B> Mr. Carmichael </B> 
: Why is someone who is over 75 and living in the west side of Shetland to be treated differently from someone over 75 who is living in Glasgow?

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021h05_spnew18"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
: The rules that apply for someone over the age of 75 do not change. If they live in certain areas where the same conditions apply to everyone, 75 and under, or those over 85, they will still get what any other over-75-year-old will get via that Act. That concession has been made.
<P>

<a name="31021h05_para39">The problems of rural coverage cannot be resolved separately from digital switchover. It is not sensible to improve analogue services when an increased number of householders are voting to go digital. Our framework for switchover will ensure that people in rural areas who receive public service broadcasting channels on analogue&#151;BBC1 to Channel 4, S4C and Channel 5&#151;have access to those public service channels when analogue is switched off.
