<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Mr. Ainger.]</i>
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Nicholas Winterton):</b>  Before we start our business, I want to welcome hon. Members back to the House after the all-too-short Christmas recess. I wish everyone a happy, prosperous, peaceful and successful new year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para0">The first debate has been initiated by the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn), the subject of which is clearly popular. Many hon. Members are present in the Chamber and quite a number of them have notified me that they wish to speak. If they are relatively self-disciplined, I will try to include as many of them in the debate as possible.
</p>



<a name="50111h01_time0"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew1"><b> Lawrie Quinn  (Scarborough and Whitby)</b>  (Lab): It really is an honour to be granted the first debate in Westminster Hall in the new year. I wish to reciprocate on behalf of all hon. Members in the Chamber in sending our best wishes to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to all the staff of the House for the healthiest and happiest of new years. It is clear from the number of colleagues who have joined me this morning that a popular subject has been granted for the first debate of the year. Given the wide geographical representation in the Chamber, we know how important community railways are to the nation. I shall limit my remarks to allow as many hon. Members as possible to raise the specific issues affecting the many local routes that they represent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para1">Last week, I was reminded that the new year of 2005 is the 40th anniversary of the infamous work of Dr. Beeching and, in a personal context, it is 25 years since I started my railway civil engineering career, before entering the House of Commons in 1997. I hope to steer the debate with due reference to both anniversaries and to what have been the seven happiest and fruitful years of my life as one of the joint chairman of the all-party railways group of which you, Mr.&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, are an active member.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para2">What Dr. Beeching did 40 years ago was fundamentally a major error. Such action was pessimism over optimism and a pessimistic assessment of how much the rail network deserved to survive. Today&#039;s debate will link back to what has happened during the past 40 years and will demonstrate how far the potential for community railways can be taken.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para3">Community railways are really about local people and partnerships. In my constituency of Scarborough and Whitby, the Esk valley route from Whitby to Middlesbrough through the North Yorkshire moors national park, the North Yorkshire moors railway and the route along the Yorkshire coast from Scarborough through Bridlington to Hull are good examples of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
type of railways that we shall be considering this morning; it is a list of railways that Dr. Beeching did not manage to cut. Given such an historic context, we must define what is meant by a community railway.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para4">In the 1950s, significant parts of the network were being closed as the spread of the private car and the lorry took away much of the local railway&#039;s traditional business. In 1963, the Beeching report concluded that about a third of the network should be closed along with many local stations on main lines. The programme was vigorously pursued for five years against strong community opposition. In 1968, it was evident that such an approach could not continue and the policy started to change. The then Transport Minister, Barbara Castle, introduced a subsidy payment for services that did not quite pay their way. It reflected the gap between income and costs and recognised the social and political value of particular local lines. Later, it was consolidated into the passenger service obligation grant under the Railways Act 1974, which lasted until it was replaced by franchise support mechanisms and payments on privatisation between 1996 and 1997. The recent work by the Government and the Strategic Rail Authority responds to the situation today and seeks to repair the historic trend of decline and ultimate closure of our important local community routes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para5">The community rail development strategy, which was published last November, follows naturally from those historic strands. It is based on the wishes of the communities served by key lines around the country to remain connected to the national rail network and on the concept of a different category of local railway, separately specified, with standards appropriate to its use. It builds on the wishes of local communities to be actively involved in the development of their railway. Essentially, it is about putting those lines on a sustainable basis by bringing costs and income closer together. It recognises that continued subsidy will be required and needs to be commensurate with the value of the railway to the community in terms of economic development, accessibility, social inclusion and the environment, as well as fitting in with spatial development plans and fulfilling a role as backbone of local public transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para6">The strategy provides the first opportunity for many years&#151;perhaps 40 years&#151; to consider the development of community railways in their own right. Previous policies focused on principal routes or market segments, with little regard paid to the effect on local and rural railways. Fares and standards are often a by-product of decisions made to meet the needs of main lines, but the new strategy provides an opportunity to consider separately the unique characteristics of the much-loved and much-valued community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para7">Many hon. Members have discovered first hand from debates and visits by the all-party railways group as well as recent sittings of the Transport Select Committee, how important the community railways are to local people. When I have finished speaking, I hope to hear wider contributions from the Floor to support the arguments for many valued local railways from all over the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para8">As I look forward into the new year, the outlook for rural railways is positive. Publication of the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s community rail development strategy on 22 November last year, with the Secretary of State&#039;s 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
strong support, was a turning point for rural and local railways in the United Kingdom and perhaps helped to define the new concept of community railways. The new policy suggests development of more lightly used lines in a sensible, cost-effective way, Every Member of the House must applaud that. It will also help to reduce operating costs and to drive up use and revenue. That is important for this sustainable objective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para9">The proposals include seven demonstration projects, and I am pleased that the Esk valley route in my constituency is one of the seven routes. Those projects will provide practical experience of the best ways of achieving the goals set out by the strategy. I hope that every Member of the House will play a full part in becoming involved in the projects in their own localities to ensure that that is delivered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para10">Fifty-seven routes have been identified as suitable for future community rail designated routes and perhaps operating standards can be simplified, as is common in other parts of Europe. It is fair to note that much of the policy that has been developed during the past decade or so has its roots, in terms of best practice, in Germany and Scandinavia. I am pleased that many hon. Members have been able to see that work in practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para11">The key component of the strategy is the community rail partnerships. They have been extremely successful in winning new business for the rural railways. I believe that the SRA&#039;s statistics confirm that. The partnerships bring together local communities, local authorities and the railway industries, with the shared goal of improving service and driving up the use of rural lines. Many of them have been effective in bringing in external funding for projects, including station improvements and extra train services. They go beyond the simple transport agenda and link into wider strategies for accessibility, rural regeneration, social inclusion and sustainable tourism. A growing number are structured as social enterprises and generate some of their resources from practical initiatives such as on-train catering services and events, running feeder bus services, organising community car clubs and consultancy services&#151;all good examples of the type of work done in the Esk valley.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para12">Despite that positive background, media coverage of the recent launch was mixed, to say the least. Where local journalists had been briefed and were aware of the work of their local community rail partnerships, the coverage was positive and well informed. However, that was not the case with some national newspapers. That led to scare stories about closures and a Beeching mark 2, which undermined the strategy&#039;s positive message.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew2"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/ Co-op): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the negative coverage was not helped by the remarks of some in the upper reaches of government about transporting round the country large volumes of fresh air? Does he also agree that, if the SRA brief were widened from its laudable aim of improving the revenue from and usage of existing passenger rail lines to include the restoration of passenger services such as the national 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 4WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
forest line in north-west Leicestershire and south Derbyshire, that would also be worthy of attention and investment?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew3"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : Indeed, it was remarks of that kind that generated the interest and were one of the reasons why I applied for this debate. I wanted to ensure that the Government gave us the positive answers that I optimistically expect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para13">At the heart of this matter is the concept of partnership working. Without doubt, the sense of partnership that has been generated owes a tremendous amount to the Association of Community Rail Partnerships, led by Paul Salveson. It has done an excellent job by facilitating the involvement of many local railway support groups, local authorities and individuals in the development of this new policy. The association has already responded to the negative general media coverage of the strategy and has tried to stress the positive way forward. I hope that this debate will enable us to put the record straight about what we mean by community rail partnerships and the objectives that hon. Members seek for their local railways and the national transport network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para14">The strategy is supported by a wide range of organisations with a long record of supporting rail and public transport&#151;Transport 2000, Railfuture, the Rail Passengers Council and many local user groups. I hope that that will reassure anyone who thinks that the strategy is about cuts. It is not; it is about driving up revenue through greater use and looking at the scope for reducing costs where possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para15">I thank Mr. Speaker again for being so all-knowing about the importance of this debate. With it, the Government have an opportunity to give the positive response that I am sure we all want to hear.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston)</b>  (Lab): I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for introducing this important debate. Does he agree that an important facet of the Government&#039;s response must be the flexibility to allow the community partnerships to develop around the markets that apply in their areas? In my constituency the north-south Bidston-Wrexham line, which can be developed for commuter and leisure activities, is quite different from the lines that run east-west, which could see significant freight development.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew5"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : Indeed, that sentiment is at the heart of the community rail development strategy published by the SRA in November. The strategy tries to provide local solutions and to focus on the fact that each local railway is a separate entity that needs local solutions.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ronnie Campbell  (Blyth Valley)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate, because it is important, especially in our area&#151;south-east Northumberland&#151;where there were a lot of pit closures a few years ago. Those closures mean that everybody now has to move out of the area to find jobs. The problem in our area is that there is no transport except for buses. However, there is also a rail link, which is dormant. As we said, that is unfortunate, as rail 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 5WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
linkage would get people from the areas where the coalfields used to be to the Tyneside conurbations, where all the work is now.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew7"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : My hon. Friend may remember that I spoke on the subject in his constituency some years ago. I believe that, if fully implemented and developed, the community rail development strategy, above all through community partnerships, but also through closer working between regional and local authorities, offers hope that the type of initiative that he wants will eventually be brought forward. This is the start of a marathon march of policy development. It will be extremely important for many local communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para16">We have heard the keenness of many colleagues to intervene on the debate. Their interventions and their presence in the Chamber shows the strong support for community rail development strategies around the country. It also shows what positive examples there are in the local areas of the 60 or so railways around the country. I hope that every Member of the House will commit to support the maintenance and development of railway services in their constituency and nationally, just as my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) has.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bob Laxton  (Derby, North)</b>  (Lab): I share my hon. Friend&#039;s view that there is a good&#151;indeed excellent&#151;future for community railways. Does my hon. Friend share my concern that, at the same time that the Government introduced the Railways Bill, which includes abolition of the SRA, the SRA published a report about the community rail development strategy? I have some concerns about a railway service that runs through my constituency in Derby.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. Interventions should be brief. They are not speeches.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Laxton </b> : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The railway service in question runs predominantly through the constituency of the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin). Traffic on that railway has grown by 15 per cent. Like many commuters, I have some concerns about the future of that railway service.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew11"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : I think that that particular train was well out of timetable, but I agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s point. As my speech comes to its conclusion, I want to put some key questions to the Minister. I am sure that we are all interested to hear the Government&#039;s response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para17">I was talking about the direct role that Members of Parliament can play in their local community rail partnerships and how, if such partnerships have not been formed, hon. Members can help form them in their area. I have played a small but, I hope, significant, role in supporting the work of the Esk Valley rail partnership in the past eight years or so. Given my expertise of the rail industry, I hope that that has been a positive contribution to the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para18">It is worth noting some heroes in that area. On behalf of the Esk valley railway development company, I pay full tribute to the original development officer, Neil Buxton, who handed over to his successor, Tony Smare, in 2003 after many years working with the local 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
community to sustain and build the community rail partnership&#151;a partnership that saw groups such as the women&#039;s institute and local parishes work closely alongside the county council, the North York Moors national park and the North York Moors railway to sustain and in some senses take ownership of those vital community assets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para19">My first-hand experience of working with the Esk valley railway development company allows me to focus on three key work streams that are important in my locality&#151;marketing, rail operations and infrastructure. Those are significant and important because the franchise has just been transferred in my part of the world and there needs to be continuity of working to ensure that the good work that has been invested over many years is not lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para20">I pay tribute to Network Rail, in particular, for working in partnership with local groups and the local newspaper, the <i>Whitby Gazette</i>, to recognise the importance of renewing the final mile or so of track into Whitby to improve journey times, rideability and the overall performance of an important piece of railway that had seen little attention since those black days of Beeching.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Denis Murphy  (Wansbeck)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that the demise of Railtrack will improve the opportunities for introducing new passenger rail services such as the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell)? Were it not for the incompetence of Railtrack and the fact that the SRA diverted the vast majority of funds to improve the west coast main line, by now we would probably have had passenger rail services running on the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew13"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : As my hon. Friend and many in the House know, I spent the last days of my career as a railway civil engineer working for Railtrack. I believe that the attitude and community focus of Network Rail, and the fact that it is prepared to work with community groups in community rail partnerships, demonstrates that there is a different, positive attitude. I urge him to become involved, if he is not already, in forming a rail partnership for his location.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para21">The Esk valley line has been much improved and there is hope that in February&#151;a few weeks&#039; time&#151;there will be a multi-million pound investment in the renewal of the final piece of track, brought about by a community partnership.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew14"><b> Judy Mallaber  (Amber Valley)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend share the concern that has been put to me by the friends of the Derwent valley line, which affects three hon. Members present in the Chamber, that the abolition of the Countryside Agency raises some doubts about the funding of such partnerships and how they will continue to pursue the valuable work that they do?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew15"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : My hon. Friend tries to prevent me from closing my more parochial remarks, but I am coming on to some key questions that I am sure that all hon. Members want the Government to answer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para22">I hope that the Minister will restate the Government&#039;s full support for the strategy and the intention to transfer it, with all its formal powers, to the Department for

Transport once the SRA is wound down. I hope that she will express support for community rail partnerships across the United Kingdom and for the work of the Association of Community Rail Partnerships, which is the national federation of community rail partnerships. I hope that she will include a commitment to maintain Government funding for ACoRP once the SRA and the Countryside Agency funds cease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para23">The commitment to the development of a rural rail network, which we all want to see, will bring great benefits and give community rail partnerships throughout the country greater confidence, and enable them to understand better how local circumstances can bring about much-needed change and the flexibility that we have heard about in some of the interventions, and how they can improve and extend services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para24">I hope that I shall be able to tease a reassurance out of the Minister that the proposals set out in the Railways Bill do not herald a systematic closure programme. Any future proposed closure programme should take account of the important social exclusion issues that we have mentioned briefly this morning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para25">We need to hear about the Government&#039;s commitment to get the best from rail and complementary transport in rural areas. There is much scope to develop many of the integrated bus and rail links, as well as to promote walking and cycling to stations. In rural areas, particularly national park areas&#151;such as the one in my own constituency&#151;the spread of public transport is very thin, and it makes obvious sense to ensure strong integration between bus and rail to maximise the potential of the network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para26">This year will present a number of challenges to the community rail partnerships and to the Association of Community Rail Partnerships. The Countryside Agency and the Strategic Rail Authority have been major funders of vital work and of community rail partnerships. Both organisations will be wound down this year, and their funding support will cease. It is essential that ACORP should continue to develop its positive work with the rail industry and the Government. The funding gap must be bridged and properly filled. What has been achieved so far has come from a real sense of partnership, and I pay tribute to what has happened in Scotland and Wales, where generous support has been provided to community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para27">In conclusion, not only the future development of transport links but the vitality and economic regeneration of communities such as Scarborough and Whitby depends on good transport links and good access to the rest of the country. The strategy, when it is fully developed and given its head with the voice of local people at the forefront, will create the prospect in my area and many others of reopening many of the missing railway links that were axed by Beeching 40&nbsp;years ago. One such important link is the eight-mile route from Pickering to Rillington Junction, which offers the revitalisation of transport from Whitby, in my constituency, to the city of York.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para28">It is extremely important that we have reassurance from the Government. I commend the work of the SRA in introducing this strategy, and I pay full tribute to

Mr. Chris Austin, the executive director of community rail development, who said in a covering letter to the SRA that was also sent to all hon. Members:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Success will be seen as a railway which is sustainable and which contributes to a vibrant local and rural economy, as well as helping to meet Government targets on accessibility, the environment and social inclusion.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para29">I hope that the Government believe that, and that the Minister will confirm it during the debate.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : I repeat my request for very short speeches, and I ask the Front-Bench spokesmen to shorten their contributions, because many hon. Members wish to speak.
</p>



<a name="50111h01_time1"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew17"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead)</b>  (Con): I note your request that we make short speeches, Mr. Deputy Speaker, given that the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn), who opened the debate, has spoken for almost one third of the time available to us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para30">I want to speak about two lines in my constituency, the Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley lines. They are both designated in the Government&#039;s plans as future community railways&#151;a proposal that has caused much concern to my constituents and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Henley (Mr. Johnson) and for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), both of whom are actively taking up this cause on behalf of their constituents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para31">I begin by saying that I have no problem with the concept of the community railway. I am sure that there are lines in the country for which the concept is right and entirely suitable. It will be appropriate to designate such lines as community railways; the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) has spoken lyrically about his own Esk valley line. However, I do not believe that such a designation would be appropriate for heavily used lines that form major parts of the commuter railway network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para32">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby referred to lightly used lines. In its consultation document, the Strategic Rail Authority discussed lines that were local and rural in character. The two lines that affect my constituency&#151;Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley&#151;are not lightly used. In peak hours, they are a main part of the commuter network and carry residents from Wargrave, Cookham and Furze Platt into Maidenhead and Twyford, on to the main line and then, predominantly, into London Paddington, although some people commute west. The lines are heavily used in peak hours and it would not be appropriate to designate them as community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para33">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby paid tribute to the role of the Strategic Rail Authority in bringing forward the proposals. That authority, which was set up only four years or so ago by the Deputy Prime Minister, is now being abolished by this Government. The abolition of the SRA means that the responsibility for such decisions will fall to the Department for Transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para34">The question for my constituents is whether they can trust this Government to look after the future of their heavily used branch lines. From their experience of this Government&#039;s transport policy, their answer must be a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 9WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
resounding no. Anyone who tries to fit on the 7.27 from Twyford to Paddington on a weekday morning&#151;courtesy of this Government&#039;s change of our local railway franchise from Thames Trains to First Great Western&#151;knows that. Sadly, our local commuter lines are being pushed to one side in favour of long-distance trains. What does that say about the future of branch lines such as Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew18"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b>  (Con): Does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the reasons why none of us trust the proposals is that they represent a classic smoke-and-mirrors effort by the Government to shift the subsidy that they have been giving to community rail lines on to local authorities, without giving those authorities any extra money? The case is made&#151;no one can trust the Government on this issue because they are seeking simply to shift the responsibility and any blame for problems on such lines to other agencies that do not have the necessary funds.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew19"><b> Mrs. May </b> : My hon. Friend is absolutely right. This is yet another example of how this Government all too frequently shift the burden of responsibility on to local authorities but do not follow that up with the necessary funding. The idea that a community rail partnership would take over the running of the Maidenhead-Marlow or Twyford-Henley lines, with all the funding responsibilities that that would bring, causes significant concern among my constituents. They feel that the only outcome will be reduced services&#151;particularly peak-hour services&#151;and that this is about nothing less than future closure by the back door.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para35">The Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s consultation paper on the proposals suggested that a community rail partnership would not be suitable for high-frequency railways; in fact, it designated as suitable low-frequency railways with hourly or less frequent services. In peak hours, the Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley lines have half-hourly services, and that fact on its own shows that they do not fit the criteria set by the Strategic Rail Authority for community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para36">As I have said, there may well be railways that the designation fits, but I do not believe that the two lines affecting my constituency are such railways. They are used heavily by commuters in peak hours and by schoolchildren travelling to local schools. We want people to use those railways because doing so has many environmental and social advantages. They are heavily used at the moment, and it would not be appropriate to hand them over to the local authority. In the case of the Maidenhead-Marlow line, the local authority&#151;the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead&#151;could not even respond to the consultation document on community railways; local authorities are not the best bodies to run community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para37">I can only think that the Government have a long-term plan to cut back on the branch lines and to reduce the subsidy. That will lead to reduced services and, in the end, to cuts by the back door. As one of my constituents said in the local paper, at least Beeching was honest about what was being done. I fear for the future of those two lines as a result of the designation, and I urge the Government to remove the Maidenhead-Marlow and Twyford-Henley lines from the proposal to designate

them as community railways. My constituents need those lines, and the Government need to respond to their concerns.

<a name="50111h01_time2"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Colin Pickthall  (West Lancashire)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) on securing the debate, which is of great interest to all of us. Like probably everyone else, I want to be very parochial in my remarks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para38">Initially, I was very interested&#151;almost excited&#151;by the ideas in the document about community rail partnerships, because they seemed to give those in my part of the world a good opportunity to get a grip on rail services that are, for reasons that I shall give later, inadequate. However, I was depressed by the response given to the document by the local ginger group, a very good and active group with which the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) and I have a great deal to do: the Ormskirk, Preston and Southport Travellers Association. It immediately responded to the proposal as if it were the death-knell of those railways specified as being suitable for community rail partnerships. Perhaps the group had been talking to the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para39">West Lancashire has three rural railway lines: Southport to Manchester or Wigan; Liverpool to Preston via Ormskirk; and Liverpool to Wigan via Kirby. Those are all local and rural lines, but obviously they also connect substantial conurbations. There is nothing better than an hourly service on the lines&#151;when the trains turn up, that is. All three lines are on the list as being suitable for community rail partnerships, and I would very much like them to be taken over by a community partnership as soon as is reasonably possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para40">Two of the three lines are broken, in that the electrified parts of the lines from Liverpool end in Kirby and Ormskirk. Passengers have to transfer from those lines to diesel lines to make the rest of the journey. There are 11 small stations and halts. The largest community in my constituency is Skelmersdale, which has 40,000 people and is growing rapidly. It has no rail link at all to the rest of the country, even though the Liverpool to Wigan line runs along its borders, only about a mile away from the town centre. For many years, we have sought to link up Skelmersdale with the railway world, but we have failed. I hope that the community rail partnership will be a way to secure that link.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para41">The Ormskirk-Preston and the Southport-Wigan lines cross at right angles in the town of Burscough. There are two stations in Burscough, and they are a mile apart. In the pre-Beeching days, those two lines were linked by the famous&#151;in my part of the world&#151;Burscough curves, so it was possible to make an almost right-angle turn in Burscough, and go from Liverpool to Southport, or from Southport to Preston, via Burscough. The track for those lines is still there, and there is a great feeling in the district that they should be reopened; the cost would not be too terrible. There is a big debate to be had about that, but it would fit in the category of restoring the curves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para42">The community rail partnership, if properly handled, could be of immense benefit. First, it could link Skelmersdale; secondly, it could bring back the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 11WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Burscough curves; and, thirdly, it could create a more rational timetable. One reason why the lines are underused is that there are hardly any late-night services and none on Sundays. In the villages and hamlets where there are stations, young and elderly people in particular are isolated and cannot get into any of the large towns 15 or 20 miles away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para43">Station accessibility could be tackled. Several stations are impossible to get into with a pram, or if one suffers from mobility difficulties. It has been suggested that unused or underused station buildings could be put to multiple uses, and that would be wonderfully appropriate for many small stations. A community rail partnership could advertise the lines and the places that people could get to. I am also interested in the Cumbria coastal line, but I do not have the time to talk much about that now. Virtually no work is being done, and has not been for 20 or 25 years, on advertising the places that people can get to on that line&#151;the Lake district and the coast. As a result, it is terribly underused.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para44">Will the Minister say a little more about precisely what the simplified operating standards would mean? What will they involve and how would they save resources? Will she say something about the variety of lead organisations that might be appropriate for involvement in partnerships? There is a very active local strategic partnership serving the whole of west Lancashire. Would that be an appropriate forum to pursue these ideas?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para45">I had a lot more to say, but a large number of people want to speak and I will close my remarks with those questions.
</p>



<a name="50111h01_time3"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew21"><b> Hywel Williams  (Caernarfon)</b>  (PC): I congratulate the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) on securing this important and interesting debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para46">I want to speak on behalf of my own line, which is the Cambrian coast line, which runs from Pwllheli in my constituency to Machynlleth. It stops at busy little stations in Porthmadog, Bermo and various other places on the way down, as well as many romantic and windswept halts on the seashore of the west coast of Wales. The line was first mooted to be a link with Ireland, in competition with Holyhead, which had to face the little difficulty of crossing the Menai straits&#151;which it does magnificently, of course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para47">The line has faced many perils over the years, including marine boring insects, which were a threat to the bridge at Bermo and, most important, the threats posed by Beeching, who closed the vital 16 miles between Afonwen and Caernarfon. That prevented travel from the south and west of Wales to the north of Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para48">The Cambrian coast line is part of the network. It is a community railway in terms of the infrequency of the service, the fact that it serves a rural community and the fact that it provides travel for tourists, but it is also part of the network. I know that my colleagues on the Cambrian coast forum would want me to emphasise that. It is a busy local forum, made up of local representatives from the councils and also my hon. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 12WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). We see the Cambrian coast line not only as serving our local community but as the link to Shrewsbury, Birmingham, London and beyond, as well as to south and west Wales. I want to emphasise to the Minister that it is part of the network, even though it might appear to some to be a quaint, romantic and perhaps even Ruritanian little line out in the west of Wales.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para49">My second brief point is in respect of the School Transport Bill, which we discussed some time ago. The Cambrian coast line carries 250 school students every day. It is probably the only practical way that some students can attend the schools in Porthmadog and in Harlech. The line derives about &#163;109,000 a year as a direct result of its use by school students. I want to emphasise to the Minister that when guidelines are being drawn up for the preparation of school transport schemes the rail element must be given proper consideration, particularly in respect of my line. I am sure that the local forum will be discussing that with the national Executive.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Charlotte Atkins) </b> : I understand that the hon. Gentleman has written to me about that issue and I have responded. He will receive a response in writing very shortly.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew22"><b> Hywel Williams </b> : I thank the Minister for that intervention. I am sure that there is great scope for using community rail lines for school transport and I commend such use to hon. Members.
</p>



<a name="50111h01_time4"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew23"><b> Ross Cranston  (Dudley, North)</b>  (Lab): I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) for taking the lead nationally on several health and safety issues and on this issue. I wish to talk about the matter in a slightly different way and deal with the rolling stock that is used on community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para50">The black country has always been a centre for technological innovation. In particular, Parry People Movers, which is mentioned in paragraph 2.5 of the document, has been developing rolling stock for versions of light rail in recent years. I should declare an interest, as several close friends and members of my immediate family have small investments in John Parry&#039;s company. They have made a social investment from which they do not expect any immediate return.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para51">The forms of light rail carriages that have been developed have great advantages. They cause less pollution, use less energy and have high-performance acceleration and braking systems. They do not have to be segregated from the surrounding environment with, for example, fencing, and are less costly to run. However, I wish to raise four points about some of the difficulties.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para52">The first difficulty is up-front investment for innovative technologies such as this one. The National Audit Office report on light rail in April last year mentioned the need for up-front investment. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to identify&#151;perhaps later&#151;where funding might come from. For example, could the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 13WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Energy Saving Trust&#039;s powershift programme, which applies to buses, cars and so on, also be used for light rail?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para53">The second issue&#151;improving value for money&#151;is referred to in paragraph 1.8. The strategy document says that further research is required on rolling stock value for money, lower costs for ground-level boarding and so on. I urge my hon. Friend to arrange for such research to be carried out as soon as possible so that there will be no impediment to community rail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para54">The third issue relates to specifications for rolling stock. As I do not have time, I shall not go into detail, but there have been great difficulties in meeting some of the specifications, which historically focused on high-speed rail. Applying them to the development of rolling stock for community rail has been difficult. The strategy document says that the standards should be as flexible as possible and appropriate to the routes. I urge the Government to ensure that the specifications are flexible, to match a more flexible railway.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para55">The final point is about interchange with other forms of transport. The Brierley Hill metro extension, which will affect my constituency, relates to community rail in that heavy rail freight will run over part of it. There is a need for flexibility. Incidentally, I urge the Government to approve funding for the Brierley Hill metro extension by the summer. Everything is now in place, but, again, there must be a more flexible approach to linkage with other forms of transport.
</p>



<a name="50111h01_time5"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew24"><b> Mr. Patrick McLoughlin  (West Derbyshire)</b>  (Con): I wish to make just a few comments. The line I want to talk about has already been referred to by the hon. Members for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton) and for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para56">The way in which the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) started his speech was quite telling. He began by saying that he was very excited when he first heard of the community railway idea, but then became very depressed by the reaction to it. I wonder whether that is not something like the experience in respect of what we hear from the Government. An idea starts off, and, yes, we may all agree with it and agree that there is some logic behind it. But we are haunted by the Chancellor&#039;s words: we cannot believe a word that they say. He said that of his neighbour, and the truth is that the British public are now saying it of the Government. That is why there has been a great deal of scepticism, to put it mildly, about what community railways are all about and what they will actually deliver.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para57">I have received a letter from the friends of the Derwent valley line&#151;as, obviously, have other hon. Members. I want to discuss that line because it serves an important part of my constituency. It goes from Derby up to Matlock. It includes the stations of Matlock Bath, Cromford, Whatstandwell, Ambergate, Belper, Duffield and Derby. A good half of that line&#151;the section from Ambergate&#151;is on the same line that is used by inter-city railways. Virgin and Midland Mainline use it for their main services. The line is designated to become a community line&#151;it is not in the first seven, but it is one of the other 57 lines that we have heard about. Who will have the priority on it, if it is designated as such? That worries me.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 14WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para58">The concerns expressed to me by the friends of the Derwent valley line have a lot of legitimacy. There is much concern about what will be the consequences of the Government&#039;s overall proposals for the line, and also about what will come out of the Railways Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para59">We have heard lots of comments this morning about the Strategic Rail Authority and its published document on the community rail development strategy. The Government set up the SRA, and they are now abolishing it in the Railways Bill. When the Deputy Prime Minister set up the SRA he informed us that it would be the answer to all the problems facing the railway industry, and the present Secretary of State for Transport has told us that the Bill is the answer to all the problems currently facing the railways. Therefore, it is not surprising that the British people are sceptical about what the community railways policy will actually deliver.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para60">The hon. Member for Amber Valley and the friends of the Derwent valley line have mentioned the abolition of the Countryside Agency, and the fact that future funding for the community rail partnerships in general and the Derwent Valley Rural Transport Partnership in particular is not guaranteed after 2005. I want the Minister to assure us that that funding is secure, and that finding that money will not suddenly fall on any of the relevant councils&#151;Derbyshire county council, Derbyshire Dales district council, Amber Valley borough council or Derby city council. It would be a travesty if the funding were not in place and we were expecting any of those councils to find that money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para61">We all know about the problems with regard to local authority resources. There has been an increase of 15 per cent. in passenger traffic on the Derwent valley line in the past six months. The areas that the line serves attract many tourists in the summer months, as well as at other times of the year; lots of people go up to Matlock and Matlock Bath. The Minister&#039;s constituency abuts mine and she knows the area well. We also have a huge number of visitors to the Peak district. Therefore, there is a lot of pressure on the roads and urban transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para62">Today seems to be a transport day in the House of Commons. There is not only this debate but a debate on road safety this afternoon in the main Chamber; the Railways Bill is also being debated in Committee. There is a lot of attention on transport today, but there is also much concern. I have not had enough time, but I want to ensure that the Minister has time to respond to some of the interesting points raised by many hon. Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para63">There is much scepticism about the underlying motives behind community railways. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) said, there is a case to be made for them in certain areas where the railway interferes with no other lines. I am concerned about the Derwent valley line&#151;particularly about whether a community railway or one of the larger companies, such as Midland Mainline or Virgin will get priority when they operate on the same tracks. My constituents are also concerned about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para64">Whenever there is any threat or change to the railway service&#151;there was a possibility earlier this year that some services would be removed&#151;that issue fills my postbag. I thought that the Government wanted to encourage people to use the railway. That is what they say, but they must give assurance that they are not putting services at risk.

<br>

<a name="50111h01_time6"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew25"><b> Judy Mallaber  (Amber Valley)</b>  (Lab): Just briefly, following on from previous points, I ask the Minister for some reassurances about the clauses of the Railways Bill on railway closures, because they are causing some anxiety in relation to the development of community railways and particularly the Derwent valley line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para65">I ask the Minister to consider the different uses of railways in the future development of the railway service. Commuters have expressed their concerns to me about whether services on the Derwent valley line might be lost from Standwell and Ambergate into Derby and into Belper. However, that line is also important in the economic regeneration of the midlands. The Derwent valley has world heritage status and it is essential that we develop the railway line further. The partnership that we have had up to now has done well, in conjunction with Central Trains and the county council, in developing and expanding traffic on that line, and it will expand in future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para66">I am a great supporter of community transport buses and getting more money into such schemes and of the tax regime under which they operate. In this situation, however, we have to consider community transport in terms of the railway. The A6 is the main road through Derby and is used for everything: lorries use it, tourists do too, and so do those of us who dawdle behind the tourists trying to get to Matlock to visit the county council buildings. The A6 is a wonderful route that is also used by bikers and it even has helicopter signs, because the bikers are monitored from the air. We cannot afford to expand buses on that road as the main form of transport to meet all those needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para67">I hope that in the development of the railway lines and this policy my hon. Friend the Minister will consider how to develop a range of uses in different areas. The Derwent valley line is valuable. It has a great deal of local support and we want to ensure that the proposals put forward are advanced positively to meet the various needs in our area.

<p><a name="50111h01_spnew26"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b>  (Lab): I want briefly to mention the Bedford to Bletchley line in my constituency, which has an active rail user group that has worked with the local authority and the train operator, Silverlink, to grow custom on that route. Can the Minister confirm the suggestion in the SRA&#039;s rail strategy document that it would be possible for the Bedford to Bletchley rail link to join the Bicester to Oxford route, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)? Those two rail links are part of the Oxford to Cambridge route that was shut&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down by Dr. Beeching and are part of the wider east-west rail link. If they could join in a single community rail partnership, it would benefit them, would be helpful in reopening the closed section of line between Bicester and Bletchley and would contribute to the reopening of the Oxford to Cambridge link.
</p>


<p>

<p><a name="50111h01_spnew28"><b> Dr. John Pugh  (Southport)</b>  (LD): I will be brief, because the Minister has a lot to respond to. I congratulate the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) on securing this important, wide-ranging debate that started in Westminster and seems to have covered all stations north.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para69">No one can be against the objectives of the Bill&#151;increased use, costs down, less subsidy and, generally speaking, a new approach. Community ownership is a fine phrase. The new approach defined by the SRA involves a series of desirable moves, such as the use of other funding sources&#151;although some of the funding sources specified in the paper that it prepared seem a bit optimistic. The paper mentions better marketing, integration, flexible fares, boosting secondary sales such as cinema tickets, food and additional products that can be sold as part of the package, links with tourism and events and more flexibility. None of us would object to having nicer, better looked-after stations and realistic and appropriate engineering standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para70">None of the proposals are objectionable in principle, and none of them are impossible on a larger scale. On lines such as Mersey Rail a lot of co-operation takes place with the local community over events programmes, although that line is not designated for community rail partnership.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para71">I accept that we are dealing largely with a dysfunctional and disjointed system. Despite the good prospectus, there is suspicion about the Government&#039;s zeal for community rail partnerships. That is despite their protestations on that score, notwithstanding the remarks made by the Department for Transport about moving air around the country. Many of the lines are believed to make heavy losses, although in the SRA paper a community line is not by definition a line that bears heavy losses or incurs big expenses. I suppose that suspicion is exacerbated by the fact that the Railways Bill, which is being debated in Committee as we speak, contains an inordinate number of clauses about closures. I suppose also that part of the suspicion lies in the fact that some of the ideas have evolved from communities&#039; attempts to save railway lines under threat. It is relatively easy to parody the plan under discussion, seeing it as the gradual handing over of the line to anoraks while reducing funding&#151;a kind of Beeching mark 2, with all the subsequent economic and social damage, which is never properly weighed up with railway closures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para72">None the less, my personal position is one of slight ambivalence. I am not convinced that everything recommended in the paper by the SRA can necessarily be dismissed. There is a lack of clarity about what a community rail partnership is, and the consultation documents provided to the SRA say so. We are unclear, and we will still be unclear after today, about how the cocktail of funding will work. There is a lack of clarity about the true cost of the existing lines. It is unclear how liabilities and assets will be dealt with, because some community rail partnerships will inherit track that has been recently renovated, which will be run at a low cost. Other partnerships will inherit substantial and heavy costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para73">It is unclear how community rail partnerships will work in the wider industry, which everyone acknowledges is fairly fragmented. It is also unclear how 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 17WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
partnerships are going to get out of hock to the train operating companies and the rolling stock leasing companies, which have a licence to print money whether community rail partnerships exist or not. It is fundamentally unclear how the partnerships will avoid having responsibility but little control and possibly less funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para74">I remain suspicious about designation, which is the process whereby some rail lines are being designated suitable for community rail partnerships&#151;an issue brought up by the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May). In the north-west, the Southport to Manchester airport route is designated as one for community rail partnership, which is particularly interesting to me. In recent SRA documents, routes to airports are regarded as fundamental to the further development of the strategic rail network&#151;not a small local issue but a major part of our transport infrastructure. None the less, other routes in the north-west&#151;the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) mentioned the Ormskirk to Preston line&#151;are almost tailor made for a community rail partnership. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am involved in a project to develop a railway line in that area and to install a curve in Burscough&#151;I hope to see that some day&#151;which will link Ormskirk, Preston and Southport. That would change Merseyrail from a radial structure to a far more profitable loop structure and it could be done with very little cash. Small change from the tram scheme for Liverpool would do, or even the tea money from Crossrail; either would adequately accommodate such a scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para75">Progressing the scheme is extraordinarily difficult; one needs to speak to Network Rail, the Strategic Rail Authority, the train operating companies, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority&#151;which is pretty encouraging&#151;Lancashire County Council, the regional development agency and the Government office for the north-west. It is like knitting fog. It takes an extraordinary act of faith to believe that the creation of a new partnership will make life easier. None the less, it might.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para76">There are doubts about the programme and what the Government are endeavouring to do, and those doubts have been voiced by many hon. Members. Is the proposal really about a sustainable future for community lines, or about winding up lines that have no future? I suspect that it is both.

<a name="50111h01_time9"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spnew29"><b> Mr. Christopher Chope  (Christchurch)</b>  (Con): This has been an excellent debate, and I, too, would like to congratulate the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn). At the beginning of the debate, there were 22 people in this Chamber, including you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the Government Whip. That shows the great interest in the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para77">We can divide the contributions into those from Members on the Government side, which were basically centred on naivety, and were made by hon. Members who have, so far, been taken in by the Government&#039;s spin, and those from Conservative Members, which were perceptive. My right hon. and hon.

forced to close. Not surprisingly, the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats and is their sole representative here, describes the position as ambivalent; there is nothing new about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para78">The proposal is essentially another attack on rural Britain. One needs only to compare the subsidy going into rural community railway lines with that going into London buses, let alone the London commuter rail network, to see the enormous disparity. The Government connive at putting &#163;1 billion of subsidy a year into London buses, yet they seem to resent &#163;300 million in subsidy going into the national network of community railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para79">My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), in a succinct and pithy speech, put her finger on the key issue: the proposal is about future closure by the back door. If not, why is the line that she mentioned, which is heavily used by commuters during the day, to be included in the community rail network without local people having the opportunity to veto that? My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) talked about smoke and mirrors and about not being able to trust the Government, a theme taken up by my hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin), who has the Derwent valley line running through his constituency. I understand that that line has attracted a large increase in passengers in recent months.

<p>
<a name="50111h01_para80">We Conservative Members are concerned about the gap between what the Government say and what is actually happening. When launching the Government&#039;s new vision for rural railways, the Secretary of State for Transport said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Rural railways are important to many parts of the country.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para81">We all agree with that. He went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We want more people to use rural railway lines and the development of community railways is a vital part of that.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para82">My right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight), who cannot be in two places at the same time, would usually have dealt with this debate, but he is dealing with the Railway Bill Upstairs. He asks&#151;and I certainly support his point&#151;why the Government&#039;s Railways Bill is making sweeping changes to how community railway lines can be closed in future. If the Government really are interested in promoting community railway lines, would not it be great to have a Bill that dealt with making it easier to open railway lines where demand existed? There is not much chance of that from a Government who have kicked almost every project for expanding railway capacity into the long grass.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para83">Unfortunately, the Railways Bill is about making it easier to close, not open, railway lines. It is also very much about ensuring that if they are closed, someone other than the Secretary of State will take the blame.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para84">The railway network has remained roughly constant in size since the 1960s. It is widely assumed that the Government&#039;s latest wheeze, dressed up as the community rail development strategy, is little more than a smokescreen behind which Ministers are trying to conceal a new round of savage rail cuts. I remember the Beeching cuts; at the time, I was none other than the secretary of the railway society at school, so I felt very strongly about them. I have had a continuing 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 19WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
interest in the maintenance of the railway network since those early days. We know what happened then, but I cannot cope with the fact that the Government are not prepared to come clean about their intentions. They are disguising their true intent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para85">The community railway development strategy transfers more responsibility for financing rail services to passenger transport executives&#151;although it does not transfer any extra money to them&#151;while simultaneously taking away from those executives their role in determining which local rail franchises should be awarded. To provide extra local services, a PTE must get approval from Network Rail, which, as we know, is not an easy task. No such problem arises if the local PTE wants to cut a service&#151;what a surprise. In that case, it is free to switch the spending to other transport modes, as the White Paper delicately puts it. That means a bus. Although Network Rail is allowed to block the provision of new train services if some of its engineers want to do that, there is no comparable hurdle to starting a new bus service, however congested the roads that service may have to use.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para86">An interesting insight into where the Government&#039;s sympathies lie is provided by the fact that when new rail services are considered, the extra infrastructure costs and compensation to other operators must be calculated in advance and paid by the local passenger transport executive. In the case of new road surfaces, however, such considerations apparently do not apply. That is described as &quot;streamlining&quot; in the White Paper. That really means that the Government want to shift traffic from trains to buses, but do not want to say so. Most of all, they do not want to take the blame for the rail closures that they are secretly planning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para87">We are not against flexibility in facilitating decisions about new forms of transport service, but we are utterly against a policy of closure by stealth, which has been designed to ensure that when closures are carried out, the local passenger transport executive will be blamed when the Government are actually responsible. We share the concerns of PTEs throughout the country about the way in which the Government are removing some of their powers. Kieran Preston, the chairman of the Passenger Transport Executive Group has said that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;it makes no sense to hand over the planning and management of regional rail networks to unaccountable civil servants in Whitehall who lack the local knowledge and expertise&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para88">We have had a good debate. It is important to put pressure on the Minister to answer some of the points and give some of the assurances that hon. Members have sought. We want community railways to have as much freedom as possible to increase their passenger numbers by coming up with their own schemes. We are inherently in favour of freedom, enterprise and decentralisation&#151;they are inherent parts of our policy. That is not the way the Government are going. They have an agenda to close down many rural railway lines by stealth, which is why we are grateful to the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby for giving us the opportunity to express those views. I hope that all of those who switch in due course from the naive to the perceptive category will seize the opportunity to press their arguments home on Report of the Railways Bill.

<a name="50111h01_time10"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Charlotte Atkins) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Lawrie Quinn) on securing the debate, which has generated a huge amount of interest. We have had a wide-ranging debate, and I could not possibly attempt to respond to every local issue raised. However, I shall undertake to write to hon. Members giving detailed responses to the points that they have raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para89">As the House will be aware, the Strategic Rail Authority published its community rail development strategy in November last year. The strategy aims to put local and rural railways on a sustainable basis for the long term, by increased ridership, freight use and net revenue, keeping managing costs down and the greater involvement of the local community. It is based on the premise that the closure of lines is not desirable nor a solution to the problems that local lines face, irrespective of what hon. Members may have read in certain sections of the press. I can assure hon. Members that the strategy is aimed at increasing rail use and developing the railway to the benefit of the communities that it serves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para90">The strategy has been developed over 18 months. It involved an extensive consultation exercise in February last year, which drew responses from more than 300 organisations and individuals, including local and regional authorities, regional assemblies, regional development agencies, the rail industry, tourism bodies, Members of Parliament, rail user groups and a host of other bodies and individuals. By and large, the objectives and approach advocated in the consultation document were supported overwhelmingly by the respondents. There was an almost universal agreement that no single approach can be adopted nationwide, as many hon. Members have said today. Instead, appropriate local solutions would have to be encouraged within a broad framework.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para91">The final strategy was published in light of the responses received to the consultation. It lists 56 routes that the Strategic Rail Authority proposes to designate as community rail lines. Those local and rural routes make up about 10.5 per cent. of the national rail network, including 390 stations. There is evidence of latent demand for the lines and the argument for their retention and development is therefore compelling. It is one that is supported fully by the Government. To achieve the objectives of the strategy, there will have to be active support from a wide range of stakeholders, including train operators.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew30"><b> Mr. McLoughlin </b> : The Minister may not now know the answer to the question that I am about to ask, so I should be grateful if she would let me know it in due course. Of the 56 lines that have been designated, how many have lines that are part of the inter-city network? I am concerned about the Derwent line in that a large part of it is dominated by the inter-city network and I am worried about the priority that the community lines would receive.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew31"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : I cannot give a figure. However, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right about the Derwent line. I am aware of it; it is not too far from where I live 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 21WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and my constituency. There is a possible link between the Derwent valley line and Peak Rail, the heritage line at Matlock and, given that it is in the Peak district, there is clearly scope for the development of tourism along that line.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew32"><b> Dr. Pugh </b> : The SRA document contains a definition of a community rail line and a list of lines that are designated as community rail lines. Are there any lines that fit the definition, but that are not on the list?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew33"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : I am not aware that that is the position, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para92">To achieve the objectives of the strategy, there will have to be active support from a wide range of stakeholders, including train operators, Network Rail, local authorities and local users working in partnership.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew34"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): The Minister referred to local authorities and stations. Obviously, a key issue is station reopenings or, indeed, openings. Local authorities often put money forward with the rail authorities for that to happen as such action is expensive. Some new designs for platforms are being produced. Is the Department for Transport encouraging such designs and does it regard that as helpful research?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew35"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : We always want to ensure that stations are accessible. Many issues concern the inaccessibility of stations, especially when we are discussing tourist lines. It is difficult to make arrangements for people with access difficulties at local stations, so we are keen to make sure that we make stations far more fit for purpose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para93">Although the characteristics of the 56 proposed routes vary, they all have the scope for greater community support and greater development. The strategy is designed to improve the value for money and social value of the lines in three broad ways, the first of which is through increasing patronage and income. There are many ways in which that can be achieved, such as raising the profile of the railway within the local community and through better marketing. There is a latent demand to be tapped, as demonstrated by the Bittern line partnership in Norfolk, where passenger numbers have increased by 162 per cent. since the establishment of the partnership.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew36"><b> Mrs. May </b> : The Minister refers specifically to the desire to increase patronage on potential community railway lines. At the moment, the Government&#039;s policy, as exercised through the SRA and Network Rail in the operation of franchises and timetabling, gives emphasis to long-distance services and is leading to a reduction in services on local branch lines and commuter lines. When will the Government reverse that policy? Without that reversal, she cannot hope to have the increase in patronage that she is talking about.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew37"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : I agree that there have been issues about the inter-city lines, for instance, taking precedence over local lines and I know that many Members have raised that matter, including in my area. We are looking at that.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 22WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para94">As the right hon. Lady has jumped up at this point, I will take on board the issues that she raised about the Twyford to Henley-on-Thames and Maidenhead-Marlow branch lines. She talked of the strategy being imposed on her local community. I assure her that local consultation will take place prior to the designation of any lines. We believe that there is scope for some operational improvements in Marlow in particular, where the current signalling is restrictive. By designating it a community railway, there is a real opportunity to make that a priority for attention. However, I want to make it clear to her and to other hon. Members who raised the issue that it will be down to local consultation and if the local community does not want such a designation, it does not have to happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para95">Returning to the points that I was making, the second key issue is to drive down costs. The key drivers of cost on the railway are the maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure, the lease charges for trains and staff costs. There is scope for reducing those outgoings on community lines through track maintenance strategies more closely aligned to the needs of the routes, through better use of rolling stock and competitive pressure in the rolling stock market, and through training staff with a variety of skills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para96">Assessing the exact costs of community rail routes is difficult because almost all routes are part of a larger network. More work is required on that issue and it will be carried out through seven pilot projects that the SRA has identified, including as my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby mentioned, the Esk valley line from Middlesbrough to Whitby, which runs through his constituency. That work will necessarily involve the support of Network Rail and the Office of Rail Regulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para97">Thirdly, the strategy relies on greater community involvement. That includes the industry working with local authorities and local users, and the establishment of community rail partnerships. Those are not-for-profit organisations that include local authorities, rail users, the train operator and often Network Rail. Some may also include local businesses, national park authorities or other local stakeholders. They are established by mutual agreement and run by a committee of the stakeholders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para98">Hon. Members have raised a number of issues. One of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber) related to the Countryside Agency. The Countryside Agency has funded ACoRP as a rural transport partnership project since 2000&#150;01. A number of Members raised issues about the future of rural transport partnerships and that programme. The programme was never intended as an initiative that would last for all time. Existing commitments will be met until the end of March 2006. At that point, the Countryside Agency will hand over its decision making to regional development agencies. Each RDA will determine the priorities for its region and will certainly give priority to such rural initiatives.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew38"><b> Mr. Boris Johnson  (Henley)</b>  (Con): On the subject of local community involvement, a question has formed in my mind relating to something the Minister said. If a community suspects that a community railway project is a back-door way of closing a line and that the cuts in subsidy entailed by the SRA paper will have that effect, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 23WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
how can it set about rejecting it? The Minister said that if, after consultation, a local community wants to reject it, it may do so; how, exactly, can that come about?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew39"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : If there is no local support, that will become clear during the local consultation process. Community railways cannot work unless they are actively supported by the local community. If that support is not forthcoming, they will not be able to proceed.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew40"><b> Lawrie Quinn </b> : The hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) intervened when the Minister was talking about continuity funding and the Countryside Agency. Did she say that that will be guaranteed until 2006, and what mechanisms does she envisage will be in place with regard to the more piecemeal negotiations with the regional development agencies for future funding?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h01_spnew41"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : With the ending of the Countryside Agency&#039;s responsibility, a number of programmes will be passed over to the regional development agencies. They will take responsibility for the rural funding and for developing the valuable initiatives developed by the Countryside Agency, such as the village partnership schemes and the rural transport moneys that go to parish councils.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para99">The strategy provides a framework for all these developments to take place. A route prospectus will be prepared for each community rail line to identify the opportunities for development, and any constraints on that, as well as the suggested time scale for implementation. The plan will be consistent with the SRA&#039;s programme of route utilisation strategies and regional planning assessments and, prior to publication, it will be discussed with all the key stakeholders, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 24WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
including the community rail partnership or the rail development company. An agreed plan, along with the associated consultation, will be a prerequisite to the formal designation of routes as community rail lines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para100">None of what is proposed in the strategy will change the principles of railway operation, and the safe operation of services will remain the overriding concern. However, designation of a route will allow for a reappraisal of the standards for infrastructure renewal and maintenance to ensure that they are appropriately specified for the route in question and to allow for a reduction in costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para101">The specification of service levels will remain the responsibility of the funding body&#151;in most cases the SRA or, in time, the Department for Transport. However, in the case of microfranchises, that body may be a local or regional authority. In both cases, the specification of service levels should be made in conjunction with the local community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para102">The regulatory cap on fares will be removed from community rail lines so that they can be determined locally in light of demand and, where appropriate, integrated with bus fares. Local promotional fares will be encouraged, as will improved methods of revenue protection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para103">The implementation of the strategy will at first be focused on the seven pilot projects. They have been chosen for their differing natures in order to demonstrate and test various aspects of the strategy. The detailed proposals for each line will be confirmed following local consultation and discussion with local authorities and the community rail partnership or railway development company.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h01_para104">This has been a useful debate, and I am grateful to Members for their contributions. I will write to Members who raised detailed points to ensure that they get a full response.

<a name="50111h02_time0"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Miller  (Ellesmere Port and Neston)</b>  (Lab): We now move on to an earlier form of transport, which the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) missed out of his list of the things that are happening today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para0">I welcome the opportunity to have this debate and thank my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) for his interest in it. With your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I shall allow him a couple of minutes to make points about the Gloucester museum; he has spoken to the Minister about that. I also thank the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) for his support today. He represents a constituency that is the home not only of Formula 1, but of the Stoke Bruerne museum. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff), my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) have also indicated their support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para1">The Boat museum, the National Water Maze museum and the Canal museum hold the UK&#039;s inland waterways collection, which includes the world&#039;s largest collection of historic inland waterway craft. That historic fleet is the greatest conservation liability: in a recent condition survey, more than half the boats were reported as being in a poor or very poor condition, and many more need restoration to bring them back to conservation condition. The broad beam barges are the rarest and at greatest risk, as they are much less common than narrow boats. The collection represents about 90 per cent. of the UK inland waterways collection&#151;some 14,500 objects, including 80 historic inland waterways craft. It is the largest such collection in the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para2">The Waterways Trust manages and co-ordinates the waterways archive, which holds 80,000 records at Gloucester docks, Ellesmere Port and 13 local authority public records offices. Together, the collections and archive records provide the most comprehensive and complete record of the social, economic, technological and cultural story of inland waterways from the 18th to the 21st century. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister agrees that the collection is of national importance and that, whoever picks up the bill, it must be preserved and available to the public. It represents an important part of our national heritage.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Frank Field  (Birkenhead)</b>  (Lab): May I emphasise how widespread the interest is in this debate? I have had correspondence from people in Birkenhead who, although they do not have an immediate relationship to such a site, are passionately interested in the issue and the outcome of the debate.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Miller </b> : The canal network provides not only an important piece of Britain&#039;s heritage, but a superb leisure resource, and the museums that I am talking about today provide a very important educational resource. My right hon. Friend is absolutely right: there is interest right across the country, including from you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although I know you have to be neutral today.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 26WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para3">The museums attract about 100,000 visitors per annum, generating &#163;1 million in gross income from admissions and trading&#151;retail, catering, boat trips and so on. However, that is not enough to cover the responsibility, which I touched on earlier, to conserve and interpret the collections. The museums do not receive core funding from the Government, but receive generous support, worth about &#163;4.50 per visitor, from British Waterways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para4">I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will correct the comments made by Lord McIntosh of Haringey, who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The implication of some of these questions is that there is no government funding for the Waterways Museums. That is not the case. The British Waterways Board gives the museums &#163;750,000 a year, which comes from its Defra funding.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>4 November 2004; Vol. 666, c.430.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para5">As my right hon. Friend the Minister knows, British Waterways provides the trust with &#163;890,000 a year, of which &#163;450,000&#151;not &#163;750,000&#151;is for the museums. That funding is not really from DEFRA, but is sourced from British Waterways&#039; commercial income. British Waterways also provides premises free of charge at Gloucester and Stoke Bruerne. At Ellesmere Port, the local authority provides the site without charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para6">The Waterways Trust has financed the annual deficit of more than &#163;60,000 a year for the past four years. Sponsorship from British Waterways is topped up by revenue earned from admissions&#151;some &#163;350,000 a year&#151;and secondary business in catering, retail and boat trips, which is worth about &#163;100,000 a year. In addition, one-off discretionary grants are received from regional development agencies and local authorities. My very small local authority of Ellesmere Port and Neston gives a grant of &#163;7,000 a year and Cheshire county council gives &#163;3,000 a year. Small grants such as that are also important. However, despite being designated as nationally and internationally important, the inland waterways collection receives no direct Government funding, in contrast with the National Railway museum, the National Maritime museum and the National Coal Mining museum, all of which receive Government subsidies worth between &#163;8 and &#163;19 per visitor and offer free admission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para7">In the past three years, changes in Government policy have worked against the financial stability of the waterways museums, which has resulted in the loss of about &#163;200,000 a year in income. That is the focus of our case. The impact on the market of free entry, which is very much welcomed by visitors to museums and a great credit to the Government, must be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para8">Competition from the free-entry museums was paralleled by a serious decline in visitor numbers at the three sites of 11 per cent. overall and 19 per cent. at Ellesmere Port in the year after free entry was implemented. Numbers have drifted lower in subsequent years and have just dipped below 100,000 visitors a year. That has had a major impact. Designation challenge funding, which provided the waterways museums with &#163;100,000 a year for three years, although not dead, does not provide core funding and I understand that there has been recent correspondence about that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para9">The waterways museums have been successful in raising capital grants&#151;nearly &#163;4 million since 1999&#151;and generating their own income of about &#163; 1 million a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 27WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
year gross. They make a significant contribution to the local economy. Spend per visit is about &#163;9 to the museum and about as much again to the local area. More than 10 per cent. of visits are education based and, having looked carefully at the quality of the material and its historical importance, I am convinced that that number could grow and that the relationship between our museums and the education sector could be strengthened.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Tim Boswell  (Daventry)</b>  (Con): I find myself entirely in sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments. Does he agree that the particular and almost unique character of the waterways museums is that they provide a fascinating insight to our economic and social history, which includes some quite under-privileged people, and the wider environmental impact of the canals?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Miller </b> : I could not agree more. Not only have the museums had an enormous impact on the development of our industrial heritage, but they have left a legacy that has an impact on society today to a degree that we take for granted. It is extraordinary that we have this fantastic resource in the United Kingdom, but allow it to go into decline. British Waterways has done some fantastic work, with Government support, to help to restore some canals, particularly for leisure purposes. A lot more can be done that will be beneficial to communities throughout the country&#151;not just in the three locations where the museums are. There is a huge job to be done by my right hon. Friend&#039;s Department, in liaison with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Education and Skills, to ensure that society gets the best from this fantastic resource.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para10">The museums cannot sustain their position with the loss of income that I have mentioned and a critical point has been reached. Some &#163;1.1 million per annum is needed for the next 10 years for the maintenance of the collection, to address conservation arrears and to enable the museums to offer free entry to all. Free entry sounds like a decline in income, but in my judgment and that of the experts on the trust it will generate a stimulus to visitor numbers. The nationally and internationally important designated inland waterways collection should by funded by the Government in the same way as other national collections, such as the railway, maritime and coal museums.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para11">New investment in the waterways museums can do much to help them to develop as centres of excellence for education, cultural tourism and public enjoyment. The museums have the capacity to double their visitor numbers and an economic value of about &#163;1.8 million could become as much as &#163;3.6 million, split roughly 40&#150;40&#150;20 between Ellesmere Port, Gloucester and the Daventry, Northamptonshire, location. Without action, these museums and the many treasures that they hold could be lost, which would be a huge tragedy.

<a name="50111h02_para12">The museums have the capacity to increase their secondary income from catering, retail and boat trips, but real growth will come once they have secured the future of the collections, which are the basis of their future attractions, and become centres of excellence for

conservation and learning. It is calculated that free entry alone will increase visitor numbers by as much as 50 per cent. We know that people will naturally and more readily go through the door if somewhere is free of charge than if there is a barrier of a charge on entry. The evidence is reasonably clear that where that approach is adopted, revenue generation can be increased substantially.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para13">During the years in which I have represented my constituency, which you know better than most people in the Chamber, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have been arguing passionately for stronger cultural and tourism links between the museum and the fantastic city of Chester. I firmly believe that there is a real commercial market out there for getting our American cousins and Japanese visitors, who come in their tens of thousands to the great city of Chester, to come and enjoy the boat museum. If any commercial tour operators are listening to the debate, I commend that idea to them, because there is the basis for a commercial operation.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): This is not tangential, but vital. Will my hon. Friend also pay due regard to the Waterways Trust for the campaigns it has run, which are all to do with seeing the heritage and wanting canals to be reopened so that people can continue to live the life of the canals?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Miller </b> : I agree with that sentiment entirely. Some restoration work on the canals that I have seen throughout the country&#151;for example, in my hon. Friend&#039;s area of Wiltshire and in Northamptonshire&#151;is splendid and has undoubtedly raised public awareness of the subject. In itself, that can act as a magnet to encourage people to dig a bit further. Properly structured museums that are tailored around that important educational niche can provide potential income for those museums and do a service to our young people. As I suggested, some imaginative tourism enterprises could be developed around the museums and the surrounding waterways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para14">My right hon. Friend the Minister may not be in a position to say yes&#151;which is the word we are looking for&#151;to all the demands being placed on her today, but in introducing the debate and before, with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, allowing my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester to speak, I must say that I hope my right hon. Friend the Minister agrees to work with colleagues in the Chamber, and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead said, with the many other colleagues from throughout the country who are interested in this aspect of heritage, to find a practical way forward in the interests of our national heritage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para15">The nation&#039;s industrial heritage&#151;built as it is on sea-going vessels, coal and the railways&#151;has another important strand, which is that of the canals. We should never forget the importance of the canal network in the development of this nation. It would be a tragedy if those collections were broken up or allowed to deteriorate, and I urge my right hon. Friend to do her best to help to deliver what we seek.

<p><a name="50111h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : The hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) has rightly sought the approval of the Member who introduced the debate, the Minister and the Chair to participate briefly in this half-hour debate. I call Mr. Dhanda.

<a name="50111h02_time1"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Parmjit Dhanda  (Gloucester)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall try to keep my contribution to no more than about 60 seconds, because I want to give the Minister time to reply. I concur with everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) said. We have been working on the issue for some time and I am pleased that the debate is taking place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para16">I also wish to thank some people, not least Roger Hanbury of the National Waterways museum, for everything that we have tried to do together on the issue. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) will join me in thanking the docks historian and secretary of Friends of the National Waterways Museum, Hugh Conway-Jones, for the work that he has done with us, as well as volunteers such as Audrey Fielding and many other constituents. The key thing for us in Gloucester, in Daventry and in Ellesmere Port is to ensure that the National Waterways museum can continue and can compete.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para17">We welcome the Government&#039;s decision to introduce free entry to museums. At the same time, we are concerned about the difference in subsidy between our National Waterways museum and that of the national railway, maritime and mining museums. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will consider seriously this request for an additional &#163;1.1 million. In Gloucester, that money is important not only for our heritage. More than &#163;1 billion is flowing into Gloucester docks for regeneration and we want to be able to remind the next generation&#151;because of tourism and education and because of their history&#151;why Gloucester docks are so important. A waterways museum is a key part of achieving that.

I acknowledge the importance of the issue, the huge campaign that has taken place during the past 12 months and the support for what is being asked of the Government today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para18">In some ways, the description that my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston gave of the significance of the waterways museums is a timely reminder of the importance of museums to our national life. They have an ability to contribute to education, remind us about our past, enable us to understand our present and shape our future, and take a key role in regeneration. All museums across the nation play that role in the life of the nation and communities, although that sometimes goes unrecognised. To some extent, the work that hon. Members and others have done in bringing the needs of the waterways museums to the nation&#039;s attention is a timely reminder of the significance of those museums.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 30WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para19">I am not here to argue against the needs of the waterways museums, to take away from the work that they have done or to fail to acknowledge their determination, effort and achievements to date. That goes without saying; I know that they are important. It is imperative that the collections that they hold are preserved, conserved and improved to ensure that not only our constituents, but their children and grandchildren, can understand the importance of waterways and the museums to our nation&#039;s development. For the sake of putting it on the record, I want to confirm the special place that they have in our nation. They provide the most comprehensive and complete record of the social, economic, technological and cultural story of inland waterways from the 18th century until now. As we have regenerated canals and waterways, the story is not yet finished; there is another story to be told.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para20">That is the good news. I have no difference of opinion over the importance of waterways museums, but let me be honest about the dilemma in which the Government find themselves. We are talking about a strange sector, in that it is not a planned sector. The Government have no control over how many museums are started. Every year, there are people who feel that they have a collection that they want to show to others and preserve for posterity, and they start a museum in their own home&#151;such museums exist. People might hire a small shop front and they have their museum. However, the Government can never respond to that haphazard growth in the number of museums by funding every one of them. I do not think anyone would expect us to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para21">Other things that are important to the nation, such as schools or hospitals, involve planned growth and planned arrival of resources&#151;revenue and capital&#151;to support them. The dilemma in which I find myself, as the Minister who is meant to be supporting the museums, is that they grow haphazardly and our budget does not grow to meet those needs. The result is that our funding structure, in which we give money to the museums, is sometimes not rational.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para22">This is a matter not of choosing the museums that are the most beneficial or most important to the nation and deciding to fund them, but of doing what we can, taking into account custom and history, and making the best of a museum sector that is both nationally funded and funded by local authorities, as well as by industry and trusts, but funded by no one independent museum itself.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para23">As hon. Members know, the Government have a direct responsibility to fund and care for a number of national museums. They are all set up in statute; there is a law of this land, passed by these Houses of Parliament, that gives them the status of national museum. This is not rational, however. They are the big museums that we all know about and they are often in London. The story of how they got to be national museums is also one of this nation&#039;s history and of the things that it valued in the past.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para24">We inherit an obligation to fund those national museums, but it is very expensive to do so. We take on our obligations, however, and &#163;284 million a year goes into funding those museums. The extra money that we have been able to put in has ensured that the collections are looked after and are world beaters. We should be immensely proud of them.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 31WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para25">The bottom line, however, is that the Government are not in a position to add to the list year in, year out. We simply do not have the money to do that. If we were to do it, we would be splitting the money&#151;that increased amount that the Government receive from the Treasury for national museums&#151;among more museums, and the consequence would be less money for each museum and poorer collections. I would then have to reply to lots of Adjournment debates on why national museums were getting less than before.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para26">I do not use that as an excuse; it is the truth. That is the dilemma that we face all the time. Therefore, I cannot say that we hope to take the museums on as a national museum. That is not to say that they do not have an important national collection, but having an important national collection is not the same as being a national museum. These are not the only museums that claim to have an important national collection and that want to join the national museums list. Without thinking very hard, I could name three other museums that believe they have national collections and that want to be added to the list in the run-up to the spending review. The Government have not embarked on inviting applications to the list.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para27">The Government acknowledge that to set things in stone&#151;to say that the list of museums that get all the money is closed for ever and a day&#151;is not helpful to the good work that museums do. Hon. Members will be aware of two things that have happened. First, the Government are putting money into regional museums through the renaissance in the regions programme&#151; &#163;45 million by 2007&#150;08. There will be opportunities for museums, including the waterways museums, to join the clusters of museums that are included in that programme&#151;perhaps not now, but the Government hope that that funding stream will increase as the years go by.

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para28">As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, the waterways museums have had designated funding of &#163;300,000 over three years. Bidding will open again for such funding in 2006, and the waterways museums will be able to take part. I acknowledge that that does not come anywhere near meeting the &#163;1.1 million revenue costs that the museums need&#151;not to survive, but to improve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para29">My hon. Friend will know that we have asked the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council to work with the Museums Association to see what can be done. We have taken that approach in a few other examples. In the north-west, it has already brought in&#151;not a lot&#151;&#163;50,000 from an overseas organisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h02_para30">Hon. Members are bound to ask that certain museums be allowed to join the list of national museums, as achieving that is a copper-bottomed guarantee that revenue and capital will be provided. They should continue to make such requests, but should not expect that to happen in the next few years. I invite them to continue to work with us so that we are aware of wishes to join the list, but they should not turn their back on other innovative ways of funding museums. To some extent, we are in this together, and we will do as much as we can to work with the waterways museums through the MLAC.

<a name="50111h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Immigration and Asylum</h3>

<a name="50111h03_time0"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight)</b>  (Con): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise such an important issue this afternoon. As opinion poll evidence shows, which I shall quote in a moment, our electors believe that immigration and asylum is one of the most important matters that affects society. The unprecedented level of immigration into this country is accompanied by a range of consequences, such as the polarisation of residents from 1 per cent. ethnic minorities in the New Forest district to more than 50 per cent. in Newham.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para0">Our failure to integrate ethnic minorities has led to the creation of an ethnic vote, which has been long exploited by Labour in our inner cities and brilliantly so against Labour during the Leicester, South by-election. It was put into overdrive by the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr O&#039;Brien), in his recent attempt to whip up Muslim sectarian feeling against my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), the Leader of the Opposition. The effect of the failure to integrate ethnic minorities is the creation of areas in our cities in which the English language is alien and the British culture subordinate. In the words of the Government&#039;s community cohesion panel, which reported in July 2004:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. concerns about the speed at which newcomers can be accommodated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The identity of the host community will be challenged&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The &#039;pace of change&#039; (for a variety of reasons) is simply too great in some areas at present.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para1">My first question concerns whether the Government encourage integration or multiculturalism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para2">Another objection people have to the high level of immigration is the apparently unfair treatment of the majority community. That was exemplified most recently by the different treatment by the Birmingham Repertory theatre and the BBC of the plays &quot;Behtzi&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer&#151;the Opera&quot;, which were perceived as deeply offensive to the Sikh and Christian religions respectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para3">While we are about it, on 26 December, <i>The Sunday Times </i>reported:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Inland Revenue is considering recognising polygamy for some religious groups for tax purposes. Officials have agreed to examine &#039;family friendly&#039; representations from Muslims who take up to four wives under sharia, the laws derived from the Koran.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para4">Perhaps the Minister is in a position to tell us that that was a Boxing day joke. It is not surprising that, when people consider that it might be racist to oppose such culturally unfamiliar concepts, they say that they are not ashamed of being called racist. People vote for extremist parties, and parties that while not extremist, are robustly unafraid of addressing race and immigration. Those are some of the consequences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para5">The final consequence is the huge pressure of overcrowding on public services and housing, in particular, in London and the south-east of England. Let no one say that such issues are not widely recognised. A YouGov poll showed that 74 per cent. of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 34WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
people believed that too many immigrants are coming into Britain. As <i>The Economist </i>put it a month ago today:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Londoners, young people and the middle classes can normally be counted on to hold more liberal views, but not, it seems, when it comes to immigration. Their sentiments are virtually identical&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A Eurobarometer poll earlier this year&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para6">last year, that is&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;found that 41 per cent. saw immigration as one of the two biggest problems faced by the nation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para7">Of course, the Prime Minister&#151;ever ready to launch an eye-catching initiative&#151;was not far behind. On 19 December, <i>The Guardian </i>reported:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Blair looks at points plan to outflank Tories on migrants&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Blair and his election co-ordinator, Alan Milburn, are said to be determined to show that asylum and immigration are under control&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sources said&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#039;We can&#039;t just sit there and say &quot;It&#039;s all fine.&quot;&#151;we look like an incumbent government that is just complacent. There is absolutely no desire to get tough just for the sake of it&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para8">My second question to the Minister concerns whether he is planning to get tough. If so, is that because he thinks that it is necessary to get tough or will he do so just to impress a concerned electorate? If he gets tough, what will he do to cut the numbers of migrants to these islands?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para9">Pressure on housing is overwhelming. Just before Christmas, I heard of a proposal to build between 14,000 and 27,000 new houses in my constituency, which would increase its population by 25 per cent. They would be part of the 1.2 million houses designated by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for the south-east and eastern regions. Those proposals are causing untold anguish and conflict, as well as the necessity for massive public and private infrastructure investment. They have, of course, been rejected both by the South East England and the East of England regional assemblies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para10">The proposals coincided with the admission by the Government for the first time that immigration will increase the number of households in England by 1.2 million over 20 years to 2021. That figure comes from a written answer in the House of Lords. That is double the previous estimate of fewer than 600,000, which was based on 1996 projections of migrant numbers. One in every three new households a year&#151;that is 60,000&#151;will be formed due to international migration; 55 per cent. will be in the three Euro regions of London, the south-east and the east. That is one of the most crowded areas in Europe. The rate of new household formation in London will be doubled from 26,000 a year to 46,000 a year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para11">Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is completely irresponsible for the Government to promote immigration without taking account of the resultant intense pressure on housing and public services.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para12">Therefore, my third question to the Minister is whether the effect on demand for housing was taken into account when formulating the Government&#039;s immigration policy. Do the Government accept that the consequence of increasing immigration is increasing pressure on housing in the south and east of England?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para13">Of course, we are not only talking about housing; other services are put under considerable pressure. There are some schools in London in which more than half of the pupils in the first year do not speak English. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 35WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Government do not collect those statistics, but some local authorities do. The Government do not know how many pupils at the age of five are able to be taught through the medium of English in our schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para14">There is pressure on hospitals and all the other public services. My constituents cannot get a dentist. Today, I received an e-mail from a friend in north Nottinghamshire who told me the same. He cannot get a dentist in that part of the world. That consequence cannot be detached from the large additional numbers of people depending on our public services.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b>  (LD): I am interested in this line about dentistry. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the decision of the previous Conservative Government to cut the number of dentists that we trained 10 years ago might have had a bearing on the availability of dentistry services for his constituents, in addition to any issues raised as a result of immigrants?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Turner </b> : It has had no effect whatsoever on the number of consumers of dental services. This Government, which has been in power since 1997, were aware of the previous provision for dental training when they took the decision to increase massively the number of people coming to this country.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mark Lazarowicz  (Edinburgh, North and Leith)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): If I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly, he told us at the start of his speech that what he described as the immigrant population of his constituency was about 1 per cent. Does he seriously suggest that such a small proportion could have the effect on the dental services in the Isle of Wight that he seems to blame upon it?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Turner </b> : Actually, I was talking about the population of a constituency on the mainland. The point is that people move. People are moving out of London to the rest of the south-east as more and more migrants move to London. People are also moving out of the south-east to constituencies such as Isle of Wight and those in the New Forest as more and more people move out of London to the surrounding counties. There is a knock-on effect; that is how I would describe it.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr. Desmond Browne) </b> : We should dwell on the point that my hon. Friend raised with the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman prayed in aid the absence of dental provision in his constituency, saying that it was a consequence of the Government&#039;s migration policy. Perhaps he could explain to those of us involved in the debate the profile of population movements in the Isle of Wight and how it relates to the Government&#039;s migration policy, so we can be reassured that the argument that he has advanced is germane to the debate.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Turner </b> : There is additional pressure on all public services as a result of there being more people in all parts of this country. I was going to ask why has there been such a massive increase in demand for public services, particularly housing.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 36WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para15">The Government have, as a matter of policy, allowed a huge escalation in migration. According to the Office for National Statistics, net migration to this country has risen sharply since the Government took office. In the years 1994 to 1997, the figures were 78,000, 48,000, 39,000 and 75,000, but from 1998 the annual net inflows were 100,000, 133,000, 176,000, 172,000, 153,000 and 151,000 respectively. Those figures no longer refer mostly to asylum seekers. Although asylum is still a problem, the number of regular migrants to the UK has, according to figures given to my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Rosindell) on 11 November, increased, with a dip only in the election year 2001, more or less regularly from 58,000 in 1997 to 140,000 in 2003.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gwyn Prosser  (Dover)</b>  (Lab): On the question of public services, particularly the national health service, we have heard a lot about numbers, but have we heard anything about the contribution that the migrant population plays in running those essential public services? Would not we be at a loss to run the public services we have today without them?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Turner </b> : The hon. Gentleman will hear much more about that. My dentist is South African and I understand perfectly the contribution that migrants make to running the public services. However, not all of them do so and I will demonstrate how many in a moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para16">Fourthly, was the growth of immigration from 1997 accidental or intentional? What was the justification for the growth that the Government put in train? Are the figures that I have already quoted good enough? The Government Actuary&#039;s revised projection of an inflow of 130,000 a year is 28,000 below the average for the past five years, so one wonders how he reached that projection. He takes no account of recent Government policies that are designed to stimulate immigration or of illegal entrants&#151;about 50,000 of whom are detected, so it is likely that a similar number will succeed and add another 500,000 people to each decade of the population estimates&#151;and he takes no account of overstayers. Some 70 per cent. of those refused asylum stay in Britain. There are simply too many scams that the Government seem unable to stem; they lack the will to inquire, the determination to act and the power to succeed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para17">I shall give some examples of those scams. The first is the student scam. Home Office immigration statistics document, Cm 633, suggests that the number of students who are allowed to extend their stay is so great that it amounts to another back door into the country. In the years 2001&#150;2003 alone 27,000 Jamaicans had their student visas extended, even though only 1,690 had been admitted and there were supposedly only 780 students here in the first place. Overall during that period, there was a 48 per cent. increase in student extensions and it is evident from the detailed statistics that extensions are most frequently sought by and granted to nationals of the poorer countries that generate most economic migrants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para18">Fifthly, how does the Minister explain the huge dissonance between the number of students and the number of extensions from each country? What is he doing to plug that apparent loophole?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 37WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para19">The second scam is the work permit scam. The so-called sector-based scheme was set up to permit unskilled young people from outside Europe to take up temporary employment in the food and hospitality industries for up to 12 months. Some 10,000 such permits were allocated to Bangladesh and the quota was filled within three weeks. The Immigration Advisory Service said in July last year that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;there is chaos in Bangladesh with disturbances, a sports stadium having to be hired to issue tickets for interviews, and a suspension of the scheme in April&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para20">The administrative cost of that scheme must have been colossal. However, more importantly, why was the scheme set up in the first place? Unemployment among young Bangladeshis already in Britain is 50 per cent. As Sir Andrew Green said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Surely the people already here should be offered these jobs, or should be trained to do them, before we add still further to immigration&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . There is absolutely no check on departure. This could well be just another example of immigration by the back door.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para21">My sixth question to the Minister is about why his former boss, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), said on 6 April 2004 that there was a need for immigrants to fill 60,000 catering vacancies in London. Why did Bangladesh receive an allocation under the food and hospitality sector-based scheme when many British Bangladeshis are unemployed and 75 million new EU citizens are eligible to work here? What was the cost of administering that element of the scheme?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para22">Finally, I turn to the effect of arranged marriages. One of this Government&#039;s first decisions was to abolish the primary purpose rule, which was designed to ensure that marriage took place between people who wished to spend their lives together, and not as a cover for immigration. Two ill effects have come from that decision. First, it has led to the abuse of the immigration process&#151;and I define it as a scam to that extent. Secondly, it has perpetuated the division of communities on racial lines, and that is not a scam but a danger.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para23">There are about 20,000 arranged marriages a year involving people from the Indian subcontinent, and young Asians in this country come under considerable pressure to undertake such marriages. A failed arranged marriage can mean not one but two people having the right of abode in the UK, each able to bring in another spouse in future. Even assuming that such marriages are genuine and sustained, they involve more rapid population growth than when both parties are from the United Kingdom. As Lord Ousely has reported:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;About 1,000 Bradfordian Muslims marry each year. If most of those marriages were internal to this country, it would lead to 500 new households which would be likely to average 4 children per household&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With 60 per cent. of marriages involving a spouse from overseas, the number of households goes up to 800 and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. family size is likely to be significantly larger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This leads to very rapid population growth&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para24">which,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;concentrated in particular areas puts severe demands on the public services.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para25">Furthermore, as fewer children are brought up in English-speaking households, fewer are ready for English-medium schools and fewer families integrate into the local English community, if one remains.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 38WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para26">The course adopted by Denmark and Norway, two countries of impeccably liberal traditions, is to tighten the rules for the admission of spouses and long-term cohabitants to ensure that both parties enter into their unions maturely&#151;over the age of 24&#151;and willingly; arranged yes, forced no. Secondly, in Denmark such marriages have to have a long-term stake in Danish society and be financially secure enough to support themselves. Thirdly and most importantly, to ensure that they remain together, permanent residence is granted only when the couple have lived together in Denmark for seven years. That system produced a 27 per cent. drop in the number of applications in the six months after it was introduced. My penultimate question to the Minister is whether he will consider what elements of the Danish system could be adopted to prevent abuse and to promote community cohesion.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : On that very point, I should like to ensure that a full picture of the Danish system is given. The hon. Gentleman may know that more than 1,000 couples of mixed nationality, including one Danish person, live in Malmo or the surrounding area in Sweden and commute daily to work in Denmark. The number of mixed nationality couples in Sweden is increasing at a rate of 60 a month, which is an unattractive consequence of the very policy towards which the hon. Gentleman is driving us.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Turner </b> : I am grateful to the Minister for that information. The bulk of the statistics that I quoted come from MigrationWatch UK, which has established an estimable reputation for objective measurement and observation of this important matter. In the past, the Government have slagged off its statistics as being unreliable. Fortunately, an unnamed civil servant said in an internal Home Office e-mail on 29 July 2003:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have made this point many times before but can we please stop saying that Migrationwatch forecasts are wrong. I have pointed out before that Migrationwatch assumptions are often below the Government Actuarys Departments high migration variant.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para27">My final question to the Minister is to ask him whether he still believes that there is something wrong with MigrationWatch UK&#039;s forecasts and statistics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para28">If we are to persuade the people of Britain, of all colours and creeds and, particularly, those who have such long-standing connections with this country that they have nowhere else to go, that we really are interested in their welfare, we must take action on all the fronts that I have described. If we do not debate the topic, we leave it to be debated behind closed doors on the basis of rumour and mystery. If we debate it openly and discuss it honestly, we stand a chance of making sensible decisions on how to deal with the issue which is of such concern to our constituents. If we do not, we risk driving them more and more into the hands of parties less scrupulous than those represented in this Chamber.

<p><a name="50111h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Mark Lazarowicz  (Edinburgh, North and Leith)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate today to raise one aspect of the immigration rules: visa charges for international students attending education in the UK. For the past 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 39WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
month or so, I have been trying unsuccessfully to secure an Adjournment debate on the subject, so I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) for securing a debate on a topic whose broad remit allows me to concentrate on this specific issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para29">Having heard the hon. Gentleman&#039;s opening comments, however, I was tempted to divert my comments in another direction. Although he has raised some valid questions, it seems to me that under the guise of telling us that he wants a serious debate on the matter, he is giving circulation to a number of anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant myths about the effect of immigration on public services and so on, which are entirely unacceptable. I shall be interested to see how the more liberal face of conservatism on the Opposition Front Bench distinguishes itself from the comments of the island backwoodsman who introduced the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para30">I shall not digress and will speak to the issue that I want to address and that has been a matter of concern to many organisations involved in higher education in this country, including Universities UK and the British Council. It has been raised directly with me by Edinburgh university students&#039; association and constituents of mine who work in the area. It is particularly relevant to cities, such as Edinburgh, that have a large student population, many of whom come from overseas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para31">The principle of charging for leave-to-remain visas was introduced in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and, as the Minister knows, there has been recent Home Office consultation on the matter, the outcome of which has not yet been announced. The big problem, as those who have been involved know, is that we charge those already in the UK who require leave-to-remain visas or extensions of such visas, to allow them to complete their studies. The charge is currently &#163;155 or &#163;250, depending on how the application is made, and, under the consultation, it could rise to almost &#163;500.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para32">The proposal is of great concern to the organisations to which I just referred. It certainly risks deterring overseas students from coming here to study. It is widely recognised that it is in the interests of the UK, and not just of the students concerned, that we should encourage international students to come here. In cities such as Edinburgh, overseas students and the economic activity that they bring with them is a major element of the local economy. The Prime Minister himself recognised that when he launched his initiative on international students in 1999 with the objective of attracting more international students to the UK and the long-term aim of generating long-lasting trade and diplomatic links for the UK. He rightly spoke at that time of the important contribution of international students and of the need for greater efforts to be made to attract more of them here.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para33">Many international students do not have to pay the higher charge for visas or visa extensions, but the evidence is that many do. Hon. Members may have received a helpful briefing from Universities UK, which is a highly respected organisation. It states that many entrance clearance officers do not seem to follow the UK Visas guidelines that they should give students leave to remain for the duration of their course plus at least several months when they first make application for a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 40WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
visa. As a result, although students get the benefit of the lower charge when they first apply from outside the UK, they have to renew their visa at the higher charge&#151;Members will understand that that is a potential deterrent to many students&#151;and international students who have gone into higher education from school or from further education, or who decide to remain as research students having completed an undergraduate degree here, may also be hit with the higher charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para34">Let me make it clear that I do not object to the principle of requiring those who apply for visas of any type to make a contribution towards the cost of administering the system, just as a UK citizen pays towards the cost of being issued with a passport. However, many organisations that are involved with international students believe that the Home Office would drive away thousands of potential international students from the UK were it to implement the proposals. To our short-term and long-term detriment, they would likely go to our competitors in Europe and elsewhere.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para35">My hon. Friend the Minister knows that this issue concerns many Members, particularly those such as myself with a significant further and higher education presence in their constituency. More than 70 MPs, including me, have supported the early-day motion of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell). It calls on the Government to grant an exemption from visa charges to international students studying in the UK. Even if the Minister and his colleagues are not prepared to go that far, I hope that they will listen to the concerns that have been raised by Members in this debate and by a wide range of organisations involved in higher education in the UK to try to ensure that we continue to make the UK attractive to the genuine international students, who contribute to our economy, to their education and to the economy of the countries from which they originate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para36">I value having had a few minutes to put those points. As I indicated to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, prior to the start of the debate, I hope to take part in the debate in the main Chamber later this afternoon. If by any chance the business in that Chamber were to proceed a bit more rapidly than it is at the moment, I hope that you and other hon. Members will understand why I might leave a little early and before the end of this debate.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Nicholas Winterton):</b>  Before I call the next speaker, I thank the hon. Gentleman for the courtesy of advising us of his situation.

<p><a name="50111h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. John Horam  (Orpington)</b>  (Con): First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) on raising the topic today. We ought to congratulate him doubly because, if I recollect accurately, the last time the subject was debated&#151; 18 March 2003, also in Westminster Hall&#151;it was he who raised it. I recall that debate well, because I had the pleasure of supporting him then as now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para37">Clearly, Isle of Wight and Orpington are linked in that one respect. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), who is on the Front Bench, pointed out that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight and I are entirely opposite in that I have

gardening down as one of my interests, while my hon. Friend&#039;s private interests include absolutely not gardening. But there we are; that is life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para38">I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight that this is an important topic that has, I am sad to say, been under-debated recently in the House of Commons, whatever view one takes of it. I agree with him that all the opinion polls show that the matter is of great importance to ordinary citizens. He will be interested to know that that is also shown by a poll that I conducted in my constituency&#151;with exemplary objectivity, I might add. Obviously, I did not know who would reply to my survey. It was not only conducted with exemplary objectivity, but took a very high sample compared with the opinion polls conducted nationally. Such polls usually have about 1,000 or 1,500 replies, but no fewer than 25,000 Orpington citizens received my survey.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para39">The survey absolutely confirmed what my hon. Friend is saying&#151;namely, that the subject is of high importance. Indeed, it came after only crime and antisocial behaviour, which were top&#151;not surprisingly, perhaps. Immigration was second, well ahead of health, education and transport, which would otherwise be considered very important topics. My localised survey entirely confirms my hon. Friend&#039;s general impression.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para40">The issue of statistics troubles us on such occasions. I readily admit that the whole business of trying to measure immigration is fraught with difficulty&#151;obviously, there is a great deal of illegal immigration of one kind or another, and it is difficult for statisticians under any Government to capture exactly what is going on&#151;but there have been various attempts to cast more light on the statistics, notably by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para41">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight will recall that the last time we had such a debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex had had an Adjournment debate the day before, in which he tried comprehensively to get at what exactly the figures show&#151;with scant success, I am afraid, as they reveal very little. That is for two reasons. First, it is inherently difficult to get at proper numbers, which I concede. Secondly, and frankly, the Government have created an atmosphere of suspicion about all Government figures because of how they have spun them over the past seven years. The Government are notorious for their spin, and statistics have been no exception to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para42">As we know, the Statistics Commission and the Audit Commission have both been extremely critical of the fact that the Government have handled figures in a political way over the last few years, which has done a great disservice to government as a whole, whoever is in power. As a consequence, people have lost confidence in Government figures on this or any other subject.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is about to move off the issue, but I cannot let him do so without drawing his attention to what I expect he already knows: in or around July, the Home Office invited the National Audit Office to audit the published immigration statistics. He will of course be aware that the NAO gave those statistics a clean bill of health, although it made a number of interesting and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 42WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
qualifying remarks about them. Consequently, on the basis of his own argument, he can now rely on those figures.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Horam </b> : I hear what the Minister says, but I remain suspicious of the whole subject, because as the Audit Commission and the Statistics Commission&#151;an independent watchdog&#151;had said previously, the Government handle statistics with considerable political spin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para43">I have for some time advocated that responsibility for such statistics should be given up by the Government. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor has recently taken this up. The responsibility for statistics of this kind&#151;whether they are from the Home Office, the Office for National Statistics or independent bodies or are general Government statistics such as those on waiting lists&#151;should be taken away from the Government and given to Select Committees of the House of Commons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para44">That would have two advantages. First, the process would be far more open and the Government would not have to make interventions of the sort that the Minister has just made to defend statistics because they would be open and there would be accountability to the House. Secondly, the scrutiny of the Executive by the legislature, which has not been a happy process recently, would be enhanced. We need to improve such matters, and making such a change is one way to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para45">It is inevitable that statistics from organisations such as MigrationWatch have far more credibility than those of the Government because they are making an attempt to take an independent view of the matter. We should be grateful for the views of MigrationWatch because it is making a considerable effort to get a clear picture of what is going on, including the difficult area of illegal immigration. Its figures, which I read from time to time and tend to support, state that there is a net immigration of about 250,000 people every year. Bromley, the borough of which Orpington is a part, has a population of 300,000, so that figure represents about two and half constituencies coming to this country every year, which is a huge proportion of the population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para46">As my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight said, those immigrants are mainly coming to England, particularly the south-east, and even more particularly to London. I am glad that the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) is here. If he were not, I would be the only London MP present. Perhaps he will have a countervailing view on the matter. I feel that London has a particular problem in this area, which we ought to address.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para47">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight made such a comprehensive speech that I do not want to cover all the ground, but I must comment on one area, which is the effect on housing. This is a very sore issue in an area such as Bromley, particularly in my own constituency of Orpington. Whole areas of south-east and south-west London have been inhabited for some time by people from other countries. I am thinking of an area of south-west London that is occupied almost exclusively by Koreans. Whole streets of houses are taken up by Koreans, all the local shops are run by Koreans and the schools mainly take Korean pupils. As a consequence, one of my friends has emigrated: he 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 43WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
cannot afford to buy a house where his father lives, nor can he afford to get his children to a school or find a school to take them, so he has gone to Australia. It is a sad fact that that is happening in this country in this day and age, and it is happening in London.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Turner </b> : He is welcome in the Isle of Wight.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Horam </b> : My hon. Friend says that he is welcome in the Isle of Wight, but the housing situation may not be much better there.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow)</b>  (Lab): I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman says about someone being unable to afford a house. That indicates that the area has improved immensely as a result of people moving to it.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Horam </b> : I think the problem is that houses are unavailable to people in that part of London&#151;I am thinking of Morden&#151;because they have been bought up by Koreans, whatever the price, and English people are priced out. That is what is happening&#151;<i>[Laughter.]</i> I do not think that it is a very funny matter. That effect percolates throughout London, particularly the south.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para48">The situation is bad and getting worse. A recent report in <i>The Times </i>said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Immigration is dramatically outpacing official predictions, the Government admitted today. Ministers now believe there will be double the number of foreign households previously predicted. More than half of the new arrivals are expected to settle in London&#151;with serious implications for housing.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para49">That is the point I am making. My own borough has been told by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to increase the amount of housing it is putting up, even though it is more or less doing so at its capacity according to its unitary development plan. In December, a report in the local paper stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Senior councillors fear the green belt could be under threat after being told to increase house building.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Planners on Bromley Council have been told by a Government inspector more houses need to be built.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Inspector Ava Wood, who heard the public inquiry over the borough&#039;s 10 year unitary development plan (UDP), also said density needs to be upped to fit more homes in.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para50">The report also stated that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the authority needs to set a target for affordable homes based on need, rather than capacity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para51">That seems to imply that it should build more than it thinks it can build if the need exists, which is an astonishing position for a Government to take.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para52">We know from the overall position of the ODPM that it received a report by Professor Barber that essentially said, &quot;Predict and provide,&quot; and the fact of the matter is that a great part of the prediction is caused by net immigration. My simple view is that if we could control immigration in the way proposed by the Conservative party&#151;there should be a quota for asylum seekers and less encouragement to economic migrants&#151;we would have a lower demand for housing and the possibilities for first-time buyers in the London area would improve.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 44WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : We have not had an opportunity to ask a Member from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party about the specific point of a quota for asylum seekers. Is it his position that if the most deserving case the world had ever seen for refugee status were to arise after the quota was filled we would have to say to that individual, &quot;Go back to the country you have come from and your almost certain death.&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew20"><b> Mr. Horam </b> : Absolutely. Our country is not the only country in the world. There are other destinations that that person could go to. There ought to be a rational way to sort out such situations. As the Minister knows, in recent years we have taken a disproportionate share of all the genuine asylum seekers, and that should not continue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para53">I strongly agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight in his third question to the Minister. What are the implications for housing, particularly in the south-east and London, of the current level of immigration? I believe that it is a major factor in creating social and family problems in London, and that it is a cause of immense distress. If we could get it under control in a sensible way, all those linked problems would be alleviated.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew21"><b> Mr. Lazarowicz </b> : I will try to take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s arguments at face value. Given what he says about the pressure on housing, if it were possible to do what he suggests&#151;I doubt that it would be&#151;what would be the consequences for the labour market of the failure to allow workers to come to this country to meet the needs of the economy? Would not that have very damaging consequences for his constituency, among many others?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew22"><b> Mr. Horam </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, because economic activity is precisely the ground on which the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Government justified the level of immigration, which they clearly think is acceptable, during the debate on 19 March 2003 in this Chamber, which I have mentioned. The Minister responding to that debate conceded that a lot of such economic activity figures reflect immigration by people such as high flyers in the City of London, rather than the mass of migration that we are talking about. That skews the economic effect of this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para54">One also ought to take a balanced position. Economic activity is only one part of the equation; the other is the environment and quality of life. We do not measure quality of life simply in terms of our standard of living. In my part of the world, quality of life is deteriorating as a consequence of the amount of development that is being forced on areas of south London by the level of immigration. That is a factor in the overall overdevelopment of areas such as mine. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) does not see that we have to strike a balance between the environment and quality of life on the one hand, and economic activity on the other.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para55">The Government are allowing this to happen and the Liberal Democrats, on the ground of economic activity, do not dissent, but that is mistaken in the short term and damaging in the long. Conservative proposals will not only command respect and support among ordinary people, but they are in the best interests of this country.

<p><a name="50111h03_spnew23"><b> Alistair Burt  (North-East Bedfordshire)</b>  (Con): I also thank and congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) on raising the topic. This is an extremely sensitive issue, which, if it is not debated here, is certainly going to be debated on the doorsteps in the months and weeks to come. It requires careful, sensitive handling and difficult questions must be answered. I appreciate the efforts of colleagues to do so in this Chamber.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para56">I do not want to follow the general argument, because I want to deal with a specific area of asylum policy. However, a couple of remarks about the statistics and how policy is put together may have some bearing on the worries that my hon. Friends rightly raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para57">I am sure that it will come as no great surprise to the Minister that I want to consider the situation surrounding the Yarl&#039;s Wood detention centre in my constituency, particularly the contents of the report by the Prison Service ombudsman on the incident and fire as long ago as St. Valentine&#039;s day 2002, but on which the ombudsman was only able to report on 16 November 2004. I am pleased to see the Minister; he bears no criticism for the matters that I will discuss, because he was not in place at that time. Since he has been the Minister responsible for Yarl&#039;s Wood, he has treated my requests for information and pleas on behalf of various detainees with nothing but courtesy, speed and dispatch, which I appreciate very much indeed. However, his Department has some considerable explaining to do, which I will make clear.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para58">On 16 November, in an answer on a 450-page report on a highly significant incident in which &#163;100 million of damage was caused and scores of lives were endangered, the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), issued a written statement, which I consider wrong. The statement made no admission of Home Office error and no apology for the circumstances, but the report indicates that the role of the Home Office was of immense significance in creating the problems that eventually led to the disaster.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para59">To put this matter into context, I shall quote from the conclusion of the report. The Prison Service ombudsman said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The targets underpinning the project were unachievable, the project was conducted under unreasonable time constraints, the design of the building was poor in terms both of construction materials and layout, speed of delivery was given undue prominence in the contract letting process, the contractors never looked likely to complete the construction within the agreed timescale, policies were ill-thought through and were inadequately consulted upon, and the incident that led to the disturbance was mishandled.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para60">That is a damning indictment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para61">I make six charges that I should like the Home Office to answer in due course. The Government are incompetent at handling a significant policy and they panic under pressure; they waste resources on an epic scale; they are incompetent in managing their agencies; their use of information for short-term political gain is less than trustworthy; they unfairly pressurise their civil servants; and they are careless with the lives and liberties of those whom they detain without trial or commission of crime. I shall illustrate those charges briefly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para62">On incompetence and panic, the circumstances behind the building of Yarl&#039;s Wood were rising numbers of asylum seekers post-1997, but relatively static 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 46WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
removal rates of about 7,000 per year. The report details the setting of an unachievable new removal target and pressure to get a detention centre built speedily, but there was no understanding of the consequences. It was a botched job leading to what the ombudsman describes as a building that was unfit for purpose and the subsequent disaster.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para63">The ombudsman says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There was of course no excuse for the actions of those detainees involved in the disturbance and the suffering and damage they caused. I have concluded, however, that what occurred at Yarl&#039;s Wood was the result of a series of decisions taken over the previous three years.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para64">There is a policy point: we cannot be sure that this Government get their policy right under pressure. Therefore, what assurance can the Minister give us that the policy failures in the assessment of the issues surrounding asylum and removals have been addressed, so that that sort of problem cannot arise again?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para65">Secondly, I charge that the Government waste resources on an epic scale. Yarl&#039;s Wood was significantly overpriced. The ombudsman details a memo from the Prison Service, which said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;My own view of the IND exercise is that if and when the NAO [National Audit Office] takes an interest they will have a &#039;field day&#039; in value for money terms.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para66">The report describes how the pressure of speed made it an overpriced contract. Premiums were added on and there was not adequate supervision. I have informed the NAO of that particular paragraph and I am interested in what it says.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para67">The speed also ensured that there was a failure to transfer the insurable risk from the public to the private sector, which has led to an ongoing dispute about the insurance. It might mean that the taxpayer bears a cost for the whole fiasco instead of the people who should have insured it. Again, that is an outstanding waste of resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para68">How have procedures changed in the Home Office to ensure that such a reckless and expensive response to a problem cannot happen again? Why were they not considered sufficiently significant to be detailed in the Home Secretary&#039;s statement on 16 November.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para69">Thirdly, I allege that the Home Office is incompetent in managing its agencies. I will give two examples. It was stated to my constituents at the outset that Yarl&#039;s Wood would be a relatively low-level security area and that no one who was a serious security risk or was dangerous in any way would go there. However, the report details how those who had been responsible for a riot and incident at Campsfield house shortly before Yarl&#039;s Wood opened were deliberately transferred to Yarl&#039;s Wood in breach of those undertakings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para70">It is also clear from the report that the Home Office did not know how many people were at Yarl&#039;s Wood on the night that we are discussing. Among his many expressions of astonishment, the ombudsman said that he was astounded that the Government did not know how many people they were in care of in detained circumstances in Yarl&#039;s Wood on the night of the fire. How can a Department be so incompetent in the management of its agencies? What action has been taken in the Home Office to investigate why so many errors were made in relation to the supervision of contractors and how can we be sure that that such a situation will not happen again?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 47WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para71">I allege that the Department is less than trustworthy in the use of its information, for short-term political gain. I am aware of the seriousness of that charge. The ombudsman&#039;s report describes the process&#151;if it can be called that&#151;to produce a removal target of 30,000 a year at a time when removals then stood at about 7,000 a year. The target was treated with great scepticism in the Home Office and by the various agencies involved in the removal of detainees. It inadvertently got into the public arena and a Home Office official, who is quoted in the report, apologised to a Minister by way of a memo on 7 June 2000 for having allowed such a high figure to get into public currency, because once it did, it gained some credibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para72">Despite that lack of certainty within the Department, on 23 March 2001, just a few weeks before the onset of a general election campaign, the then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), re-announced the 30,000 target in a Home Office news release. Indeed, it became a manifesto commitment. It was described by, among all newspapers, <i>The Guardian</i>. On 24 March 2001, it said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday insisted he would continue to maintain the pressure by making the return home of 30,000 failed asylum seekers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the focus of official efforts over the next 12 months.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para73">Immediately&#151;and I mean immediately&#151;after the general election campaign was over, the new Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), was advised by his officials that the target was unachievable. How can that sort of target, the subject of a general election campaign, become unachievable in a few short weeks? How did it become unachievable then, when beforehand, inside the Department, it had been known to be very suspect? I suggest that the carelessness with which the then Home Secretary used those figures was tantamount to a fraud on the electorate. I want to know from the Minister how such a figure, which was characterised with such concern inside the Department, became an official target when it had such a sceptical basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para74">My fifth point may give some indication of why that was the case: civil servants are placed under unreasonable pressure. A senior civil servant, the director of detention in 2001, is quoted in the ombudsman&#039;s report as saying that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;he considered the 30,000 target &#039;laughable&#039; and &#039;plucked out of the sky&#039;. This view was based initially on the views of experienced Immigration Service staff and very rapidly his own observations and judgement. He went so far as to describe the target as some kind of fantasy which you had to publicly acknowledge or you were branded &#039;not one of us&#039; and a &#039;troublemaker&#039;. Disturbingly&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para75">the ombudsman concludes&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;he said reasoned debate was &#039;forbidden&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para76">What investigation has taken place into allegations made by such a senior source? In his conclusions, the ombudsman drew attention to the climate in the Department. What evidence do any of us have that that climate is not still present? That leads to the suspicion about statistics and about everything else that we hear about. That is the concern behind the fact that that sort of pressure is placed on officials.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 48WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para77">My final point is that the Government are careless of the lives and liberties of those whom they detain without trial and who have not committed any crime. That is the story of the whole thing. For political purposes, a removals target was plucked out of the sky, put in a manifesto and driven by the Prime Minister&#151;whose personal involvement is also noted in the report&#151;when everybody else in the Government knew that it would not work. That only became clear immediately after the election when the then Home Secretary admitted a mistake. It was a mistake for which many hundreds of people could have paid for with their lives. That was the process described by the ombudsman.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para78">In conclusion, the story is appalling: detainees were let down; those responsible for them were let down; my constituents were let down; the emergency services that had to deal with the fire were let down and, to add insult to injury, were sued for the part that they had played. Local and national taxpayers were also let down, and the Government&#039;s response was a written ministerial statement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para79">I am certain that the Minister can do a lot better. I ask him to take this opportunity to apologise and indicate what the Home Office is doing to ensure that its part in the process that became the Yarl&#039;s Wood disaster is not repeated.
</p>



<a name="50111h03_time4"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h03_spnew24"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b>  (LD): I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) on securing this afternoon&#039;s exceptionally interesting debate. On seeing the title &quot;Immigration and Asylum&quot;, my first reaction was to observe that it is not always helpful in a 90-minute debate to lump the two subjects together, because they are very different. However, while listening to the hon. Gentleman and some of his hon. Friends, I heard a number of different issues being conflated. Perpetuating the supposed conjunction between asylum and immigration is the least of the difficulties that have arisen today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para80">The hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) said that this issue is under-debated, and he is right. Other hon. Members have highlighted the dangers of a lack of debate on such issues. There was a debate in this Chamber on 8 July, not under the heading &quot;Immigration and Asylum&quot;, but on the Home Affairs Committee report on asylum applications. It was held at the conclusion of an extensive, exhaustive and evidence-led investigation by the Select Committee. The manner in which the issues were dealt with on that occasion&#151;my recollection is that the Minister was also present &#151;benefited from the opportunity enjoyed by members of the Select Committee to go out and learn for themselves, at first hand, the extent and nature of the problems that people undoubtedly face.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para81">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight made his opening remarks and went on to speak about the problems of integration and multiculturalism. He asked whether Government policy is to pursue integration or multiculturalism. I do not think that those two objectives are necessarily mutually exclusive. We must be careful about how we use the terms. For example, the issue does not arise from immigration or even asylum, unless we take the term &quot;immigrants&quot; to mean people whose family came here perhaps two, three or four 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 49WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
generations ago. The problems of community relations are not exclusive to communities with a high number of migrants, whether economic or asylum seeking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para82">In raising those matters in such a way, the hon. Gentleman risks conflating the issues. I regret to say that that is what he did when he discussed dentistry provision. I suspect that, like me, every Member here knows from their own constituency experience about the problem of availability of NHS dentists. I also know about it because I well remember campaigning to save the Edinburgh dental school. The root cause of the problem&#151;that was an unintended pun&#151;was the closure of the dentistry schools by the Conservative Government between 1992 and 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para83">It takes a long time to train dentists. The Scottish Executive have made the recruitment and training of dentists a major priority, but the situation will not change overnight. To raise the issue as the hon. Gentleman did in a debate on asylum and immigration lends credence to the taxi driver view, if I can call it that, which is that all those people are coming over here and taking our jobs and services. That is manifestly not the case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para84">The hon. Gentleman also spoke about several scams, including the sector-based scheme, which we value greatly in my constituency. We do not regard it in any way as a scam. It brings to my constituency many processing workers, which the community simply is not able to supply from its own resources, for the fish and shellfish processing sectors. I also must caution him in respect of his comments on arranged marriages. Perhaps he was well intentioned, but I fear that many outwith this Chamber will read his comments and take offence at them.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew25"><b> Mr. Browne </b> : As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am aware of the significant contribution that migrant labour makes to the economy of his constituency. I do not wish to endorse all that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said, but he made a coherent point about the changed circumstances after the accession date of 1 May. We now have access to a much extended labour market in Europe, and, of course, that is relevant. It may be of help to the debate if the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), who has some experience of the matter in his constituency, discussed it further at the appropriate time.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew26"><b> Mr. Carmichael </b> : I am exceptionally grateful to the Minister for that contribution. He makes a valid point, which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight also made. On the wider market, we must wait and see. The Minister referred to access&#151;he was right to use the term&#151;but it is early days. The extent to which we can exploit access to that market, the extent to which people will want to come from the new accession countries to perform those jobs and the impact that that will ultimately have on matters such as the sector-based scheme all remain to be seen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para85">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) referred to visa charges for students and I am grateful to him for raising that issue, about which I, too, have received representations. He is right to say that there is a widely held fear that the charges will start to deter overseas students from coming here, which would be exceptionally unfortunate and another example of the law of unintended consequences.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 50WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para86">The contribution made by overseas students to our higher and further education sector is immense in respect of the individual institutions and the long-term benefits that accrue to this country&#151;those, however, are perhaps less quantifiable&#151;because we establish good links with a generation of people who will return to their own countries and perhaps go on to lead the opinion-formers of tomorrow. Many of those countries are ones with which it is essential that we establish good relations if our future national security is to be assured.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para87">The hon. Member for Orpington referred to the scepticism about Government statistics and the Minister made an interesting observation about the National Audit Office audit of the statistics. The answer that he received from the hon. Gentleman made me suspect that not much would satisfy him about Government statistics; he was determined in his scepticism. However, as one who lives at both ends of the country, I caution him because I can take an outsider&#039;s view of the problems facing people who live in London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para88">I see that there are problems with the overheating of London and the south-east, but to raise such issues in the context of a debate on immigration and asylum and to conflate the issues in that process is not particularly helpful. Indeed, it is no more helpful than the Tory proposals for quotas for asylum seekers. I was disappointed by the hon. Gentleman&#039;s response when the Minister challenged him on that issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para89">I am keen to keep to my 10-minute limit and there is only one more issue that I want to draw to the Minister&#039;s attention. It was raised by early-day motion 458 on immigration rules and English language fluency for ministers of religion and concerns the difficulties that Hindu temples are having in recruiting poojaris as a&nbsp;result of having to meet English language fluency level&nbsp;4. The Minister may be aware that poojaris are not required to be preachers in Hindu temples, but there are difficulties with recruitment as a result of that language requirement and I hope that the Minister will give his earliest attention to the matter.

I also congratulate all those colleagues who have contributed to the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para90">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) said rightly that these vast subjects, particularly when placed together, cannot be discussed fully in a short debate such as the one that we are having today. However, the subject is important, and my hon.

Debates in the House in recent years have shown that characteristic, which is important but is not always reflected in the press and other parts of the media.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para91">I pause only to say that I sometimes consider that standard debates are not the easiest way in which to develop policy and an exchange of ideas. The hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser), who is here today and an expert on such issues, and I served on the Home

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Affairs Committee, which I often considered was an extremely good venue for an exchange of ideas and policy, and a good place in which to talk rationally. Other experts on such difficult issues are also present today. What a huge subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para92">Reference has been made to the Government&#039;s record over the past eight years. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire was right to refer to it. The record was unhappy in many respects and much of it took place before the Minister was in his place. I thank him, as I have done on other occasions, for the way in which he approaches such topics. Undoubtedly, during the past few years, asylum and immigration have become high on the list of worries of members of the public. My hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam) referred to a survey that was carried out in his constituency. Such matters cause concern.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para93">It is not easy for a Government to handle an efficient and humane asylum and immigration policy&#151;not easy at all&#151;but many would say that their record has been disappointing, to give it its lowest description. Asylum applications shot up and almost trebled between 1996 and 2001 and reached more than 100,000. The Government&#039;s inability to adopt a proper and effective removals target of failed asylum seekers was well highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para94">In 2001, I tabled a parliamentary question to which the Government replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The current&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. target relating to the removal of failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom is to remove 30,000 in 2001/02; 33,000 in 2003/04; and 37,000 in 2004/05.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>17 December 2001; Vol. 377, c.78W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para95">The Government should not have put forward such figures if they could not deliver them. The truth is that they had to abandon that target. It is not surprising that the former Home Secretary said not many months ago that he did not have a clue how many illegal immigrants were in this country. I think that the best estimates suggest that there are upwards of 250,000 failed asylum seekers here at the moment. That is a pity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para96">I wish to refer to two or three narrow, but important, points. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight naturally and properly referred to the impact of migration on housing in this country. Last December in the other place, my noble Friend Lord Lamont asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government about the latest projections for additional households each year in England, over what period forecasts had been made and how that compared with the previous projections of households in England in 2021 that was published in 2000. The Minister of State, Lord Rooker replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The 2002-based interim household projections are the Government&#039;s latest projections and have updated the 1996-based household projections.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The 2002-based Interim Household Projections show that 189,000 additional households are projected to form annually between 2001 and 2021 in England. This projection assumes recent population trends continue and trends in household formation remain as estimated for the 1996-based household projections. They do not take account of future housing supply.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;How many additional households in England each year can be attributed to the projected levels of net international migration in current and previous projections&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para98">to which Lord Rooker replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is estimated that, in the 2002-based interim household projections for England, about 59,000 additional households per year are attributable to net international migration out of a total of 189,000 additional households per year between 2001 and 2021.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>8 December 2004; Vol.&nbsp;667, c.

<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para99">The number had previously been estimated to be about 38,000 additional households a year. Simply in terms of housing, the problem is important; I say no more than that.

<p>
<a name="50111h03_para100">We now have Government figures that show that nearly one in three of the additional 189,000 households formed each year will be due to international migration.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para101">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight talked about immigration scams. There are a couple on which I would like an update, although the Minister has been very helpful on the matter in recent times. Reference was made to bogus colleges. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) was entirely right to talk of the many benefits of having international students in this country. However, we know&#151;and the Minister accepts&#151;that there have been and still are a number of bogus colleges. In a written answer, the Minister has said that

<a name="50111h03_para102">that is, educational colleges&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;of which about a quarter have been found to be bogus.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 15 November 2004; Vol. 426, c. 1092W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para103">That is almost 300 bogus colleges. I would appreciate it if he could give an update on how many of those bogus educational establishments have been closed.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew28"><b> Mr. Gerrard </b> : I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that something has been done about bogus colleges&#151;and about time, too. The issue is not so much whether they are closed down, but whether people are allowed to get visas to come to such a college. That is now not possible. It is a step forward that that loophole has been closed.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h03_spnew29"><b> Mr. Malins </b> : The hon. Gentleman, whose judgment on such matters we respect enormously, was right to say that it was about time that something was done. The situation was very bad. I simply ask the Minister not only whether some of those places have been closed but what has been done to ensure that such places cannot profit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para104">I have two other matters to raise. First, there is the question of sham marriages. A reply to a parliamentary question that I asked last year suggested that, in 2001 to 2004, the better part of 8,000 to 10,000 marriages suspected to be bogus had been reported by registrars to the Home Office. It was significant that my inquiries among registrars showed that whenever they reported a proposed possible bogus marriage, they found the

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Home Office unwilling to act. There has been legislation since. The Government were right to deal with the problem and, to quote the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), it was about time they did. Can the Minister bring us up to date on whether he is entirely happy with the current situation?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para105">Finally, there is the question of juxtaposed controls and borders. The debate on border controls could occupy weeks in itself. I happen to know that the Government have been working hard over the past year or more to improve our border controls. It is a difficult task. However, I would like them to comment, if they would, on a document that I received a few days ago from representatives of the British International Freight Association. What the association says is very important. Quoting observations of some member companies, it says that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in July of this year all major ports around the world had to upgrade their security to comply with the International Ship & Port Security (ISPS) Code, agreed in December&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The ISPS Code is administered and regulated in the UK by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. TRANSEC&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our members moving goods by road from the Continent still report significant instances of &#039;clandestine entrants&#039; getting into and hiding on trucks in order to gain entrance to the UK. They are said to be usually armed (sometimes with firearms). The point being that these trucks move through supposedly ISPS compliant in France and the Low-countries (some of which have British Customs/Immigration staffed &#039;juxtapositioned&#039; control zones at them), go aboard ISPS compliant ro-ro ferries/ships and through UK ISPS compliant ports the other side, yet such armed stowaways can remain undetected.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para106">Can the Minister briefly address that matter? I am sorry that I have extended my allocated 10 minutes by a few seconds.
</p>



<a name="50111h03_time6"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h03_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration  (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desmond Browne) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) on securing the debate. He is right to say that it addresses an important and under-discussed issue, and the policy on it can only benefit from the debate. Unfortunately, I appear yet again to have been left with a comparatively small amount of time to respond, so it is unlikely that I will be able to deal with all the points that have been raised in this debate, but I will seek to deal with those that I do not address by other means.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para107">The tone of the debate has broadly been helpful, although I will have something more to say about that. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken for the contributions that they made; I hope that they will excuse me for that general acknowledgement. I am also grateful that my hon. Friends the Members for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and for Dover (Mr. Prosser) are present; they have expertise in this area and it was unfortunate that the limited time available to us did not allow them to do anything more than intervene in the debate. However, they were telling interventions that helped the debate to progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para108">I have a slight disappointment about something, which I hope that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight will accept in the right spirit. He promised that he would address the positive aspects of migration, and particularly the significant contribution that migrant labour makes to the national health service at all levels, but, except for a fleeting reference, he failed to do so. That may be a consequence of lack of time. As I have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
debated with him before, enjoyed those debates and felt that his contributions were balanced, I will give him the benefit of the doubt on this occasion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para109">Nobody is more acutely aware than I am of the views of the public on this issue of public policy. They are reflected in my postbag, and in contributions from both sides of the political spectrum. Not everyone shares the views espoused by the hon. Gentleman. There are significant numbers of people in the United Kingdom who have different and far more liberal views about how we should run our border controls and how we should approach issues such as who should be entitled to migrate to our country and live and work among us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para110">I know that MORI polls show that 70 per cent. of people in this country think that migration is too high. I am also conscious that polls&#151;and sometimes they are the same polls that produce that 70 per cent. figure&#151;show that for many of the people who hold that view, it can be explained by the fact that they have exaggerated beliefs about what the actual figures are. The MORI poll that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to recently showed that, on average, people thought there were four times more migrants in the UK than there are on any view of the figures&#151;whether they be the figures that other people extrapolate from the public figures or those that are published after being audited.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para111">There is a duty on all of us to use statistical information in this area with a degree of responsibility, and, being a Minister, I accept that that stricture applies more heavily to me and to the Home Office than to anybody else. That is what my dispute with MigrationWatch UK is about in relation to the figures. To the extent that it uses figures that are published and are in the public domain&#151;and, broadly, it does use such figures&#151;I have no argument. Most of the time, it uses figures that have been independently audited, at the request of the Home Office, by the National Audit Office, and that have to a large extent been given a clean bill of health. I have a copy of the report in front of me and it contains some qualifications, as I mentioned to the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam). However, it suggests that the figures can largely be relied on, and it shows in particular that there is no transference from one set of figures to another&#151;from the migration figures to the asylum figures, or vice versa&#151;which was an important part of the debate that was taking place many months ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para112">To that extent, I have no objection. It is the flawed analysis of the figures that I dispute. I understand that some of that is in an area where there is debate, because no Government in this country have ever been able to say how many illegal migrants there are here. No Government in the world can say how many illegal migrants there are in their country. It seems a sterile argument to concentrate&#151;as many people and commentators want to do&#151;on the inability of one Home Secretary, or successive Home Secretaries, to be able to answer that question with accuracy. Nobody has ever been able to do it and I suspect that nobody ever will.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para113">It is incumbent on the Government&#151;I accept this responsibility&#151;to look at the methodologies used by other countries, as we are currently doing, to see how the figures can be properly estimated in a way that does not inflame public opinion one way or the other, but informs 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 55WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
it and allows us to have a debate. When that work is complete, we will publish those figures and that information, but, as yet, it is work in progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para114">I turn to some other important points. It is important to accept that people in the UK live in a globalised world. We do not live in isolation. We may have lived in a different world 20, 30 or 40 years ago, when international travel was much more difficult than it is now and when our economy was in a different state. However, migration is essential if we are to maintain our role as a major economic player. I do not think that there is any party in this Parliament that does not think that that is right. It is the scale that we are debating, rather than the principle.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para115">It is beyond debate that we have one of the strongest economies in the world. We consistently have nearly 600,000 vacancies in the labour market, unemployment is at sustained, historically low levels and employment at sustained, historically high levels. Without migration, the rate of economic growth that we presently enjoy would be much lower. We could not look forward to the expected level of economic growth that all of us, as politicians and the elected leadership of this country, wish to see so that we can make the level of investment that we want in the infrastructure of our country and our public services. We could not sustain that growth. We must face up to that reality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para116">I understand that those labour market facts have significant consequences in relation to pressures on public services and, in particular, on housing in certain parts of the country. However, we must face the reality that those issues exist whoever does the work. If the work needs to be done in those parts of the United Kingdom, and if we are of the view that that level of growth should be sustained and continued, workers will need to come to do the work.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 56WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para117">As I travel around this city, I notice&#151;with my accent&#151; that there is a significant amount of migrant labour from my part of the United Kingdom carrying out work and living among the people of the city. If those people settle in this part of the United Kingdom and want their families with them, they will generate a degree of pressure on public resources, whether they be housing resources or health resources. I understand that that is an uncomfortable reality for people who consider themselves to be the indigenous population&#151;whatever that might mean. What is the indigenous population of the south-east of England? When I am out, I hear people speaking English as a native language with many accents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para118">Whatever the native population is, that is a challenging fact for them, but if we are to see the growth that we all want, we must deal with those issues. It will be unfortunate if this debate, which it is the Government&#039;s responsibility to respond to, becomes an issue about immigration, because, as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight pointed out, if we do not get the context of the debate right and if we do not take it forward properly, it will be ruthlessly exploited by extremists&#151;particularly from the right wing of politics&#151;to mask their racist approach to life in this country. That will do significant damage. We have a joint responsibility to take the issues forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h03_para119">We are not, in international terms, a high net migration country. Whatever the figures may be&#151;the Government Actuary&#039;s Department has a mixed record of predicting the number of people and the growth of the population of this country&#151;we are not a high net migration country. In fact, in relation to all our competitors, we are substantially smaller&#151;.

<a name="50111h04_head0"><h3 align=center>GP Services (Exmoor)</h3>

<a name="50111h04_time0"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Adrian Flook  (Taunton)</b>  (Con): I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to raise an important issue for the people of Exmoor that also resonates in every sparsely populated area of England. As the south-west region is the most rural of England&#039;s regions, the debate is relevant to counties other than Somerset and the part of Devon to which Exmoor extends.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para0">I am sure that the Minister has boned up on his knowledge of my constituency and no doubt he knows that there are two very distinct geographical parts to it: Taunton Deane, which has 80,000 electors, and Exmoor, which has nearly 4,000&#151;a much smaller number. The matter is best illustrated by my saying that although Taunton Deane is not overcrowded, the 3,900 electors of Exmoor live in an area roughly the same size as the whole of Taunton Deane.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para1">I share Exmoor with my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger) and the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey), so together we represent one of the most remote areas of England. It is worth pointing out that, compared with the national average, Exmoor has a significantly greater proportion of households with individuals suffering from limiting long-term illnesses. Due to the nature of farming communities, families will be left to look after those who are ill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para2">On Exmoor, there is also a greater proportion of individuals caring for the ill or the elderly and a greater number of people living in medical and care establishments run by housing associations. Contrary to how some people regard Exmoor, it is not a very wealthy area across the piece. It is also well accepted that Exmoor has an ageing population, which is easy to understand when one considers that many people aspire to retire there. In turn, a higher than average proportion of people provide unpaid care in farming families, and a consequent proportion of the elderly live alone after the husband or wife has passed away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para3">It is also worth pointing out that Exmoor is unusual in having no traditional nursing homes, which creates extra problems for the GP surgery I shall mention in a few moments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para4">There are two particular issues that I want to bring to the Minister&#039;s attention. The first is the sparsity of the area that I represent, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater, and the manner in which primary services are struggling to match those in the towns of Taunton and Bridgwater, as well as those elsewhere in England. Secondly, there is the particular problem of the Dulverton medical practice which is based at Trumpington House surgery in the town of Dulverton. Even to the Minister, hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), whose constituency is hardly a conurbation, Exmoor must be really rural and Dulverton, although a town, not much more than a large village. It is the gateway to Exmoor and one of Britain&#039;s most beautiful areas, yet it is only a small town.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para5">I am grateful for the information that has been provided by the partners of the surgery and Mrs. Pam Poole, the practice manager. Everyone who works for the surgery is held in high esteem by people throughout 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 58WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Exmoor. I am also grateful to Mr. Bernard Smith, chairman of the Dulverton medical practice patient group, which has a good relationship with the doctors at the surgery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para6">The practice covers an enormous area of 300 square miles and is based right in the centre of the town. That is the good news. The bad news is that the town is old and the practice based in extremely cramped conditions in an old house. There are 4,000 patients&#151;a very steady number held over the past 20 years&#151;with three whole-time equivalent doctors, of whom Dr. Lee Burton is the only full-timer. Some will say that 4,000 patients for three full-time doctors does not seem like a particularly burdensome load, but I am about to come to the crux of the issue, which is sparsity. Given that they have to cover 300 square miles, three full-time GPs working between 8 am and 6.30 pm five days a week do not have much time for house calls as well as surgery appointments, even on a good day. The doctors are, as in every doctor&#039;s surgery in the country, extremely pressed for time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para7">The patient group has emphasised the rurality of Exmoor to Somerset Coast primary care trust. Coupled with the lack of public transport, those from all the isolated communities must travel long distances to the community hospitals at Minehead, Williton, Tiverton, Taunton and, in some cases, Wellington. The round-trip can take several hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para8">The patients&#039; group is concerned that the outreach surgeries continue. They are in demand and began in response to local need. I know the village halls well, and will visit three of the outreach surgeries with Dr. Burton on Friday morning. I will be honest and admit that it would be fair to say that they lack professional amenities. No doubt Dr. Burton and his colleagues offer good medical care, but those village halls, which are at times cold, are not as well equipped as they ought to be. I am sure that the Minister appreciates that that is not the best way to deliver primary care in the 21st century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para9">The Minister will be aware of the issue of out-of-hours care. In a sparsely populated, rural area such as Exmoor, it is the main concern of the practice group. Patients are not happy with the out-of-hours service that has been afforded to them by Somerset Coast PCT. Thanks to the distance, emergency GP attention often takes several hours to arrive. Doctors are dispatched from Taunton, sometimes via Bridgwater, to get to the heart of the moor. Even with the most sophisticated navigation equipment available, local knowledge is immensely important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para10">In short, what is needed is funding for more doctors to cover the area at any one time. That issue, I am sure, will be evolving in many rural areas throughout the country. The problem is that, when the unknown GP arrives in the middle of the night, he has few, if any, patient records. That is always a cause for concern for patients and for the patients&#039; group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para11">It appears that, since the system came into being at the beginning of April, none of that has been able to take place until the patient has telephoned the emergency contact number, been subjected to a host of questions&#151;sometimes repeated by more than one operative&#151;and been told that a doctor will be phoning. That call could come up to three hours later due to excessive demand for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 59WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the service. That comment is what electors of mine&#151;patients of the service&#151;are hearing all too often, so, of course, confidence in the system is low.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para12">The alternative is to call 999 immediately, rather than go through the NHS Direct system, but 999 calls mean an in-built expense to the NHS that we would prefer not to be placed on it. However, that is what a large number of people are beginning to do. When 999 is called and an ambulance arrives, the response time is well outside what is expected. That is understandable because Taunton, the location of the nearest major ambulance station, is at least 25 miles away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para13">So, the issues are out-of-hours service, the continuation of outreach services and sparsity. The availability of physiotherapy also needs to be improved. Farming is the mainstay of Exmoor and farmers go through physical work and exertion much more systematically than many of us, who seem to have desk jobs. It therefore becomes an imperative that people receive physiotherapy much more smoothly and efficiently, or they could end up prematurely chronically disabled and unable to work. That would undermine their whole lifestyle. Mental health care is common in rural areas, but the service and support for psychotic or affective disorders is sparse on Exmoor.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger  (Bridgwater)</b>  (Con): My hon. Friend and I share Exmoor almost exclusively. He makes an eloquent case, but perhaps I may tease out this point a little further. Domiciliary care in our local hospital in Minehead, not the main one in Taunton, has been cut even since we began to represent the area&#151;not because the hospital wants it cut, but because the resource has been moved to Taunton. Does he agree that we must try to encourage more domiciliary care such as physiotherapy back on to the moor?
</p>




<p><a name="50111h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Flook </b> : It would be extremely useful if the services being offered in Minehead were also offered in Dulverton. I wait to hear the Minister&#039;s response. In the spirit of trying to be helpful to one another, I informed his office of the issues that I intended to address this afternoon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para14">The minor injury unit represents an important issue, but one that I hope is being resolved. The Minister may be aware that it has been a slight local cause c&#233;l&#232;bre. Following 1 April and a new GP contract, the PCT saw no value in continuing to fund the minor injury unit. The sum involved is fairly small&#151;just a few thousand pounds&#151;and the unit offers local people an opportunity to be seen quickly by a health professional. However, the doctors thought that that decision was wrong and, despite local medical committee guidelines, which advise against offering services not funded by the PCT, they have continued to offer the facility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para15">Even the people in Bridgwater, where the PCT is based, did not grasp the issues of rurality and sparsity faced by those living on Exmoor. The 80 patients treated every year are grateful that the doctors have continued the facility. Where else could they go? Wherever they live&#151;it could be Simonsbath&#151;to go to Dulverton is a detour. If they found that the minor injuries unit was not open, they would have to go on to Taunton. Therefore, a small detour to Dulverton could mean another 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miles to the accident and emergency department at Taunton or going back across the moor to Minehead.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 60WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para16">In response to my hon. Friend&#039;s comment on Minehead, there is, I am told, no medical cover, by which I mean a doctor&#039;s cover, for the minor injury unit between 11 at night and 8 in the morning. That creates further concern and pushes people the longer distance to Taunton, instead of the slightly shorter distance to Minehead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para17">The patients&#039; group remonstrated with the PCT successfully, and following a personal meeting with Alan Carpenter, chief executive officer of the PCT, a dialogue is taking place. I hope the problem will be resolved
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para18">I hope also that the Minister has been able to follow closely my depiction of the difficulties in delivering primary health care on Exmoor. The matter is made more problematic by the situation in which doctors find themselves with their own surgery premises. The building, which is in the centre of Dulverton, is outdated and restrictive. It was converted in the 1960s from a house, when the doctor, who had a single consulting room, moved next door. The number of consulting rooms is now too few for the number of doctors. The nursing area is equally cramped. The corridors are not wide enough for wheelchair or stretcher access and there is a lack of space in the treatment rooms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para19">In view of the geographical isolation and the distance even to the community hospitals of Minehead and Tiverton, the surgery needs to be able, and is just about able, to offer dietician&#039;s advice, community nursing and midwifery, a health visitor service and&#151;not that the doctors are being paid for it&#151;the minor injury service, but all in cramped and unsuitable surroundings. When I visited the surgery in December, I was introduced to a number of staff who are based in what are effectively broom cupboards. They make the facilities that some of us still endure in the House of Commons look quite palatial.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para20">The Minister will know that much more is being asked of primary care and that Trumpington House has no opportunity to match what many GP surgeries can offer elsewhere in my constituency. The minor surgery service could even be extended. There could and should be mental health support. It would be good to see occupational health services for rural workers based there and even visiting GPs with special interests being allowed to go to the surgery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para21">Access for the elderly, infirm and disabled is real issue. There is an inadequate drop-off point on a narrow street, which always blocks the traffic and is a problem for blue-light emergencies and for the air ambulance if it ever has to pick someone up from the surgery. I noticed, because it is all too clear, that the dispensary is too small. Of the 4,000 patients, 75 per cent. get their prescriptions from the doctor and get a poor service&#151;not because the pharmacy is inadequate, but because people have to queue so close to each other that everyone knows what everyone else&#039;s prescription is. That cannot be right. Overall, in the words of the chairman of the patients&#039; group, Trumpington House
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;is not conducive to a healing environment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para22">There is a solution. A site for a new medical centre has been found in grounds currently occupied by the dentist in the town. It is well located, easily accessible to everyone in the community and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater and I know, even has the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 61WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
blessing of local planners, who are fairly picky. Funding, as I am sure the Minister would expect me to say, is the key to solving the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para23">The PCT acknowledges the difficulties, knows that there is a solution and, depending on the yardstick used, says that the surgery is its No. 1 or No. 2 priority. It has given everyone the impression that it wants to be helpful, but says that there are genuine restrictions on finding suitable capital funding to help the GPs to move their practice. It appears that the PCT&#039;s budget to help doctors to improve their facilities throughout all its surgeries on the Somerset coast amounts to about &#163;600 per surgery. That may or may not include the extra &#163;108 million for helping doctors to improve their premises, which was announced by the Government at the end of July, but it works out to an extra &#163;100,000 per PCT and an extra &#163;150,000 next year, which is not a lot. I hope the Minister appreciates that there are problems of sparsity on Exmoor and even the local PCT is slowly working out that it has not quite grasped what that means in terms of how services need to be delivered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para24">I believe that my comments are helpful and I hope that they have been received as such. We are looking for help and for understanding of sparsity and its impact on how doctors are trying to keep up with what is expected of primary care elsewhere in our country. In trying to improve the health of their patients, it appears to me as a layman that they have to struggle more than others. They are at the end of the queue in more ways than one: they tend to have smaller patient lists, which means that funding is more difficult, and they are geographically more removed from the centre, which means not only that their patients have to travel much further, but that the money seems to travel more slowly to them.
</p>



<a name="50111h04_time1"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman) </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Flook) for the interest that he takes in his local health services and I congratulate him on raising the issues today. However, for the very reasons that he outlined, I hope he will understand that much of what he has said pertains to matters that have to be addressed locally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para25">The hon. Gentleman correctly said that, although my constituency of South Thanet contains significant rural areas, it is very different from Exmoor. I have no knowledge of the detail of how life on Exmoor works; I cannot possibly know. I have enough to do to ensure that I understand how life in South Thanet works. That is why it is right that we have a policy of shifting the balance of power, sending money for the national health service to local areas and making local primary care trusts the focal point for local decision making, with people who know the area making decisions that are relevant to it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para26">Although I will deal with some issues that the hon. Gentleman raised and tell him what is being done about them, the response must come from his local PCT and local health professionals who understand the area. They have been given the resources, the opportunity and responsibility to address those issues locally. I hope that he and his colleague, the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger), engage with their local PCT to ensure that their views are fed in. I am also happy to say 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that, because that local PCT has a duty to ensure it understands the views of local people, it organised a series of consultation events last autumn to enable it better to comprehend the needs of the local health community. Those events have informed the capital programme, including primary care services; helped to ensure that resources are going to the right places; and helped the PCT to create a strategic services development plan, which will no doubt address many of the issues that the hon. Member for Taunton raised.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger </b> : The Minister has made the most elegant points. One problem with Somerset Coast PCT&#151;most of which is in my constituency&#151;is that one goes from an industrial town to a very large seaside conurbation to a huge rural area. We have four hospitals of which only one would meet Government standards. The PCT is good, and the Minister is absolutely right: it is undertaking a phenomenal consultation process, in which I, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Flook) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) have been involved. However, it is finding it very difficult to obtain the capital receipts to be able to do what it would like to do.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h04_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : Later on, I hope to have good news about capital receipts for the hon. Gentleman. We have come up with a formula for ensuring that the capitation expenditure in each area reflects properly the needs of that area. Deprivation and rurality are two issues that are taken into account when determining the amount of money per head going into the health service in a particular area. It will take us some years to move fully to the use of that formula, but it already is and will continue to be an awful lot more generous to Exmoor than the formula for spreading out money in the national health service that it replaced. I hope it will help the PCT to address the issues mentioned in the long term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para27">I ought to say something about the problems of contracting and attracting GPs to an area such as Exmoor. Before I do that, with my Government hat on and to ensure a balanced debate, I am pleased to say that in December almost 100 per cent. of patients were offered an appointment with a GP within the national target of two working days and almost 100 per cent. of patients were able to gain access to a primary care practitioner within one working day. That is a considerable achievement by health professionals, and I congratulate them on their hard work and commitment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para28">Part of the modernisation of the national health service means that we must modernise the role of GPs and have the new general medical services contract, which came into existence in April, as an alternative to the personal medical services contract. It allows far more flexible working and increases UK expenditure on primary care from &#163;6.1 billion in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;8 billion in 2005&#150;06, which is an increase of 33 per cent. It is based on a series of quality indicators that will allow GPs to be paid more if they improve the quality of services to their patients and are able to reflect the needs of areas such as Exmoor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para29">The contract also provides new recruitment and retention possibilities to tackle shortages, which will be very important to areas such as Exmoor. For example, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
it allows for new benefits, including enhanced service payments if specialist services are delivered in a primary care setting; allows for resources to be allocated more fairly according to need; and benefits patients, giving them a far wider choice of high-quality services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para30">I hope that those services will be in the community, as the hon. Member for Bridgwater said in an intervention, rather than in a hospital. In an area such as Exmoor, it is vital that we provide more services in people&#039;s communities, rather than have them travel long distances to hospital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para31">All the surgeries in the west Somerset area, which includes Exmoor, have transferred to GMS contracts&#151;only a few remain on the PMS contract. I have no doubt that they all recognise the benefits and that they can use them to improve services in their area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para32">The hon. Member for Taunton raised several issues, and I shall try to deal with them. First, the Trumpington House surgery in Dulverton faces several serious challenges. I do not minimise them for a second. Officials of the PCT have met regularly with the surgery to discuss options for developing integrated health facilities on an alternative site. I am pleased to say that, following acceptance of the new GMS contract, the PCT has invested more than &#163;900,000 in Trumpington House surgery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para33">The news that I have for the hon. Gentleman&#151;I am slightly surprised that he has not heard it already and that the PCT has not put it up in lights&#151;is that the surgery has been awarded &#163;250,000 for 2005&#150;06 from the Dorset and Somerset funding. The money has been allocated for development of the modernisation project and has come from the new premises moneys released by the Government in 2004. It is for the local PCT and the surgery to work out how the &#163;250,000 can best be used, but, if the provision of new services and facilities is as important as the hon. Gentleman suggests, I hope that they give serious consideration to using the money for that purpose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para34">The hon. Gentleman discussed out-of-hours services. He may be aware that the new GMS contract allows PCTs to take responsibility for such services. By 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 64WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1 January, all but seven PCTs had assumed responsibility for them. Indeed, the transfer of responsibilities for such services to PCTs means that in many areas much more effective out-of-hours services can be provided. The new contract also helps to retain and recruit GPs who otherwise would not be interested in providing an out-of-hours service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para35">Somerset Coast PCT has taken on this responsibility and has put in place a robust and integrated out-of-hours service. The service can be accessed by NHS Direct and is supported locally by treatment centres, minor injury units, community hospitals and community nursing teams. Out-of-hours services are available at Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton and at community hospitals in Bridgwater and Minehead. The services are supported by a county-wide strategic development group, which is chaired by the chief executive of Mendip PCT, the lead PCT for out-of-hours services in Somerset.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para36">I am not saying that everything about that out-of-hours service is already working perfectly. Of course it is not. The service will have to be monitored and improved. The issues that the hon. Gentleman identified will have to be addressed as time goes on, but the local team has put in place a strong plan that can improve on and deliver a top-quality out-of-hours service to people on Exmoor in the long term. Although feedback will be necessary from patient groups, the hon. Gentleman and local people, I believe that the service will go from strength to strength.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para37">It is important that we deal with resource allocation, at least briefly. As I said, because the old formula did not properly reflect deprivation, rurality and other issues that add to costs in particular areas, we abandoned it. We have introduced a new formula that is much more generous to areas such as Exmoor, although it will take several years before Exmoor is on target for the total spending that we expect it to receive. However, the area has already benefited significantly from the new formula, and it will continue to benefit as it approaches the target in the coming years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h04_para38">I hope that, following that brief canter through the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised, I have addressed his concerns. If I have not, I am happy to meet him to discuss them further.

<a name="50111h05_head0"><h3 align=center>School Buildings (Medway)</h3>

<a name="50111h05_time0"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h05_spnew0"><b> Jonathan Shaw  (Chatham and Aylesford)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have an opportunity to talk about schools in the Medway towns and I would like to put it on record that my contribution is supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark) and by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews). All three of us, representing the Medway towns, have high aspirations for our young people, students, and children, and the schools in which they learn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para0">Without doubt, Medway schools have benefited enormously from investment under this Labour Government. There was &#163;21 million of capital investment last year; there is the same again this year; and there will be just about the same again next year. That means more than &#163;60 million within a three-year period, which is unprecedented. When I was elected, in 1997, if I were to have forecast those sums of money going in to schools in the Medway towns, people would not have believed it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para1">The figures are one thing. What matters to children, parents, school staff, heads and governors is what that &#163;60 million does. What happens in the classroom and in the schools is what matters. The money improves facilities for schools and thereby the learning opportunities for our children and young people in the Medway towns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para2">I used to be surprised when I visited schools and heads wanted to show me their new toilet blocks. I had difficulty in matching their enthusiasm when they described the transformation. They said the same about staff rooms. I should not have been surprised, because the reality was that there was never any money to put those things right; if there was money, staff rooms, loos and so on were the last priority. That has been why there has been enthusiasm and much else, which I will go on to talk about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para3">Heads have said to me that, at long last, they have got the money, particularly devolved capital, which has proved very popular, to put right and to improve aspects of their schools that they had never been able to consider. That was the picture in many Medway town schools, but those days are going. It is not just a matter of toilets and staff rooms; it is much more than that. I will give a few examples. We are constructing new buildings. A sports hall at Medway community college just recently opened. It cost &#163;1 million and it is a superb new centre. When I visited it recently, a young girl said, &quot;This is the best thing that has happened to our school in years&quot;. I am really proud of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para4">Seven years ago, when a head teacher at All Saints primary school, Mr. Stuart Kay, and I stood outside his Victorian building, he looked at me and said, &quot;I want a new school for this area in Chatham&quot;. Well, he has got it. More than &#163;1 million was involved. There are fantastic new classrooms and there has been a transformation. There are smiles on the faces of all the staff and the children. As the head teacher said, &quot;We are over the moon with what has happened&quot;. He did not believe that it was possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para5">We can contrast that and other examples of what went before. Perhaps one of the startling examples was Chatham South secondary school, which for 21 years 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 66WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
did not have a school hall. We are talking about a secondary school that provides education for hundreds of pupils; boys and girls in the Medway towns did not have a school hall. Well, it has a school hall now. Eighteen months ago, a new &#163;1 million school hall and drama and music centre opened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para6">Close to home, Wayfield primary school, where I am a governor, has a nursery. It was originally built under the urban aid programme under the previous Labour Government. It took the election of another Labour Government for that nursery to be refurbished under the new deal for schools programme. The school had to wait that long. I have said that in a very partisan way because Conservative Members of Parliament vote against that investment; that is the clear dividing line, of which my constituents are very much aware.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para7">The examples of school investment that I referred to are typical of what is taking place across the Medway towns. My hon. Friend the Minister knows that the Medway area is part of the Thames gateway. It is one of the four national growth areas and a national priority for the Government. There can be no question about the priority given to the Thames gateway; the relevant Cabinet Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister himself. We have aspirations for the new communities, and&#151;vitally&#151;for the existing communities in the gateway. If we are to succeed in getting cohesion and dynamism and if we are to grasp those opportunities, we have to ensure that the infrastructure&#151;whether of transport, health or education&#151;is improved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para8">We have made a good start; recently two new nurseries were built as a result of &#163;500,000 each from the Government. There are free places, and a new Sure Start centre has opened, at a cost of &#163;1.1 million, that provides high-quality support for children and families in Medway towns. It would be wrong to overlook the Government&#039;s investment in higher education to ensure the establishment of the universities. Kent university and Greenwich university now share the Medway campus. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway is not here today but, since 1991, he has been an inspiring champion of the cause to establish a higher education institute in the Medway towns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para9">Discussing school buildings in Medway is relevant to the core purpose of this debate. Institutions for higher education are in place; we need to create the right conditions so that all our young people can aspire to and obtain the necessary standards so that they can choose whether they will attend those institutions. Those two universities have undertaken great work, particularly on the children&#039;s university and in reaching out to communities that had never considered higher education. The education maintenance allowances have made a difference by encouraging young people to continue their education post-16; some &#163;500 million has been invested to assist such children and their families. We are only too aware of that investment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para10">The essential infrastructure, however, has to ensure that there are people with the skills to meet the challenges and opportunities. Some 12 per cent. of residents in Medway towns have qualifications of degree level or higher, compared to a national average of nearly 20 per cent.; on that criterion, we are ranked 66th of 67 authorities in the south-east. That is a poor position from which to benefit from the growth that comes from the knowledge and skills based economy.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 67WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para11">Standards are rising in Medway schools and I pay tribute to the hard work and efforts of head teachers, other school staff, pupils and parents. However, 30 per cent. of Medway&#039;s work force do not have any qualifications. In a competitive region such as the south-east, that makes things difficult for us. Our people have 7 per cent. fewer qualifications than the regional average. Given that backdrop, the Minister will understand our determination that Medway schools should be the springboard for our population to reach out and grasp the gateway&#039;s potential.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para12">The Department has advised Medway that we will start to receive building schools for the future funding in 2011, and that more will come into effect in 2016. I understand that building schools for the future is a long-term programme. However, if the gateway is to meet its full potential, we need to invest earlier in school buildings in Medway. The Department needs to understand better the gateway and the unique and special circumstances in Medway and the whole of the gateway. Perhaps it should be clearer about the importance that it attaches to schools for the future. I say that because in neighbouring Gravesham there has been an allocation from the 2008 tranche for building schools for the future. I would like to understand the criteria that the Government are working to. I know that deprivation levels are similar in Medway and Gravesham, but what factors are taken into account in terms of growth and the need to improve the personnel infrastructure? The Government must look again at Medway and I ask the Minister to consider my points and to review those decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para13">We have no argument about the commitment to invest in our schools. We know that we are having a share of the &#163;5.5 billion of capital investment that the Government are providing compared with the &#163;650 million that was being spent on schools prior to 1997. I am not just saying that I want more for my schools and I want the Minister to understand that. If we are to grasp the opportunities and realise the ambition, the gateway must meet the challenges and have a skilled work force. We need the schools that will be the springboard to create those opportunities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para14">Many more properties&#151;some 120,000&#151;will be built in the gateway by 2016, 43,000 of which will be in Kent and Medway. Schools need infrastructure investment and they have had that infrastructure investment. I am a great supporter of the Government&#039;s ambitious programme of refurbishing and rebuilding schools. In parts of my constituency outside Medway, rebuilding of two schools will start in March with spending of some &#163;13 million or &#163;14 million. I know that the Government are not just talking about spending money; they are spending money on schools both in Medway and elsewhere in my constituency. However, the point that I am labouring is that if we are to meet the challenges and if my existing residents and constituents are to realise the potential and grasp those opportunities, our schools must be the springboard. Investment is needed so that in Medway we can build those schools for the future before 2011. I hope that the Minister will review that decision.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>



<a name="50111h05_time1"><h5></h5>


<p><a name="50111h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for School Standards  (Mr. Stephen Twigg) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) on securing this important debate. I put on record my respect for his efforts and, as he rightly said, those of our hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews) and our hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Paul Clark). I had the opportunity last year of visiting the area with our hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham to meet parents and teachers and to visit a primary school. I am aware of many of the challenges and opportunities that my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford set out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para15">It is probably worth starting by saying a little about some challenges that we faced when we came to office in 1997. My hon. Friend set those out with reference to his constituency. It is fair to say that school buildings throughout our country had suffered from decades of under-investment and neglect as well as a chronic and widespread backlog of urgent repairs. A large number of schools that were built in the 1960s and 1970s were passing the end of their design life and many were in much poorer condition than older schools built 50 or even 100 years ago. A huge number of temporary classrooms were in use and many were in terrible condition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para16">My hon. Friend referred to toilets. Many schools had outside toilets and heating systems that were antiquated, inefficient and inadequate. Very few new schools were built between the late 1970s and the mid to late 1990s. Those that were built were usually a response to necessity caused by rising pupil numbers in certain parts of the country. Schools were not in a position to improve their buildings or to respond to developments in learning and teaching, in particular the challenges of information and communications technology and the new technologies that are now available to us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para17">In 1996&#150;97, the financial year at the end of which we came to power, direct Government support for capital investment in school buildings stood at just under &#163;700 million for the whole of England. That has been increased dramatically to record levels. This year the figure is &#163;4.9 billion and it will rise over the next three years to &#163;6.3 billion in 2007&#150;08. That significant improvement in capital investment in our schools is designed not only to make up for those decades of neglect, but to address the challenges that the education service faces as we go into the 21st century. We need to ensure that all schools are up to the expected standards, with very high aspirations for all children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para18">We have done a number of things. We have revised and improved the design and environmental guidelines for schools to reflect the needs of this century, and in particular to capture the benefits of new technology and ICT. An example is the greater availability of interactive white boards and greater expectations in relation to sustainable buildings and good environmental quality. That is in addition to meeting some challenges around inclusion in education, for which my hon. Friend has been a powerful advocate in his role as a constituency MP and on the departmental Select Committee.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 69WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para19">In November, we announced the capital funding for schools over the current spending review period, taking us through to the financial year 2007&#150;08. Taking those three years together, we are talking about more than &#163;17 billion of additional capital support for investment in maintained schools across England. The capital strategy underpins the five-year plan for education, which was set out last summer. It seeks to provide all schools and authorities with funding, allocating it in a way that is fair and meets the needs that exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para20">In 2007&#150;08, a typical primary school of 250 pupils will have a direct grant of &#163;34,000 to spend for its own capital purposes and a typical secondary school of 1,000 pupils will have about &#163;113,000. On top of that, depending on local priorities, all schools will have access to about &#163;2 billion through the local authority or the diocese.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para21">By 2007&#150;08, there will be a further &#163;500 million available for exceptional needs that formulaic funding alone cannot meet. By then, we will be targeting about &#163;2.7 billion for the renewal of the secondary school estate through academies and the building schools for the future programme. I will come to the position in Medway in a moment. The ambition of building schools for the future is to renew every secondary school in England. That is a huge task. It has never been attempted before and will take some time&#151;we estimate between 10 and 15 years, and even that must be subject to future decisions and future spending patterns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para22">I turn to some challenges in Medway to which my hon. Friend referred. First, I acknowledge the important points that he has raised, both about standards and improving quality with respect to learning and teaching, and about some continuing challenges that are faced in the education service in his constituency. I am pleased to echo his points on the role of universities and the great importance of getting that higher education presence in Medway. Like him, I pay tribute to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Medway, who has led the campaign on that issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para23">We know that part of the challenge with respect to aspiration for those children who come from families that traditionally have not gone into higher education is to achieve more effective co-operation between schools and higher education. The progress that my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford described enables those aspirations to be raised&#151;ideally, experience shows us, from the youngest possible age. The greater the links between universities and schools, the more likely it is that we will see the benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para24">As my hon. Friend acknowledged, Medway benefits from the general increase in funding via formula and the targeted capital fund. For the next three years, the authority and its schools have been allocated &#163;45 million in capital funding. Much can be done to ensure that that investment has a real impact, but, as he said, Medway has not been prioritised in the first three waves of BSF funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para25">Let me say a little about how we chose the areas that would go into the different waves of BSF. As I said, it is a long-term programme lasting perhaps 10 to 15 years. Just two years ago, we invited every local education authority to apply to be included in the first wave of projects or to express an interest in being included in the rest of the programme. We published detailed guidance 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>11 Jan 2005 : Column 70WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
on how we would prioritise investment, and how we would start with the areas of greatest educational and social need. We chose simple, robust and understandable criteria: a combination of schools&#039; GCSE performance and eligibility for free school meals in the area. That meant that authorities could see for themselves whether they were likely to be included in the early stages of the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para26">BSF is a development of the private finance initiative. As such, it deals with procurement of groups of schools rather than individual schools. That clearly brings efficiency and value for money from public procurement. However, more importantly, the real value of BSF is that a grouped approach should mean that we get much greater educational impact from the capital investment. Each local authority has the opportunity to think about its educational vision for all the children in the area covered, including, for example, whether the number and type of pupil places across an area are right. Groupings can consist of an entire authority or part of one. Where it makes sense, groupings can also cross authority boundaries where those authorities wish to collaborate.
</p>

<a name="50111h05_para27">Medway did not ask to be included in the first wave of BSF, which was announced in February 2004, but it expressed an interest in coming into the programme after wave 1. However, compared with other groups of schools put forward by other authorities around England, Medway&#039;s schools did not have enough need to be included in waves 2 or 3, which we announced in November. The further 20 projects, which will access funding by 2007&#150;08, all have greater overall need than Medway as a whole.

<p>
<a name="50111h05_para28">My hon. Friend asked about the comparison with Gravesham and suggested that the two areas are broadly similar in character. It is worth pointing out that because of the sheer size of Kent LEA, the two will come into BSF at different stages. Gravesham was the first priority area. In a broad sense, my hon. Friend is right, but schools in Gravesham have a greater need than those in Medway, according to both the indicators that we used. The percentage of pupils with 5 GCSEs at A* to C for Medway schools is 47.9, whereas for Gravesham the figure is 42.5 per cent. On free school meal eligibility, the figures are 10.2 per cent. for Medway and 16.5 per cent. for Gravesham. That explains the technicalities of how Kent&#039;s bid for the project in Gravesham was deemed to have a higher priority than that for Medway.

<p><a name="50111h05_spnew1"><b> Jonathan Shaw </b> : I am not disputing the figures; I said only that there are similarities between the two areas. However, without question, the most deprived area in Kent is Thanet. I am trying to understand what importance, if any, my hon. Friend&#039;s Department has attached to the Thames gateway and the special circumstances to which I referred.
</p>




<p><a name="50111h05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Twigg </b> : I was coming to that. We have sought a consistent set of criteria across the country and we decided that, for ease of understanding and clarity, the combined indicator of GCSEs and free school meals was the best. For the reasons set out by my hon. Friend, a particular challenge exists with respect to the authorities that are part of the Thames gateway. There will be opportunities, through basic need funding and the

targeted capital fund, for some effects of the increased demand for pupil places that the Thames gateway will bring to be met before authorities such as Medway become part of BSF.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para29">We recognise that uncertainty is damaging to good planning by authorities and schools. That is why we wanted in November to give the authorities not in waves 1, 2 or 3 a broad indication of where they were likely to start in BSF. As my hon. Friend said, Medway is likely to join the programme between 2011 and 2016. We cannot give greater certainty this far in advance, but that is indicative planning information, which must be subject to future public spending decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para30">I would not want to mislead Medway into thinking that it has a definite and predetermined slot, but we have made it clear that the Government are committed to completing BSF within 10 to 15 years. Officials will meet local authorities, including Medway, in the coming months to discuss the issue in further detail. That meeting will give the authority an opportunity to put to our officials some points that my hon. Friend has raised today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para31">We have also announced that authorities, including Medway, that are not in the full programme by 2011 will receive capital to enable them to rebuild or remodel at least one of their secondary schools with the greatest need, either through the academies programme or through additional funding via the targeted capital fund. To support local education authorities in their planning, the meetings that I have just described will deal with capital strategy and consider the investment needs of each local community in greater detail. I sympathise with the fact that Medway&#039;s secondary schools will not immediately get the investment that some of them need. Despite the generosity of the education settlement, the scale of the need nationwide is enormous.

<p>
<a name="50111h05_para32">I mentioned the substantial capital support of &#163;45 million that has been allocated to Medway schools over the next three years. That sum can be used for their priorities. In addition, Medway can take up the offer of funding for its neediest school, and I have encouraged it to do so. I am sure that my hon. Friend will do the same. I understand that plans are already being developed locally for an academy: more than one school might be able to benefit from the academy route. It will be for Medway to bid to the revised targeted capital fund for any further priority projects. We hope to publish our guidance on this fund next month.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para33">Direct Government funding is not the only resource available to Medway and other authorities for priority investment in their schools. Medway has the flexibility to decide how to use all capital delivered from the single capital pot, not just that which comes direct from the Department for Education and Skills. Therefore, if education is its priority, Medway can direct further capital towards schools, if it wishes. It should also ensure that it maximises all its section 106 planning gains. I think my hon. Friend will accept that that gives Medway real options, and I hope that it will explore all of them. I give him an undertaking that our officials will give whatever support they can to ensure that that can happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50111h05_para34">I congratulate my hon. Friend again on raising this important issue. I believe that building schools for the future represents a tremendous opportunity to deliver improvement. We must have a system for prioritising, but there are a number of other ways in which we can get the extra capital needed into the schools in Medway. I look forward to working with him and the other two Medway MPs to ensure that that can be done over the months ahead.
