Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development
(Mr. Gareth Thomas):</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to
debate this issue under your chairmanship, Lady Winterton. It is an
important topic that has concerned many in our constituencies, many of
whom have been part of the Make Poverty History campaign, and it is of
considerable importance to the developing countries that are part of
the African, Caribbean and Pacific
grouping.</p><p><a name="06060867000008">Increasing
trade will be essential to achieving the economic growth that is
necessary to meet the millennium development goals and lift millions
out of poverty. Trade Minister after Trade Minister from developing
countries emphasised that exact point at the World Trade Organisation
talks in Hong Kong in December. Ghana&#146;s trade Minister, for
example, said:</p><a name="06060867000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is no longer a
matter of public debate anywhere in the world that trade is indeed the
most powerful engine of growth, particularly for poor
countries.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060867000009">A
further example to support that point is the case of Malawi, which has
a total Government budget of some $730 million. Donors provide a
further $500 million. Realistically, that is nowhere near enough money
if Malawi is to deliver the better health and education that its
citizens deserve and which its Government want to provide for them.
While donors can, and no doubt will, increase their aid budgets for
Malawi, what it really needs in the long term is sustained economic
growth to generate the taxation revenues. To do that it needs the
trading opportunities that are fundamental to economic growth. Clearly,
economic growth and more trade are not enough. The distribution of the
benefits of the economic growth, and making sure that the growth is
sustainable, are essential elements too. However, greater trade will be
fundamental if we are to see the progress that we want towards the
millennium development
goals.</p><p><a name="06060867000010">An ambitious
pro-development Doha round could of course also play a key role in
increasing global trade, potentially by hundreds of billions of
dollars. Work on the multilateral trade negotiations&#151;the Doha
development agenda&#151;continues, as the House will be more than
aware. The Government continue to press for the deadline for the Doha
development agenda to be met, and for an ambitious pro-development
outcome to the current round of talks. We continue, in 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 148WH</b><br>particular, to urge all WTO members to play their part in ensuring that
that opportunity to help developing countries will be
seized.</p><p><a name="06060867000011">Although the
Doha round has generated most attention in recent months, the potential
contribution that economic partnership agreements&#151;EPAs, as they
are affectionately known&#151;could make to development and poverty
reduction in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries must not be
underestimated. Last year, the Make Poverty History campaign rightly
highlighted the economic and social dislocation that poorly designed
and over-speedy trade liberalisation can lead to. The Government have
made it clear that we will not force trade liberalisation on developing
countries, either through trade negotiations or aid conditionality. I
believe, however, that for developing countries, trade reform that is
carried out under the right conditions and is well integrated with
poverty reduction strategies or national development plans can bring
considerable growth opportunities and benefits for the world&#146;s
poor.</p><p><a name="06060867000012">Economic
partnership agreements between the EU and ACP countries are not simply
regional trade agreements. They have the potential to be much
more&#151;to be genuine tools for development. The Cotonou agreement,
which sets the framework for the EPAs, clearly states that the EU-ACP
partnership will focus on the objectives of poverty reduction,
sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP
countries into the world economy.</p><p><a name="06060867000013">Agreements in the different ACP
regions are likely to take different shapes and forms. Countries,
obviously, have varied interests, and national development plans have
different focuses on occasion. To return to the example of Malawi, EPAs
offer it the immediate prospect of greater regional trading links with
its neighbours and, as a result, larger markets in which its business
people and private sector can sell their produce. Malawi could also
benefit from an agreement, as part of the EPA negotiations, making it
less difficult to comply with the EU&#146;s non-tariff barriers, such
as high standards; or, indeed, it could perhaps benefit from relaxed
restrictions on where its producers are allowed to source inputs for
products that they are already good at exporting to the EU&#151;the
so-called rules of origin. A country such as Jamaica, which is in the
Caribbean group, has strong interest in access to the service markets
of the European Union, for example. Such access has the potential to
increase the incomes of people employed in those sectors in
Jamaica.</p><p><a name="06060867000014">If the full
potential of EPAs for development and poverty reduction is to be
realised, it will be essential to negotiate them with the full
co-operation of the Governments of the ACP countries and their regional
bodies. They should be able to decide what is or is not included in
their EPA, through analysis of what they can do in their own contexts,
appropriate policy dialogue and consultation and informed
choices.</p><p><a name="06060867000015">When we made
clear our position on EPAs in March last year, our position paper did
not reflect, by any stretch of the imagination, the views of all
European member states or indeed the Commission. However, more than a
year later, I believe that our position paper has had a significant
impact. By taking a strong public stance, we have brought much
needed-attention in the 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 149WH</b><br>European Union to the negotiations. Just over a year ago, EPAs hardly
figured on the radar of most EU member states. That is not true now. We
have raised the profile and importance of the negotiations. During our
presidency, EPAs were discussed regularly in several different European
groups, including a new technical expert group dedicated to EPAs alone.
Those discussions, both formal and informal, have led to results in the
form of Council conclusions on EPAs, which were agreed on 10 April this
year by all 25 EU member
states.</p><p><a name="06060867000016">The
conclusions highlighted again the need for the Commission to take into
account the choices of the ACP countries in negotiating the agreements.
That includes choice about any aspect, such as whether investment,
services or competition should be included. The conclusions reiterated
the need for flexibility to be built into the agreements and for the
ACP countries, crucially, to receive substantial improvements in access
to EU markets. They suggested concrete ways to take forward discussions
on development assistance for supporting the implementation of EPAs.
They also gave a steer on how the critical review of EPAs that is due
this year should be conducted to be most effective. The motivation of
all member states to put development at the heart of EPAs has now been
made clear to all stakeholders in the ACP countries and in the European
Union and, crucially, the Commission.</p><p><a name="06060867000017">We are not complacent and do
not think that those conclusions alone will deal with people&#146;s
concerns about the way in which the negotiations are going. We are
working on other areas to ensure that the EPA process moves in a
positive direction. First, we are using all the opportunities that we
have to maintain close contacts with the ACP grouping and to hear from
it directly its views and concerns about the process. My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State has met chief ACP negotiators, and I too
have discussed EPAs with ACP Ministers&#151;most recently on a visit
to the Caribbean.</p><p><a name="06060867000018">Our
overseas posts also stay in close contact with their ACP hosts to
ensure that we understand in detail how the negotiations are seen in
developing country capitals and that we can identify and act on any
particular needs that they have. For example, we recognise the concern
about the capacity of ACP countries to engage in the negotiations.
Through the in-country offices of the Department for International
Development, we are supporting significant numbers of technical
assistance programmes for many of the ACP countries and regions. We are
supporting independent experts in the Caribbean region in deciding
which goods are of interest to them in the EPA negotiations. That will
include preparing analysis and facilitating technical discussions
between regional negotiators and each of the Governments in the region.
That will help the region as a whole, because Ministers will be
presented with options and be able to make informed decisions about the
negotiating positions that they should take.</p><p><a name="06060867000019">I should make it clear that in
providing support across the ACP regions, we are acting very much at
the request of the countries involved. We will continue to 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 150WH</b><br>make sure that our assistance is co-ordinated with what other donors are
doing to support the EPA process.</p><p><a name="06060867000020">Secondly, we continue to build
the evidence base for the negotiations. We are supporting good,
high-quality and impartial research that helps to inform the approach
taken by the ACP countries and the European Union to the negotiations
on key development issues, and that has made a difference to the policy
debate on EPAs. One recent piece of research that we supported, for
example, highlighted the potential difficulties faced by ACP countries
in each region in agreeing which EU imports are sensitive to them. As a
result of that research, ACP negotiators are now working on how to take
each other&#146;s sensitivities into account in a way that will not
undermine their goals for greater regional integration.</p><p><a name="06060867000021">Thirdly, we will continue to
press our position with the Commission and other European Union member
states, particularly those with forthcoming presidencies, to build
support for our position on EPAs. Fourthly, we are working closely with
ACP countries, EU member states and the Commission to focus on the key
milestone for the negotiations this year&#151;the review process.
Until 10 April, we were worried that some wanted only a brief technical
review of the negotiations, but the Council conclusions that I
mentioned earlier directed the Commission to use the review as the
basis for a wider discussion of the challenges posed by all the trade
and development aspects of EPAs, and that is a key success. The review
is a key opportunity for the ACP countries to voice their concerns and
for the European Community and member states to recognise and act on
them well before the finalisation of any agreements. Clearly,
addressing those concerns will be paramount if the negotiations are to
be successful.</p><p><a name="06060867000022">I
should outline our three particular concerns about the state of play in
the discussions. As yet, there is no cross-EC agreement on what could
be offered to the ACP countries on rules of origin. Similarly, there is
as yet no agreement on offering duty-free and quota-free access to all
EPA groups&#151;something that we continue to argue should be offered
immediately to all ACP groupings. Our third concern is that
negotiations have proceeded particularly slowly in the four African
blocks, although, frankly, they are not racing ahead in the Caribbean
or Pacific groupings. It is obviously important that we get the process
right, but we need to bear in mind the consequences of not reaching
agreement on EPAs or, indeed, an alternative, given that the WTO waiver
comes to an end at the beginning of
2008.</p><p><a name="06060867000023">Another key
issue will be establishing whether any of the ACP countries will decide
not to join an EPA and to request an alternative trade regime. If any
ACP country does seek an alternative, we will work to ensure that that
alternative meets the criteria set out by the Cotonou agreement and
that no worse market access should be provided for that country. That
will mean ensuring that the level of EU tariffs and preferential rules
of origin, in EPAs or any alternative, are the same as, or indeed
better than, those currently offered tothe ACP.</p><p><a name="06060867000024">Finally, it is also critical
that we ensure that there is a productive partnership after the
agreements are signed; we cannot just walk away from the EPA process
when 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 151WH</b><br>negotiations are finally concluded. We will therefore work with the
European Union&#151;particularly the Commission&#151;and ACP
countries to design the monitoring mechanism for EPAs that both sides
have called for to ensure that the process is effectively
implemented.</p><p><a name="06060867000025">That was
just an overview of the work ahead on EPAs for the Government and, more
broadly, the Commission and member states. I hope that that provides
hon. Members with a sense of the depth of our commitment to ensuring
that EPAs are effectively designed and are genuine tools for
development. They will help a large group of developing countries with
which the EU has had a long-standing relationship to reap the benefits
of participation in the global economy. I shall of course attempt to
answer any questions that hon. Members
raise.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060867000124">2.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06060867000026"><b><a name="06060867000129">Mark
Simmonds (Boston and Skegness) (Con):</b> Like the Minister,
let me say how pleased I am to serve under you guidance yet again, Lady
Winterton.</p><p><a name="06060867000027">The first
thing that needs to be highlighted about economic partnership
agreements is the ambitious nature of the proposals that have been put
together. They are immensely complex, and the aim is to redefine the
trade regime between different regional groups of ACP countries around
the world. Most ACP countries&#151;there are 78 in total in Africa,
the Caribbean and the Pacific&#151;need significantly increased trade
to improve their economic growth rates and the well-being of many of
their citizens.</p><p><a name="06060867000028">As
the Minister mentioned, it was recognised that many ACP countries were
unable to profit from the Lom&#233; agreements, which were redefined
under Cotonou four or five years ago. In 2002, the ACP countries were
at the top of the pyramid of advantages offered by the EU to its
development partners, but they were none the less at the bottom of the
list when it came to exports to European markets. Indeed, the situation
was getting worse, not better. In 2003, just3 per cent. of the
EU&#146;s imports came from ACP countries, compared with 6.7 per
cent. in 1976.</p><p><a name="06060867000029">Before
I go into the specific questions that I hope the Minister will be able
to answer, it is important that I put on record the Conservative
party&#146;s position and beliefs as regards international trade
mechanisms. We obviously believe, as I think the whole House does, that
aid and debt relief are important and make significant contributions,
but they are not sufficient in themselves totally to alleviate poverty
across the world, as we would like. If the least developed nations are
to see a step change in their fortunes, there must be major reform of
world trade rules. My hon. Friends and I agree with the World Bank,
which
states:</p><a name="06060867000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Current
trade restrictions are the biggest impediment to economic advancement
and poverty reduction in the developing
world&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06060867000118">It must
also be said that international trade haslifted millions of
people out of poverty, particularly in south-east Asia and China.
Tragically, Africa in particular has been left behind, and its share of
world trade has fallen from 6 to 2 per cent. in the past decade,
despite the significant aid and assistance that has flowed into the
continent.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 152WH</b><br><p><a name="06060867000030">The economic benefits of greater
openness and freer trade are immense. Trade leads to faster growth
rates, cheaper imports, new technologies, stronger political ties and,
as the Minister rightly said, it enables Governments in developing
nations to generate revenue, which they can plough back into their
public services, improving health and education for the very people
whom they represent.</p><p><a name="06060867000031">It must also be said that
history is littered with protectionist follies. For every &#163;1
that is given to developing nations, they lose &#163;2 through
protectionism. Development is hindered by protectionism&#151;matching
one protectionist bloc with another is not the solution. Currently, we
have nothing like free trade in the world. When protectionism is
removed, those industries that have been protected fail to compete
internationally, and there are many examples of that from the past 40
or 50 years, including businesses in Latin America and the heavy steel
industry in India. Countries that pursued a freer trade agenda grew
faster than those that pursued protectionist
agendas</p><p><a name="06060867000032">Conservative
Members understand that there needs to be a transition period, because
total free trade cannot be established overnight. It must also be said
that tariffs can be beneficial for developing nations, assisting the
development of industry and generating revenue. The World Bank has
estimated that offering the EU duty-free access would incur losses to
sub-Saharan economies of 1 per cent. of their GDP and up to 10 per
cent. of Government revenue, which would clearly be disastrous and not
help sub-Saharan Governments to stand on their own two feet.</p><p><a name="06060867000033">The Conservative party welcomes
the objectives of EPAs. They are defined as the sustainable development
of the ACP states&#151;to which I shall return later in my
remarks&#151;their smooth and gradual integration in the world
market, and the eradication of poverty. If all that can be
achieved&#151;as I said, there is tremendous ambition behind the
proposals&#151;EPAs will be of great benefit to least developed
countries.</p><p><a name="06060867000034">The World
Bank believes that EPAs would encourage
the</p><a name="06060867000119"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;liberalisation of
services, provide for common product standards, and set up the
negotiation of investor protections, based on state-to-state ad hoc
arbitration of
disputes.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060867000035">I hope that
the Minister will say a little more about the arbitration of disputes
and what discussions have taken place, between the EU and the regional
blocs, and within those blocs. Clearly, different countries have
different aspirations and priorities.</p><p><a name="06060867000036">The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa has estimated that if EPAs were implemented as
outlined in the Commission&#146;s report, the gains to sub-Saharan
Africa alone from regional integration could be as high as $1.2
billion. EPAs have attracteda great deal of criticism,
particularly from non-governmental organisations and other
organisations. Much of it is not justified, but several issues rightly
raised by the NGO community and others who have an interest in this
area require
clarification.</p><p><a name="06060867000037">It has
been argued that EPAs have been criticisedfor not being
development-focused enough, despitethe fact that the
negotiations include all but nine ofthe world&#146;s LDCs.
The European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid
highlighted the 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 153WH</b><br>importance of sustainable impact assessments alongside EPAs. Will the
Minister explain the relationship between SIAs and EPAs, and whether
the knowledge and evidence gained through SIAs is being used to forge
and mould the EPA negotiations? Will he provide an update on their work
and their effectiveness in ensuring that development remains at the
heart of the negotiations? They should not just go down the road of
liberalising as fast as possible. There needs to be a mechanism that
ensures that the extra economic growth and wealth creation cascades
down to the maximum number of people in the regions and the individual
countries, thereby providing much needed poverty alleviation.</p><p><a name="06060867000038">The other issue that was
missing from the original EPA discussions concerned the mechanisms that
are used to ensure monitoring of the negotiations. It would be helpful
if the Minister said where the monitoring mechanisms have got to. It is
also clear that the negotiations are significantly behind schedule. He
rightly mentioned that in his opening remarks. It is alleged that there
is no way that the target date of mid-2007&#151;1 January 2008 at the
latest&#151;will be met. Will he say how far behind the negotiations
are? What structures and thought processes have been put in place to
speed them up? Of course, they must not be rushed through, and both
they and the agreements that are reached must be right, particularly
for the developing
nations.</p><p><a name="06060867000039">I shall now
explore the subject of the ACP countries that do not specifically have
negotiating capacity. Many of them are reliant on EU aid and funding
for their negotiating teams, which may impact on their ability to
negotiate objectively. There are also concerns about the ability of ACP
countries simultaneously to participate with limited resources in
negotiations for the Doha round, EPAs and the &#147;Everything but
Arms&#148; agreements, which are still going on. As the Minister
knows, in LDCs and ACP countries the same individual or small group of
individuals who are responsible for international negotiations are
often also responsible for internal trade. Many of them are much more
focused on improving trade within their country&#151;trying to get
the infrastructure in place so that people can bring their produce to
the markets&#151;and, rightly, on inter-regional trade rather than
necessarily on the global issues relating to the World Trade
Organisation.</p><p><a name="06060867000040">How will
the EU ensure that ACP countries get a deal that benefits them? That
does not necessarily occur, as was shown by the lack of take-up of the
&#147;Everything but Arms&#148; agreements, where the Cotonou
preferences were clearly better or easier to meet, and of greater
significance and importance to the developing nations. That was
primarily but not solely because of the rules of origin that were in
place, which the Minister rightly mentioned. I was disappointed to hear
him say that there were still disagreements within the European Union
and that rules of origin preferences were not being resolved.
Hopefully, the UK Government will continue to push for the UK view of
the way that the rules of origin need to
move.</p><p><a name="06060867000041"><b><a name="06060867000130">Mr.
Thomas:</b> Let me be clear about why we believe that there
has not yet been progress on the rules of 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 154WH</b><br>origin. It has been because there is an impact assessment being made of
the rules of origin in the review process which the European Commission
has rightly put in place. Frankly, that has taken longer than we would
have liked. We believe that we need to move forward with other member
states and with all the different bits of the Commission to reach
agreement on the negotiating position for the Commission on the issue.
I hope that that additional clarity is
helpful.</p><p><a name="06060867000042"><b><a name="06060867000131">Mark
Simmonds:</b> As always, the Minister is helpful and
constructive in his intervention. He will be aware of the urgent need
for us to find a resolution to the issue. It is hindering both
development from within the developing nations and inward investment by
the developed nations which wish to invest in those countries that they
deem suitable.</p><p><a name="06060867000043">I was
interested in the Minister&#146;s choice of words when he mentioned
the Doha development round. There seems little doubt that it is
faltering&#151;to put it politely. Many in the trade world believe
that there is little chance of reaching a comprehensive agreement, even
within the new time scale, which keeps being pushed back. I think that
our deadline is now either the beginning or end of July. Indeed, some
countries have begun negotiating bilateral trade agreements outside the
mechanism of the Doha trade round. The Asian countries are doing that,
as is the United States. The Minister and his colleagues in the
Department of Trade and Industry seem to be confident that they will
reach a solution, so why is the EU Trade Commissioner announcing that
he has ambitions to start negotiations for agreements with the
countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations, which I
understand is conditional on Burma&#146;s rightly being
excluded?</p><p><a name="06060867000044">What does
the Minister think are the chances of success for the Doha development
round, given the EU&#146;s reluctance to lower its steep barriers
against trade in farm products? I know that the Minister does not agree
with those; nor do the UK Government. There is still an enormous amount
of resistance from other European countries on that matter.</p><p><a name="06060867000045">One of the drivers for reform
of the Lom&#233; and Cotonou conventions was to ensure that EU-ACP
trade agreements were compatible with the WTO. However, as I said, it
looks like the Doha round will fail in some areas, if not in totality.
Is it possible that the EU-ACP agreement may exceed, in terms of
liberalisation, what was agreed by the WTO? That would cause problems
elsewhere in multilateral trade
agreements.</p><p><a name="06060867000046">Two sets
of negotiations are taking place simultaneously, despite the fact that
it has been generally agreed that it would be desirable to complete the
Doha round before beginning the EPA negotiations and discussions. If
the WTO round fails, would it be possible to build on where we have got
to on Doha&#151;even if there has not been a total
agreement&#151;rather than try to pre-empt and second-guess the
conclusions? Does the Minister think that there is a potential conflict
between the Doha WTO round and the EPA negotiations, and to which one
do the Government give
priority?</p><p><a name="06060867000047">The Minister
will hopefully be aware that there has been concern that the Cancun WTO
negotiations broke 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 155WH</b><br>down because of the so-called Singapore issues: competition policy;
transparency in Government procedure; trade and investment; and trade
facilitation. The EU has rightly been criticised for trying to include
those issues in EPAs. Will the Minister assure us that they will not be
included in any form and that they will be removed from the EPA
negotiations?</p><p><a name="06060867000048"><b><a name="06060867000132">Mr.
Thomas:</b> We have made clear our view that unless the
six negotiating blocs want the Singapore issues to be part of the
negotiations, they should not be part of them. It is clear that all the
negotiating blocs are keen to discuss trade facilitation, which is one
of the Singapore issues, and that at least one bloc&#151;the
Caribbean&#151;wants a discussion about investment. It must be for
the negotiating teams of the six blocs to decide whether they want to
discuss the so-called Singapore issues. If they do not, we are clear
that they should not be forced to have those discussions. That is the
position that, increasingly, other member states are taking. However,
when negotiating teams are up for those discussions&#151;and given
the benefits that agreement on those issues could bring to their
economies&#151;they should be supported in their negotiations. It is
for the negotiating teams to make that
call.</p><p><a name="06060867000049"><b><a name="06060867000133">Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
clarification, but it is interesting that not all EU countries in the
new structure that must be brought on board are in agreement with what
the Minister said about the Government&#146;s position. We agree with
the Government&#146;s position and hope that the Minister and his
colleagues will continue to try to persuade those in the EU who require
persuading to follow the Government&#146;s position rather than their
own agendas.</p><p><a name="06060867000050">The Trade
Commissioner said that there will be a new monitoring mechanism to
oversee capacity-building, technical expertise and logistics projects
that are part of the EPAs. Again, it would be helpful if the Minister
could say when those monitoring mechanisms will be established, what
sort of bodies will have an input, and whether they will be
independent. Hopefully, the monitoring bodies will have significant
input from the developing nations. How will the Government ensure that
they identify areas where eradication of poverty has been hindered
rather than helped by the issues that I mentioned earlier and about
which the Trade Commissioner talked?</p><p><a name="06060867000051">The Trade Commissioner also
said that EPAs will include significant development aid and technical
assistance both from the EU budget and individual member states. It
would be helpful to know whether that is the case and, if so, what
funds DFID intends to put into the EPA system for the development aid
proposals. Will it be an increasing programme over a number of
years&#151;the thought process may still be going on&#151;and what
will be the time scale? Will it begin in 2008 and will it happen prior
to the agreements being reached, if they are
reached?</p><p><a name="06060867000052">I want to
explore one or two other areas and the first is asymmetric
liberalisation. The EU has stated that the opening of ACP markets to EU
goods and services will be on an asymmetric basis, which means that ACP
countries will be able to open their markets to the EU at a slower rate
than the EU will open their markets to 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 156WH</b><br>ACP countries. How will that rate be decided and on what time scale will
the markets be opened up? Does the Minister have a view on how that
should be done? Will it be industry by industry, region by region or
country by country?</p><p><a name="06060867000053">Every country will have
different industries that they want to benefit from the proposal. It
will be an enormously complex challenge to reach an agreement between
countries in a region and for them to agree on their relationship with
the EU. Clearly, that must be evidence-based, but the original time
scale is challenging. Five years from 2002 is the end of 2007, although
I understand that the Trade Commissioner has said, ambitiously, that he
wants agreement prior to that date, so that means the summer of 2007.
It will be extremely challenging to get that agreement by
then.</p><p><a name="06060867000054">We recognise
that &#147;Everything but Arms&#148; is a non-reciprocal agreement,
unlike EPAs, but the two agreements affect many of the same countries
and the EBA agreements cut across the EPA regions, offering countries
within EPA regions different deals. Where have the thought processes
got to in unravelling that complexity? The best explanation that I
heard was the Trade Commissioner&#146;s describing the complexities
as a Russian doll&#151;when one layer is removed, another appears
underneath. Does the Minister agree that EPAs and EBA agreements could
cause conflict and confusion, or is there a strategy to try to unravel
those two areas of trade negotiation and agreement?</p>

<p><a name="06060867000055">The ACP countries must create
the conditions in which a market economy can develop and thrive: the
rule of law, stable Governments and the establishment of private
property rights. In our view, EPAs hold great promise and could be
extremely beneficial to the ACP countries involved. However, the
success of EPAs depends on negotiating a fair deal that does not
disadvantage developing nations and creates a system in which
developing ACP nations have confidence. It is necessary to wrap up
within the EPAs targeted aid aimed at building trade capacity and
infrastructure, such as reliable energy sources, well maintained
transport networks and increasing technical expertise. All are
essential if the trade agreements are to
work.</p><p><a name="06060867000056">The
Conservatives support the objectives of EPAs, but they must be used to
help ACP countries access world markets while maintaining their
individual developmental and economic priorities, especially
facilitating and enabling inter-regional trade, which is one of the
main areas that has not been focused on sufficiently to
date.</p><p><a name="06060867000057">Poverty around
the world is at unacceptable levels. Nearly half the world's population
live on less than a dollar a day, 1 billion people do not have access
to clean water, 100 million children do not go to school, and 40
million people live with HIV/AIDS. All of us in the House have a moral
duty to take action. Trade is the best means of alleviating poverty in
a sustainable way in the developing world. If the Government lobby hard
to ensure that the developing world gets the best deal from the
proposed agreements, they will have our
support.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060867000125">3.7
pm</h5><p><a name="06060867000058"><b><a name="06060867000134">Mr.
Jeremy Browne (Taunton) (LD):</b> Thank you for calling me,
Lady Winterton. It is great pleasure to participate in this important
debate.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 157WH</b><br><p><a name="06060867000059">I start by saying on behalf of
the Liberal Democrats that there is a lot of consensus on this subject,
and the Government, and perhaps the Opposition parties, deserve some
credit for approaching it in that frame of mind. In many ways, Britain
has taken a lead among developed countries in promoting the agenda.
That is to our collective credit as a group of politicians here in
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06060867000060">The
Liberal Democrats instinctively support free trade. We have done so for
many decades and generations and do so today. It is the best means of
lifting people out of poverty because it increases prosperity through
increasing production.</p><p><a name="06060867000061">Clarks shoe company, near my
constituency in Somerset, has closed down its production facility,
although it still has people in administrative positions there. All its
production facilities have been exported to other parts of the world
and, sadly in many ways, no Clarks shoes are produced here in Britain.
Someone who supports more being done to alleviate poverty in the
developing world said to me recently that that is terrible&#151;that
it is exploitation. I replied that I was not so sure, because it cannot
be bad for Somerset that we have lost the jobs and bad for the
countries where factories are opening. It must be good for someone, and
I think that it is probably good for the countries to which the jobs
have gone, because it has given people new opportunities and prospects
for prosperity in relative terms to what they enjoyed
before.</p><p><a name="06060867000062">Globalisation
is often given a bad press and many features of it cause discomfort,
but the story is not uniformly bleak&#151;far from it. Globalisation
and free trade in goods and services has provided opportunities for
people, most notably in big and expanding developing economies such as
China and India, to gain access to income and prospects that are far
better than those that their parents and grandparents enjoyed. My party
starts from the assumption that free trade is a beneficial consequence
of political activity, and we seek to promote it as far as that is
possible.</p><p><a name="06060867000063">In that
regard, I have much sympathy with the position put forward jointly by
the Department for International Development and the Department for
Trade and Industry in their submission to the International Development
Committee&#146;s inquiry. The Government said:</p><a name="06060867000120"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Government&#146;s
view is that in the longer-term, prospects for economic growth and
development in ACP countries will be boosted if they open their own
markets. Poor consumers in ACP countries stand to benefit from cheaper
imports, from other ACP countries as well as from the EU, as do ACP
businesses. These gains will not accrue if ACP states fail to
liberalise their
economies.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060867000064">That is a
clear-cut position, reflecting a reasonable consensus in this House.
The Departments continue:</p><a name="06060867000121"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;However, neither will
they materialise if liberalisation is implemented without careful
consideration of the poverty and social impact of trade reforms. Social
safety nets and transitional assistance will be essential to cushion
the most vulnerable and to assist ACP producers exploit new trading
opportunities.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060867000065">The
reason I mentioned the second part of that submission is that it brings
us to the nub of the debate. We accept that free trade is beneficial
and that it is a route to greater prosperity for people in the poorer 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 158WH</b><br>parts of the world as well as those in more advanced countries. However,
there are many caveats and qualifications to that, and I shall run
through some of them.</p><p><a name="06060867000066">The British Government and the
European Union have a variety of objectives that can conflict, or at
least do not always align. The EU, rightly, has a goal of trying to
increase the prosperity and well-being of people who live in the
European Union. The EU&#146;s share of world prosperity, projecting
decades ahead, is to fall dramatically. Within a few decades, the EU is
likely to enjoy only half of its current percentage of the
world&#146;s overall wealth. That must be important, and even of
concern, to Governments within the EU and to the EU
collectively.</p><p><a name="06060867000067">Part of
the European Union&#146;s business must be to ensure that we improve
living standards in Europe. That is an EU objective. Another EU
objective is, rightly, to try to foster and assist poverty alleviation
in parts of the world where, relative to us, people live in desperate
straits, and to be an outward-looking rather than an inward-looking
organisation. Those two objectives do not always align.</p><p><a name="06060867000068">It is also important for the EU
to recognise that when it interacts and deals with other countries
throughout the world, that is not a partnership of equals, because
those countries are far less likely to be able to bring weight to bear
on proceedings than member states, especially when we work
collectively. In support of that, I shall quote a telling passage from
the Committee&#146;s report:</p><a name="06060867000122"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There appears to be an
assumption within the UK Government and the European Commission that
the ACP can sign up to, or reject, whatever they wish. This is not the
case. The ACP states remain recipients of EU aid, some of which funds
ACP negotiating capacity. The ACP nevertheless lacks the negotiating
capacity of the EU and is stretched to negotiate simultaneously in the
WTO and other regional negotiations. The ACP is also economically weak
compared to the EU: it has very little to offer the EU and potentially
much to gain from the negotiations. The collective ACP stake in the
partnership negotiations is therefore significant. The negotiating
process should be undertaken with this disparity in power in
mind.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06060867000069">We are entering a
process to find a good deal and a mutually beneficial deal, but we are
not doing so as though we were negotiating with a partner that has
equal presence in that debate. A balance needs to be struck, and it
requires skill and political sensitivity.</p><p><a name="06060867000070">I should like the Minister to
touch on a few other areas when he winds up the debate. The
transitional period was what the Conservative spokesman, the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds), called the time between
the current arrangements and absolute free trade. Most people, even the
most enthusiastic exponents of free trade, would accept that if one
opens the markets in one go, one potentially swamps the countries that,
as part of one&#146;s policy, one seeks to assist. The consequences
might be the opposite of what one intended when one embarked on that
policy.</p><p><a name="06060867000071">Will the
Minister provide us with an accurate timetable for the transition? As I
understand it, some people have talked about 10 years, and others 20
years. We might not be able to be definitive, but it would be
interesting to receive an indication of how long the process will run.
Some people might be concerned that it will never end, and that we will
end up with a 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 159WH</b><br>halfway-house arrangement. In many ways that might be beneficial for a
long period, but I should be interested to know the end point that the
Minister seeks to reach, and how long he anticipates it will take to
reach it. I should also be interested to know what progress the
Government have made on the issue in discussions with other EU member
states, and whether there is any consensus in the EU about how long the
transitional arrangements will ideally exist.</p><p><a name="06060867000072">On a separate point, it is also
important that we in the developing world do not think of opening up
free markets as a solution in itself. When I talk to people with
considerable expertise in the field, I am always struck that countries
with low GDP have difficulty developing their economy&#146;s
infrastructure, a proper banking system and proper accountancy methods.
They all involve professions that countries such as Britain
occasionally take for granted&#151;in fact, we occasionally scorn
those who undertake such jobs, considering them to be mundane. However,
they are important for any economy to function effectively, and without
those procedures, legal frameworks, and banking systems, and without
people having property rights, it is difficult for them to borrow money
and get companies up and running.</p><p><a name="06060867000073">Too often, when we discuss
developing countries, people&#146;s first idea is farming and
agriculture. In many countries farming is important, and for anybody
with a low income, it is the most important industry of all; however,
no country will prosper in the long term if it thinks of its economy in
those terms. We must also try to develop a range of economic
sectors&#151;wealth-generating parts of their economy that require
more than subsistence farming, but instead require people to invest and
borrow money, employ staff, pay their taxes and administer themselves
effectively, so that they are in a position to export and produce goods
and services that we in more prosperous countries throughout the world
wish to buy. Often, the benefits that the EU, the United States and
elsewhere can bring to bear takethe form of expertise rather
than the other skills that we might seek to export instead.</p><p><a name="06060867000074">I do not know whether the
Minister would like to touch on this final point, but about a year ago
there was much debate about the role of good governance in the
increasing prosperity of countries with low GDP. In the past few weeks
the inflation rate in Zimbabwe, to pick the most obvious example, has
reached 1,000 per cent., and unemployment, by some estimates, is as
much as 70 per cent. By any criteria, that is an economy that is in
total and utter disarray.</p><p><a name="06060867000075">I have a personal interest,
because I lived in Zimbabwe for a year and a half when I was a child of
10 and 11, so I have an emotional attachment to the county. In every
way, it ought to be a successful country. The arguments have been
rehearsed in this Chamber many times, and I shall not rehearse them
again, but my point is that there can be as much free trade, as much
export of expertise and skills in the areas that I mentioned, such as
banking and accountancy, and as much direct financial aid as possible,
but if it is squandered, the likelihood is that people in that country
will not benefit. In Zimbabwe, where, according to all indicators,
people are living in wretched circumstances and abject poverty directly
as a result of the actions of their own Government, we have 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 160WH</b><br>a moral duty to intervene. In the case of Zimbabwe, I appreciate that
that is easier said than done; it is difficult to bring pressure to
bear on Zimbabwe in a meaningful way, as there are all kind of
practical obstacles.</p><p><a name="06060867000076">None the less, there is a wider
point about encouraging good governance, not only in countries that are
resistant, such as Zimbabwe, but in the many other countries that would
actually like assistance with their infrastructure, administration and
government. We in this country may be able to assist in making sure
that the money that they raise through improving trade&#151;or
through aid, for that matter&#151;is spent more effectively and is
more likely to benefit the recipient. That would be a valuable aspect
of Government
policy.</p><p><a name="06060867000077">I conclude
with the thought that we in this country have a duty to provide aid for
countries that need our assistance; everyone accepts that. The
Government are to be congratulated on establishing a Department devoted
purely to that task. The issue has been afforded much more attention
than was the case five or 10 years ago. I have only been a Member of
Parliament for just over a year, and I am struck by the amount of
correspondence that I receive on the subject. I have also met a lot of
delegations, made up of people who take a keen interest in this area of
government, who have come to Parliament all the way from my
constituency, 150 or so miles away. The Government deserve to be
congratulated on having played a part in raising those levels of
consciousness and stimulating them further, for being imaginative in
their support for aid policy, and for trying to progress the debate on
trade and growth.</p><p><a name="06060867000078">I
wish the Minister and the Government well in their dealings with the
European Union. I hope that they will continue to take what it is
reasonable to describe as a leadership role, but will also take some of
the points raised in this debate, and use them to be still more
effective in
future.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060867000126">3.23
pm</h5><p><a name="06060867000079"><b><a name="06060867000135">Mark
Lazarowicz (Edinburgh, North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</b> This
is indeed an important debate onan important subject,
particularly for developing countries. It is fair to say that if a
network of economic partnership agreements is eventually established,
it will be probably be more significant for relations between the EU
and ACP countries than the original Lom&#233; convention, which was
drawn up some decades
ago.</p><p><a name="06060867000080">I agree with
everything that has been said about the potential gain for developing
countries, including the poorest, from an expansion of trade. There is
no doubt that developing countries stand to make a particular gain from
an expansion of trade, and such expansion will be important if we are
to have any hope of reaching the millennium development goals. Free
trade can be an immense opportunity for developing countries, but as
has been mentioned, free trade also has to be fair trade, and the
relationship must have beneficial, not negative, consequences for
developing
countries.</p><p><a name="06060867000081">In some of
the time available this afternoon, I want to put on record issues that,
as I am sure that the Minister and the various Front-Bench spokesmen
will be aware, have been raised by developing countries and 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 161WH</b><br>non-governmental organisations concerned with these matters. I hope to
get a response in those areas, and some expansion as to Government
policy in them.</p><p><a name="06060867000082">Let us
not forget what is being asking for. Ultimately, we are asking
producers in ACP countries to put themselves in direct competition with
European competitors, who in many cases will have had decades of
subsidies, support and protections from their Governments, in which
they have been able to build up strong, competitive industries. We want
ACP countries to be able to compete on fair terms with those producers,
and it is important that the transition to that new trading
relationship benefits the ACP countries. We are all aware of the danger
that, if we simply open up markets in developing countries, products
from Europe will flood those markets, and even existing industries and
producers in ACP countries will lose out; it will be a question not of
benefit to those developing countries, but of actually setting the
relationship back.</p><p><a name="06060867000083">The
issues about which many developing countries and NGOs are concerned
have been made well known to Members of the House, so I shall not set
them out in great detail, but describe them in headline terms. There is
concern in some quarters that even the loss of tariff income could be
important for some ACP countries, because it would have an effect on
their Governments&#146; expenditure on social provision, particularly
health and education. There is a concern that once ACP countries have
entered into economic partnership agreements, their ability to change
their own trade and development strategies in future to take account of
changing circumstances will be limited.</p><p><a name="06060867000084">Above all, I have already
referred to the concern that ACP countries could find themselves unable
to protect their domestic producers and infant industries from EU
imports&#151;not just imports without any EU subsidy or assistance,
but imports that are actually subsidised in various ways, whether
indirectly or directly, by EU countries. The consequences for infant
industries and domestic producers in ACP countries could be
severe.</p><p><a name="06060867000085">Concerns have
been expressed about what can be described as the premature lowering of
import tariffs in Ghana and Senegal on products such as tomato paste,
chicken parts and meat. It is suggested that there was a subsequent
flood of cheap European products undercutting locally produced goods,
causing factories that added value to local produce to close, and
causing hardship in poor rural communities where livelihoods depended
on the sale of surplus
food.</p><p><a name="06060867000086">Concern has
already been raised about the Singapore issues. I certainly welcome the
Government&#146;s clear statement that they will not take an approach
that insists on the Singapore issues as part of negotiations, but I am
sure that the Minister will appreciate that it is one thing to make
that statement at European Council meetings, and another for it to be
immediately put into effect. When a series of detailed negotiations are
taking place, the Singapore issues can be pressed much more strongly
than the Government would wish, through the back
door.</p><p><a name="06060867000087">Concerns about
the capacity and ability of some trade negotiators, including regional
secretariats and ACP trade negotiators, to engage in equal negotiations

<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 162WH</b><br>with the EU have already been mentioned. I know that the Government and
the EU have given some support to try to level the playing field for
those negotiations, but more needs to be done. It would be interesting
to hear today what steps the Minister thinks can be taken to secure a
level playing field in the negotiations not only for the EPAs but for
the World Trade Organisation, and to hear how some levelling of the
playing field can be achieved by providing resources to the negotiators
from the ACP fund.</p><p><a name="06060867000088">It
has already been suggested from across the Floor that one of the issues
is who leads for the EU in negotiations. The suggestion has certainly
been made by some in the development lobby that the development wing in
the EU institutions&#151;to put it in those terms&#151;does not
have the same input as those concerned with trade policy. Those are
important concerns, which mean a substantial review of the approach
taken to the EPA to date is required. That is why I welcome what the
Minister has said regarding the review of the EPA negotiation process
and it would be interesting to hear&#151;either today or
later&#151;about the terms that the Government think the review must
comprehend to ensure that it is not just a &#147;light&#148;
review, as the European Commission originally described it. We want to
know a bit more about how extensive that review process can
be.</p><p><a name="06060867000089">It is a difficulty
in all the negotiations about the EU&#146;s relationships with ACP
countries and the developing world more generally that there is a
tendency for the Government or others in the EU to take a position
about the direction in which they want to go, only for it to change
somewhat when it comes to detailed negotiations. We then have to wait
for an intervention by the Secretary of State or someone else to get
the negotiations back on course. I am interested to hear how the
Minister envisages the development of the review process. Will he
reassure us that as far as possible, the Government, along with our
European partners, will keep a grip on the review
process?</p><p><a name="06060867000090">I shall make
my final point briefly because some of my original points have already
been made. I would like to know how we can meet the objective of the
Cotonou process to ensure that the development of the new relationship
between the EU and the ACP countries involves not just Governments and
institutions, but civil society and parliamentarians at all
levels&#151;particularly those in the developing countries, but those
in the EU as well. That is an area where some progress still has to be
made.</p><p><a name="06060867000091">Britain is
perhaps an exception as far as the involvement of civil society in
debates on this issueare concerned. Like the hon. Member for
Taunton(Mr. Browne) and most other hon. Members, I know that
the public&#146;s interest in these issues is deep, wide ranging and
considerable, and it forms one of the largest single elements of the
correspondence and contact I have with constituents. That is not the
case in all EU countries, and an important task must therefore be
undertaken to ensure that these discussions and negotiations involve
wider civil society.</p><p><a name="06060867000092">I
shall make one further point, if I may, given that there is a bit of
time available, about the process that we take part in during such
debates, and the involvement of wider civil society in the terms to
which I referred. I am not sure at whom my comments should 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 163WH</b><br>be directed&#151;the Government or even the Chairmen&#146;s
Panel&#151;but I note that our position in discussing this Select
Committee report is not untypical. The report began in the Select
Committee in November 2004 and reached the end of the Committee process
in March 2005. The Government responded quickly in June 2005, but for
all sorts of reasons, we have finally got round to debating it in the
House in June 2006.</p><p><a name="06060867000093">As
it happens, that may have caused a problem&#151;not a substantial
one, because, fortuitously, there is already a debate on the issues. I
have raised concerns elsewhere about the way in which we ought properly
to discuss such matters. I will not press the point further, but if we
are talking about involving parliamentarians in the wider process, as
well as Government, it may well be salutary for us, as
parliamentarians, to consider
that.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06060867000127">3.34
pm</h5><p><a name="06060867000094"><b><a name="06060867000136">Mr.
Thomas:</b> With the leave of the House, I shall try to answer
some of the questions and points raised during the debate. I hope both
Opposition spokesmen will forgive me if I start with the contribution
of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark
Lazarowicz), because he articulated a number of the underlying fears of
many of our constituents&#151;particularly in the NGO
community&#151;about how EPAs might turn out in practice. I hope that
I mention one or two things that will address the perhaps
understandable scepticism about the direction of travel of EPA
negotiations.</p><p><a name="06060867000095">One of
the reasons why the Government sought this debate&#151;I am grateful
to Mr. Speaker for allowing it to take place&#151;is to allow the
House to understand and discuss the way in which negotiations have
developed since our position paper was published in March last year.
Given that the Doha round of negotiations have understandably taken
considerable precedence in media, NGO and Government activity, we
wanted to use the debate to set out the considerable amount of work
that has been going on, often behind the scenes, to ensure that the EPA
negotiations genuinely deliver the development outcome that we think
they can.</p><p><a name="06060867000096">I shall
give some additional reassurance on Singapore issues. I have made clear
our position up front. We sought to persuade the vast majority of EU
member states and the Commission that forcing the discussion of
Singapore issues would not be possible, and would not be desirable in
any case. I believe that we have been successful in that. Our officials
who tracked the negotiations across Government&#151;whether in the
Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office or the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;and the Ministers
with responsibilities for the negotiations in those Departments, are
monitoring whether there has been any attempt to force discussion of
Singapore issues by a back-door mechanism. If there were, we would
oppose it. Our position, which I believe has prevailed, is that it is
genuinely for the negotiating teams of the six blocs to decide which,
if any, of the Singapore issues they want to be discussed. As I say,
trade facilitation is being discussed in all groups at their request,
and the Caribbean and the Pacific groups want to discuss investment,
too.</p><p><a name="06060867000097">My hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith is right to say that there
was a genuine 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 164WH</b><br>concern that some wanted just a light-touch review of how negotiations
have gone, as I outlined earlier. We made it clear that we wanted a
much fuller review of the negotiations, and the EU Council conclusions
from 10 April have made it clear that it wants a much fuller review.
Our position led to that genuine success and I welcome the support that
we have had throughout all member states.</p><p><a name="06060867000098">Regarding how the review might
progress, it is for ACP regional blocs, member states and the
Commission to feed in their assessments of it. One of the things we
discussed with at least one regional negotiating bloc country, which
might help in the review process, is the carrying out of independent
work in each of the different regional areas&#151;if the negotiating
blocs want it&#151;to feed into the review so that no one can say
that it is simply a further negotiating position by the regional bloc
or the EU. It will be genuinely independent. If the regional
negotiating teams want that, we are willing to consider supporting such
a process.</p><p><a name="06060867000099">I hope
that that provides further reassurance about the seriousness of our
intent in relation to the importance of the review. It is a
cross-Government position, so my right hon. Friends the Minister for
Trade and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as
Ministers in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, are also engaged in
watching how the negotiations
proceed.</p><p><a name="06060867000100">I come to the
usual battery of questions from the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness
(Mark Simmonds). His first question concerned how&#151;and, indeed,
whether&#151;arbitration of disputes would be needed. Let me be clear
that, to date, there are no such apparently intractable differences of
opinion between the EU and the ACP. If there were, we would think that
the best way to resolve them would be through independent negotiation,
perhaps facilitated by an independent arbitrator. I bring the hon.
Gentleman back to the review that will take place this year, which will
again provide an opportunity to see how matters are moving forward. I
hope to continue to build consensus around the direction so that there
will be no need to resolve such
disputes.</p><p><a name="06060867000101">The hon.
Gentleman also asked me about the relationship between sustainable
impact assessments and economic partnership agreements. He may be aware
that in the Council conclusions to which I have referred the need for
sustainable impact assessments is specifically mentioned. Some such
assessments have been conducted. Those that were done for the ACP are
confidential to the ACP grouping, and neither we nor the Commission
have seen their results. They are clearly designed to inform the
negotiating position of the ACP grouping. Some have been done for
member states and the Commission, which we have seen but which,
frankly, were not terribly informative. We are trying to work with the
Commission to come up witha more effective methodology for
further such assessments for precisely the reasons outlined by the hon.
Gentleman, so that we can properly understand what certain negotiating
positions and agreements might
mean.</p><p><a name="06060867000102">The hon.
Gentleman also asked how we will ensure that the benefits of the extra
trade that EPAs might deliver will be spread down to the very poorest. 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 165WH</b><br>Obviously, in the context of the specific EPA negotiations, it is
difficult to put in particular benchmarks. That is where the wider
context of development discussions with each developing country becomes
important and where work on national development plans and poverty
reduction strategies becomes crucial. That wider development dialogue
seeks, in effect, to extend the benefits of growth to the very poorest
in developing countries. That is where we can make sure that the
benefits of trade and economic growth are spread to those who most need
them.</p><p><a name="06060867000103">The hon.
Gentleman also asked me about monitoring mechanisms and whether they
will be independent. A key outcome that we secured in the Council
conclusions was the recognition that further work needs to be done on
the design of the monitoring mechanism, with not only the European
Commission but ACP Governments and stakeholders, for that very purpose.
We expect that to be ready by the time that any EPA comes to be
negotiated. Obviously, I will continue to keep hon. Members up to date
on the ongoing discussions on EPAs.</p><p><a name="06060867000104">The hon. Gentleman asked me how
negotiations might be speeded up, for want of a better phrase, and how
they linked to the Doha development round. He is right to say that the
Doha round negotiations are an important backdrop to the EPA
negotiations and will have a considerable impact on them, not least in
the context of the discussions on special and differential treatment,
which are very important in relation to whether particular problems
will develop from the food security issues that have been the concern
of some in the NGO community and some in-country capitals. The current
discussions on that in the Doha round will be particularly important in
the EPAs dimension.</p><p><a name="06060867000105">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
broad point was about how we can speed up the process. That is one
reason why it is crucial to have an extensive and full review of EPAs
this year and not just a light-touch review. We need to consider what
further progress is needed and what member states and the Commission
can do to support the negotiations more effectively, so that if
possible we get them to a stage at which they are ready for
implementation by the time the WTO waiver comes to an end.</p>

<p><a name="06060867000106">The hon. Gentleman is rightly
worried about the overload on the negotiators in each of the various
developing countries. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne) also
raised that issue, and they are right to raise that concern. The
pressure on a number of key Ministers and key officials in developing
countries is considerable, not least because of their importance to the
Doha round, EPAs, internal trade discussions, and bilateral trade
agreements that might be being negotiated within each region or with
key developed countries. We have sought to ease that capacity dimension
through our trade-related capacity building support. We have given
&#163;1.6 million to support the Caribbean regional negotiating
machinery in that process. We have also given &#163;8.9 million to
the southern and eastern Africa regional trade facilitation programmes,
and various other financial supports to the other negotiating blocs,
precisely to try to help with 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 166WH</b><br>some of the capacity constraints that hon. Members and people in the NGO
world have understandably drawn to our
attention.</p><p><a name="06060867000107">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness also asked me whether I still think that
the Doha round will be a success, and mentioned a speech made by
Commissioner Mandelson. There is no doubt that we are getting close to
the wire with the Doha round. It is clear that all the key blocs in the
negotiations know that there is potentially a huge prize with a
successful outcome to the Doha round, and that they recognise that all
blocs will have to give further ground. Clearly, it is necessary to
make some progress on the sequencing of revealing more details of the
final position of each country or bloc, which needs to happen quickly.
My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor and other key
Government members have all been involved in seeking to move those
negotiations forward. Commissioner Mandelson has made it clear that he
is still hopeful that there will be a successful outcome to the Doha
round, and we continue to work for such a conclusion both within our
discussions in Europe and, more broadly, on the international
stage.</p><p><a name="06060867000108">I do not
believe that there is a conflict between the EPA negotiations and the
Doha round negotiations, which is another concern that the hon.
Gentleman raised. Multilateral negotiations are always better for
individual developing countries, because developing countries coming
together to negotiate their positions inevitably strengthens them
against the big, regional negotiating blocs. Bilateral agreements offer
potential for countries to be bullied, and can mean that the best
possible outcome for those developing countries is not secured. Our
position is very much that multilateral negotiations are the best way
forward, which is why we continue to put as much political and official
effort into trying to secure the Doha round outcome that we
want.</p><p><a name="06060867000109">All Members
present asked about development assistance to support the
implementation of EPAs. I suspect that we will continue to provide
increasing development assistance to support the implementation of
EPAs. It is difficult to say how much will be required until we see
what the negotiations bring forth. As I indicated, we have been
spending an increasing amount on building trade-related capacity to
support negotiations across a variety of settings and on implementing
the outcome of those negotiations.</p><p><a name="06060867000110">We will provide money
bilaterally, and money will also be made available through the European
development fund. Hon. Members may know that the latest development
fund negotiations&#151;EDF 10&#151;were successful, with a 15 per
cent. real-terms increase in the size of the total. How those extra
resources will be allocated has yet to be decided, but there is clearly
a potential for further resources to be made available to implement the
EPAs once they are finally
negotiated.</p><p><a name="06060867000111">The hon.
Member for Taunton asked about the timing of any asymmetric
liberalisation&#151;how much time developing countries would need in
order to decide the pace at which they wanted to open up their markets.
Our policy to date&#151;in a sense, it was alluded to in the
Commission for Africa report&#151;is that 20 years is the essential
time frame, and that that time might be needed. It is possible that
complete opening up by ACP countries cannot be envisaged. Inevitably, 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 167WH</b><br>the length of time that it takes for markets to be opened up will vary
in each ACP group, so that is an important part of the
negotiations.</p><p><a name="06060867000112">World
Trade Organisation rules provide some flexibility. Part of our
negotiating position in the current round of WTO talks is to press for
further flexibility, but we know that there is likely to be resistance
to that from developing countries that are not taking part in the EPA
discussions, so we have to be realistic about the level of flexibility
that might be available. The EU Council conclusions that we secured on
10 April reinforced the need for more flexibility and asymmetry in the
final outcome&#151;an important point to bring home to
negotiators.</p><p><a name="06060867000113">I hope
that I have provided further reassurance to hon. Members about how the
negotiations are going, 
<br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 168WH</b><br>about the way in which Departments across Government are following those
negotiations and the seriousness with which we are taking those
discussions, and about the fact that we are working to persuade other
member states and the Commission of our position. We believe that EPAs
have a huge potential for good. They will help to facilitate economic
growth, which is crucial for tackling progress on the millennium
development goals. However, it is by no means a done deal, which is why
the review later this year will be so important. We will keep hon.
Members and people outside the House up to date on our
progress.</p><p><a name="06060867000114"><i>Question
