<a name="50405h01_head1"><h3 align=center>Door Supervisors</h3>




<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[<i>Mr. Watson</i>.]


</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Sir Nicholas Winterton): The first debate in Westminster Hall on this, the last Tuesday of this Parliament&#151;perhaps I am anticipating it, but I think not&#151; is on the registration of door supervisors, initiated by the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley).

</p>




<a name="50405h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Eric Illsley  (Barnsley, Central)</b>  (Lab): It is a pleasure to speak on such an important issue, and I hope that the debate gets the national publicity that it deserves&#151;although, as you said in your opening remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it could well be overshadowed by other events. None the less, it is an important issue and I am grateful for the opportunity to raise it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para0">The debate is about the registration of door supervisors, but it would be more apt to say that it is about the lack of registration of door supervisors, because that is the crux of the problem. For a number of reasons, which I shall detail in a moment, not enough individuals are coming forward to register as door supervisors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para1">Under the Private Security Industry Act 2001, door supervisors need a licence&#151;what those in the industry call a badge. All sectors of the leisure industry welcomed the Act; indeed, many of the companies in the industry helped draft it. It was a welcome piece of legislation, and its purpose was obvious&#151;to improve the calibre and quality of door supervisors, to provide them with training, and to improve the industry. Unfortunately, the Act is not working. Not all door supervisors are registering for a licence, and those who do apply are having to wait due to delays at the Security Industry Authority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para2">The SIA was set up to implement the legislation and to oversee the registration of door supervisors. However, the SIA and the police have taken the attitude that their patience is exhausted at the lack of people coming forward, and rather than look for solutions they seem intent on bringing prosecutions. That will make the situation worse because those door supervisors who are prosecuted will be precluded from holding a certificate for between two and five years. The shortage will thus become worse.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para3">The Government now face a difficult situation. Fewer than 20,000 door keepers have been certificated and licensed, but the Government are now implementing the Licensing Act 2003. As a result, every liquor licence in the country is due to be reissued. That comes at a time when the Government are already under pressure in respect of binge drinking. To allow a situation to arise in which pubs and clubs will be unable to find door 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 368WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
supervisors is a recipe for chaos. It will cause problems later this year; indeed, we are already hearing of shortages and their attendant problems.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para4">It is not a new problem. The issue has been flagged up practically since the 2001 Act was passed and its implementation dates announced. Although the closing date for the London area is 11 April&#151;to some extent, that has always been regarded as the deadline for implementing the whole Act&#151;the Act was in force for the best part of last year, and the first area to comply was Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. So prosecutions have been available to the police for the past 12 months, and the problems have been well documented and are well known; the Government and the SIA have known of them for two years. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) raised the issue in an Adjournment debate in the House in June 2004. He referred to the problems being experienced in the pilot area of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, and I shall refer to the same problems.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para5">Recently, a leisure company called Luminar supplied me with a file of correspondence that had passed between it and the SIA. It was a substantial volume of correspondence, which dated from 2003 and detailed all the issues to which I shall refer, including delays and the problems that we are storing up for later this year caused by the lack of door supervisors. Indeed, <i>The Publican Newspaper&#151;</i>the trade paper for the pub and club industry&#151;has been running a series of articles for some time highlighting the problems that we face.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para6">What are those problems? Why and how are they occurring? As of 10 February, the SIA had received 21,957 applications to register as a door supervisor. Of those, 17,035 were accepted as valid, 10,124 were granted and 872 were refused. The registration process started in March 2004, but only 10,000 certificates had been granted by 10 February. That is less than one door man per nightclub, leaving aside pubs, restaurants or anything else. That is the extent of the shortfall.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para7">Why are delays occurring? Why are door supervisors not coming forward to register? There have been many allegations that the SIA has caused delays, and, to some extent, that is true. There have been delays in issuing the certificates, or badges, as they are known in the industry. The SIA has always maintained that the average time needed to obtain a certificate is between four and six weeks. Obviously, to make the legislation work, there must be identity and criminal record checks. In reality, however, issuing a certificate can take anything between three and five months.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para8">Let me give an example. Since this debate was publicised, a Hertfordshire company known as Bradzone contacted me to tell me about its problems. It tried to help its door supervisors to complete their application forms, which were submitted to the SIA by mid-January. The company informed me last Friday that, in the vast majority of cases, it was still waiting for the certificates to be issued three months later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para9">There is a great deal of bureaucracy involved in applying for a certificate. The initial inquiry must be made by the applicant. Many door supervisors are employed by security companies, but companies are not allowed to assist them in completing or obtaining the forms; individuals must obtain the forms themselves, fill them in and send them off. They can obtain a form by visiting the website or using the telephone line. Quite 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 369WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
often, however, the line is busy and there is no facility to leave a message. The individual is simply put off. So it is difficult to obtain the forms in the first place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para10">There are also several stories of forms issued to and completed by individuals, and returned for relatively minor mistakes or, more likely, omissions. Some stories are legendary.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para11">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred in an Adjournment debate to a door keeper who told him that one of his staff had supplied a passport, a plastic and paper driving licence, a birth certificate and two household bills. His form was returned, marked &quot;insufficient identity&quot;. Door keepers and the leisure industry feel increasingly frustrated by the bureaucracy of the SIA.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para12">Another story, which is passing into folklore, is of forms being returned because the abbreviation &quot;UK&quot; has been used on the form instead of &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. Petty bureaucracy does appear to be involved in the completion of the form.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para13">The procedure is complex. The application form supplied by the SIA informs the individual that they must apply for a licence application form and booklet, complete the form, send the money and so on. It also says that the licence application form is returned to the individual part-completed. I have in my hand an application that was returned to an individual, but the only thing that has been completed is his name. Why the SIA cannot allow the individual to complete his own name on the application form is beyond me. Why can it not allow the forms to be issued in bundles or batches to door supervisory companies so that they can supply them to individuals to send back? I do not understand why the SIA insists on this part-completion, as they call it, of the form.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para14">It is not the easiest form to complete. It is the first form that I have ever seen that asks an individual to supply his surname in four separate sections: surname, family name at birth, any other surname used, alias surname and alias given name. It is quite a complex form, which takes some understanding. I should say that the forms are intended for door keepers, who used be known as bouncers. We are not giving them to Cambridge undergraduates. The nature of the industry does not lend itself to complex bureaucracy. The legislation is designed to improve the quality of our door supervisors, but we must address the bureaucracy of the system because it is discouraging people from applying.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para15">There is also the question of cost. There is a fee of &#163;190, which is non-refundable, to apply for a certificate. That is after an individual has completed his training course, which can cost up to &#163;400. Altogether, the whole process costs at least &#163;400 or &#163;500. Again, that is for door supervisors, who probably work part-time and whose main hours of work will probably be on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. They will probably earn about &#163;10 an hour, so the procedure is not cheap. This can be a disincentive to some door keepers, especially at a time of relatively full employment when they can seek work elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para16">According to the booklet, door keepers are disbarred from registration if they have convictions and cautions, but they can also be precluded from applying for a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 370WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
certificate if they have been warned about an incident or offence. The disqualifications and bureaucratic procedures have put off many door keepers, who probably thought from the outset that there was not much point in applying for a certificate. If they were convicted of affray or actual bodily harm years ago because of a scrap outside a nightclub when they were protecting the doors, they may think that there is no point in applying. We must consider the issue in the light of the fact that we are trying to improve the employment situation of door keepers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para17">The SIA could remove some of the bureaucracy and improve its functioning, but it is not responsible for all the delays. I referred earlier to the delays that are caused by the door keepers. By delays, I also mean their reluctance to apply. There is some debate as to whether enforcement of the Act will encourage door keepers to come forward to register or whether it will have the reverse effect. I am sure that some in the SIA, the Government and the industry believe that there will be a flood of applications once we reach the final deadline and prosecutions begin. My view is the opposite; prosecutions will discourage door keepers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para18">The industry estimates that it needs 100,000 door keepers to maintain the doors of clubs, pubs and other facilities throughout the country. The SIA estimates that 50,000 are needed. There is a huge discrepancy between those figures. In a June 2004 Adjournment debate, the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety referred to a requirement for 95,000. Even if we split the difference and say that 70,000 door keepers are required, we are more than 40,000 short at present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para19">After three years of the Act, which came into force in 2001 with all the attendant publicity, door keepers have not come forward to register. Applications have been invited in the first area since March 2004. Twelve months on, the SIA and the police have expressed to MPs in a recent meeting their impatience with the situation. Prosecutions have been occurring, but door keepers are still reluctant to apply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para20">There is a theory that door men are waiting for enforcement before applying. I am not sure that that theory works. I cannot see the point in a waiting to be prosecuted for not having a badge, knowing full well that such prosecution would preclude him from obtaining one. Door men are not waiting for prosecutions before they come forward to register. Instead, perhaps they are being deterred for the reasons that I referred to earlier. As I said, some door men who already have minor convictions may think that they will be precluded from obtaining a certificate and so do not apply. I also referred to the red tape and complications involved in filling in the form, and the cost.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para21">Complaints have been made by door keepers about their pay. Perhaps they are waiting for a crisis in the door supervisor industry that will force pay up from the present levels. That may prove to be a problem. The leisure industry will be chasing a scarce commodity, and door men who have the necessary certification will increase their charges unless the situation is remedied. The consumer will carry the can for that in higher door admission charges and drinks prices. I had a meeting last week with the director of a company that supplies door supervisors. He said, &quot;We are sitting back. Later this year, we will make a killing, as our door supervisors are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 371WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
badged and ready to move in.&quot; That will be an added cost to the industry. The nature of the employment is that it is casual and relatively dangerous compared to some. Legislation also requires a door keeper to wear a badge; once he is certificated, that is a condition of keeping the certificate. In some of the more dangerous areas, the idea of wearing a badge and turning away unruly or armed youths is not exactly an inviting prospect for some door supervisors, who do not want the people whom they turn away to be able to identify them. That is another reason for door keepers&#039; reluctance in coming forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para22">So, for all the reasons that I have outlined, there is a huge shortfall. At the moment, it is roughly a 40,000 shortfall, on best estimates, and that is a big problem. The attitude of the SIA and the police has so far not been helpful, in my view. In the Adjournment debate last June, the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have received the impression of arrogant, uncaring and out-of-touch officials in the SIA who are either ignoring advice or have been told to drive a policy through, regardless of the consequences.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16 June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 885.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para23">Even in the middle of last year, the SIA&#039;s attitude was brought into question, but that is exactly its attitude at present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para24">On 3 March in the House we had a lively meeting, organised by the parliamentary beer club, with representatives of the SIA, the leisure industry and some security companies. It seemed to me that the SIA was convinced that the only way forward was to prosecute those door keepers who had not applied for certificates. I believe that that will compound the difficulties. Last Saturday, I had a discussion with the licensing officer for South Yorkshire, who informed me that that weekend South Yorkshire police were going to target the pubs and clubs in Sheffield, Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham. In Sheffield they contacted 200 door supervisors to check their credentials&#151;42 were found not to have certificates and will be prosecuted. That is 42 fewer door supervisors just from last weekend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para25">In Barnsley, the police went to check the door supervisors. After the second had been checked, every other supervisor disappeared. There was not a supervisor on the doors in Barnsley at the time that South Yorkshire police began to mount the checks. That is not unusual. The stories date back to 1993, when every door keeper in Newcastle was stood down because of a particularly well-known incident in the industry. The idea of prosecutions will simply drive door keepers back underground. We need to look at a different way forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para26">One of the things that the SIA does not appear to see is the effect on the leisure industry. The SIA has accused the leisure industry of mismanagement and one thing and another. The leisure industry owns the clubs and the&nbsp;pubs; it is not responsible for the door keepers. The door keepers and the security aspects are separate from the leisure industry, but it is likely to suffer the consequences.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para27">Every town centre licence in Barnsley has a condition that the premises must employ registered door supervisors. Over this weekend, every licence in the town centre was under threat because the licence conditions could not be met&#151;door supervisors could not be found. The innocent parties&#151;those in the leisure 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 372WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
industry&#151;will suffer the consequences of closure, loss of income and everything that goes with that. That is unfair and slightly irresponsible. The SIA and the Government must get together and see whether they can find a way forward, unless they have a secret agenda to use that method as a back-door method of closing pubs and clubs in town centre areas. That is not bad for a Government who texted people at the beginning of the last election campaign, &quot;If you don&#039;t give a XXXX for the licensing hours, vote Labour.&quot;
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Andrew Mitchell  (Sutton Coldfield)</b>  (Con): A very good point.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : I still stand by that. I am a big supporter of the Licensing Act 2003, and I want it to work. I want this legislation to work as well. I very much welcome the decisions taken in the past few days, one of which is to extend the 11 April London deadline for two months. Although that is welcome, it is not enough, and I do not think that it will work. However, more people might come forward, given the publicity that this debate might achieve. The second decision was that an individual who has completed the form, made the payment and gone through the training will not be prosecuted if he is found to be working the doors but has not yet received the badge. That is a welcome move, as is the idea of a provisional certificate. I would like a moratorium on prosecutions; the police should hold back on prosecutions until we can increase the numbers coming forward and address the reluctance of door keepers to register. Prosecutions are counterproductive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para28">We should also reassess the legislation, even though it is late in the day, because it does not appear to be working in respect of wheel clampers and door supervisors. As well as extending the deadline for London, we could extend the deadline for all areas, perhaps giving ourselves until the end of the year to try to improve the number of door keepers coming forward. If it does not, the situation could become chaotic, especially in the summer months. The industry has an obligation to discourage cowboys who try to operate with unregistered door keepers, and to insist on badged door men. The problem is that there are not enough of them about. We have to change attitudes. The SIA has to change its attitude and encourage registration. At the moment, all it wants to do is to enforce the legislation, rather than trying to make it work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para29">I will finish as I started, by saying that to have a shortage of bouncers and door men at a time when we are being criticised for disorder as a result of binge drinking, and when every licence in the country is up for renewal and possible extension into extra hours&#151;to leave the situation as it is&#151;is a recipe for disaster.

</p>




<a name="50405h01_time1"><h5>9.58 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h01_spnew5"><b> Dr. Phyllis Starkey  (Milton Keynes, South-West)</b>  (Lab): I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on having called the debate. The issue of door supervisors is one of enormous importance for my constituents. Soon after I was elected in 1997, I raised it in a private Member&#039;s Bill that called for the setting up of a national register of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 373WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
door supervisors, so I was pleased to see that measure incorporated into the Bill that set up the Security Industry Authority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para30">I should like to reiterate why the Private Security Industry Act 2001 was needed and why, in general, I still welcome the principle of it. Huge numbers of door supervisors are entirely responsible and do an incredibly important job. However, there were, unfortunately, a great many people in the trade who had a criminal record. Many of them were still involved in criminal activity, particularly in relation to the drug trade&#151;either peddling drugs or simply turning a blind eye to the fact that others were doing so. In some parts of the country violence was a huge problem: door supervisors were assaulting the public rather than protecting them, in some cases causing fatalities and serious injuries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para31">I was drawn to the issue because my constituency has a young population, and the issue is important to them&#151;not exclusively, because people of all ages like to have a good night out in pubs and clubs, but most of us of more mature years would recognise that young people tend to do that more often. It is enormously important that when young people have a good night out in a pub or a club, they can be confident that they are not going to be put at risk by the door supervisors, who are the very people who are supposed to ensure that the clientele do not put themselves or other people at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para32">So, there is an important principle that relates to all door supervisors. I will just point out that not all door supervisors are men. The increasing number of women door supervisors are making an important contribution to the trade. The Private Security Industry Act 2001 was of enormous importance in ensuring that door supervisors did not have relevant criminal records, had proper training, and were protecting the public and public order in pubs and clubs. That is what the vast majority of responsible door-supervising organisations support and, of course, it is also what the leisure industry as a whole supported, which is why it supported the Act that set up the SIA and why it lobbied for door supervisors to be the first section of the security industry to be covered by the SIA.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para33">I wanted to reiterate those points, but I do concur with many of the points that my hon. Friend made about the difficulties that have occurred in implementation. I hope that the Opposition spokespeople act responsibly, like us, and do not lurch off into all sorts of expositions about how flexible licensing hours will lead to more binge drinking. As the report from the Home Affairs Committee points out today, the way to deal with that is through the planning system, through stopping drinks promotions and through having more&#151;not fewer&#151;registered door supervisors. To a certain extent, flexible licensing hours are a relatively minor part of the scene and it could be said that they will help to improve things in that they will stop what happens at the moment, which is huge numbers of extremely drunk people all turning out of pubs and clubs at the same moment and queuing up for non-existent taxis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para34">There are serious problems. I will not reiterate the points made by my hon. Friend about the delays in dealing with applications in the SIA or about the shortfall of door supervisors coming forward to be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 374WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
registered, although I will reiterate his point that many door supervisors have other jobs and do door supervising as a top-up on a relatively part-time basis. For those people, finding the money up front to pay for training and registration is not worth their while. It could be argued that, since pubs and clubs have to have registered door supervisors, it is for the trade to find a way round that situation. Clearly, pubs and clubs could give loans to the people who normally work for them to pay for training and then recover that money from their earnings. That is a perfectly reasonable solution. The trade must take some responsibility for helping to see us through the implementation period and for dealing with the fact that, although there are full-time door supervisors, there are many who are part-time, who will not themselves be able to find the money up front.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para35">The points that I want to make that have not been made by my hon. Friend relate to two issues that have been raised with me by the management of clubs in my constituency and by the licensing officer at my local council. They relate to the fact that the SIA does not seem to give enough weight to the practicalities or to the reality of how the leisure industry operates. The first issue relates to the operation of large indoor and outdoor venues&#151;pop concerts and festivals, rather than pubs and clubs. It is difficult to decide exactly who, among the people employed to run such a large indoor or outdoor event, has to be registered with the SIA. The SIA seems to think that it is a simple matter to decide whether staff are concerned with security and need to be registered or are taking the money for tickets and so on, and therefore do not. That does not reflect the reality of how these events are organised. There will be some people who are clearly 100 per cent. concerned with security, and some who are 100 per cent. not concerned with it, but there will be a whole load of people in the middle who are partly concerned with security. There needs to be some clarity and practicality about the way those individuals are licensed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para36">The second issue concerns the training that the SIA requires. I have been given the strong impression by people in the trade in my constituency that the SIA does not understand the skills required by door supervisors in large pubs and clubs and large pop concert venues, and it does not give enough emphasis to what one might describe as the heavy end of security or the skills required to deal with situations when they start to get&#151;I know no other way to describe it&#151;hairy. It is incredibly important that door supervising staff are able to bring the really difficult situations under control before they get completely out of hand. The SIA seems not to appreciate the need for the training to provide such skills, as well as the other skills covered in the training. Again, that is due to a lack of proper dialogue between the SIA and the trade.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para37">I ask the Minister to reflect on those issues, and use her influence to ensure that the SIA is more pragmatic and practical and works with the responsible parts of the trade. However, I ask the trade to recognise that there was always going to be a problem. The fact is that a significant proportion of door supervisors will not be licensed because they have criminal records. Part of the point of the system was to get those people out of door supervising because we need a business that is respectable, respected and does its job properly, and the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 375WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
individuals within it need to be properly recognised, properly trained and properly paid. That is an issue that the trade, as well as the SIA, needs to face.

</p>




<a name="50405h01_time2"><h5>10.7 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. John Grogan  (Selby)</b>  (Lab): It is a great pleasure to take part in this debate, which was opened with such characteristic passion and clarity by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley), and I also felt that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) got to the heart of the matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para38">My late father had a way of cheering me up when I was a bit down. He used to say, &quot;It&#039;s great to be alive. There are millions of people out there who would love to be alive today and aren&#039;t.&quot; I am tempted to paraphrase that a little this morning. It is great to be here on the morning that the general election is being called. Coming from a marginal seat, I reflect that there are thousands of people out there who would like to be here, but are not quite yet. In that context, I am delighted to make a few remarks in this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para39">I want to make a few suggestions on how we take the matter forward without repeating some of the arguments that have been made. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central mentioned <i>The Publican Newspaper</i>, a very distinguished newspaper that serves the licensed trade. There is another paper that serves the licensed trade, the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>. They are both equally distinguished, except for the fact that I write a column in the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>. I shall refer to one or two suggestions I made in that column.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para40">It is interesting that my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central mentioned towards the end of his speech the very recent extension of the deadline in London during the past few days. I reflect, as an MP from what used to be called the provinces, that it is only when an issue begins to affect London that people in the bureaucracy&#151;and, dare I say it, the Home Office&#151;begin to take the matter seriously. The matter has been reported in <i>The Publican Newspaper</i> and the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, and it has been in MPs postbags for about a year now. It is only when the deadline in London is almost upon us&#151;within a couple of weeks&#151;that an extension is made. That may be deeply welcome in the capital, and I am delighted that we are not going to have pubs and clubs shutting in marginal seats in the capital during the next month, but I worry a little about all the punters in the rest of the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para41">A couple of measures could be taken to ease matters. They would not undermine the principles of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 which my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West rightly praised when outlining the reasons for them. She was also right to point out that an increasing number of women play quite a role in the industry and that they are helping to change the face of the industry. Where a door supervisor has bothered to take a course and make an application, the simplest thing to do would be for the SIA within days to send an acknowledgement of it. As long as a door supervisor has an acknowledgement that they have made an application and they can show it to the relevant authorities, that should be good enough to prevent prosecutions in the rest of the country. Otherwise, London will be a special case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para42">When my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central was describing some of the cases of delays and referring to folklore, I heard my hon. Friend the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 376WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Minister from a sedentary position say, &quot;Yes, it is folklore.&quot; However, there are many cases of delays, and the SIA admits that. The percentages are in doubt, but some people are definitely waiting more than 10 weeks. Quite a lot of people are having their forms returned for reasons, as my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central said, such as putting &quot;UK&quot; rather than &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. Some people have had their forms returned on seven or eight occasions. If somebody has taken the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble to undertake the course and put in the application, that should be good enough. I ask the Minister to consider carefully that suggestion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para43">I also understand that where the people on the books of agencies and security firms have made applications but have yet to receive their final registration from the SIA, there is a provision in the Act for approving agencies and security firms that have reached a sufficiently high standard to satisfy the SIA. No such firms have been approved, however. If some of the more reputable firms could acquire that status, it could help to break the logjam. I welcome the moves made in London by the Home Office, but we need some action that will help in the rest of the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para44">I want to bring one further case to the attention of the&nbsp;House to show how passions are running high. On 7 March I received a press release, which I think other Members of the House received, from Mr. Andy Walker, the chief executive of the Federation of Door Supervisors and Security, the trade union for the private security industry. He is also managing director of Protexus Training Ltd. He made many criticisms about the operation of the Act, some of which we have heard this morning. He has a distinguished background, having served in the Army and for 10 years in the police. He was one of the first people to argue for the Act; he was a consultant to the Home Office, undertaking research into the Act in the 1990s; and he then became a consultant to the SIA. Within days of issuing a measured press release on, among other issues, the need for strong enforcement, he was suspended from his job by Protexus Training Ltd. All sorts of rumours are going round the industry that the suspension was a result of pressure from the SIA. The SIA is very tetchy about these matters, but it should be strong enough to face criticism and debate matters with its critics in the industry. It should not resort to undermining the careers of people with a long and distinguished history in the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para45">We have made some progress in recent weeks, but I say to the Minister that to make the Act work, we need more flexibility from the SIA and the Home Office.

<p><a name="50405h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Khalid Mahmood  (Birmingham, Perry Barr)</b>  (Lab): I join other Members in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing this important debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para46">The issue was brought to me just before Christmas, when there were considerable concerns about it in Birmingham. I had the opportunity to meet the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety, who took some action with the Security Industry Authority and asked me to speak to the chief constable in my area to seek, locally, an agreement not to prosecute people who had made an application in the

&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
area. I welcome the help that was available from the Home Office in trying to allay a significant concern for many people. It is a major employment issue in my constituency, where more than a quarter of people are involved in work for the leisure and hospitality industry,

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para47">The need for proper implementation and the importance of that for people who act as doorkeepers at the venues in question has already been mentioned. Without the right legislation, the wrong type of people can be involved in such employment, aggravating matters instead of policing them and making them better. In Birmingham I want to ensure that doorkeepers will be properly licensed, and able to support the police in providing the service that we all want.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para48">In general the legislation is good, but the way in which it is implemented is an issue. In Birmingham we had a good network in which the licensing of doorkeepers was established, with very effective processes. Although I can accept the present central point of registration, we need, if we are to be able to make progress in the light of some of the debates that have gone on, the devolution back to the licensing committee of the review of some applications

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para49">Because of the nature of the job, issues of involvement in minor offences may arise. If there is a question of people who have had huge experience in the industry being struck off the central register without a real appeal I should perhaps draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the need for a bit of local common sense, so that the local licensing committee could review a matter, take a decision and pass the information back to the SIA centrally. If we are to reach the 70,000 figure mentioned by my right hon. Friend&#151;sorry, I mean my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central; there is always the next term&#151;it is important that experienced people continue and that we do not lose the experience of those who want to take the matter seriously, take up the training courses and do a job that they are proud of. We want to encourage them, because they are needed to assist the police force and the community in providing the service we want.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para50">The only way in which we will move forward is by a common-sense approach in which local authorities are allowed to be involved again with the SIA, in producing a register and enabling people to appeal.

</p>




<a name="50405h01_time4"><h5>10.19 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mark Oaten  (Winchester)</b>  (LD): I join other hon. Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing the debate. It is an important issue, and I have learned a great deal this morning from the knowledge that has been conveyed, and the issues that have been raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para51">I echo what the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) said about recognising how far we have come in reaching the point that we are now at. When I was first elected&#151;probably before then, when I went to pubs at the age of 18 or 20&#151;bouncers had a notorious image. The industry has come on in leaps and bounds and changed completely in its professionalism and the way it operates. It is worth noting that that has changed and that we do not use the word bouncers, but rightly call them door supervisors. I am sure that we all welcome those changes.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 378WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para52">My experience, from going out with police in different parts of the country, is that door supervisors are a critical part of the management of the night-time economy. Door supervisors in city centres work closely with the police and CCTV operators, and are often miked up with earpieces and walkie-talkies. Their contribution is a key part of managing what happens in our city centres and requires an awful lot of training, skills and trust. Working closely with others, they have become a pivotal part of that process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para53">We often think that the main function of door supervisors is to deal with drunkenness and disorder. Of course, making sure that people going into pubs and clubs are not drunk is a key role, but they are also responsible for dealing with under-age drinking and making sure that age limits are properly managed. That is extremely difficult. When I am out with police and they ask me to judge how old somebody is, I find it near impossible to tell a 13-year-old from a 21-year-old, but door supervisors have to deal with those difficult and complex tasks. They are also often responsible for safety issues such as ensuring that the limit of people allowed into a pub or club is managed properly, and that a record is kept of how many people go in, so that health and safety regulations are observed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para54">In some city centres, door supervisors provide reassurance to members of the public who may have been to the cinema or theatre, who do not necessarily want to go into a pub or club and who may feel uneasy when they see a large queue of people waiting to go in to a pub or club. The presence of a door supervisor who is in control of the situation can be greatly reassuring. Door supervisors play a key and growing role, and we should praise and thank them for their work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para55">The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central highlighted a number of problems in the system. I do not know whether they are folklore or serious issues, but let me address some of those raised, such as the point about the operation of the SIA. I hope that the Minister will address some of those points, reassure us and let us know whether they are real problems. We are told that&nbsp;the SIA has had difficulties with phone calls. One would think that a simple system could manage that. These days, many people request applications and forms by e-mail, or using webline and online access; why is not that service more widely available?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para56">The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central made a good point about groups of applications from different clubs being made together. A lot of clubs are now part of networks and can manage that process. That seems to be a sensible and responsible approach in which we should ask pub and club groups to get involved. Multiple applications should be processed simply, and I am concerned about the delays.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para57">I am also concerned to hear about what has been happening in South Yorkshire with the police and their work over the past couple of weekends. If it is true that there have been spot checks and that certificates are not in place, and that individuals face prosecution or are disappearing because they do not want those police checks, that will break down the important relationship between the police and door supervisors, which should be one of trust and working together, rather than one of mistrust and nervousness. If that is happening in South Yorkshire, it is sending all the wrong messages.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 379WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para58">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West talked about handling large venues such as pop festivals. In my constituency, for the past six years, we have had the Homelands festival in the bank holiday weekend at the end of May, to which 40,000 people come. Having attended that to see what takes place, I know that hundreds of people are involved in that organisation. For clarity, it would be extremely helpful to know which people should be registered. The hon. Lady made an excellent point on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para59">The hon. Lady asked what kind of training takes place. I do not know; I am ignorant about that, but she is right to highlight the difficult circumstances in which door supervisors will find themselves. Indeed, they will be the same difficult circumstances in which police find themselves on Friday and Saturday nights, so door supervisors&#039; training should be of as good quality, so that they can handle situations with hot-headed people. I do not know what involvement the police have in that training&#151;I assume and hope that there is some, but perhaps the Minister can tell us.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para60">I do not know whether, for example, the training involves taking individuals out on a Friday or Saturday night, with someone supervising, to see how they cope. I hope that the training would involve that, and that a door supervisor would not be thrown into a violent situation on a Saturday night without having experienced something similar with guidance or training.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para61">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West rightly mentioned that many such individuals have had criminal records and that being a door supervisor had been an underground profession. I hope that having a criminal record in the past would not be a barrier to individuals applying for and getting jobs in the future. I strongly believe that if individuals have served their time or been through a process, we should not rule them out because of what may have taken place four or five years ago. Again, I would welcome the Minister&#039;s comments on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para62">The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) amused us with his comments about the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, but he made a serious point about London often being the starting process. However, my evidence is that London has been coping with the problem slightly better. Where the problem has been difficult is in cities where the night-time economy has grown. London has had a night-time economy for many years, but in some of the newer cities, particularly in the north in England, the night-time economy has taken off in the past three or four years. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the need to ensure that legislation catches up in those areas. I am not just talking about the northern cities, but about some of the cathedral cities in the south of England, which are experiencing a growing problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para63">It is right that resources should be put across. With some of changes taking place and the deadline moving in London from April to 6 June, I hope that the Minister will reflect on the possibility of changing that deadline in some other cities where there are difficulties. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the word &quot;marginal&quot; only three or four times, which was extraordinarily restrained of him. Given what is taking place this morning, we wish him well in the future.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para64">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahmood) made a telling point. We do not necessarily need to manage the whole process from a central bank. Let us draw on local knowledge, to see whether we understand circumstances more locally, and let us have more local approvals in the system. Let us ensure both that there is a good appeals system in place and that we consider such a tricky issue from a common-sense perspective.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : I should perhaps clarify something that I obviously did not make clear. The extension of the two-month period in London is by the Metropolitan police, who will not prosecute between 11 April and 6 June. The SIA has not moved the deadline, which concerns a moratorium on prosecutions.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Oaten </b> : I am grateful for clarity on that, but as I understand it the point remains valid. If there is a problem in London, there will be problems in other cities. We hope that the Government work with police forces throughout the country to introduce a similar delay. If the problems are as severe as the hon. Gentleman suggests, moving to June 6 will not tackle the problem. Indeed, he mentioned delaying until the end of the year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para65">There are two issues that the Government are considering. The first is the idea, which we support, of charging a levy on pubs and clubs that are causing difficulties. Perhaps we are slightly blinkered in assuming that the levy should go towards police costs. There is a strong case for considering other ways of using the levy to help the night-time economy; for example, through night buses and so on. The levy could also go towards processing door supervisors or the cost on individuals undergoing that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para66">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West pleaded with the Opposition not to make cheap points about 24-hour licensing. I shall not do that, but I make the observation that with so many changes taking place that still need to bed down, is there not a case for a pause, before we move ahead later this year?

<p>
<a name="50405h01_para68">Turning to other matters, this may of course be the last time that the Minister and I perform together, as we have done a great deal over the past six months.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para69">I congratulate the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing this important debate and on the constructive and helpful way in which he opened proceedings. He and I entered the House in 1987, although I took an enforced sabbatical between 1997 and 2001, when the Private Security Industry Act 2001 was passed. Although the hon. Gentleman cannot be acquitted of the charge of having been in the House when the legislation was passed, the Minister and I were not here.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para70">I have looked at the record of the debates on the Act, and it is clear that the Opposition highlighted the enforcement issues. The hon. Gentleman has raised many of them today, and I shall come to them in a moment. I have also toured the night spots of Sutton Coldfield&#151;as you may have done in the past, Sir Nicholas&#151;and together with the chief of police I have seen at first hand the valuable work that has been conducted. It has described by all those who have spoken.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para71">The private security industry has been campaigning for national regulation for more than 30 years, as have a succession of hon. Members, security trade associations and lobby groups. They all assert that they want the system to work but that it is currently neither user-friendly nor proportionate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para72">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey) is absolutely right that there is support for the policy across the House. She issued an injunction to the trade at the tail end of her speech, but I think that the trade completely accepts what she said, and I hope that the Minister agrees.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para73">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr.&nbsp;Mahmood) made a most helpful point in stressing that common sense should be the guiding principle. However, the Minister will have winced as Labour Members, in a devastating indictment, politely and deftly condemned not the Government&#039;s policy, but their competence in handling this issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para74">I wish to bring five key issues to the attention of the Chamber. A very low number of door supervisors have applied for and received their SIA licences. The biggest question is why are they not registering? Those who have applied have often had to wait a long time before receiving their licence, and I am advised that the SIA has a backlog of 9,500 applications. The application process is complex and expensive. There is a lack of SIA licence non-compliance enforcement, and if the 11 April 2005 licence deadline is maintained, there will be only about 13,500 licensed door supervisors in England and Wales, according to figures issued yesterday. That is in an industry that employs just under 100,000 door supervisors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para75">The SIA has received only 23,000 applications for licences, and 13,500 licences have been issued. If the Government and the SIA do not extend the application deadline beyond 11 April&#151;as has been said, they have done that for the London area in conjunction with the Metropolitan police&#151;the country will have only 13,500 licensed door supervisors. That is in no way enough, and pubs and clubs would not be able to stay open, because 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 382WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
they would be contravening their licences. That would obviously lead to more work for the police, and as hon. Members have said, less secure town and city centres. Many pubs and clubs would have to close because they would not be fulfilling the licensing criteria if they did not have door supervisors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para76">There are nationwide problems with SIA processing times. The Manchester Pub and Club Network attempted to delay the start of the licence deadline after doormen complained of extensive delays in getting passes approved and issued. Phil Burke, of the Manchester Pub and Club network, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the Network has received a large number of calls from worried doormen forced to quit working the doors through no fault of their own because their new SIA passes are failing to arrive on time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para77">Stephen Thomas, the chief executive of the security firm Luminar plc, has expressed his concern over the &quot;SIA and its performance,&quot; and an official at the Cabinet Office&#039;s Better Regulation Task Force has admitted that the Private Security Industry Act 2001 is &quot;bad legislation&quot; and that the SIA&#039;s performance


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;leaves much to be desired.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para78">There is also the problem of non-compliance. Many door supervisors have not even gone through the application process. This is a very serious problem, which the SIA needs to address immediately. It has been caused by several of factors. First, inevitably there is the expense. It costs a door supervisor about &#163;400 for a training course and &#163;190 to apply for a licence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para79">Secondly, the SIA licence application criteria are very strict. Obviously, that is necessary in order to remove criminality from the industry. However, it cannot be correct that one can be refused a licence as a door supervisor because one has received a caution for a minor offence, but one can join the police service in some areas with such a criminal record. The application criteria should at least be no stricter than the process of joining the police.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para80">Thirdly, the licence gives away the identity of a door supervisor and could make them vulnerable to revenge attacks, which greatly concerns the union. The licence, which must be worn by the door supervisor, must display his full name. That could lead many door supervisors to fear revenge attacks if they apprehend drug dealers or criminals in the establishments in which they are employed to ensure order.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para81">Fourthly, the application process itself is also of concern. Many of those who have applied for a licence have complained that the process is very slow and that the SIA is inefficient in dealing with the application. One must call the SIA to receive an application pack; it cannot be downloaded from the website.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para82">There have been many complaints that there is a long wait to get through on the telephone to request a pack. I asked a member of my staff to try to apply on the phone, and they were kept on hold for a very long time. When they tried again, a message advised them to try again later as the line was too busy, and they were automatically cut off. Another message advised them to call between 8 and 10 am. As you can appreciate, Mr.&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, that would not be a good time for a door supervisor, who may have been at work until the early hours of the morning, to make such a call.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 383WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para83">The application form can take some time to arrive. I am advised that it can take up to two months. Once it has been completed, it is often returned with a message that there are errors on the form but without any explanation as to what those errors are.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para84">The industry has been trying to work with the SIA to make the process simpler and easier, but with little success. The individual door supervisor must, for example, fill out the form themselves. The form is four pages long, as the Minister will know. Their employer cannot help them. Many individuals cannot fill out the application form, perhaps because English is not their first language or because they find it confusing, for the reasons elegantly explained by the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central. Businesses and training companies that have tried to help to register security staff have been told that applications must be submitted individually and in person.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para85">Industry associations have also suggested that the door supervisory qualifications currently held by approximately 40,000 people should be recognised at least as a provisional licence when those people apply for a licence. The SIA has also rejected that suggestion. Will the Minister reconsider this issue? The SIA argues that it sends out a 30-page booklet explaining how to fill out the application form, and so it is not necessary to relax the rules or to simplify the form. The poor uptake, however, shows that reform is necessary.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para86">The SIA states that it takes six weeks to process an application form. That is not the experience of many people. Application forms are lost in the system, and original documents are often lost. This led to one doorman having to cancel his family holiday. One doorman in Wales applied for his SIA licence in the last week of July, and did not receive it until the week before Christmas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para87">Fifthly, the SIA&#039;s lack of enforcement for non-compliance is also a problem. FEDS, the trade union for the private security industry, which first told me of its concerns at the beginning of the year, believes that one of the key reasons for the uptake of licences being so slow is that many doormen are not convinced that the system will be enforced. It became illegal to work as an unlicensed door supervisor in June in Hampshire, in August in the south-west, in September in Wales, and in October in the midlands. To date, only a small number of prosecutions have been brought.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para88">Many door supervisors do not want to waste the time or expense of becoming licensed, as they do not believe that the SIA will enforce the regulations. Will the Minister comment on that specific point? The SIA&#039;s official figures show that it has 40 enforcement and compliance officers. Does the Minister think that it will be possible to regulate an industry with more than 85,000 employees with such a number?

</p>

<a name="50405h01_para89">In our submission, the SIA must employ more enforcement officers in order to carry out its work with any credibility. It says that it will work in partnership with the police and local authorities to enforce its licensing regime. For obvious reasons that the Minister will understand, the SIA must not rely on the police to enforce the licensing regulations. Police in the metropolitan areas, where most of the country&#039;s clubs and pubs are situated, are far too busy on Friday and Saturday nights dealing with the violent and alcohol-

<br>&nbsp;<br>
related crime and disorder that we now see in our town centres. The binge drinking culture means that, more than ever before, the police rely on door supervisors to keep their establishments in good order; they do not want to arrest or discipline them on behalf of the SIA.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para90">We appear to have a criminal records bureau-style mess, with all the consequent difficulties that have become so familiar under this Government. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central&#151;a senior and well-respected Labour Member&#151;delivered an indictment not of the policy but of the way in which it is being implemented. Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition will clearly add that to the charge sheet of this discredited and incompetent Government as we go into the general election. However, I urge the Minister to take action this day, to stir up the SIA and to deliver the message that, even at this late hour, the Government understand the scale of the problem and will take action to deal with it.

</p>




<a name="50405h01_time6"><h5>10.42 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Caroline Flint) </b> : We do not know, but the Prime Minister may already have called time on this Parliament; however, I am certain that our constituencies will not be calling time on Labour in government. I am sure that people across the country will see the effort that we have put in over the past eight years to making a real difference.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para91">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) on securing the debate. What makes it crucial is that at its heart are the most important people&#151;the public who use the establishments. That was clearly outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey). At one time, there was hardly any regulation of door supervisors and other door staff. I understand that only 60 per cent. of local authorities had any form of licensing scheme; and the schemes varied from one local authority area to another, particularly on training and on benchmarks on previous criminality and involvement in crime. We have moved on from a pretty dire situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para92">We have also moved on for the employees involved in that sector. They are often paid cash in hand, and their rights as employees are mostly unprotected. As a former officer of the GMB, I know that that trade union has always taken a keen interest in recognising that part of our work force. Allan Black, a national officer, is responsible for that. He and the union have been working hard to get that work recognised as a professional job and to ensure that the leisure industry and others recognise that they cannot treat those people as a sort of add-on when running such establishments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para93">I take issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central on the role of the leisure industry. It should take an interest in door supervisors, whether they are contracted from a company or taken on individually. It is crucial that the industry takes responsibility for the people front of house who supervise the entry and leaving of an establishment and maintain good order. I am sorry, but there is no excuse. The industry must take responsibility for such people in the same way that it must take responsibility for its own staff.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 385WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : I am not sure which point in my speech my hon. Friend was referring to, but I take entirely her point that all parts of the industry must take responsibility for whatever they do. In my final comments I said that the leisure industry must ensure that it employed badged supervisors to drive out the cowboy or criminal element of unregistered door supervisors.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew15"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I welcome my hon. Friend&#039;s additional contribution, and we must make those points absolutely clear. We should consider our discussions in the wider context of licensed premises and how they are run. The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), the spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, made points about under-age drinking and serving people who have had one too many, and the problems that that causes. We should consider the whole package of the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local authorities, residents and community organisations working with licensed establishments and other retailers to ensure that people can have a good night out in a safe atmosphere. It is part of the jigsaw; it is about making our enjoyment safer and more pleasurable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para94">It is key to ensure that people feel that organisations such as the SIA are working well. I am covering this debate for my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety, but I understand that there have been some problems. The SIA has had to re-examine its systems, for example, but it is not just a question of the SIA&#039;s responsibility. In preparing for the debate, I asked some of the questions that hon. Members have asked this morning about the number of applications and why they have not come in. We must assume that some people have not applied because they are concerned that they will not be approved. Several Members have mentioned that that is not necessarily a bad thing, and it has been recognised that the process constitutes a big clearing house. That exercise is important for the public and those individuals working as door supervisors who are doing a good job, have been trained and who, whether they are working for a company contracted to an establishment or individually, want to be valued for their professionalism and integrity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para95">As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Mahmood) said, unfortunately there are some examples, illustrated by arrests, convictions and trouble caused, of individuals who should not have any responsibility for supervising establishments in our communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para96">My hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) asked whether London was receiving special treatment. It is not. Recognising how huge the process is, we have introduced the system of door supervisor licensing regionally. It started with a pilot in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, and then, starting in the south-west, it moved clockwise geographically through England and Wales. The south-west began accepting licences from 1&nbsp;June 2004. The introduction of the system moved from Wales to the midlands, the north-west, the north-east, the east, the south-east and London. At each stage notice was given about sending in applications and a deadline was given for each region. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr said, our discussions with the police were about what should be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 386WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
done where applications have not been processed. If people have received acknowledgment of their application&#151;everybody should get a letter stating that their application has been received and is being processed&#151;that will satisfy the requirement if the police are trying to decide whether to prosecute. The process allows for some proportionality and discretion, which I shall discuss later, and that is exactly the same for London. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Selby that it is not the case that we have only thought about some of those issues when they have started to affect London itself. I say that as a South Yorkshire MP.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para97">What does worry me is the fact that people are not applying. I take on board the points that have been made about individuals who have applied, and other issues. In trying to determine whether the examples that have been given this morning are folklore, urban myths or whatever one wants to call them, it would be helpful if the names of individuals could be attached to particular cases so that we can follow them up and establish what happened. I cannot say with my hand on my heart that errors have not been made. The nature of the beast is such that mistakes are bound to happen, but we need to know whether we are dealing with serial offending&#151;the errors are happening time and again&#151;or one-offs due to an administrative error or whatever. I do not dismiss the anecdotes&#151;I think of the examples that my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central gave&#151;but it would be helpful to have names against them so that we could investigate specific incidents and determine whether they were isolated cases or something more worrying. That also applies to the comments made by several other colleagues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para98">As everyone knows, the date when applications could first be made and when a licence would become a legal requirement in each region were published in full in July 2003. That was 11 months before the first legal requirement to be licensed&#151;the offence date&#151;and a full 20 months ahead of the final legal requirement date of 11 April, which we are coming up to, for London. Regardless of some of the comments that have been made in this debate, it is clear that individuals and businesses have had a considerable amount of time in which to plan, prepare, and train to meet the regulatory timetable. However, despite that, many applications have been submitted late in all the geographical regions, and the picture is no better in London.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para99">Training has been available for all door supervisors since January 2004. As each region came online, the SIA tried to ensure that capacity was available to cope with the estimated demand. I understand the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made about what is included in the training. The SIA did consult during development of the training specification with individual door supervisors, company trainers, awarding bodies and associations about the specification, but I shall ensure that her comments are passed on to my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety to determine whether there is anything missing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para100">On who should be registered, the Act describes the designated activities that an individual is required to have a licence to undertake, and they are described in the &quot;Get Licensed&quot; booklet. I shall ensure that the points about indoor arenas and large venues are also covered.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 387WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para101">Training courses have been organised prior to the offence dates in most regions, but several have been cancelled due to a lack of take-up. Unfortunately, it is not until the offence date has been reached and individuals risk prosecution that the demand for training courses in any region increases. That is worrying, as it begs the question whether some individuals and sections of the trade are operating in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve, which is a safer night out for the paying public. In each region there has been a three-month window between the date when applications could be received and the date when it became a legal requirement to hold a licence. The SIA published a target for processing 80 per cent. of licence applications within six weeks. The average since licensing began is 73 per cent. within six weeks, and 89&nbsp;per cent. of all applications are processed within eight weeks. Obviously, that is not 100 per cent., but that is because some applications throw up several questions, and the SIA must be thorough in establishing what the concerns and problems are.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para102">The SIA estimates that some 46,000 individuals will need door supervisor licences. That figure is supported by its operational experience and its police partners. As of 30 March, 50,597 individuals had requested application forms, but only 27,721 of them had returned their completed forms. That is worrying, and happened in spite of the fact that as of 30 March 45,060 individual door supervisors had spent time and money obtaining the necessary qualification.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para103">On a more encouraging note, it is pleasing to see that in the past month applications were requested by potential door supervisors at an average rate of 500 per day. An average of 250 a day were returned, and an average of 300 newly trained door supervisors joined the qualifications database every day, having gained the necessary qualifications. However, the situation is still worrying, and we must ask why individuals do not return application forms that they have been given and why those who have received the necessary training do not move forward. I also wonder, as the daughter of publicans, why in establishments there is no discussion with door staff about why they have not returned their applications.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para104">The SIA and its police and local authority partners have made every effort to ensure that individuals and their employers are fully aware of their responsibilities. Direct mailing, mail shots and meetings with the licensed trade have very clearly outlined the actions that individuals need to take, and the time scale within which they need to take them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para105">Hon. Members have posed questions about the cost of the licence. I understand that it costs &#163;190. It can attract a subsidy of &#163;105 from the Learning and Skills Council. The licence fee is tax deductible&#151;that is worth just under &#163;50&#151;and other funding subsidies are available as well. There are several methods of assisting people with the fee, but, as hon. Members mentioned, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 388WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
companies who employ doorkeepers might want to look into that, to build a reputation for themselves as an organisation that has fully trained staff.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para106">It is hoped that more people will continue to apply. As I have said, we need to reduce the number of errors. A high error rate has occurred in London applications, which demonstrates that some people are still not fully aware of how to fill in the application forms. Where those errors are minor, they are, where possible, solved through a telephone call, but where the error or omission is critical to the licensing criteria, the form or a duplicate has to be returned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para107">It is not until the SIA has a complete and acceptable application with a cleared payment, including the necessary supporting documentation, that they can start to process it. The processing of course includes a criminality check.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Illsley </b> : I want to reinforce a point; I think that what the Minister has just referred to is among the examples that are passing into folklore. It is impossible to correct a form over the telephone with the SIA. People simply cannot get through.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew17"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I shall look into that issue and follow it up.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Grogan </b> : I understand that the Prime Minister is on the way to the palace, so the moment of decision is nigh. Will my hon. Friend clarify whether she is urging police forces not to prosecute people who have submitted an application form and received an acknowledgement? Can she at least give us that encouragement?
</p>






<p><a name="50405h01_spnew19"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : No, I am not urging that. The issue is one that we must examine. We need to consider whether people show a real willingness to comply with the legislation. That is not an issue that I can deal with; it is an operational decision for police at force level. What I have tried to describe to my hon. Friend is how attempts have been made to assist people, and to give a proportionate response. I am not prepared to keep moving the barrier back. As I said at the start of the debate, we are concerned about the continued safety of the public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para108">A reform that has been made is that from yesterday the processing of applications can commence immediately on receipt of a correctly completed form, without waiting for the payment to clear. I understand that we are also looking into the question of bulk applications coming in from organisations. We have listened to the concerns that have been expressed and dealt with some of the issues raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h01_para109">However, although we listen and have carried out reforms, and although I shall write to hon. Members about some of the other matters that the SIA has taken into account, what we are doing is important for the protection of the public and we must stand firm.

<a name="50405h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Woodcraft Folk</h3>


<a name="50405h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h02_spnew0"><b> Jeremy Corbyn  (Islington, North)</b>  (Lab): This debate has resulted in enormous interest in the Woodcraft Folk and has come about because more than 100 Members of Parliament have signed my early-day motion asking the Government to restore their very modest level of funding to the national organisation of the Woodcraft Folk. I do not know whether you have personally been involved in the Woodcraft Folk, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  <i>indicated dissent.</i>
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew2"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Obviously not. I should explain briefly what the Woodcraft Folk is. That would enlighten the rest of the world and, one never knows, it might persuade more people to join, which would be extremely useful. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Is it left wing enough? We do not discriminate. The Woodcraft Folk has existed for 80 years. It was founded as a co-operative youth organisation, with a totally volunteer ethos. It seeks to develop children&#039;s lives in a way that is peaceful, co-operative and at one with nature. Many of the mores and traditions of the Woodcraft Folk come from native American cultures and much of the singing and many of the activities at camps are related to that tradition.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para0">Those of us who have been involved, or, in my case, still are involved, with Woodcraft as active parents and so on, find the camps disturbingly democratic in their operations. When one arrives at a Woodcraft camp with several dozen, if not several hundred, children, dividing them all up into clans or villages and then democratically deciding who is going to do what can mean that professors of philosophy are ordered around by children of primary school age, who decide how they should conduct themselves when doing the washing up and all the other things that have to be done there. So, they are disturbingly democratic organisations and I urge all Members of Parliament who are getting ideas above their station to spend a week at a Woodcraft camp in the summer. It would do them all a great deal of good.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para1">The values of the organisation are, and have been, that it gives a lot of children an opportunity to do things together, to be taken seriously, to understand democratic values, and to value and respect each other. Rather than having a hierarchy, everything is conducted in circles. Some of the debates and discussions are very long, but it means that children begin to understand the responsibilities of decision making and how they conduct their lives.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not just the young people who enjoy the Woodcraft Folk, but the parents, guardians and people who look after them? They learn a lot about themselves in that kind of environment.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew4"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Absolutely. I endorse that. I have been on many Woodcraft camps and one finds skills one did not know one had. One also finds that one does not have a lot of skills that one thought one had before going to the camp. The camps provide that kind of opportunity. They are good for the adults as well. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 390WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The&nbsp;whole thing relies on volunteer work and activity. The basis of most of the Woodcraft groups was inner-city communities in the 1920s and 1930s. They were the only opportunity that many working-class kids ever had to get out of slum living and awful physical conditions and go to outdoor pursuit centres. The Woodcraft Folk owns a small number of centres around the country and also uses scout camps and other people&#039;s campsites. The Woodcraft Folk provided that release and that opportunity, and gave the children the values of understanding and respect for other people. We should pay a lot of credit to it for that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para2">The Woodcraft Folk is not a middle-class ghetto that is run around the rims of the M25 or the north or south circular. It is a national body, and it links up closely with international organisations. International camps are held every year and there is a great deal of cross-fertilisation between different groups. For example, we had an enormous international camp at Newark a few years back with 4,000 children from all over the world. It was well run; it was on a large campsite and the whole thing was ecologically sustainable. The whole image was &quot;Sust &#039;n&#039; Able&quot;, to the extent that there was a bicycle-powered cinema, where a group of people sat on bicycles and propelled a generator that provided electricity for the films. Unfortunately, the people became fascinated by the films and stopped pedalling, so the electricity went out and we lost the film altogether. However, all those kids will remember that in a way that they perhaps would not remember something else.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bob Blizzard  (Waveney)</b>  (Lab): I certainly concur that the Woodcraft Folk is not just an urban movement. My own children attended the local group in Lowestoft, and there are still two Woodcraft groups today&#151;one in the rural area and one in Lowestoft. Is the problem that the organisation is not as widely known as it should be? Should we not be using the modest Government grant to make people more aware of the Woodcraft Folk, rather than taking it away? My children benefited from the group, and many more could do so.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew6"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Absolutely. Those who have been in Woodcraft never forget it, and it is certainly a life-enhancing experience. However, I want to say a little more about the international side of things before I go on to the issue of funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para3">International camps provide a real opportunity for young people from all over the world to come together. Woodcraft attempts, through international contacts, to reduce the costs for those coming from poor countries. If African children are coming, for example, we will try to help them out in some way, but if Europeans are coming, they probably will not need helping out in the same way. The camp was an amazing experience for all those children who turned up. Likewise, the delegation sent by Woodcraft to the Johannesburg summit on the sustainable world was an amazing experience for those children. I do not think that they would have had that experience had we not had Woodcraft.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para4">Two years ago, I attended an international camp in Finland, where there were different philosophies about how children should operate and be treated, respected and so on. That resulted in some enormously long debates about why the Soviet Union collapsed. Nevertheless, the debates were interesting and the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 391WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
children learnt a great deal. It was a fascinating experience. We should recognise what Woodcraft has achieved, why it was founded, and how children and adults alike benefit from it.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Keith Bradley  (Manchester, Withington)</b>  (Lab): I confirm what my hon. Friend is saying about the international camps, having visited one myself a number of years ago. I commend the work of groups such as the one in south Manchester, based in Withington, and the work of Angela Downing and her team, who do marvellous work for people in the city to foster the aims and values identified by my hon. Friend. We have to ensure that that work continues in areas such as south Manchester.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew8"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Absolutely. I endorse what my right hon. Friend has said, because the experience of kids from inner-city Britain&#151;who come from poor communities and get that opportunity, that bit of oxygen and that space&#151;is fantastic. One can see those children developing during a few days of having to live and work co-operatively. That is a great achievement.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Stephen Pound  (Ealing, North)</b>  (Lab): Before my hon. Friend moves on from the issue of the inner-city constituencies&#151;there is sometimes a perception that Woodcraft Folk are more countryside-based&#151;I want to tell him, as a fellow inner-city urban Member of Parliament, that the opportunity not only to open one&#039;s lungs but to open one&#039;s mind is absolutely unique in my experience. The work that the Woodcraft Folk do as an element of social inclusion in our city constituencies is absolutely vital and seldom recognised, but never has it been more important than it is now. Will my hon. Friend accept the fact that many of my constituents have looked to the Woodcraft Folk as a window on a wider world and have become far better people because of the Folk, as has the society and community from which they come?
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew10"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : That is absolutely so. Many members attended the lobby of Parliament two weeks ago organised by the Woodcraft Folk. A large number of people&#151;hundreds, mainly from the London groups, as we are in London&#151;came to that lobby. It was young, it was exciting, it was vibrant, it was multi-ethnic, it was respectful, it was listening&#151;all that sort of thing, which is what is so good about the Woodcraft Folk.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para5">We tabled the early-day motion and asked for and received this debate because of the issue of funding. The amount of public money that goes to the Woodcraft Folk from local authority youth budgets and from national Government is absolutely tiny. The biggest supporters of the Woodcraft Folk are the parents and the children themselves, who undertake fundraising activities such as jumble sales, just as any other youth group does, to raise money. Help also comes from donations, particularly from the co-operative organisations, which have been generous and supportive of the Woodcraft Folk for a long time. I pay tribute to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, Co-operative Retail Services and all those who have done so much to support Woodcraft over the years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para6">A number of trade unions have also made donations. My union, Unison, has given money to Woodcraft at various times or helped to support specific projects, such 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 392WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
as the international camp that we held in Newark. The Woodcraft Folk rely on volunteer work and participation and voluntary donations for most of their activities.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Pound </b> : In the interests of further publicity, I remind my hon. Friend that there are also registered supporters, and I am proud to be one. Such a small sum of money&#151;usually about &#163;20 or &#163;30 a year&#151;is extremely good value. Perhaps a few more registered supporters would be appreciated.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew12"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : I would bring out my Woodcraft card to demonstrate my credentials. If I had remembered, I would have worn my Woodcraft shirt&#151;a beautiful bottle green shirt&#151;which would also entitle me to attend the annual gathering. We do not have conferences, meetings or conventions, and we do not meet in Bournemouth, but we do have annual gatherings, which are great fun and, again, democratic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para7">What brought about all the furore, including articles in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>The Independent&#151;</i>one suddenly discovers that many journalists were Woodcraft Folkers and are upset at the prospect of the Woodcraft Folk suffering&#151;was the Department for Education and Skills grant. Over the years, the Woodcraft Folk have received a grant from the Department which has in part funded the work of the&nbsp;head office. The grant amounted to around &#163;50,000 a year the last time it was paid, which is a small amount for a voluntary organisation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para8">We are in the year of the volunteer and there is nothing more voluntary than most of what the Woodcraft Folk do. We do not have paid workers, other than those who run the outdoor pursuit centres and those at head office. We are not a wealthy organisation. When the Woodcraft Folk reapplied for the grant, they were unfortunately not successful. The money will not be available from next year onwards. That is a great shame, because it will damage the work of head office and weaken the Woodcraft Folk. The failure of that application also sends the unfortunate message to volunteers that they are not likely to receive recognition from central Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para9">I hope that the Minister can give us the hopeful news that the Government are prepared to consider the decision again and sit down further with Woodcraft Folk national officials&#151;there was a meeting yesterday&#151;to discuss how to support them in the future. Above all, I hope that the Minister will make a clear declaration that we welcome, support and admire the work of the Woodcraft Folk, in that it develops fully rounded individuals in our society.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para10">I meet children who come to my Woodcraft Folk group. I visit other groups and occasionally show them round Parliament. They ask a lot of questions. They are questioning young people, making a contribution. Surely that is what we are all about. Some of the kids on Woodcraft camps are not easy to deal with; they are very difficult kids. They come from a difficult environment or family background, and have been given an opportunity, a space&#151;above all, respect&#151;by the ethos of Woodcraft. That is something that we should all encourage. I should be grateful if the Minister told us how she got on in her meeting with the Woodcraft Folk 
<br>

yesterday. How many letters of support for Woodcraft has she received in the past few weeks, in addition to the 100-plus signatures on my early-day motion? Above all, can she give us some hope that the Woodcraft Folk will continue to receive financial support from central Government so that their head office can continue its important work? Will local authorities be encouraged, through their youth budgets where appropriate, to fund equipment for camping, meetings, activities and all that sort of thing?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para11">I conclude by quoting a parent in my constituency, who has written to me at length. She says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Why do I bother to volunteer? The time that I have been working as a volunteer for the Woodcraft Folk I could have been being paid for the equivalent time on a teacher&#039;s salary, as that is my profession, at which I am successful and enjoy. I am increasing the amount of work that I am taking on in primary school, but I am finding it very hard to let go of what I am doing with the Woodcraft Folk, and these are some of the reasons why: there are enormous benefits to mine and other people&#039;s children; they are confident to mix with a broader range of people, and thus better prepared for their future responsibilities. They learn skills, gain insight and knowledge, develop positive attitudes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Benefits to the adults, parents and families: Adult members are able to develop friendships at the same time as their children, working collaboratively with other parents&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para12">Anybody who has brought up young children will know that it is a joy and a wonderful experience, but it can be quite isolating. However, if one is in a collective organisation with other parents who are doing the same thing, one can feel good about it and develop firm friendships. My correspondent continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Woodcraft Folk could expand to include more children and parents as members. However the benefit of what goes on in the groups goes much further than to only those people. We know that the attitudes that have been developed in the groups will spread in to all aspects of the community&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para13">I hope that the Minister will give us some good news and will recognise that we need the Woodcraft Folk. We need those values, that strength and that voluntary effort. We need that joy, and we need the recognition of central Government to develop it further.

</p>




<a name="50405h02_time1"><h5>11.18 am</h5>



<p><a name="50405h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Children, Young People and Families  (Margaret Hodge) </b> : I congratulate my old friend, the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), on securing the debate, and all who have joined him.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para14">Let me say something about the scheme under which the Woodcraft Folk submitted an application. In the past eight years, we have, throughout the Government and particularly in the Department for Education and Skills, massively increased our support for the voluntary and community sector and greatly expanded the funding available for the scheme. It runs in a three-year cycle: &#163;9 million was allocated for 1996 to 1999, whereas &#163;21 million is available for the cycle for which we have just allocated money, so we have more than doubled the funding available to voluntary youth organisations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para15">To pick up on what my hon. Friend said, many, if not all, the organisations offered what the Woodcraft Folk offers. I should not like any hon. Member to go away with the idea that the money was not allocated to worthwhile organisations that do the two things to which my hon. Friend alluded. The first of those is to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 394WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
work with disadvantaged children to ensure that they can participate in society, either through activities or by expressing a voice. That is done by Children&#039;s Express, the Children&#039;s Society, the British Youth Council, Barnardo&#039;s and a number of other organisations&#151;I could go on. They are all organisations that hon. Members would wish the Government to support. The second is to depend on volunteers. Woodland Folk is not the only organisation that depends on volunteers. All the organisations that were successful in this year&#039;s funding round use volunteer activity to contribute to supporting youth activity and engagement, and to providing stimulating and enriching experiences for young people and teaching them the sense of civil responsibility that will enable them to participate in society when they grow up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para16">Let me explain how we approached this year&#039;s funding round. Through the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; Green Paper, we have embarked on a radical transformation of children&#039;s services. We want everything that we do to meet the five outcomes that children told us, in a consultation exercise, were important to them. In reconfiguring services for children, we reconsidered how we should provide Government support to the voluntary and community sector. As a result, we published a funding strategy document in December 2004, which set out for consultation the principles for funding the sector on which we thought we should go forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para17">First, we wanted to fund organisations that have the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; outcomes at their hearts and build their services around the needs of children and young people. Secondly, we wanted to support national infrastructure, which is relevant to the Woodcraft Folk. Thirdly, we wanted to support innovation, because if we are to transform children&#039;s services, we should look for new ways in which to deliver them and to help us put children at the heart of things. Fourthly, we wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider organisations&#039; commitment to the participation of children and young people, which is at the heart of everything we do. Many of the organisations that we funded were able to achieve that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para18">I understand the disappointment of the Woodcraft Folk in having its funding bid turned down, but I assure my hon. Friend that that is in no way a criticism of its work. I have known of that organisation and its contribution for a long time, and of its link to the co-operative movement and the philosophy that underpins it. I welcome that contribution&#151;as I do the contribution of other voluntary organisations working in the sector&#151;in promoting the well-being of children and their participation in society, and in providing the sort of enriching activities that will help their development and support them in achieving their potential.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para19">Some 160 organisations bid for funding this year. We could have run a closed shop scheme by simply asking organisations that had previously received funding to repeat their funding applications, but we consulted the voluntary and community sector&#151;specifically voluntary youth organisations&#151;and said that we wanted to open the territory so that all organisations could bid against the criteria that we set in relation to the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; agenda. It was with that concurrence and consultation that we opened up the scheme. However, the fact that 160 organisations bid meant that there was strong competition.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 395WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para20">We published a clear set of objectives and criteria against which we would judge the bids, including how the proposed outcomes of the work that the organisations wished to carry out linked to the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; outcomes. Having published the criteria and having agreed with the voluntary sector to open the scheme to all voluntary organisations, which I think hon. Members would agree is fair, we assessed the schemes. We used a fair and transparent process to assess all bids against criteria that we made public in our application guidance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para21">Unfortunately, the Woodcraft Folk bid was not successful when judged against those criteria. I suggest that hon. Members read its application, which I hope it will make available to them. Again, I stress that that does not mean that the organisation does not do splendid things and does not have a very important contribution to make, but if we publish criteria, if we want an open and transparent system, and if we have a fair competition, it is inevitable that some organisations will fail and others will succeed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para22">By doing things this way, we were able to fund organisations that hon. Members would want us to support. UNICEF, which did not succeed in obtaining funding before through the grant scheme, received funding for the first time. So did the YMCA and organisations such as The Wildlife Trusts and Youth Music Theatre UK. I could cite others. Some organisations that did not succeed in obtaining funding are as worth while as the Woodcraft Folk.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Blizzard: </b>  Notwithstanding what the Minister says, does she accept that any voluntary body that has received a grant from the Government or from anyone else for many years needs a period of notice before that grant is withdrawn or before it is unsuccessful with another bid? Suddenly being cut off is as bad as losing the money itself. Surely phasing and timing are important.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew14"><b> Margaret Hodge </b> : Having spent part of my life working in the voluntary sector, I know that one spends far too much time securing funds and then worrying about losing them. That is part of the inequality in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 396WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
way in which we as a nation fund all parts of the voluntary sector. I am not quite sure what the answer is. The system is better than it was when I worked in it because people tend to receive three-year funding instead of one-year funding, which gives much greater security. When I worked in the voluntary sector, we received funding for a year and did not know until the 11th month whether we would receive it the following year. People grappled around for new money. Funding is insecure, but that is part of living in the voluntary sector world. It is tough.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="50405h02_spnew16"><b> Margaret Hodge </b> : With the greatest respect to my hon. Friend, I will move on because I have only three minutes left in which to strike a more positive note, which is what I believe hon. Members want me to do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para23">As I said, the insecurity of funding is a general problem. We do, however, want to support the Woodcraft Folk. We want it to succeed, as it makes a contribution, although it failed to convince those who assessed the competition that it was as good as other organisations that submitted bids.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para24">I met the Woodcraft Folk yesterday to see how we could support its work and help it. I stress that the grant is &#163;50,000 against head office costs of about &#163;250,000, but funding is almost &#163;1 million overall. So it is not a huge element in the organisation&#039;s overall funding, which I believe my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) accepted. Most of the contributions come from families and children. No doubt my hon. Friend and others would not mind seeing their contribution doubled if it had a funding crisis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h02_para25">We want to help the Woodcraft Folk by seconding a member of our staff to it for 12 months. We hope to get on with that rapidly. We also hope that that member of staff will be able to support the central organisation by helping it to look for news ways of diversifying the funding streams that it receives so that it secures long-term funding and continues to provide the experience that all hon. Members have welcomed.

<a name="50405h03_head0"><h3 align=center>HIV/AIDS Overseas</h3>


<a name="50405h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley)</b>  (Con): It is a great pleasure to have had this issue selected for debate. A number of eyes will be on other matters now that the general election has been called, but, despite the fact that we shall all be busy with other things, I hope that we shall have time to reflect on the policies that an incoming Government&#151;of whatever persuasion&#151;will adopt to deal with the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. I am therefore delighted to see the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) in his place. He has done such a lot as the chairman of the all-party group on AIDS in the House of Commons and I welcome him to the debate.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para0">The subject has been debated several times in the House during this Parliament, but we cannot debate it often enough. If we debated it every week, that would not be too often. Indeed, the Minister is responding to another Adjournment debate about HIV/AIDS today. The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking at a particular aspect of the problem of HIV/AIDS&#151;the increasing number of orphans in Africa, with all the problems that that creates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para1">I shall look at the raw statistics, so that we can remind ourselves of the pandemic with which we are dealing. Although everyone talks about Africa, the issue goes much wider, so I want to look at some other regions. If several other areas do not learn the lessons of what went wrong in many parts of Africa, they, too, could face the problems that Africa faces today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para2">Sub-Saharan Africa is the region hardest hit. Some 25.4 million people live with HIV. Last year, an estimated 3.1 million people became infected, while 2.3&nbsp;million people died of AIDS. The AIDS pandemic has cut life expectancy at birth to below 40 years in nine African countries and the number of orphans is expected to double by 2010.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para3">Let me put those numbers in context. The number of people currently living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone is nearly equal to half the population of the entire United Kingdom. In fact, even though the region holds just over 10 per cent. of the world&#039;s population, it contains nearly two thirds of all HIV/AIDS cases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para4">In Zimbabwe, the situation is especially bleak. Just last week, UNICEF said that one in five Zimbabwean children are now orphans. More chilling still is the fact that one Zimbabwean child dies every 15 minutes from AIDS. That means that six children in Zimbabwe will die of this preventable disease during this debate if it runs its full course. Clearly, that is an outrage that we should simply not tolerate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para5">South Africa continues to have the highest number of people with HIV in the world. At the end of 2003, an estimated 5.3 million people were living with HIV. Added to that grim number is the fact that HIV prevalence among pregnant women is more than 27 per cent. That means that more than one in four expectant mothers have HIV, and many of them will pass that death warrant on to their children. Unfortunately, there is no sign of a decline in the epidemic, and the most recent data suggest that prevalence is increasing in all age groups apart from one.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 398WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para6">Although sub-Saharan Africa is the region hardest hit, it is not alone in facing the spectre of HIV/AIDS . In the Caribbean, for example, AIDS has become the leading cause of death among people who would normally be in the prime of their lives&#151;those aged between 15 and 44. By 2010, life expectancy at birth is projected to be 10 years less in Haiti and nine years less in Trinidad and Tobago than it would have been without AIDS. We can see what is happening throughout the whole Caribbean.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para7">Eastern Europe and central Asia have also seen the number of people living with HIV rise dramatically in the past few years. By the end of last year, an estimated 1.4 million people had HIV&#151;a more than 900 per cent. increase in less than a decade. If there is any good news in these statistics, it is that most of the outbreaks in the region are still in their early stages and, if we want to do something about the situation, clearly we can. I was looking at some World Bank statistics on Vietnam, where &#163;35 million has just been given to fight the AIDS fight. An estimated 250,000 people were living with HIV by the end of 2003 but, if that is not arrested, by 2010&#151;just five years away&#151;the figure will reach 1 million, which is extremely worrying.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para8">Asia has a relatively low percentage of people living with HIV/AIDS, but I am still uncertain about whether a number of the countries are owning up to the reality of the statistics. The fact is that their populations are huge. China and India are especially worrying cases. I will mention India in a moment in another context. It has a huge population of more than 1 billion people. It has 5.1&nbsp;million people suffering from HIV and that number is growing. That must be worrying. All 31 provinces in China have HIV cases. That shows us exactly what can happen in a country with a population of 1.5 billion. We must pay attention to what is happening in Africa, but we must not forget countries such as China and India, otherwise the picture will be incredibly stark.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para9">In Latin America, more than 1.7 million people are living with HIV. Two countries in that region, Guatemala and Honduras, are especially hard hit, with national adult HIV prevalence of more than 1 per cent. However, lower prevalence in other countries disguises the fact that serious, localised epidemics are under way. That is another point. It is the same with India. We can talk about 5.1 million cases, but they are not spread throughout the whole of India; they are in specific parts of India. That is what we must watch.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para10">Worldwide, the total number of people living with HIV last year was estimated at 39.4 million, the equivalent of about two thirds of the population of the United Kingdom. Approximately 4.9 million people became newly infected last year alone, of whom about 640,000 were below the age of 15. As would be expected from those figures, the death rate is depressingly high. Last year alone, about 3.1 million people died from AIDS, including more than 500,000 children under the age of 15. Let me put that in context. That is like 18 jumbo jets crashing into the earth every day. If 18 jumbo jets were crashing into the earth every day, the world would want to do something about it. To take the context that I mentioned earlier, we have started the general election campaign and it will last 30 days. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 399WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
During the period of the election, which we will all be fighting, 250,000 people will die because of AIDS. That is how significant the pandemic is.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow)</b>  (Lab): I am listening with interest to the statistics. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the other areas that is of concern is eastern Europe? If we consider the infection rates in some of the countries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia and some of the Baltic states that are either in, or soon will be in the European Union, we cannot regard this epidemic as being far away and of no concern to us. It is on our doorstep in those cases.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : I am extremely grateful for those comments. Clearly, there are no borders as far as HIV/AIDS is concerned. It does not matter where one happens to be. As I said, we concentrate on Africa and clearly that is a huge problem, but HIV/AIDS is everywhere in the world. The hon. Gentleman mentions parts of Asia and central Europe. He is absolutely right. The problem is growing. That is my fear. If I could point out today that the number of e new cases, or the number of people dying of AIDS was decreasing, I would be more relaxed, but I cannot be relaxed. There is only one area in the entire world where the figures are stagnant. They are increasing everywhere else.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para11">Between 2002 and today, the number of people with HIV/AIDS has increased. In Asia, the figure has increased to 8.2 million; in eastern Europe during the last two years the figure has gone up from 1 million to 1.4 million; in Latin America, it has increased from 1.5 million to 1.7 million; in Oceania it has gone from 28,000 to 35,000&#151;the figure is relatively low there, but it is still increasing&#151;and in the middle east, it has gone from 430,000 to 540,000. No one talks about the number in the middle east. In the one area where the figure is static, which is north America and western Europe&#151;I know it is increasing in the United Kingdom&#151;the number of women with HIV/AIDS has increased from 390,000 to 420,000. That is how stark the situation is, and that is why we should not just concentrate on one area of the world. This is a global pandemic&#151;that is what the word means&#151;and we have got to do a lot more to tackle it at every stage.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para12">We know that there is no cure for AIDS at the moment, although anti-retroviral treatments can extend the life of those who are HIV-positive. The World Health Organisation estimates that nine out of 10 people who need the treatments are not receiving them. That needs to be addressed. The best medicine in the world cannot work if it does not reach those who desperately need it. Even worse, if this situation continues, 5 million to 6 million more people will die of AIDS in the next two years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para13">As devastating as those numbers are, they will only be a teardrop in the ocean of misery unless strong action is taken immediately. That is because the devastation of HIV/AIDS goes beyond short-term health concerns; it is a long-term economic disaster for all those countries. A World Bank report released in 2003 found that AIDS reduces economic growth to the point of economic collapse. It does that by destroying human capital&#151;the people who work&#151;and accumulated knowledge and experience goes with it. It also wrecks the foundations of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 400WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
human capital&#151;education and family&#151;and creates millions of orphans, who are less likely to invest in education and job training for their future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para14">Shanta Devarajan, chief economist of the World Bank&#039;s Human Development Network, notes that in countries with severe HIV/AIDS epidemics


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;if nothing is done quickly to fight their epidemic, they could face economic collapse within several generations, with family incomes being cut in half.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para15">Moreover, the WHO points out the mutually reinforcing link between HIV/AIDS and poverty:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;In many countries, HIV/AIDS pushes people deeper into poverty as households lose their breadwinners, livelihoods are compromised and savings are consumed by the cost of health care. The pandemic also adds to the strain on national institutions and resources, and undermines the social systems that help people to cope with adversity. In the most severely affected settings there is already evidence that HIV/AIDS is eroding human security and productivity, undermining economic development, and threatening social cohesion.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para16">Not only is HIV/AIDS devastating the current work force, but it affects future workers. The report goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Educational systems and education standards too are being affected as more young people are forced to leave school to take care of sick parents and look after siblings. More than 11 million African children have lost one or both parents to AIDS. The spread of HIV and the impact of AIDS are disproportionately affecting young people, and therefore the future of the global community itself.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para17">In an attempt to examine further the future effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, UNAIDS recently produced a study that examined three scenarios for the future of AIDS in Africa. Each makes certain assumptions about how the world will react right now and then imagines how those decisions will affect the world in a quarter of a century. I could go through each of the scenarios, but I shall not do so. All I can say is that each is fairly grim in its own way. Even the most effective approach means that many more millions of people will contract HIV, which will turn into AIDS at a later stage. The report points out:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There is no magic bullet: just as the causes of HIV and AIDS are complex, so are the responses. There is no single policy prescription that will change the outcome of the epidemic. HIV and AIDS is a long-wave event, and needs consistent policy responses over several terms of government. Rapidly fluctuating policy responses will do nothing to stem the epidemic. It is essential to develop both short-term pragmatic solutions and long-term strategic responses. Working on both is critical to a successful outcome.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para18">Obviously, each of the scenarios presented can do no more than make an informed guess about the future, but remember that even the worst-case scenario 15 years ago did not predict the devastation that has been brought upon us all by HIV/AIDS. This is a wake-up call for us all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para19">I congratulate the United States of America on its programme for spending $15 billion with President Bush&#039;s emergency plan for AIDS relief. On 21&nbsp;September, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need is most urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time and our unprecedented commitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50405h03_para20">One area in which the US is spending money is in building capacity, which is essential. Providing money is one thing, but we desperately need to ensure that countries can spend that money effectively. I said that the US is focusing on 15 countries, but it is active in 96 countries. That is essential. It also supports other projects, through other funding, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and UNAIDS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para21">I want to mention the &quot;Conservative Manifesto for International Development: Action on Global Poverty&quot;, which was recently published. On page 3, it says:

<p>
<a name="50405h03_para22">That is important, because this is not a party political issue. I know that there will be 30 days of us slugging it out throughout the country, and I hope that international development will not be one of the issues on which Labour politicians will point at the Conservatives and say that there is a threat that we will cut money there, because that simply is not the case. I am delighted to read, further on in the report, about the areas in which we want money to be spent most effectively.

<p>
<a name="50405h03_para23">I am grateful to Help the Aged, which sent me its briefing on the report, which considers the impact of HIV/AIDS throughout Africa, particularly on the elderly. I talked about the number of people aged between 15 and 44 who have contracted HIV or are dying of AIDS and about the number of orphans, but we forget the price that is paid by the older generation who have to look after the orphans. We must reconsider the holistic approach to HIV. It is not enough simply to help to treat those with HIV. We must consider the orphans and the grandparents picking up the tab.

<a name="50405h03_para24">I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Walthamstow, who I understand is standing down at the general election.

<p>
<a name="50405h03_para25">The report &quot;Treat with respect: HIV, Public Health and Immigration&quot; is an important contribution to the debate and what we do in this country. A lot of it deals with the immigration into this country of people who are suffering from HIV. How we deal with such people is important. I welcome the report&#039;s publication and its contribution to the discussion on how to treat those who suffer from HIV. The problem is a global one; it is as simple as that. We know that the increasing number of cases in this country is because of immigrants. We cannot wash our hands of that fact or turn a blind eye to it. That is the reality, and we must ensure that everybody is treated equally.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para26">I also pay tribute to another person who is not standing down: the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley), who chairs the all-party group on

<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 402WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Africa, of which I was a member. Its report &quot;Averting Catastrophe: AIDS in the 21st century&quot; was an important contribution to the debate and I used it when I spoke in conferences on HIV in Canada and India. The report made many important recommendations such as launching the international finance facility and pushing for a review of urgent cases of unspent funds in the European Union, to which I hope the Minister will refer. The quality of EU spending and its effectiveness worries me incredibly. Recommendation 24 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Establish a unit within the DTI in partnership with experienced companies to advise other companies with operations in Africa on developing fully comprehensive HIV and AIDS programmes for both their workers, their families and the communities in which they work and where migrant labour is used also in the communities from which their workers come and return to.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para27">I shall refer to that later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para28">The group also brought out another excellent report entitled &quot;The UK Government and Africa in 2005: How joined up is Whitehall?&quot; It considers all aspects of the issue, although it admits that the report is not comprehensive. However, it looks at the pandemic and how there can be joined-up government in all Departments.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para29">I spoke about India. From 31 January to 5 February, I attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference study group in New Delhi, which considered all aspects of HIV throughout the Commonwealth. It is staggering that, according to the United Nations Development Programme human development report 2004,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;AIDS explains why 20 countries have suffered development reversals since 1990&#151;exactly half of them are Commonwealth countries.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para30">The footnote names those countries: Bahamas, Belize, Botswana, Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho, Kenya, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para31">The report was comprehensive in its recommendations about what parliamentarians and legislatures should do. It asks for a multi-sectoral approach, which is right. It also suggests establishing a Select or Standing Committee on HIV/AIDS, which should produce a report on at least an annual basis. HIV/AIDS is so important that I hope that the incoming Government on 6 May will consider that recommendation very seriously indeed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para32">The report proposed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Investing in human capital and encouraging the retention of trained professionals, especially in healthcare.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para33">One issue that was raised in India was the scandal of the number of doctors and nurses who are attracted from countries such as India and Africa to work in the health service here. Those trained health professionals should be retained in their own countries to deal with the problem of HIV/AIDS. I understand that some of our money is being used to train doctors and nurses in those countries, and that is all very well, but if once we have trained them they come to this country to work, that is a problem. We need to ensure that the doctors and nurses and professionally trained health-care providers are retained in their own countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para34">I turn now to the issue of companies&#151;British multinationals, basically&#151;doing more throughout the world. One multinational springs to mind almost immediately: Coca-Cola. There is almost nowhere in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 403WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
various parts of the world to which I have travelled in my relatively short time on this earth where I have not eventually seen the Coca-Cola sign. Its power in reaching out to the public in the remotest of villages is amazing. It can get its &quot;Drink Coca-Cola&quot; message across because its marketing expertise is second to none. It is better than many Governments in the countries in which it operates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para35">I was therefore interested to find out what Coca-Cola is doing in the battle to get the message across about HIV/AIDS and in helping to tackle it. It has set up the Coca-Cola Africa foundation, which is a partnership with UNAIDS specifically designed to make use of Coca-Cola&#039;s business systems. We must work out how Coca-Cola&#039;s strengths in marketplace infrastructure, local resources, marketing expertise and local community insights can be applied to other companies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para36">The Coca-Cola Africa foundation has supported programmes in 10 countries and assigned one of its marketing managers to work with UNAIDS. That is absolutely superb. It has rolled out projects in Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Zambia, and plans are under way to do so in other countries. Not only Coca-Cola but the company&#039;s bottlers are involved. Coca-Cola estimates that it has 45 bottling partners in 54 African countries employing 60,000 people, so it can immediately get the message across to its workers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para37">I was also interested in the power of Coca-Cola&#039;s advertising and the ability to get the message across to their markets&#151;the wider public. Celia Smith, who works for Coca-Cola in the United Kingdom, sent me a message saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Our bottle trucks are regularly used for such purposes. Certainly in Africa we use our distribution networks to get information and also condoms to remote areas. Examples of where this is happening are numerous. The charity War Child have said how successfully this works in Uganda for example.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">One of our South African bottling partners has led and supported a wide range of HIV/AIDS initiatives. They are a strong supporter of &#039;Lovelife&#039; the lifestyle brand promoting healthy living and sexuality amongst young South Africans by offering distribution support for educational materials. The bottler is also providing both infrastructure and marketing support to Hope Worldwide, an international nongovernmental organisation running prevention programmes in Africa.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In Kenya, the Coca-Cola Foundation has been working with other partners to source, transport and place cargo containers that have been converted into Rural Health Centres for the dissemination of information on HIV/AIDS to hard to reach districts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para38">We have to be concerned about the hard-to-reach districts that other people do not seem to be able to get to. Celia Smith continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Coca-Cola Foundation has also partnered with Population Services International on campaigns designed to counter the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases by the distribution of condoms. The Coca-Cola Foundation is tapping into Coca-Cola&#039;s resources to store, distribute and market education materials throughout various countries. This programme is now being rolled out to every country in Africa.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para39">That is leading by example.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para40">I have also done some research into a number of other companies that I shall mention briefly. Barclays is everywhere in this country and, increasingly, in other 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 404WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
parts of the world. It has its own programme that recognises that HIV/AIDS will have a potentially devastating effect on businesses, which will have a direct impact on the organisation, its employees and all relevant stakeholders. The company knows that that is in its own interests as well as its civic responsibility. BP has done exactly the same and has its own programme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para41">A few weeks ago, I met the HIV/AIDS director of SABMiller, the company that produces brands such as Castle Lager and Peroni. I had a lengthy conversation with him and I was impressed by what the company is doing for its work force to ensure non-discrimination and that all workers and families get educational packs. The scheme costs the company a fair amount of money. Anyone in SABMiller can be tested for HIV, and if they have got it, they will get all the necessary treatment from the company for free. That is absolutely superb. There is also confidentiality for employees so that not everyone knows that they have the condition. There is no discrimination whatever. I would like the sort of investment that SABMiller is making on behalf of its employees to be spread out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para42">I am delighted that we in the UK invest ever-increasing sums of money, as does the United States. However, the problem is absolutely massive. We cannot deal with it on our own, or even with the USA. We must be able to harness the huge power of companies throughout the world that operate in areas that are being devastated by HIV. That means looking at companies early on, in countries such as India and China, to ensure that they use their resources too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para43">I hope that the Government will respond to the Commission for Africa. The Prime Minister has already said that he will implement all the recommendations in the report, which we welcome. I hope that there will be a timetable and a proper audit, to ensure that all the recommended measures are effective.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para44">I also welcome the Government&#039;s latest initiative&#151;announced today, I understand&#151;to provide &#163;24 million to fund a trial to assess how well a microbicide gel can prevent HIV infection in women, which we now know to be the biggest killer in Africa.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas) </b> : Just to correct the hon. Gentleman slightly, that money is to fund phase 3 clinical trials of one of the leading contenders for a workable microbicide.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : I am happy to be corrected. We know that new infections are most prevalent among women. Everything that we can do to ensure both that women can access all the available treatments and that there is no discrimination between men and women in doing so is invaluable. The necessary research will cost a lot of money, and we should support it wherever it is conducted.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para45">I conclude by asking the Government to ensure that their presidencies of the G8 and European Union are effective, and that they are audited, so that we can see what has been achieved. I mentioned the fact that by the end of this election campaign 250,000 people will have died of AIDS. To put that in context, let us imagine in that period the populations of Nottingham or Cardiff or Stoke-on-Trent or Plymouth or Wolverhampton being wiped out by AIDS. That is what we are talking about&#151;that is how big the disease is.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 405WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para46">HIV/AIDS is a major crisis that requires immediate attention and action. As Professor Richard Feachem correctly argues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;HIV/AIDS is the greatest disaster in recorded human history. It is already worse than the black death in Europe in the middle of the 14th century, and the word &#039;already&#039; is important because the epidemic will get far worse before it gets better, even if we did all the right things tomorrow.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para47">He is right, but we are not doing the right things. Dr.&nbsp;Piot has argued that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the AIDS pandemic needs to be recognised to be one of the most serious threats to our prospects for progress and stability&#151;on a par with such extraordinary threats as nuclear weaponry or global climate change.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para48">HIV/AIDS is a pandemic that is not going away. We must act now. It is far too easy to pay lip service to the problem, to pose for cameras and to make speeches. We can all do that, but the victims of HIV/AIDS need more than that. They need real, practical action to save them and their future. They deserve nothing less and nothing less will do. Fortunately, failure is not inevitable and success is not impossible. Working hard, we can overcome the disease. Millions of people around the globe are looking to us to do something and we must not disappoint them.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spmin1"><b>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Sir Nicholas Winterton) </b> : The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) has sent me note to explain why she was unavoidably delayed, which I fully accept. As she is leaving the House, I am more than happy to call her to speak for the Liberal Democrats.

</p>




<a name="50405h03_time1"><h5>2.34 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h03_spnew6"><b> Dr. Jenny Tonge  (Richmond Park)</b>  (LD): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My excuse was lame: my wires were completely crossed&#151;I do not know how, but they were.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para49">I welcome this debate, so late in this Parliament. We have had many debates on AIDS and I congratulate the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) on bringing the issue to the attention of the House again. He rightly says that the problem is massive. I do not think that in modern times we have ever faced such a weapon of mass destruction as the AIDS virus. It is quite extraordinary. We must not forget that what is Africa&#039;s problem today and perhaps the problem of India and south-east Asia tomorrow will be our problem the day after that. It is wrong for people to assume that this is a third-world disease&#151;it is not. People are travelling, populations are mixing, and it will be our problem before we know where we are. Therefore, we must take great steps to deal with it, but we must take the right steps.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para50">The one thing that I must get off my chest before I leave this place is the subject of antiretroviral drugs. I totally agree that if drugs are available in the west to keep people alive and allow them to live a healthy, productive life, they should be available to people in developing countries. There is no question about that. However, it is not a simple matter; it is not like dishing out aspirin. There is a problem with antiretrovirals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para51">As a medical practitioner for many years, I know how easy it is for intelligent people to forget to take their antibiotics once they are feeling a bit better&#151;I have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 406WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
done it myself. They forget for a few days and then think, &quot;Oh, golly, I&#039;ve gone away for the weekend and forgotten for two days. Oh, never mind. I&#039;m better anyway.&quot; The huge danger with antibiotic and antiretroviral therapy is that, at the very least, people will forget to take the drugs, even if the drugs are cheaper and they have access to them. If that happens, resistant strains of the virus will pop up all over the place, and the science will not be able to keep up with them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para52">So what do we need? We need a tightly organised health infrastructure if people are to take the drugs properly. It is in their and our interest that they are taken properly. Otherwise, the drugs, which are our only weapon, will become useless. Can we have an assurance from the Government that they have discussed with their international voluntary and Government partners the question of making the drugs available only if there is a proper health infrastructure to deliver them?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para53">I point the Minister to the really wonderful example in Botswana. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley mentioned Coca-Cola. Ever since I came into Parliament, I have been beefing on about how Coca-Cola reaches parts of the world that other things cannot reach, and asking why a big container of condoms cannot be taped on to every bottle as it is distributed? Coca-Cola gets everywhere, and the condoms should be going with it. That is a good example of industry helping in the fight against AIDS, and I welcome what Coca-Cola is doing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para54">When I went to Botswana, I was hugely impressed by a public-private partnership called Debswana, which includes De Beers, the Government of Botswana, Merck Sharp and Dohme, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is funding much of the cost of the drugs. They have come together for all the people who work in the diamond industry&#151;it seems that that includes most Botswanans&#151;and have drawn up a tight regime. The workers are rigorously tested and then have to sign a contract. If they break the contract&#151;it requires them to take the drugs properly and attend for check-ups and testing&#151;they are in danger of losing their jobs and livelihoods. They will no longer receive drugs through that public-private partnership and will no longer be in the programme if they break the contract. They must stick to it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para55">Multinational companies get such bad press. Everyone castigates big companies, saying that they never do any good, they despoil the environment, they do not uphold workers&#039; rights, they do not obey the guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. If only such companies would say, &quot;Okay. Everyone, everywhere we are operating, will be part of a campaign to combat AIDS.&quot; That is the first thing; I have got it off my chest. Please let us not throw millions of pounds at antiretroviral drugs that will be a waste and will make the pandemic worse.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para56">The other thing that I have to get off my chest is the fact that the United States Government, who say that they are putting $5 billion into the fight against AIDS, refuse to fund any reproductive health programmes because of the involvement of abortion. They are withdrawing from many of them, and programmes all over the world are failing because of that. They also refuse to allow cheap generic drugs, and it seems to me 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 407WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the $5 billion that they are ploughing into the fight against AIDS is going straight to the big drugs companies in the form of subsidies for antiretroviral drugs. It is an important issue. I know that my ex-medical colleagues feel strongly about it and would want me to impress on the Government the fact that we must not waste those drugs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para57">I want to mention how important women&#039;s health is in the whole fight. Again, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley mentioned that. If people are being treated for AIDS, it is often the man in the family who gets the treatment. If money runs short, he gets the drugs and the wife stops. In my experience, it is always the women who lose out in developing countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para58">Women&#039;s health is integral. I am delighted that, following the work done by the all-party group on population, development and reproductive health, headed by the hon. Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty), and the report that it published, the Government have accepted that women&#039;s health, particularly their reproductive health, is integral to the fight against AIDS. The two have to go together; we cannot fight AIDS without doing something about the reproductive health of women. Improving women&#039;s health means not only access to treatment, but better childbirth&#151;fewer accidents in childbirth, more trained midwives and more village birth assistants. It also means better access to healthcare for women. It means treating intercurrent infections such as thrush, chlamydia and trichomonas&#151;all of which make women more susceptible to the AIDS virus. It means continuing our campaign against female genital mutilation, which does such terrible damage to women and ensures that the first time they have intercourse, if it is with an HIV positive partner, they will catch AIDS for sure because of the damage done by simple intercourse.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para59">Such measures are terribly important, combined with family planning and women&#039;s ability to limit the size of their families. Their health is dependent on being able to do that. We should also always remember that even in my family the best bits of food go to husband and children. I still have the nauseating habit of making sure that the men and the children have had enough before I serve myself. It is a sad fact, but that is the sort of mother I am&#151;is it not beautiful? Everyone will know that a lot of women are like that. They tend to serve up the food and then have what is left for themselves. In developing counties, when one bowl of rice goes between all, women get very little food. We must tackle that. We must also tackle the fact that women inhale more smoke from burning wood. Wood is still the staple fuel in developing countries and that affects their physical health and respiratory system in a big way. We must make moves on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para60">All such things, together with microbicides&#151;the Government&#039;s work on those is terribly welcome&#151;are important in the fight against AIDS. It is not just about antiretroviral drugs. In my view&#151;I must say that I am a &quot;glass half empty&quot; person when it comes to the AIDS pandemic&#151;we may well lose a generation of people to the pandemic. However, we need to concentrate on prevention for the next generation. That means education and male and female condoms. It is a simple measure, but the message must get through about education and the use of condoms. Please God that the new Pope will have a different attitude towards 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 408WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
condoms, at least for the prevention of infection. We need a change of policy worldwide. It must become a sin not to use a condom if a person thinks that they or their partner are HIV-positive. Although we accept that many things must be done about the pandemic, education and prevention will still be the biggest weapon, all over the developing world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para61">I want to mention three other things, briefly. They are big issues, and I do not want the fact that I do not give them much time to lead the House to think that I do not consider them important. One is the number of AIDS orphans being created by the pandemic. That is building up one hell of a sociological problem for the rest of the world. Children are growing up without parents, with ageing grandparents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para62">I am a grandparent to six grandchildren, and the Easter holidays were very tiring, although I am a well-nourished, healthy woman. For a sick, elderly grandparent in the developing world to have to take on a host of grandchildren is quite something, and we must concentrate hard on that issue. That means considering the matter from the point of view of the orphans, but I understand that Help the Aged wants us also to consider the needs of the people who must care for those children.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : Does the hon. Lady recognise that, if even one parent has died and that parent was the breadwinner, youngsters have to work to help the family to survive? We talk about the education that the youngsters need, but they are denied schooling from an early age because the family does not believe that it can be an economic unit unless the youngsters go out to work. The poverty is reinforced when one or both parents die.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew8"><b> Dr. Tonge </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a good point and it is true that children are often denied education because they need to work&#151;something that we are not familiar with in this country. We have long forgotten, although it is not so long ago&#151;perhaps 150 years&#151;that children did have to work to prevent their families from starving. That goes on in probably two thirds of the world today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para63">Lastly, I want to put in a plea for more vaccine research. As a medic, I know that a vaccine is the only answer. We have conquered&#151;touch wood&#151;smallpox in this world. It should be possible, with the help of vaccines, to conquer the AIDS virus eventually. My final words in this speech should perhaps be to pay tribute to the international AIDS vaccine initiative, headed by Dr. Seth Berkley in the USA. It is a brilliant organisation which has done the most extraordinary work and has pushed and fought for more money to go into AIDS vaccine research and into the companies that will make the product when it comes on stream. There is a huge amount to do in that area, and I pay tribute to the people who have been working on it. I hope that the Government will continue to support them.

</p>




<a name="50405h03_time2"><h5>2.48 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton)</b>  (Con): I think that it was five months ago when we met in Westminster Hall to discuss HIV/AIDS. I calculate that in those five months probably another 2 million people around the world will have been infected by HIV, and perhaps another 1 million will have died from AIDS.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 409WH</b>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para64">It is clear that the HIV/AIDS emergency is the biggest threat facing humankind today. It kills 8,000 people every day. More than 40 million people are infected and for too many people lack of access to treatment turns a lifelong illness into a guaranteed death sentence. Every new HIV infection that could have been prevented is not just a tragedy but a scandal, so it is right that we debate the issues today.

<p>
<a name="50405h03_para65">We are all grateful, I think, to my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) for initiating the debate. He has a clear command of the issue and has shown continuing interest in it, as one could tell from all that he said today. I am also glad, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you were able to call the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), and I am glad that she was able to speak. We are sorry that she is leaving the House, and that was probably her valedictory speech, but we wish her well. I want also to acknowledge her long-standing interest in international development and humanitarian matters, and the contribution that she has always made to our debates and proceedings, particularly on matters of reproductive health. We have heard that clearly today with her sensible analysis of how to treat HIV/AIDS, primarily in Africa but anywhere that it might exist.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para66">The battle against HIV/AIDS is a political as much as a medical challenge. Political will is holding us back more than the absorptive capacity of Governments of developing countries. The scale of the epidemic must compel us to act. When historians in the future examine how our generation reacted to the crisis, no politician will be able to use ignorance as an excuse for inaction. At a global level, the political response has not until recently reflected the urgency of the situation. We might as well be honest&#151;40 million people need treatment, yet it seems that the international community will fall far short of achieving the target of treating even 3 million people by the end of the year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para67">Despite recent progress, there is still not enough cash for the fight against AIDS. UNAIDS has estimated that it will take some &#163;6.6 billion this year to counter the spread of HIV, and so far only about half of that has been forthcoming. The G8 launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2001; now it has an obligation to ensure that it is properly funded. When existing programmes come up for renewal, we must ensure that the money is there to pay for them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para68">The British Government have shown initiative on HIV/AIDS. I admit that, and I salute the Department&#039;s decision to earmark &#163;1.5 billion for the AIDS fight and to include HIV/AIDS in all its bilateral activities. However, let us face it, we have to do more and there is a real problem on the ground. Treatment costs about $1 a day. Many people have to live on $1 a day. So, they can either be treated and starve or eat and die of AIDS. That is not much of a choice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para69">The best way to tackle HIV/AIDS is through a combination of preventive education, the provision of condoms, help for universal primary health care, the extension of antiretroviral drug treatment&#151;despite what the hon. Member for Richmond Park had to say about the dangers of not consuming those drugs consistently&#151;and the continuing quest for a HIV vaccine.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para70">Governments in the rich world must take strong and swift action to stem the spread of HIV; equally the Governments of countries with affected populations must demonstrate the political will to tackle the crisis. Charities, civil society, enlightened private companies, which my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley described, and the families of people affected by HIV/AIDS must all play an important role in the battle against HIV. Politicians and Governments control resources of the magnitude necessary to win the war on HIV/AIDS, however. Where the political will exists, the fight against HIV/AIDS is winnable. Places as diverse as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uganda, Thailand and Brazil have succeeded in slowing the spread of HIV through effective programmes of prevention and treatment. Those examples show that ultimate political responsibility lies with the Governments of those countries affected by the pandemic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para71">Uganda has shown that where there is strong, enlightened leadership, the spread of HIV can be brought under control. Equally, the South African experience shows the damage that can be done when the men at the top fail to comprehend the seriousness of the threat posed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para72">So far the global political response to AIDS has been focused&#151;quite naturally&#151;on sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are terrifying signs of a nascent epidemic in India and China, which between them are home to more than one third of the world&#039;s population. India is likely to be acknowledged as the country with the largest number of HIV positive citizens in the world during 2005. Decisive action by the Governments of India and China could save the lives of millions of people in the coming years, but historically, at least, the Governments of those two countries have not lived up to their responsibilities to their citizens. Donor countries must assert quite bluntly that India&#039;s leadership in particular needs to wake up. If we see an explosion of AIDS in China and India, let no one say that we did not see it coming.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that part of the problem with all this is that Africa was in denial for many years? It was a taboo subject, so it did not mention it, and it denied that it was happening. If China and India go down that path, they will suffer the same problems that Africa is suffering now. They can avert the tragedy of sub-Saharan Africa now if they stop their denial, have good governance and put in place proper and effective programmes.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Duncan </b> : My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Early action is effective action, and no action can be too early. With that in mind, I shall explore how the British Government should deal with Governments who refuse to take HIV/AIDS seriously. How do we use our diplomatic influence to encourage the Government of any such country to take action to help to stem the spread of HIV?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para73">Clearly, that raises complex and difficult issues of morality and diplomacy. I do not pretend to have all the answers myself, and I approach the matter in a spirit of curiosity rather than of criticism. We need to tread carefully. Outside interference in the domestic affairs of some countries is likely to be resented and might even be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 411WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
counter-productive, but perhaps the Minister will agree that there is one option that we simply must not choose&#151;the option to do nothing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para74">Surely we cannot stand by and watch while HIV/AIDS ravages an entire sub-continent. There is a positive precedent for action. The recent report by the Select Committee on International Development on the Department for International Development&#039;s activities in India states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;International donors and organisations played a key role in motivating the GoI to initiate its first responses to HIV/AIDS during the early 1990s.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para75">I am happy to acknowledge that it goes on to salute the role that DFID has played in shaping India&#039;s agenda on AIDS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para76">It continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Early indications are that the new UPA government is taking the challenge seriously&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para77">and


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We strongly encourage DFID to do all it can to support the GoI in taking such decisive action.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para78">I would be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s assessment of the most effective and productive ways in which the British Government can influence the Governments of affected countries to live up to their responsibilities to their people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para79">HIV/AIDS is inextricably linked to poverty, so the solution to the crisis is indelibly linked to the wider goals of poverty reduction. Political leaders here can do much&nbsp;to address that poverty. Zambia has 1 million HIV-positive people, but spends 30 per cent. more on servicing its debts than it does on health. Kenya spends $0.76 per capita on HIV/AIDS compared with $12.92 per capita on debt repayments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para80">As well as AIDS-specific funding at this year&#039;s G8 summit and EU presidency, we need action for faster and deeper debt relief, for better aid, and for freer and fairer trade. I hope that I get the opportunity on 6 May to implement those objectives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para81">The Conservative party has advanced concrete and ambitious plans for action on those key priorities. Conservatives will increase spending on DFID from $4.5 billion in 2005&#150;06 to $5.3 billion in 2007&#150;08. We will work towards meeting the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent. of national income on international aid by 2013. Any suggestion that we would cut spending would be a lie.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para82">Our studies have shown that significant efficiency savings can be made in the way in which the aid budget is spent. Every penny that we save will be ploughed straight back into DFID spending. That money will lift more people out of poverty, because we will spend it more effectively, by focusing it on the poorest countries and channelling more through non-governmental organisations, and less through the wasteful EU. <i>[Laughter.]</i>
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew12"><b> Dr. Tonge </b> : I cannot resist saying this. If the hon. Gentleman becomes the Secretary of State for International Development after 5 May&#151;if pigs fly&#151;I shall be watching from the wings every single penny that his Government put into international development. I shall haunt him until he fulfils all of those promises.

Secretary of State&#039;s office, I look forward to inviting her to come and give me the benefit of her advice and experience.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para83">As I said at the beginning, we consider international development an area of consensus. We can argue where we have differences, and there may be a difference of emphasis on free trade. We may not actually need to argue on the EU, because although the Minister laughed just now, an answer to a parliamentary question that I tabled said that his Department was not happy with the fact that EU spending was devoted too much to stability in neighbouring countries and insufficiently to poverty reduction, which is what aid should be all about. The Minister is laughing only at his own parliamentary answer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para84">We will also support small-scale, environmentally and socially sustainable projects rather than large-scale, prestige, big-ticket schemes. We will make free trade fairer and fair trade freer. A Conservative Government will support a multilateral, rules-based trading system overseen by the World Trade Organisation&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I know that everyone is tempted to indulge in electioneering, even in humble debates in Westminster Hall, but I must remind the hon. Gentleman that we are concentrating on Government policy on HIV/AIDS overseas and not on general overseas aid and development.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Duncan </b> : The two are of course inextricably linked, but I accept your strictures, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para85">We have laid down everything that we intend to do in our manifesto document, &quot;Action on global poverty&quot;, which is available on our website for all interested readers. The policies set out in it will help secure the ongoing improvements in living conditions, which will help to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS. By combining compassion and generosity with realism and practicality, we will help end poverty and stem the spread of HIV.

</p>




<a name="50405h03_time3"><h5>3.3 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h03_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development  (Mr. Gareth Thomas) </b> : It is a pleasure to take part in such a debate, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) for securing it and for the bulk of his speech. He set out the continuing challenge facing developed countries to help developing countries, and in his focus on companies at the end of his speech, he rightly challenged us to do more to work with companies and the private sector more broadly to fight AIDS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para86">I join the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) in paying tribute to the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge) and her campaigning record. She has been a doughty champion on women&#039;s issues in general and on development. She is an opponent with whom one cannot relax, and that is testimony to her ability.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para87">Let me join hon. Members who have spoken by highlighting some statistics that demonstrate the scale of the challenge before us. In 2004, more than 3 million people died of AIDS, and nearly 5 million were newly infected with the virus. We are seeing a reversal of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 413WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
development gains that have been made in sub-Saharan Africa in the past 20 to 30 years because of the HIV/AIDS crisis. Today, nearly 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV, the bulk of them in developing countries, and in 2003, an estimated 12.3&nbsp;million African children were orphaned as a result of AIDS. Sadly, we know that the worst is yet to come. The number of children orphaned by AIDS is expected to rise to 18.4 million by 2010, and a growing number of them will be double orphans&#151;children who have lost their mother and father.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para88">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley rightly alluded to the challenges in Asia and to the real worry that we shall see in India, China and the rest of Asia what we are seeing in Africa. Indeed, if nothing were to change, India would have a larger number of people with HIV/AIDS by 2010 than any country in Africa.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para89">My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) does an excellent job chairing the all-party group on AIDS and, like other hon. Members, he rightly reminded us of the challenge facing eastern Europe, with its rising incidence of HIV/AIDS. I should add that there is also a growing challenge in the number of people infected with HIV in the Caribbean. That epidemic is being fuelled by the stigma and discrimination that surrounds people with HIV/AIDS, and we must continue to challenge that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para90">The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton was absolutely right that political will is fundamental to tackling HIV/AIDS. There needs to be political will in developing countries, and he highlighted several countries where there has been strong political commitment to tackling AIDS. Uganda and Senegal are two clear examples, and Brazil is another. Political will is also fundamental in developed countries. As rich nations, we have to make more money available for the fight against AIDS. An increasing amount is being made available, but we clearly need to do more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para91">The hon. Gentleman mentioned India. As he suggested, the British Government, through my Department, have been having extensive, ongoing discussions with the National AIDS Control Organisation in India and with the new Indian Government, as we did with the previous Government. I pay tribute to the new Government for deciding to increase the amount that they make available to fight AIDS. I also welcome the appointment of the new head of the National AIDS Control Organisation, whom I met when I went to India to discuss HIV/AIDS in September and October last year. Things are beginning to move in the right direction, and we are beginning to see a step change in the fight against AIDS. As Dr.&nbsp;Quraishi made clear to me, however, much more still needs to be done, and donors such as Britain clearly need to do more to support that effort.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : I too talked to an Indian Minister, who said that the Government were in negotiations with Coca-Cola to replicate and harness the ability that it had clearly demonstrated in Africa. If they can do that early on with a number of other companies&#151;perhaps companies based in the United Kingdom with divisions in India&#151;that would be very effective. I hope that the Minister will at least allude to some of the things that the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 414WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
British Government will be doing to contact British companies so that they are proactive in India and other parts of the world, as well as in Africa.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : I will do just that if the hon. Gentleman will bear with me. However, I wanted to answer the last part of the point raised by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton about political will. He asked what we would do if there were problems with the attitude of a developing country Government, and Burma and Zimbabwe are classic cases. There are real concerns about the growing AIDS epidemic in those countries, and there is clearly a complete absence of political will at the top echelons of their Governments to tackle the&nbsp;AIDS crisis. In such cases, we have to recognise that we cannot work through existing Government mechanisms, as we can in other countries in the developing world. We have to work through United Nations organisations and NGOs, and that, indeed, is what we are doing in both countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para92">The UK is already the world&#039;s second biggest donor of AIDS and sexual and reproductive health assistance. I hope that the commitments that we signalled last July, when the Prime Minister launched &quot;Taking Action&quot;, the UK&#039;s strategy for tackling HIV/AIDS in the developing world, underline still further our commitment. In that document, we set out how the UK will respond to the challenge of AIDS by promoting a comprehensive response to prevention&#151;hon. Members rightly said that we must continue to focus on that&#151;treatment and care. Our response will also involve addressing the social impact of AIDS, prioritising the needs of women&#151;as the hon. Member for Richmond Park rightly mentioned&#151;and young people including orphans and other young children made vulnerable by AIDS. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms&nbsp;Keeble) will make strong representations on their behalf in an Adjournment debate in the Chamber later today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para93">We have committed some &#163;1.5 billion of taxpayers&#039; money to tackling HIV/AIDS over the next three years. As part of that commitment we have doubled our support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, bringing our total support to&nbsp;more than &#163;250 million through to 2008. At least &#163;150 million of that &#163;1.5 billion will be spent on programmes to meet the needs of orphans and other children made vulnerable by AIDS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para94">We have given additional funding of some &#163;36 million over four years to UNAIDS to support its global leadership role in the fight against AIDS, and we have provided additional funding of &#163;80 million over four years to the United Nations Population Fund to support HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health work with women. As the hon. Member for Richmond Park said, that is not least because of the growing recognition that AIDS increasingly has a woman&#039;s face, to borrow the words of Kofi Annan. We will also use some of the &#163;1.5 billion to increase support for research into microbicides and vaccines for HIV prevention, of which more in a moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para95">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley touched on our presidencies of the G8 and the EU. He rightly said that they represent a huge opportunity for us to bring the world together to make further progress on HIV/AIDS. He will be aware of the Prime Minister&#039;s commitment to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 415WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
putting Africa centre stage for our discussions at the G8 summit&#151;the Commission for Africa feeding into that process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para96">In terms of HIV/AIDS, we will focus on two areas during the presidency. First, we will try to make the money that is available for AIDS, and further money that we want to see become available, work more effectively. In too many developing countries there are simply too many donor missions. That ties up resources as the countries have to respond to the needs of each donor mission. We need to ensure that there is much more effective international co-ordination of our support for developing country Governments in dealing with HIV/AIDS. Secondly, we want to maintain the momentum that has begun to build up around HIV prevention.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para97">The hon. Lady rightly paid tribute to the international AIDS vaccine initiative and the leadership of Dr. Seth Berkley, whom the Secretary of State and I have met several times to discuss the hunt for a vaccine and how we can step up efforts internationally. At the Sea Island G8 summit in 2004, the Americans rightly prioritised the need to step up our efforts. It is our responsibility as the G8&#039;s host this year to take that issue forward. There have been a series of meetings building up to our summit in Gleneagles, considering how we can find additional resources for a vaccine. It is one area where we want the European Union to show additional leadership. We are in discussions with the EU about how it might do that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para98">We also want to secure further support for sexual and reproductive health and rights services and further financing to accelerate development of microbicides. Again, we are talking to the EU, which has shown some leadership already on microbicide financing, to see whether it can find additional resources. On 9 March in London, we hosted jointly with UNAIDS, the Americans and France a ministerial conference: &quot;Making the Money Work: The Three Ones In Action&quot;. Its aim was to take us towards agreement on more coherent national and international efforts to co-ordinate a more effective response to each developing country Government in the fight against AIDS, as well as looking at establishing the necessary financing framework.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para99">The key outcomes were an agreement to mobilise funding to narrow the AIDS funding shortfall, which we currently estimate to be at least $8 billion over the next three years, with some $20 billion needed annually from 2008. Further necessary work to underpin those figures has started, as well as a process of agreeing the division of labour between the various international organisations involved in the fight against AIDS. Under the UK presidency, we shall host the global fund&#039;s replenishment conference in September, which will take place alongside a broader AIDS funding meeting, building on the &quot;Making the Money Work&quot; event. It aims to narrow the financing gap for AIDS. By the end of 2005, we want agreement among donors and the international system on a well co-ordinated and funded plan to tackle AIDS, so that we can move forward on all the issues that I have described.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para100">I want to deal with some of the specific points that hon. Members have raised. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley highlighted the capacity issue, which is now the biggest challenge facing developing countries in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 416WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
their response to AIDS. Drugs prices were once the issue, but the Department is now working on the capacity issue. It is to provide an additional &#163;100 million to the Government of Malawi, working with them to see what we can do to increase the number of nurses and doctors. Malawi has fewer than 30 nurses per 100,000 population, compared with 85 per 100,000 in Tanzania, and 1,000 health workers per 100,000 in Europe. That gives a sense of the scale of the AIDS crisis and the capacity gap. We are seeking to increase the funding of nurses and doctors in Malawi, in order to help to persuade them not to seek employment elsewhere, including in Europe.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew18"><b> Dr. Tonge </b> : I was in Malawi a couple of years ago, when there was a 40 per cent. vacancy rate for doctors and nurses. Doctors and nurses said that they were leaving not in search of better wages&#151;they would like to stay at home if they could&#151;but because the hospitals and health services, such as they are, were completely overwhelmed by AIDS victims, who are left at the gates by relatives. In the wards that I saw, people slept two in a bed and two under the bed; they took it in turns to lie on the bed. What we saw, in what used to be a decent hospital, was absolutely horrific. That problem must be addressed. AIDS victims could be treated or cared for in the community if there were a community nursing structure. That would help the hospitals return to normal work, and would keep the doctors and nurses in Malawi.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : I accept what the hon. Lady says. To amplify her point, of Malawi&#039;s 29 districts, 10 have no Government doctor, and four have no doctor at all. That demonstrates the truth of her comment. We are seeking not only to pay the existing doctors and nurses more money in order to retain them in Malawi, but to expand training capacity to recruit more people and to invest more in the health infrastructure. We are also looking at what we need to do in the hard-to-reach areas, about which the hon. Member for Ribble Valley has specific concerns.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew20"><b> Dr. Tonge </b> : I am sorry to dwell on this point, but it is terribly important for doctors and nurses to have some sort of stimulus when they are working in medicine and surgery, and to do something other than treat AIDS victims. When I was in Malawi, they were acting virtually as mortuary attendants. There was little that they could do, and that was the major reason for their wanting to get out. If the medical and nursing staff are to be retained, someone must get the AIDS victims out of the hospitals.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew21"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : I accept the hon. Lady&#039;s point that we must not only focus on HIV/AIDS but look in the round at health care in developing countries. Over the past eight years, we have spent some &#163;1.5 billion on developing health systems in developing countries. Clearly, it would be nonsense if we were to focus only on AIDS. We must look at the broader picture. In that context, our programme in Malawi will be helpful, not only to tackling AIDS, but to health service capacity more generally.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para101">The hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Ribble Valley referred to the numbers of people needing treatment. From June 2004, there were only 440,000 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 417WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
people on treatment in developing countries. By December 2004, that figure had gone up to 720,000&#151;a 75 per cent. increase&#151;which is directly attributable to the leadership that the World Health Organisation has shown as part of its 3 by 5 initiative.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew22"><b> Mr. Duncan </b> : Why has the 3 by 5 initiative been such a failure?
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew23"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : The initiative has not been a failure. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Let me finish the point. It has focused attention on hard-to-reach areas and on what we need to do to increase people&#039;s access to treatment. We need to recognise the very low base from which things started. I am referring to the number of people in developing countries who were on treatment when the initiative was launched. The fact that, in only six months, there was a 75 per cent. increase in the number of people on treatment is encouraging. We have some nine months until the end of 2005. It will be pretty difficult to hit the 3 million target, but I do not think that we will be far off it, and without the initiative we would not have made the progress that we have.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para102">Clearly, as the hon. Gentleman says, more work needs to be done by rich countries working in partnership with the Governments of developing countries to get more people on to treatment. Fundamental to that is increasing capacity in the health service. An example of that is what we are doing in Malawi, which we hope will help that country.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew24"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : On the point about targets, we can talk about percentages, but the real problem is that we are starting from a low base. Since the Minister has been speaking, more than 3,000 people have died of AIDS. That puts into perspective the real problem that we face. Surely we should be far more ambitious about the targets. The approach has to be unified&#151;integrated not only within countries, but throughout the world.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h03_spnew25"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> : We have to have ambitious targets. Sadly, the target of 3 million people on treatment by 2005 was very ambitious, but it has focused international attention on how we get people on to treatment. The 75 per cent. increase in only six months last year is encouraging in its general direction. However, the hon. Gentleman is right: given the numbers of people who will potentially need AIDS treatment, this issue requires immediate international attention. I hope that the financing conference that we host in September and the global fund&#039;s replenishment 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 418WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
conference will help to lever further resources into the fight against AIDS and the fight to make access to treatment more widely available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para103">The hon. Gentleman rightly paid tribute to the companies that are working extremely hard to give access to treatment to their staff who are HIV-positive and, in some cases, to the communities where the companies are based. He named various companies, and I shall give two examples. Diageo pledged to provide all its HIV-positive staff in Africa and their dependants with anti-retroviral therapy for life. Anglo American has launched a partnership with the global fund to extend prevention and treatment programmes to local communities in South Africa. One outcome of the conference that the Caribbean countries asked us to host on fighting stigma and discrimination relating to HIV-AIDS in the Caribbean, which was held in November, was an agreement to work with the private sector more effectively in the Caribbean to focus its attention on these issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para104">The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton launched an attack on the European Union that was pretty typical of what comes from Conservatives. Although the EU needs to do more to fight AIDS and poverty, we should acknowledge the considerable progress and the huge contribution that it has made to the global fund, for example. That has helped to lever in additional money.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para105">The hon. Member for Richmond Park touched on the importance of education. I am sure that she will have been pleased by the launch at the end of January of our increase in funding for girls&#039; education. We shall continue to work, through the fast-track initiative, to focus on countries where the challenge on access to education is particularly severe. I have touched on the hon. Lady&#039;s concerns about vaccines and the work that we shall do to step up a gear in that respect.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h03_para106">The only sour note in the debate was the sanctimonious nonsense about the Tory spending plans on development, and I was surprised that the hon. Members for Ribble Valley and for Rutland and Melton chose not to mention their party&#039;s dismal record on international development issues. Nevertheless, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley for securing the debate. It is always helpful for us to be reminded of the challenges posed by AIDS. The hon. Gentleman asked the Government to focus specifically on what else the private sector can do, and I undertake to continue to examine that issue.

<a name="50405h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Health Service (Northern Ireland)</h3>


<a name="50405h04_time0"><h5>3.25 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h04_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Iris Robinson  (Strangford)</b>  (DUP): I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate, albeit in the dying moments of this Parliament. I again raise the issue of health, having done so at the Northern Ireland Grand Committee during the draft Budget debate. However, as the Minister who then responded was not the Health Minister, I hope for better answers today, and I am delighted to see the Minister in her place.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para0">Health service provision is a major concern for people in Northern Ireland, because it has the worst waiting lists in the United Kingdom. As I said in the Grand Committee, the Audit Office report into the Province&#039;s hospital waiting lists, which was published last year, confirmed that Northern Ireland has the worst waiting lists in the United Kingdom. The Ulster public face longer waits to access services than patients in England, Scotland or Wales.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para1">The latest quarterly waiting list statistics for the Province indicate slight improvements in relation to in-patient lists, which have been deemed a departmental priority. However the number requiring an initial hospital out-patient appointment continues to rise, and has almost doubled since 1998 to 164,672. In England, 1.8 per cent. of the population are on waiting lists for treatment, but in Northern Ireland the comparative figure is 3 per cent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para2">In seeking to improve the in-patient list, the out-patient lists are suffering. We even have waiting lists to get on to waiting lists. Greater investment in the training and recruitment of health professionals is essential and I also want to see the prompt restructuring of our dozens of health bodies to streamline decision making and enhance accountability.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para3">Although a proposed increase of 9 per cent., up to &#163;3.3 billion, in the current expenditure of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety may, on the surface, appear generous, health service inflation continues to grow at a much steeper rate. By 2007&#150;08, the percentage rise that direct rule Ministers have committed themselves to will be less than 6 per cent. The positive public messages from Ministers do not equate with the demands and restrictions that they are placing on senior managers away from the media spotlight.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para4">Differential access to private health care, as well as rurality, and factors related to ability to pay, reduce the differential spend per head on health and social services. Statistics indicate that, after assessing relative needs, to provide services at a comparative level would cost 17 per cent. more per person in Northern Ireland than in England. Different levels of private health care elevate that to 21 per cent. more to achieve the same level of service. However, the Barnett formula makes no allowance for differential need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para5">I want to make a particular point about the quality of Northern Ireland&#039;s hospital stock, which is very poor. There is also a greater backlog of maintenance compared to that in England. Many of our hospitals are of a substantial age and require redevelopment or replacement. Imaging and laboratory equipment that is more than 10 years old needs to be replaced to improve quality, effectiveness, and staff productivity, and to reduce patient delays.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 420WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para6">Although the cost of treating the victims of 35 years of terrorism soaked up hundreds of millions of pounds from the local health budget in past years, some imagine that, because violence has significantly reduced, those extra costs are no longer being incurred. Sadly, however, apart from the many new victims requiring attention, which do not make the headlines to the same extent, the health service still has to care for the victims of the past. For instance, bomb victims still require prosthetic limbs, and many still live with the psychological consequences of terrorism. And, of course, the trauma has not stopped. I unsuccessfully sought an estimate of the costs associated with caring for recent victims of the ongoing paramilitary beatings and shootings.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para7">I am sure that the Minister has been briefed on the fact that the local press in Northern Ireland were this morning reporting the tragedy that is waiting to happen as ambulance cover falls to dangerous levels across the Province. Union officials report that large swathes of the Province were left without sufficient cover over Easter. On Easter Saturday, the entire city of Londonderry had no ambulance crew. Staff in other divisions had to scramble around to provide personnel.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para8">On the same night, there was no vehicle to cover the night shift in Strabane, County Tyrone, so the crew were forced to drive a minibus the fifteen miles to Altnagelvin hospital to find an ambulance. Staff from Enniskillen were sent to Londonderry to cover an area with which they were unfamiliar. A patient was transferred in a day-care vehicle in order to free an emergency ambulance. Last Saturday night in East Antrim there was only one crew covering Whiteabbey, Rathcoole and Carrick, but there should have been at least two. The depot in Downpatrick regularly takes ambulances off the road because staff are unavailable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para9">A major overhaul of ambulance staffing is required to ensure that each depot has the appropriate number of personnel. I trust that the Minister will address that most critical matter. I fear to contemplate what might happen were a major incident to occur while we are reliant on an unsatisfactory skeleton service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para10">I hope that the Minister will deal also with the question of chemotherapy drugs, which illustrates the problem of rising costs in Northern Ireland. A new regional cancer centre will open its doors at Belfast City hospital early in 2006. However, hospitals, including Belfast City, recently had to produce emergency contingency plans because of multi-million pound shortfalls. One area identified for savings was that of cancer drugs. Thankfully, an injection of cash averted the withdrawal of those vital medications, but it highlights the difficulties that we face.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para11">Diagnosing cancer earlier, and keeping more people alive, means treating cancer as a chronic disease, with third and fourth-line drugs often being required. Experience in other countries indicates that the rapid growth in the use of chemotherapy and haematology drug-based therapies will continue. Cancer drugs are also being used more frequently for symptom control.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para12">Chemotherapy drug costs at Belfast City hospital rose by about &#163;3 million last year, and &#163;1.4 million had to be found just to maintain the services currently being provided. More cancer patients are being diagnosed and treated in the Province every year. Day case and outpatient attendances at the City hospital were up by a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 421WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
staggering 30 per cent. in one year. We are building a new cancer centre of excellence and attempting to attract world leaders in the field to come and work in the Province, and funding is proving problematic. Cancer sufferers should be entitled to the very best treatments. It is dreadful to think that life-saving treatments may not be available to those in the greatest need because the local health service cannot afford them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para13">Haematology patients also have concerns. A constituent of mine, Anne Aitchison, a lovely lady, has been campaigning for many years for improved local health services. In particular, she has been promoting the provision of coagulometers. Not only would those devices benefit patients; they would save the local health service money and time. Patients currently face a trek to the hospital warfarin clinic, and they often have to wait several hours for the results of an invasive blood test before seeing a doctor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para14">Regular hospital attendance can swallow up a significant part of the lives of patients whose blood needs to be checked every week; it can result in the loss of a whole day from work or education. Massive resources are used in warfarin clinics. Doctors and nurses are needed to conduct expensive blood tests, and ambulances are sometimes required to collect patients, whereas the new coagulometers can be used by patients in their own homes, and involve only a small pinprick, much like blood glucose monitoring. It is much easier to use them, especially where elderly and confused patients are concerned, than to take intravenous blood samples.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para15">In Germany, hand-held coagulometers have been provided for approximately 100,000 patients, but in Northern Ireland, where some 1.5 per cent. of the population requires oral anticoagulation therapy, they can be acquired only by private means or through fundraising. The use of coagulometers empowers patients to take greater responsibility for their care, something that the Government have been keen to encourage. They should be made more widely available through the national health service, and I hope that the Minister consider favourably the ongoing pleas of warfarin patients.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para16">My party has been considering general improvements that could be made to the health service in Northern Ireland, and we aim to publish proposals in a policy document shortly. There is little direct responsibility or accountability in any tier of health care management in the Province. We need transparency in spending and detailed audit trails. In recent years, a huge amount of money has been thrown at problems, and it has disappeared without trace. There must be targeted strategies with clear responsibility and accountability. Under the 1998 Belfast agreement, the Sinn Fein Health Minister acted as she pleased, regardless of the views of the Health Committee, the Assembly or her Executive colleagues. If ever a new Executive is created, there must be more opportunities for scrutiny, and Ministers must be prevented from acting unilaterally.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para17">The Minister will know that our health care staff perform complicated procedures in pressurised environments. However, they often feel unappreciated, and are suffering a morale problem. That must change if the national health service is to retain the cream of the health professionals, who are frustrated that they 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 422WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
cannot deliver the optimum service. Maximum use should be made of highly trained staff. It is inappropriate for specialists to perform tasks that could be done by others who are less qualified.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para18">Despite the new general medical services contract, general practitioners struggling to find beds for their patients feel undervalued, overburdened and unsupported. They do not have enough time to spend with patients, and that sometimes results in inappropriate referrals to already crowded emergency departments. Approximately 90 per cent. of national health service patients are dealt with in primary care. That speciality must not be allowed to suffer on account of acute care pressures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para19">The DUP wants to decrease administrative bureaucracy, not just to save money but also to streamline decision making and create a more efficient system. We advocate that, as a result of the ongoing review of public administration, the number of boards and trusts should be slashed to leave no more than half a dozen authorities. A single body should oversee regional services, and money must be channelled to front-line services rather than being frittered away in administrative costs. However, it is essential that the expertise developed over many years should not be lost as a result of such rationalisation. A co-ordinated health care network must develop, and replication of services must cease.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para20">Significant investment is required in order to improve efficiency in the service. We advocate increased funding, in excess of the Barnett formula, to ensure that those in the Province receive a standard of care that not only matches the best found elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but relates to need. We are talking not just about providing extra beds but about finding more staff, which will lead to an improvement in hospital services. We urge the provision of more radiographers and extra physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, and we would like more doctors and nursing staff to be trained locally.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para21">We should invest in areas in which improvements are most likely to result in reduced spending in future. We must think holistically about the impact of ill health on our society; that includes the costs of long-term care, benefits and absence from work. There are insufficient residential, domiciliary and nursing home places and, of those that exist, a large proportion are nursing home places, which are the most expensive. At any one time in the Province, there are 400 individuals blocking beds in Northern Ireland hospitals because the resources do not exist in the community to support them. That contributes to access difficulties at the opposite end of the hospital admission cycle. A concerted effort must be made to remove that persistent brake on the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para22">We have to plan for our ageing population. People are living longer now, which means a growing demand for health care among the elderly. More patients require treatment for conditions such as fractured hips, dementia and strokes. Our health service has been consistently overstretched for a number of years. That cannot continue indefinitely without repercussions. Rapid patient turnover contributes to rising levels of health care-acquired infections such as MRSA. Patients, including the infirm or disabled, and particularly their relatives, are fearful of their even going 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 423WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
into hospital in case they come out in a worse condition than when they went in. That is totally unacceptable in today&#039;s age.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para23">Aside from the threat to life, those acquired infections have massive resource implications for the health service. The Government must clearly address that issue rapidly. The capacity levels at which our hospitals consistently operate also raise questions about how we could cope if there was a major outbreak of influenza or an unpredicted pandemic. We must ensure that we have and maintain a sufficient stockpile of antiviral drugs for such an eventuality. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what level of preparedness exists in Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para24">I have previously expressed concerns regarding the contracting out of cleaning services at local hospitals. There must be appropriate regulation centrally of standards of cleanliness in each trust.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para25">Individuals should be encouraged to adopt greater personal responsibility for healthy living, particularly in relation to diet and exercise. There still needs to be greater awareness of the danger and effects of binge drinking, smoking and illicit drug use. I strongly support a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places, which should be introduced with immediate effect. Another issue that concerns the general public is the difficulty patients and their relatives have in accessing details about their condition or treatment. Those on waiting lists should be provided with the best possible indication of when they are likely to be called for treatment. Uncertainly only exacerbates their ill health. Greater health service transparency would be welcomed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para26">Conditions such as diabetes are rapidly becoming more common. Many such illnesses do not attract media headlines, but lead to lifelong suffering for those affected. The long-term costs are very high when people with those conditions deteriorate. I contend that early and best treatment is not only best for the patient but for our economy. Equally, new anti-TNF medications have the potential to transform the lives of the most severe sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis. Such patients could return to or remain in work if more of those drugs were funded. Let us ensure that that medication is distributed where needed, rather than on a postcode basis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para27">Mental health and learning disabilities have traditionally been underfunded. The child and adolescent psychiatry service in the Province requires major improvement, particularly given the large number of suicides among young people in Northern Ireland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para28">This Government maintain that, alongside education, health is one of their greatest priorities. The public in Northern Ireland have not seen the improvements over the past four years that they would like to have seen. It is to be hoped that whoever has responsibility for the Province&#039;s health after the election will do everything that they can to ensure that the people of Armagh, Antrim and Ards are treated exactly the same as those anywhere else in England, Scotland or Wales.

raising the issue of health service funds in Northern Ireland. I apologise for not being available to answer her questions in the Committee. I am sure that she understands that I always make a great effort to answer the many questions that she asks, and am happy to do so. I hope that my colleagues were able to deal with her queries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para29">The hon. Lady is right to say that, like other health services, health and personal social services in Northern Ireland has had to cope with the combined effect of increasing demands, increased public expectations and the high cost of new technologies. Given the pressures, the service has responded well to those demands, and I praise the staff. On each visit I have made to every hospital, care home and other institution in the health service, I have had nothing but praise and admiration for the work the staff do, sometimes under pressures that we are doing our best to alleviate but which are not acceptable. I hold the staff in the highest regard for the work that they do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para30">Demand for health and personal social services varies across the UK, but we have to recognise that there are high levels of need in Northern Ireland. To start with, it concerns me that general health is worse across Northern Ireland than it is in England. The morbidity and mortality rates for major disease risks are among the worst in Europe. There is a high level of severe disabilities and I have no doubt that 30 years of conflict&#151;euphemistically called the troubles&#151;has had an impact on people&#039;s mental health. That is sometimes not recognised until it manifests itself in some physical way, but it is a pressure that must be recognised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para31">I am also concerned that injuries from road traffic collisions in Northern Ireland are higher than anywhere else in the whole of the UK, which creates additional pressure on hospital admissions. The way to tackle that is by reducing the number of collisions that take place, reducing the number of people who are killed or seriously injured. The hon. Lady will be aware of the efforts made by the Department of the Environment, and as the Minister responsible for road safety I have made a particular commitment to reduce those numbers. There have been some successes but not enough notice has been taken of the messages we have put forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para32">In all those areas demands will continue to increase. There have been technological developments and medical advances but Northern Ireland will be also be affected by the growth in the elderly population. There is a projected growth of 52 per cent. over the next 20 years compared with 41 per cent. in the UK as a whole.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para33">Having outlined where there are difficulties, which the hon. Lady has done as well, it is right to outline some of the achievements. We should look particularly at the areas of improving health and reducing waiting times. I am always loth to talk just about reducing waiting lists; I do not think that people care much how many other people are on the list. It is a question of how long it takes someone to get the treatment they need.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para34">I want to look at what is being achieved. I am sorry that the hon. Lady said that money has been wasted and that people have seen no response. I dispute that. Although there are enormous pressures, a lot has been achieved and staff work particularly hard to see the results of the investment put in. I can tell her that since 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 425WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1997&#150;98 the volume of hospital inpatient and day case activity has increased by 17.5 per cent. More people are being treated.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para35">Community care packages are particularly relevant when we refer to bed blocking. That is not a phrase I like to use; I think delayed discharge is more appropriate. The person in that bed would probably welcome the opportunity to be moved from hospital and have a proper care package. The phrase &quot;bed blocking&quot; can be detrimental to them. The number of community care packages increased by 36 per cent. between March 1998 and March 2004. The average length of stay in hospital has reduced by 10 per cent., allowing better use of hospital beds, and the throughput per bed in the acute hospital sector has increased by 17 per cent. Again, more people are being treated.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para36">Comparing 1997&#150;98, when we first came into Government, with 2003&#150;04, the day case rate has increased from 25.5 per cent. to 31.3 per cent. That means we have got people through hospital more quickly to allow others to have operations. In relation to general health issues, between 1998 and 2002, life expectancy has increased in Northern Ireland by 1.3 years for males and 0.9 years for females.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para37">The hon. Lady did not mention oral health in her comments, but she has put questions to me on that before, and I know that she has interests in that area. Oral health is still very bad, but it has improved significantly for both adults and children. From 1979 to 1998, the proportion of adults without any natural teeth fell from 33 per cent. to 12 per cent. and other the past&nbsp;20 years, the average number of decayed teeth per 12-year-old child has dropped from 4.8 to 2.7. Looking at the health cost weighted activity index, we see an increase in health output. People are getting generally healthier; we are moving in the right direction.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para38">Among the key reasons have been the financial priority given to the needs of health and personal social services in recent years, as well as the financial stability of boards and trusts, and the ways in which they have operated. The hon. Lady said that she wanted the treatment of Northern Ireland to approach closer to equality with England. As to outcomes, I agree; but I do not think that the hon. Lady would agree about that in relation to financing, because current Treasury figures show that expenditure per head of population is 12 per cent. higher in Northern Ireland than in England.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para39">Health needs remain Northern Ireland&#039;s top priority when resources are allocated across Departments. That is reflected in the increase in spending of nearly 25 per cent. in the past three years, and the planned growth of more than 23 per cent. for the next three years. That planned increase over the next three years can be compared with other Northern Ireland Departments. In health and personal social services, the increase will be 9.5 per cent., 6.8 per cent. and 5.3 per cent., and across other Departments the figures will be 6.6 per cent., 4.9&nbsp;per cent. and 4.3 per cent. The financial uplifts will be &#163;290 million, &#163;230 million and &#163;188 million.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para40">Much of the increased funding will be required to meet the cost of reforming the pay and conditions of practically all staff, under &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, the general medical services contract and the consultants&#039; 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 426WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
contract. Those pay deals are significantly higher than the cost of inflation, because they are intended not only to make the health service more competitive in the job market and properly to reward the staff, who make a tremendous contribution, but to facilitate increased flexibility in working patterns and the redesign of existing jobs. The result is improvements in quantity and quality of work. Our biggest asset, in health and personal social services, is the staff we employ. I make no apologies for the fact that the increases are going to the staff, who are the people who make the difference.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para41">The increases in funding also bring several new developments into play, including the cancer centre that was mentioned, the acquired brain injury unit, the medium secure unit, redevelopments at the Ulster hospital and the Mater advanced wards. There will be additional capacity at Antrim hospital and&#151;I am pleased that the hon. Lady mentioned this point&#151;the regional centre for adolescent psychiatric inpatients. The hon. Lady will know what heavy pressure there has been on that service, and I have, with officials, been considering ways to meet the very heavy demands, and to adopt perhaps broader and more holistic ways of thinking about the pressures on young people, which in some cases lead them to feel that the only way forward is to make an attempt on their life. We want to improve services and think more holistically about the range of services available to young people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para42">Specific resources will also be ring-fenced for a range of specific service developments, including the improvement of foster care, the introduction of improved child protection arrangements, renal, cancer and cardiology services, support for carers, further enhancement for ambulance services, which, we recognise, is needed, and additional medical students; the last point is relevant to the issue of staff that has already been raised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para43">The hon. Lady specified the need for capital investment. I do not know if she is aware of the moneys that are being made available through the Budget statement; however, resources totalling nearly &#163;600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million were made available for capital developments in health, social services and public safety, for the incoming budget period 2005 to 2008. That will continue the major hospital modernisation programme set out in &quot;Developing Better Services&quot;, alongside a range of continuing regional and local developments, including primary and community care, learning disability and residential child care. Further phases of development programmes at the Royal Victoria, Ulster and Altnagelvin sites will continue, and planning and enabling work for new hospital modernisation schemes will be taken forward; that will include the new south-west hospital, redevelopment at Craigavon hospital complex and expansion at Antrim.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para44">On examining the figures and the spending increase I do not find it acceptable that spending that is 12 per cent. higher than spending in England does not give good or better quality outcomes for patients. I do not think that it is enough to say that Northern Ireland experiences greater pressures and that the only answer is to spend more; we are spending more. Clearly something must be done about how we spend the money more wisely. I want every penny to count, in the interest of patients. We need to undertake a critical review of the matter.

<p>
<a name="50405h04_para45">The hon. Lady will be aware of the Appleby report. We have asked Professor Appleby of the King&#039;s Fund to conduct a review of health and social care provision across Northern Ireland. Similar reviews have been carried out in England and in Wales.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para46">The review will consider how the money is spent. It may have other terms of reference, but I am confident that it will highlight the ways in which we can use the money that we have more effectively and, if additional spending is needed, how we can use that most effectively. We need to consider current demand in relation to the funding available and decide whether we are doing the best for patients with the money available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para47">The hon. Lady also mentioned the structures of the health and social services, which sometimes strike me as overly bureaucratic. A point was made about transparency. The staff do the best that they can but the structures hamper them in many ways.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para48">The review of public administration is open for consultation and addresses many of the points that have been made by ensuring that we have a structure that is commensurate with the work that is to be done and that does not overburden staff, officials and others who are trying to provide a better health service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para49">I hope that those two points will address the hon. Lady&#039;s questions and will show that they are being taken very seriously. We have every intention of ensuring as quickly as possible that we have the best possible structures to secure the best possible outcome.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para50">As far as modernisation, reform and efficiency are concerned, we want the same targets for health and social services as we do for other parts of the public sector. The challenge is not simply to spend more but to spend more wisely. What is most important is the outcome for patients. Unless we achieve the necessary outcomes, we are not doing them the service that they need with the money that we have available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para51">The hon. Lady asked about pandemic preparations. I assure her that the Department has done a considerable amount of planning for some time and continues to do so. A supply of antiviral drugs has been obtained and currently amounts to more than 4 million, which is equivalent to the number of antiviral drugs available in the other parts of the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para52">The hon. Lady also mentioned a smoking ban, which is close to my heart. The consultation on that closed on 23 March. As she will appreciate, there has been a considerable amount of interest in the issue and a range 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 428WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
of opinions has been expressed. We are going through all the responses to ascertain the balance, and I will report back in due course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para53">I do, however, urge a word of caution. There is a view in some quarters that a smoking ban solves all health problems caused by smoking. It does not. Even if we had a smoking ban, we would still need to pursue our current strategy; the tobacco action plan. Such a ban is all very well for people who smoke in public places, but many people smoke in their own homes and with children around. Smoking must therefore still be addressed, regardless of any smoking ban.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para54">I can tell the hon. Lady that &#163;400,000 of additional funding is being provided in the 2004&#150;05 Budget for the ambulance service. The same amount will be provided in the following Budget.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para55">Staffing issues are serious and have been a problem for some time. The amount of additional support that is being given through the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; to provide better support, salaries and training for staff does make a difference. I am optimistic that that addresses the problem, although I do not underestimate the size of the problem. Work has been done through the &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; to address the sorts of problems to which hon. Members referred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para56">More places are also being provided for medical students. Some 81 places have been created at Queen&#039;s medical school this autumn, which is a 50 per cent. increase in the number of medical students in only two years. The hon. Lady also mentioned specialist drugs, and I assure her that additional funding is being found to try to address the increasing needs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h04_para57">I hope that our discussion of a range of issues has shown that much planning has been done to ensure that we meet the demands of the health service in the 21st century, and that we are doing our very best within the Budget to meet the increasing demands that have been placed on us. We must decide whether we are spending our money wisely enough, whether we can do more and whether we can do some things better. All those questions are constantly under review to give us the best possible health service.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : We now move to the last debate, which was initiated by the hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston). I hope that I may be permitted from the Chair to wish him well when he leaves the House at this election. He has served the House well for three years as Solicitor-General, and we honour and respect his decision to leave.

<a name="50405h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Whistleblowing</h3>


<a name="50405h05_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h05_spnew0"><b> Ross Cranston  (Dudley, North)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful for your kind remarks.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para0">First, I declare my interest as a former trustee and chairman of the whistleblowing charity Public Concern at Work. Secondly, I apologise to my hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office for dragging him here this afternoon. I know that he has many other important and pressing matters on his plate, but I hope to make it clear that this issue is important and affects matters for which my hon. Friend has responsibility and in which he has taken a close interest both before and since he entered the House, particularly the need to regenerate civil society.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para1">This issue demands and deserves to be revisited at this time. I particularly want to raise the question of where it best sits in the machinery of Government. I am pleased that the Government have done a great deal to advance whistleblowing, particularly by supporting the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, to which I shall return, and by advancing the interest in Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para2">It may help if I briefly explain the background to the Act. The idea of legislation on whistleblowing was first raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright), who is beside me, in 1995. A private Member&#039;s Bill was introduced the following year by my hon. Friend who is now the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. Unfortunately, the Bill did not reach the statute book because it was opposed by the then Government. However, its practical approach secured the support not only of business and other key interests outside the House, but of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in an important speech that he made in 1996.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para3">The Act was introduced as a private Member&#039;s Bill shortly after the 1997 election by the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd), who is here today. He was a strong and long supporter of the measure, and it was his fortitude that got it on to the statute book; I pay tribute to him for that. With the support of the Government and the formidable help of the Minister without Portfolio, my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), who was then a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, the Act was one of the first measures to be enacted by the Labour Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para4">I set out that sequence of events because it explains several things. First, it shows that the Act neither emanated from nor passed through the ordinary machinery of Government as a Government Bill would. Of course, it remains central and at the cutting edge of the developing relationship between Government, business and civil society, and I believe that the interface between those different conceptual interests is especially important to much of what the Government are doing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para5">Where the Act has been promoted and understood as a cultural measure, it has been a success, and it retains the support of all key interests. Abroad, it has become an international benchmark and Public Concern at Work has assisted Governments in countries as diverse as Japan, the Netherlands and South Africa in adopting 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 430WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and implementing the same legislative approach to accountability and the public interest. In fact, my hon. Friend the Minister will be interested to know that, in Japan, the Cabinet Office is responsible for almost identical legislation, because it is seen primarily as impacting on quality of life.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para6">In this country, because of the history that I have outlined, the 1998 Act is part of employment legislation. Therefore, responsibility for it in the Government falls on the individual rights section of the employment relations unit in the Department of Trade and Industry. The result is that the Department with responsibility for the legislation cannot readily view it as a governance or cultural measure, which I have argued is the right way to see whistleblowing. The promoters of the 1998 Act certainly saw it as an employment rights measure, but they regarded it primarily as one dealing with of governance and institutional culture.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para7">Inasmuch as the 1998 Act is a cultural or governance measure, the promotional task is undertaken not so much by the Government, who see whistleblowing as an employment rights issue, but by the charity Public Concern at Work. The charity&#039;s work has enjoyed the support of leading companies, regulators, trade unions and various Departments, particularly the Department of Health. The charity has unrivalled experience of providing people unsure whether and how to raise concerns about wrongdoing with free advice. It has also helped organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors to reap the benefits of a whistleblowing culture. I pay tribute to the charity&#039;s dynamic director, Guy Dehn.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para8">I am grateful that the Minister is responding to this debate, because it is becoming apparent, I hope, that he is particularly well placed&#151;through his position in the Cabinet Office and the more important positions that I am sure he will assume after the election&#151;to ensure that the notion of whistleblowing as a feature of governance and institutional culture will become an important part of Government policy. I do not want to overstate the case, but the Government can help and guide people when they confront a whistleblowing dilemma in their personal life or their employment. If people are concerned about fraud, wrongdoing or health and safety abuse, they need guidance. The Government need to provide that to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para9">On the wider significance of whistleblowing, I can do no better than quote from Dame Janet Smith&#039;s recent report into the murders by Dr. Harold Shipman. Dame Janet concluded with a crucial point:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I believe that the willingness of one healthcare professional to take responsibility for raising concerns about the conduct, performance or health of another could make a greater potential contribution to patient safety than any other single factor.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para10">Whistleblowing is about empowerment, as she makes clear when she summarises the value and dilemma that is poses:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The raising of genuinely held concerns about issues of public importance is to be encouraged. The public interest may be served in many different ways, such as by the prevention or detection of crime, by the prevention of accidents or by the protection of the public purse.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para11">Barriers to whistleblowing include


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the fear of being seen as a troublemaker or &#039;maverick&#039;, the fear of recriminations and a feeling of impotence grounded in the belief that, even if the report is made, nothing will be done about it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 431WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para12">To help to address that dilemma in the health service, Dame Janet recommends greater awareness among both the health service work force and the general public of the role that whistleblowing can play. She also recommends the increased availability of confidential guidance to those who are faced with a whistleblowing dilemma.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para13">One simple but important way in which the Government can foster an empowering culture is to accept the recommendations set out in the recent report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In an authoritative review of how whistleblowing is working, the Committee emphasises that an organisational culture that encourages the raising of concerns about wrongdoing is one where the principles of public life can far more readily take route. That, it says, is because the contribution that whistleblowing can make to an organisation&#039;s internal culture is as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;an instrument of good governance and a manifestation of a more open culture.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para14">As we all know, that in turn informs trust in government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para15">The Committee&#039;s report &quot;emphatically endorsed&quot; the approach of Public Concern at Work and recommended that the leaders of public bodies commit their organisations to several key elements of good practice. Those include ensuring that staff are aware of and trust the whistleblowing avenues; providing realistic advice on what that process means for openness, confidentiality and anonymity; continually reviewing how the procedures work; and regularly communicating to staff the avenues open to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para16">The recommendations are practical and sound, and they commend themselves because they will help ensure that when people face the whistleblowing dilemma they have the necessary guidance. I would be delighted to hear from my hon. Friend that the Government endorse the Committee&#039;s recommendations. I hope that he will have no difficulty in endorsing the practical approach that the Committee takes towards the role that whistleblowing can and should play in not only promoting good governance but empowering people with the confidence to inform, influence and involve themselves in events close to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para17">A second recommendation that the Committee has made on whistleblowing also impacts on the work of the Cabinet Office, although it is about that part that informs and improves the role of regulation. The Committee recommends:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;All regulators should review their procedures for handling whistleblowing by individuals and bodies under their jurisdiction, drawing upon good practice.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para18">That meshes well with the recommendations made to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in the Hampton review about refreshing&#151;if I may use the jargon&#151;regulatory cultures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para19">Today I raise the policy issues that impact on and will greatly benefit from a greater understanding of whistleblowing. The issue raised by Dame Janet relates specifically to health; another raised by the Hampton review relates to regulatory cultures; and possibly the most important issue is relates to standards across public life. Conceptually speaking, whistleblowing is a fine example of civil society working successfully with business and government. My concern is that the issue 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 432WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is not best placed in the machinery of government while it remains in the employment rights unit at the Department of Trade and Industry. That is no criticism whatever of the DTI, but of necessity. Due to whistleblowing being placed there, it is considered to be an issue of individual employment rights.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para20">The Committee rightly concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The statutory framework in the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 is a helpful driver but must be recognised as a &#039;backstop&#039; which can provide redress when things go wrong, not as a substitute for cultures that actively encourage challenge of inappropriate behaviour&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para21">The Shipman report recommends that the Act be amended, and I hope that, in that context, the more general issues that I have raised about the future of whistleblowing will be addressed.
</p>






<p><a name="50405h05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : I should advise the Chamber that two Members&#151;the hon. Members for Aldridge-Brownhills and for Cannock Chase&#151;have sought the permission of the initiator of the debate, the Minister and the Chair to participate briefly.

</p>




<a name="50405h05_time1"><h5>4.15 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h05_spnew2"><b> Mr. Richard Shepherd  (Aldridge-Brownhills)</b>  (Con): In the few minutes that I have, I would like to add my sentiments to those expressed by you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is a great privilege and honour to follow the hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston). His honesty, candour and sheer decency as a fellow representative of the west midlands will be sorely missed by members of all parties and of no parties in our region. His work on this subject has been of enormous importance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para22">I am not certain what the hon. and learned Gentleman meant when he spoke about the important position of the Minister after the election; I do not know whether it is an indication that he is retiring and seeking pastures new or whether, if my party is right, he is taking up a Front-Bench position in the Opposition.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para23">Perhaps the greatest whistleblower that I have had the privilege to meet and know is the Japanese ambassador to Britain. He was a senior official in the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and he blew the whistle on his Foreign Minister. She was the daughter of a former Japanese Prime Minister and an enormously popular figure in Japan. The culture in Japan&#151;a culture that prevails in much of the world&#151;was that anyone who cites a wrong or brings it into the open is risking their job, and in the way of these things, he ended up in London in a distinguished post for a think-tank. However, the world rights itself sometimes, and, as I said, he is now Japan&#039;s ambassador to the United Kingdom.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para24">The case that by his actions the now ambassador raised was important. Japanese public opinion came to understand that there was a deep wrong&#151;a malaise in the Foreign Ministry that many thought was part of the signature of Japanese culture. His act&#151;painful and difficult for him at the time, but by his honour necessary&#151;helped change a climate of opinion in a Japan that wanted to modernise. I would like to think that senior officials in Government would occasionally speak up here, but that takes me beyond the brief.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para25">What is important is the recognition of good governance and of the fact that there is a public interest in a wider circle of people understanding the ethical 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 433WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
basis on which Government, the administration of great companies and the actions in little businesses all helps to elevate the standard of and belief in propriety across the nation. That is why people such as the hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North and my colleague and neighbour the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright) have laboured long to bring about the legislation. It is a merit that the Government supported the measure and introduced it, allied with the other great measure that complements and reinforces it: freedom of information. I hate the word &quot;empowerment&quot;, but those measures lift a society. We are equal citizens, and we believe in an ethical and just society. That is the principle behind the work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para26">In the natural British way, we look to institutions. We have the distinguished work, to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred, of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The recommendations are clear and worth while.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para27">Part of the difficulty that I have encountered over recent years is the tenacity with which the Department of Trade and Industry views the measure as merely an employment measure. That is limiting and gives rise to suspicions in people&#039;s minds. The principle behind the Act, which, as I said, was supported by the Government, was to raise a standard, not to be a backstop for compensation for a wrong. People that have suffered a wrong must be entitled to some form of compensation, but we have moved on to different ground and, therefore, I want to reinforce the structural point that the hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North made. As in Japan, the matter should be right at the heart of Government. The responsibility would sit better with the Cabinet Office than the DTI.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para28">If we are going to tackle these areas of difficulty in public and private life&#151;private individuals are affected as well&#151;and the echoes of the Shipman report, I would like the Minister to endorse the proposals and recommendations of the Committee on Standards in Public Life and argue within Government that this is the instrument by which they can affect the purposes behind the Act.

</p>




<a name="50405h05_time2"><h5>4.21 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h05_spnew3"><b> Tony Wright  (Cannock Chase)</b>  (Lab): I rise briefly to do two things. First, I join the tributes to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston), who is my office neighbour. The House will be hugely deprived of his expertise. I have been inspecting his rubbish in the corridor, and this morning among the things that he was throwing out I came across a huge volume entitled &quot;The Legislative Enactments of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka&quot;. Not many people, when they clean out their office, can dispose of volumes of that quality and character. He will be hugely missed, and I shall miss him as an office companion. It is entirely appropriate that he should have secured this debate on whistleblowing for what may be his swansong in the House.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para29">Secondly, those of us who played a role in the genesis of the whistleblowing legislation never saw it as a narrow employment rights measure; we always saw it as a measure that would transform the governance of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 434WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
public and private organisations. In so far as it has been narrowed into an employment measure, that is understandable but regrettable. However, report after report now states that we must think more widely about whistleblowing. The Shipman report is only the latest report to say how crucial the role of whistleblowing is in the good ordering of organisations. The Government will always take huge credit for having ensured that the measure came on to the statute book. After the election, I hope that they will revisit the measure and think about how to carry it forward so that it can genuinely become the basis for a cultural revolution.

</p>




<a name="50405h05_time3"><h5>4.24 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50405h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Cabinet Office  (Mr. David Miliband) </b> : It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Tony Wright). As he began to talk about a cultural revolution, it might be time to revive some old Maoist songs, but this is probably not the occasion to do so. I feel like a pygmy in the presence of three giants of good government and legislative reform. They should all have the thanks of not only the whole House, but the whole country for the work that they have done together and separately.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para30">I add my sorrow at the departure of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston) but also my gratitude for the enormous contribution that he has made in his eight years in the House. As you pointed out, Mr. Deputy Speaker, he served as Solicitor-General and made a signal contribution, especially in respect of youth justice, in which he took a particular interest. He has also been on the Standards and Privileges Committee. Fortunately, I have never had to appear before him, but I am sure that he performed that role with distinction.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para31">It is important to put on the record that as a Minister and as a Back Bencher, my hon. and learned Friend worked hard to secure better compensation for vaccine-damaged children, an issue to which he has devoted enormous energy. Whether it be academia, the world of finance or the world of the law, their gain is our loss. I am sure that we have not heard the last of him.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para32">I want to make a few points in the short time available to me. I am glad that the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) linked the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, on which we are focusing today, and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. He is right that they go together. I share the view held by my hon. and learned Friend that the passage on to the statute book of the Act in 1998 with wide support put whistleblowing on a new footing. The background to the Act has been sufficiently dwelt on, and I will not stick with it. However, it is significant that American campaigners should have described it as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the most far-reaching whistleblower law in the world&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para33">That is important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para34">As world leaders, we have no room for complacency. The legislation covers the private and public sectors and encourages employers and employees to co-operate in dealing with problems. It is a matter of good governance and good government. All three hon. Members raised the issue of the relationship between the Cabinet Office and the DTI. I hope that I will do not disappoint them unduly if I say that I am not going to announce machinery of government changes now. However, I do 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 435WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
want to address head on their central point in calling for such changes, which is that whistleblowing is not a matter of employment law but one of culture. The Government agree. The need to build organisational cultures is a responsibility of central Government, as well as individual Departments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para35">In such a context, we should welcome the fact that there is agitation from outside this House, notably from Public Concern at Work. I applaud the work that has been done in civil society. Public Concern at Work has worked on the issue for many years and deserves credit for what has happened. However, the machinery is less important than the commitment. I have been impressed in my short time in the Cabinet Office to have discovered just how much the Cabinet Office is doing to promulgate a culture in the civil service that we would all support. The core values of the civil service are not merely set out, but there are procedures for individual civil servants to raise concerns. That sets the broader context for the conduct of civil servants.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405h05_para36">It may be of interest to all three hon. Members to know that nominated officers have been identified in each Department, who act in that capacity in addition to their normal duties. They are directly responsible to the permanent secretary and are there to advise individual members of staff on the interpretation of the civil service code, on how to resolve a concern related to the code, on how such a concern can be taken forward through departmental procedures and, if requested, to pass concerns on to the appropriate point in the Department if they are satisfied that the matter falls within the scope 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>5 Apr 2005 : Column 436WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
of the code. The work is proactive and it betokens the significance of the cultural changes that my hon. and learned Friend is talking about.

<a name="50405h05_para37">My hon. and learned Friend also mentioned the health service. The NHS has been working with Public Concern at Work to promulgate the whistleblowing guidance first issued in September 1999, stating that every NHS trust and health authority should have in place policies and procedures that comply with the 1998 Act. A policy pack was issued to all NHS employees&#151;all 1.3 million of them&#151;in July 2003, specifically tailored to the needs of individual GPs and their staff, as well as hospital staff.

<a name="50405h05_para38">With respect to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, I am happy to agree that its report is thoughtful, serious, and common-sensical&#151;practical, I think the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills said&#151;but the extent of my enthusiasm for the recommendations cannot yet go so far as announcing the Government&#039;s conclusions on the reports. That is a matter for cross-departmental work, which is ongoing. However, we recognise the importance of the recommendations and are committed to taking them seriously. We will report back to the whole House as soon as possible.

<a name="50405h05_para39">On that note, I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the tenth or eleventh time in this Parliament for overseeing business with which I have been involved. I&nbsp;conclude by thanking my hon. and learned Friend again for raising the issue.
