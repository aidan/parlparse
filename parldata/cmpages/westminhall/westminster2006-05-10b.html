Karen Buck (Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North)
(Lab):</b> May I say how much I welcome the opportunity to debate
social housing? The subject is highly topical, although not for reasons
that we would support, but we none the less need to take advantage of
that
topicality.</p><p><a name="06051065000011">I
welcome the fact that the Minister is still in place, as she has been
extremely supportive and courteous in working with me on the problems
of overcrowding, which I shall refer to later. She has visited my
constituency and met a number of families who live in wholly
unacceptable conditions, which is the thrust of the
debate.</p><p><a name="06051065000012">Social housing
gets a bad press that is not shared by any other public
service&#151;so negative is its image that &#147;Little
Britain&#148; and Catherine Tate have created an industry out of it.
Although it has been mocked and ignored, and more recently treated as
if it were in some way a cause of poverty and social exclusion rather
than a central line of defence against them, nothing less than a
catastrophe has been allowed to
unfold.</p><p><a name="06051065000013">It is
necessary briefly to say that none of those factors can be used in
defence of the housing disasters of the past&#151;the great but badly
designed monolithic estates, the paternalistic and sometimes
poor-quality housing management, and the concentration of families with
complex needs in single-tenure neighbourhoods. Serious mistakes have
been made over the years, and they have given cover to those who were
allowed to dismantle so much that was good over the past quarter
century.</p><p><a name="06051065000014"><b><a name="06051065000504">Mr.
Andrew Dismore (Hendon) (Lab):</b> I am listening to my hon.
Friend closely and must say that there is always the risk of throwing
the baby out with the bath water. We have three big regeneration
schemes in my constituency&#151;West Hendon; Spur Road, Edgware; and
Grahame Park, Colindale. The net consequence of significantly
increasing density, which will have a great impact on local services
and communities, is a net loss of affordable homes. The London borough
of Barnet, which is responsible for those schemes, is missing a trick.
We have to do something about the chronic shortage of housing and the
overcrowding in our area, but those schemes do nothing to ease the
problems.</p><p><a name="06051065000015"><b><a name="06051065000505">Ms
Buck:</b> I totally endorse what my hon. Friend says. I fear
that Barnet is doing no favours to its own people, and it is also
failing to make a wider contribution.</p><p><a name="06051065000016">I am saying to the Government
that the opportunity afforded by the Chancellor&#146;s stated
interest in the case for social housing to be included in next
year&#146;s 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 76WH</b><br></br>spending review is almost a last chance to put right the failures of the
past. It was comforting to hear the new Secretary of State in this
Department emphasise the importance of social housing. I hope that
people&#146;s ears are open to the case that needs to be
made.</p><p><a name="06051065000017">Many good things
have been done by the Government on housing since 1997, of which the
decent homes initiative is the most important. Thousands of my
constituents have benefited from the major improvements and renovations
that have taken place under that programme, which are much to be
welcomed. However, the overall failure to address the problem of
housing supply, most especially but not entirely in London and the
south-east, has not only caused untold misery for those families
rendered homeless or trapped in chronically overcrowded accommodation,
but has been a false economy to the public purse. It has shifted much
of the cost, such as for temporary accommodation, on to housing
benefit; contributed to the destabilising of communities; and,
sadly&#151;this is why the debate is so relevant&#151;stoked the
racism that is a consequence of the competition for scarce resources in
an ethically mixed and fast-changing city.</p><p><a name="06051065000018">As the director of Shelter
rightly said yesterday, the shortage affordable homes has led to a
&#147;blame culture&#148; in which people turn on each other in
their frustration and despair. Although the consequences might have
been seen most graphically in Barking and Dagenham, we should be under
no illusion that such sentiments are confined to one
area.</p><p><a name="06051065000019"><b><a name="06051065000506">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Of those
Labour Members present today, several represent metropolitan
constituencies and one is a distinguished former council leader; I am a
provincial among them. The pressures in London are obviously
particularly great. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government,
despite their pretty sound record generally, must avoid what the
National Housing Federation has called a &#147;pile &#146;em high,
sell &#146;em cheap&#148; policy in responding to those problems?
They must balance quantity and quality in responding to people&#146;s
needs and aspirations as regards the environment and new
housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000020"><b><a name="06051065000507">Ms
Buck:</b> Again, I agree with my hon. Friend, and I shall set
those points out from my own
perspective.</p><p><a name="06051065000021">Ironically,
the choice-based lettings system, which is increasingly used to supply
housing, and which I wholly support in principle, is making the
intensity of the competition that I have described toxically
transparent. For example, a rare three-bed property in my constituency
was advertised through the choice-based lettings system two weeks ago
and it attracted 244 bidders from the already heavily filtered
top-priority category A list alone. Given that only six three-bedroom
properties have been advertised in the current financial year, most
desperate people, even on that list, face an almost endless round of
unsuccessful bidding, which is an injection of pure poison into already
deprived neighbourhoods.</p><p><a name="06051065000022">On the shortfall in supply,
targets for tackling rough sleeping and for cutting the number of
households in temporary accommodation, both of which are entirely 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 77WH</b><br></br>admirable by their own lights, simply squeeze the balloon that is
housing need&#151;reducing need in one place, only to see it to pop
up elsewhere in the
system.</p><p><a name="06051065000023">Before I
summarise the priorities for action, let me sketch out some challenges.
I shall make specific reference to London. The number of social housing
lettings has been falling for a decade, and the number of vacancies has
fallen because fewer people can afford to buy. In London, the ratio of
lower-quartile house prices to lower-quartile earnings has more than
doubled, compared with a 50 per cent. increase in the country as a
whole. The right to buy is having a continuing impact, reducing the
pool of lettings by about 12,500 a year, while the number of
completions is substantially down across the country, although I
recognise that it is up in London by about
2,000.</p><p><a name="06051065000024"><b><a name="06051065000508">Lembit
&#214;pik (Montgomeryshire) (LD):</b> I congratulate the
hon. Lady on securing the debate. Is she aware that the problems for
inner-city areas that she is describing also affect rural areas such as
Montgomeryshire? For example, house prices in my constituency have
increased by 157 per cent. in just six years, while the average
household earns just &#163;23,000 a year. Does she agree that the
problems and the solutions, which I hope she will outline, are very
much the same for rural areas? Such areas need to close the gap between
the housing that families require and the housing they can
afford.</p><p><a name="06051065000025"><b><a name="06051065000509">Ms
Buck:</b> I certainly take the point that rural areas face a
serious challenge on housing need. Although London is at the sharp end
of the problem, the pressure is distributed across the country, which
is illustrated by the fact that, since 1997, the number of people
seeking social housing has increased by about half across the country,
but by 77 per cent. in
London.</p><p><a name="06051065000026">The 2004
spending review was projected to deliver an extra 10,000 new social
homes annually by next year, but that was substantially below what the
Kate Barker report recommended, and it is less than half of what we
need. Despite the Mayor of London&#146;s welcome commitment to meet
housing need, there will be a continuing shortfall in the years to
come. The Greater London authority housing requirement study estimated
that 10,700 larger affordable homes&#151;those are at the heart of
the problem in my area&#151;were needed every year, but the supply is
unbelievably low, at 500.</p><p><a name="06051065000027"><b><a name="06051065000510">Mr.
Andrew Love (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I agree with my hon.
Friend about the commitment to reach the target of 10,000 new homes a
year, but in London, as she has outlined, we will not reach anything
like our target at current rates, given the need for larger
accommodation and the level of construction
inflation.</p><p><a name="06051065000028"><b><a name="06051065000511">Ms
Buck:</b> Sadly, I agree with my hon. Friend, which is why I
welcome this chance to make the case in relation to the next spending
review. The need is urgent, and provision is lagging well behind
need.</p><p><a name="06051065000029">The Housing
Corporation recently made a welcome contribution to recognising the
need for family 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 78WH</b><br></br>accommodation by upping its share of the social housing allocation for
family homes from 27 to 34 per cent., but that is still way below what
is needed to meet new demand in the system and to make inroads into the
backlog.</p><p><a name="06051065000030"><b><a name="06051065000512">Ms
Sally Keeble (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> Does my hon.
Friend agree that it is particularly important to consider what the
Housing Corporation says, because it provides social housing? For many
families, affordable housing is no longer affordable, and there is a
real need not only for affordable housing, but for social housing for
many of those
families.</p><p><a name="06051065000031"><b><a name="06051065000513">Ms
Buck:</b> I agree. Social housing is at the heart of my case,
although affordable housing to buy is also priced out of the reach of
families who in other circumstances might be able to afford to go into
the private market.</p><p><a name="06051065000032">As
a consequence of the devastating shortfall in supply, particularly of
family-sized accommodation, severe overcrowding rose by almost half in
London between the 1991 and 2001 censuses. More than half of all
severely overcrowded households in the country are in London, and the
social sector has for the first time overtaken private rented as the
most severely affected. The fact that 500,000 London children live in
severely overcrowded homes makes me
ashamed.</p><p><a name="06051065000033"><b><a name="06051065000514">Ms
Keeble:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for being generous
in giving way. Does she agree that there is a real problem in that
figures from the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister clearly
show that overcrowding is greatest in areas where there are large
numbers of black and minority ethnic communities, especially Asian
communities? That is particularly the case in
Newham.</p><p><a name="06051065000034"><b><a name="06051065000515">Ms
Buck:</b> That is right. In fact, my next point is that,
despite the pernicious lies of the British National party and the
perhaps more understandable willingness of desperate, badly housed
families to believe its propaganda, it is black, ethnic minority and
Muslim families who are over-represented in the severe overcrowding and
homelessness figures, and indeed across the board in terms of housing
need, so in a way we have the worst of all possible
worlds.</p><p><a name="06051065000035">I have made
the point about overall supply and, in particular, the supply of
family-sized accommodation, but it is also important to say that the
supply must be balanced out across London as a whole. That is my area
of concern; others will make the case for the country as a whole. The
geographical distribution, even of the increased provision in London,
does not meet all needs. In fact, there is a danger that it is about to
make the situation worse. Despite the fact that Westminster city
council&#151;Westminster is one of my two boroughs&#151;has to deal
with what is, unbelievably, the third highest overcrowding level in the
local authority rented sector, we are unable to obtain adequate direct
investment or to access properties through sub-regional
allocations.</p><p><a name="06051065000036">I am told
that housing opportunities in cheaper partner boroughs to my expensive
inner-London ones will help to soak up the slack, yet even though I
have 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 79WH</b><br></br>just put forward two desperately needy families who want to move to
Barnet, where they have family ties&#151;Barnet is a borough in the
sub-regional partnership&#151;I am told by Westminster that no
three-bedroom properties will be available in the sub-regional partner
boroughs of Barnet and Enfield this year. Overall, Westminster and its
sub-regional partners can expect only 90 properties to be made
available to meet the needs of more than 3,000 people on the waiting
list
alone.</p><p><a name="06051065000037"><b><a name="06051065000516">Mr.
Dismore:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning
Barnet, which is my borough. The problem is that Peter is trying to rob
Paul. In my constituency, there is a desperate shortage of the housing
that we are discussing, so frankly I am not surprised that Westminster
received the response that it did, because there is no housing for our
own people. Such properties simply do not exist in
Barnet.</p><p><a name="06051065000038">One of my main
concerns is that, although there is housing investment in parts of
London, other parts of London&#151;where there is a chronic housing
shortage, where people want to live, where jobs are available, where
there are transport links and where, as a consequence, land prices are
slightly higher&#151;are being starved of investment. That is a
completely false economic argument. We must invest where the jobs and
transport links are and where people want to live, not where those
things do not
exist.</p><p><a name="06051065000039"><b><a name="06051065000517">Ms
Buck:</b> That is right. I can understand the logic of saying
that we will not invest substantially in building social housing in the
middle of Knightsbridge&#151;that would be wholly sub-optimal in
development terms&#151;but it is critical that we provide social and
affordable housing opportunities across London and that they are not
concentrated purely in poorer areas. That is because, among other
things, we are trying to get away from lower-income households being
concentrated in lower-income neighbourhoods. Let me give two
illustrations from my area, and I shall conclude by running through
some of my priorities for
action.</p><p><a name="06051065000040">Mrs. M sent me
a letter:</p><a name="06051065000458"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
are a family of five. We have been living in two single bedrooms since
1993. The boy is fifteen, the girl is nine and the little one 3,
living, playing, studying and doing homework in the same room of 2.5
metres by 3 metres. The boy has learning difficulties, the mum has
rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes... you cannot imagine how
difficult it is to live with 3 kids in the same
room.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000041">The
father and husband of a second family
wrote:</p><a name="06051065000042"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As you
will recall, our family of six&#151;myself, my wife, two daughters
and two sons&#151;have been living in a flat with two single bedrooms
since 2001. Both my wife&#146;s health and my own have deteriorated
as a result of living here and my children, the oldest of whom is 14,
should no longer be sharing a bedroom. Unfortunately, our landlord is
indifferent to our situation... in their waiting lists we are
placed in Category B along with 66 other people, and, as such, we can
expect to wait for 12
years&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000043">that is,
12 years during which six people share two small bedrooms.</p><p><a name="06051065000044">Remember, that family are not
even in category A. The transfer list for that social landlord in my
borough says that the longest category A priority wait for a
two-bedroomed flat is nine years; the longest category B wait is 16
years. Those are not my worst cases, which 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 80WH</b><br></br>involve families of five in a single bedroom. However, at least those
cases are defined as statutory
overcrowding.</p><p><a name="06051065000045">I come
to my final example. Mrs. A and her husband are sharing a small two-bed
with their three teenage children. Mrs. A&#146;s landlord, the
Peabody Trust, told me last
summer:</p><a name="06051065000459"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;She
has been on the Trust&#146;s transfer list since March 1997... she is
waiting for a 3 bed property and her case receives priority because of
her medical circumstances and overcrowding. Unfortunately, last year,
the Trust only let one 3 bed property
in&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000046">the whole borough.
The Peabody Trust
continued:</p><p><a name="06051065000047">&#147;Mrs.
A refers to an empty 3 bed on the Dalgarno estate which needs work
doing to it... The Trust has to make some difficult decisions when
dealing with such properties and in this case, the property will be
sold&#148;.</p><p><a name="06051065000048">Of course, the
Peabody Trust is hugely engaged in selling property. Sales are also
made by Genesis and a number of other registered social landlords in my
constituency.</p><p><a name="06051065000049">What is
the solution? I do not often echo Ronald Reagan, but I shall in this
instance: the solution is not easy, but it is simple. The issue is
supply, supply, supply. We have to increase the supply of socially
rented homes, especially those suitable for families, although
genuinely affordable shared ownership options and greater availability
of smaller units can also relieve pressures on families by offering
opportunities to adult children. In the 2007 comprehensive spending
review, we need to commit to meeting the Barker target as a
minimum.</p><p><a name="06051065000050">The 2007
comprehensive spending review might give us more money to build, but we
can also buy on the open market. That is my preferred emergency
response to the crisis. We can support investment in conversions and
extensions, such as loft conversions, of existing properties. One
reason why that is hard to do is that many London boroughs, including
my own, have taken a relative reduction in housing revenue accounts. On
current trends, Westminster&#146;s housing revenue account will go
into deficit in 2010. We need more assistance to enable such programmes
to be carried out by the local authorities, the arm&#146;s length
management organisations and us.</p><p><a name="06051065000051">We have to stop the sale of
housing association properties, especially the desirable street
properties, on the open market. We have to ensure that we do not
promote home ownership at the expense of those in desperate need of
affordable rented accommodation. Too much extra investment in recent
years has gone on promoting ownership rather than on tackling
need.</p><p><a name="06051065000052">We must not only
make the concept of mixed communities a reality, but ensure that, as we
rightly mix tenure in what are currently concentrations of social
housing, we simultaneously mix social housing into areas that are
overwhelmingly owner-occupied. To echo the points made by a number of
my hon. Friends, we need social housing growth
everywhere.</p><p><a name="06051065000053">We must
invest more in tools that will help us to identify under-occupation,
promote the cash incentive scheme and make mutual exchange work
effectively. That will help us to make better use of existing housing
stock. We have been extremely complacent about the effectiveness of
such programmes. They can help, but are not sufficient and will not
solve the problem on 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 81WH</b><br></br>their own. They need proper incentives to match those offered by the
right to buy and they need to case manage individuals through the
system to encourage them to downsize and
exchange.</p><p><a name="06051065000054">An estimated
160,000 households living in the social sector could buy in the
intermediate market if that sector were providing family-sized
accommodation. Intermediate housing tends to concentrate on one and two
bedrooms, which is not what families need. The sector could provide
this, and it should.</p><p><a name="06051065000055">I plead with my hon. Friend the
Minister that we must not load the burden on to rents, as London
already has the highest rates of child poverty in the country and
research clearly shows that higher rents are a factor in work
disincentives and poverty. Rising rents in London have already
contributed almost&#163;90 million back to the Treasury,
which is grossly unfair given the pressures London tenants are
under.</p><p><a name="06051065000056">We should
expand the pilot for turning temporary accommodation into permanent,
which would be good value for money and hugely important for unsettled
families. The &#163;20 million scheme that is in place is a drop in
the ocean. Also, let us find alternatives to the property market as a
means to develop assets for those who cannot realistically afford to
buy.</p><p><a name="06051065000057">Finally, I wish
to say something on council leaseholders. Hundreds of relatively
low-income council leaseholders in my area, such as on the Warwick,
Amberley, Church Street and Lisson Green estates, face major works
bills, which can be as high as &#163;68,000 and which in some cases
are substantially more than the purchase price of their
property.</p><p><a name="06051065000058">Home
ownership has turned out to have an enormous sting in the tail for many
such families, and while right-to-buy discounts and rising property
prices have to be seen as part of the context, the reality is that the
bills are arriving now and many lessees are devastated by them. There
is a further shift towards sub-letting, as families decide that the
&#163;425 a week that they could make in housing benefit for renting
their properties to homeless families might help to get them off the
financial hook, but that does not make sense for the public purse or
the wider
community.</p><p><a name="06051065000059">It is
essential that the Government find ways to support initiatives to help
the lower-income households now getting caught in this trap and that
they recognise that there are costs involved, such as in the form of
funding cost caps, interest-free loans, deferred payments, tax breaks
on savings schemes for major works, or in some cases funds for buy
back.</p><p><a name="06051065000060">I apologise for
my speech taking so long, although I hope that Members recognise that I
have taken a number of interventions. I conclude by saying that social
housing is the public service that has been left out in the cold for a
quarter of a century, and in my view we are reaping the whirlwind.
Please let us take this opportunity to start making radical
reparations.</p><p><a name="06051065000061">Several hon. Members

Corporation.</p><p><a name="06051065000066"><b><a name="06051065000520">David
Taylor:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</p><p><a name="06051065000067"><b><a name="06051065000521">Tony
Baldry:</b> I want to be brief and many of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s colleagues wish to speak. I do not want to get
castigated for taking up time, and the points I want to make are of
reasonably narrow
compass.</p><p><a name="06051065000068">Let us look
at what happened in respect of the 2004 comprehensive spending review.
A press release issued by the former Office of the Deputy Prime
Minister in July 2004 stated that this was one of the most generous
spending deliveries ever, providing an extra 10,000 homes a year for
social rent and, on top of that, delivering more than 40,000 homes for
essential public sector workers and low-cost home ownership in areas of
higher housing demand over a four-year period. The fact of the matter
is that although that was a&#163;1.5 billion award, it did
barely anything for shire districts such as
mine.</p><p><a name="06051065000069">Ministers have
recognised that there is an aspiration for home ownership. In a
constituency such as mine, where we fortunately have zero unemployment,
pretty much everyone who comes to see me at my constituency surgery and
looking for housing is on a low income. They are in work and have
almost always lived in the area all their life: having gone to school
in Banbury and grown up there, they now work there. They want to get
into housing and would aspire to own their own home if they
could.</p><p><a name="06051065000070">The Government
have put forward shared equity schemes, which are really exciting. My
only concern is that under the proposals made by the Deputy Prime
Minister and the Chancellor in their pamphlet &#147;Extending Home
Ownership&#148;, the aspirant owner has to take on a mortgage of 75
per cent. of the value of the property. Hometrack has worked out that
in Oxfordshire as in London, only about 2 per cent. of those on low
incomes could afford a shared equity 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 83WH</b><br></br>property on that basis. Practically none of the people on low incomes
will be able to take up shared equity.</p><p><a name="06051065000071">In my patch, notwithstanding
that we are likely to have it trumpeted that the settlement will be
generous and so on, if it is anything like the 2004 settlement,
practically nothing will happen. We will then be told that there is to
be shared equity, but that will also be a false dawn because no one
will be able to access
it.</p><p><a name="06051065000072">I do not
understand the economics of housing. Huge numbers of people in my patch
are going into the private rented sector, so the state is paying
private landlords considerable sums through rent and housing benefit.
Housing benefit is still money from the taxpayer and I do not
understand why more of the benefit cannot help to ensure that families
can access home ownership. The proportion that a family on low income
have to put up would be reduced and far more of those hard-working
families in my constituency&#151;often with husband and wife both
working on low incomes&#151;could access housing of their own rather
than being trapped, as many of them are, in permanent shorthold assured
tenancies.</p><p><a name="06051065000073">Many of my
constituents are confronted by a dilemma: they either go to the
district council and are told that they can be put in temporary
accommodation for an indefinite period, and eventually one of the few
new, affordable social homes might become available, or are told to go
to the private sector. As soon as they go to the private sector, they
are told that they are by definition adequately housed and they fall
off the list.</p><p><a name="06051065000074">I make
my plea to the Minister: over the next year or so, may we perhaps have
a gathering of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, Ministers, the Housing
Corporation and others to see how we can make shared equity schemes
more accessible to a larger number of people? The Treasury should not
simply, under a different pot, spend more and more on housing benefit
and lock people into private rented tenancy in permanent shorthold
assured tenancies that they really do not
want.</p><p><a name="06051065000075">In a
constituency such as mine, if we could make the finances of shared
equity work better, we could lever in a lot more money from
individuals, families and mortgage lenders. There seems to be a
disconnect that I do not entirely understand, but something tells me
that we could do a lot
better.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000480">9.59
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000076"><b><a name="06051065000522">Jeremy
Corbyn (Islington, North) (Lab):</b> I shall be as brief as
possible because it is important that all colleagues are able to get
into the debate. It cannot have escaped your notice, Mrs. Dean, that
the majority of Labour Members participating in this debate represent
London constituencies; that is because of the nature of the housing
crisis in London which my Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park
and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) outlined very well indeed.</p><p><a name="06051065000077">I represent an inner-London
constituency where property prices are going through the roof all the
time. Anyone wishing to buy a property in my constituency, such as a
two-bedroomed flat above a shop on a main road, would need about
&#163;200,000. I saw an ex-council, three-bedroomed flat on an estate
advertised yesterday for &#163;350,000. So-called &#147;shared
ownership&#148; properties are so expensive that the possibility of
anyone on less 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 84WH</b><br></br>than a head teacher&#146;s income getting one is remote. In reality,
there is a massive housing crisis. Little is being built and some
council property is still being sold, fortunately at a slightly lower
rate than in the past.</p><p><a name="06051065000078">As my Friend said in relation
to the choice-based letting scheme, people on the housing waiting list
go into a bidding frenzy every Thursday when the local paper comes out.
Most of them are sadly disappointed. People come to my advice bureau in
tears saying that in two years they have managed to visit one property
with 20 other families and did not even manage to get an offer at the
end of that process. Such a cruelty goes on week in, week
out.</p><p><a name="06051065000079">To some extent,
I welcome the choice-based letting system. However, we should be
careful because those who are not computer literate, whose first
language is not English and who do not feel confident or comfortable
using telephones often simply do not bid. Such people just wait, but
they will wait for ever because they have no opportunity at all. While
I am not against choice-based letting, we should be cautious because
those whose first language is not English are, in my experience, in
danger of losing out as a result of it.</p><p><a name="06051065000080">The Member for Banbury (Tony
Baldry) mentioned some of the problems in his area, and I have much
sympathy with those, particularly the point he raised about the
perverse levels of cost and the way in which investment can deal with
the situation. I suspect that my local authority, Islington council,
like most other London bodies, houses few people off the waiting list
into any new development or vacant property. People tend to be directed
into the private sector or into leased properties where the council or
housing association take on the lease. Such leases are phenomenally
expensive.</p><p><a name="06051065000081">Ex-council
properties that have been sold under the right to buy are then bought
up by property companies or housing associations, or they are leased.
The rent for such properties is often up to &#163;300 a week. People
in desperate housing need are put into them and the rent is paid by
housing benefit; usually 100 per cent. of it is paid in that way,
although that is not true in all cases. The family involved then often
live in a poor quality property that is badly managed, very unsuitable
and, in some cases, downright dangerous in my view. A huge rent is paid
by the public sector.</p>

<p><b>10 May 2006 : Column 84WH</b>&#151;continued</p>



<p><a name="06051065000082">If any member of such a family
then manages to get a job&#151;clearly we want people to get jobs and
careers&#151;they cannot afford to take it, because they are suddenly
saddled with a bill of &#163;15,000 a year in rent alone, and they
have lost income support and other benefits. We are building a mad
benefit trap that costs the public a huge sum to prevent somebody from
working and keep them in a grossly substandard and inadequate form of
accommodation. A lot of that money could be spent far more effectively
on building new homes for rent for the people in desperate housing need
throughout London.</p><p><a name="06051065000083">I
shall just quickly make two or three points because I recognise that
many other Members wish to speak. First, on planning issues, the Mayor
of London has rightly said that he wants 50 per cent. of all major
developments given over to what he terms &#147;affordable
housing&#148;. I understand that aspiration, and I support it with
one or two reservations. I do so because I want far 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 85WH</b><br></br>more homes for rent to be available, but I do not like the use of the
word &#147;affordable&#148; because the definition of it is loose.
It means whatever anyone wants it to mean. Developers seem to think
that something is very affordable when I do not think that that is the
case. I would much rather say that we desperately need &#147;places
for rent at a fixed level in the public sector&#148;.</p><p><a name="06051065000084">My local authority, Islington
council, was controlled by the Liberal Democrats until last Thursday.
Sadly from their point of view it now has no overall control, which
represents an enormous step forward for Labour. One issue in the
election was the Liberal Democrats&#146; persistence on the policy
that they would demand a proportion of social housing only on
development sites of more than 14 units. In my borough there are few
large development sites; most are very small. The Labour proposal was
to go right down to the bottom and insist that all development sites
have a proportion of social housing, which is eminently sensible. I
hope that that is the new council&#146;s policy.</p><p><a name="06051065000085">With major developments,
developers do not think about the housing needs of people who are
desperate to be rehoused; they think of their profits. Arsenal stadium
sadly closed last week and the football team is moving to the new
stadium. The old stadium site is being redeveloped as Highbury square.
The developers, with the agreement of the Liberal Democrat council, are
going to put 711 one-bedroomed private flats on that site. That is
crazy. There is a desperate need for family housing to keep communities
together. What happens is that single people and couples move to
one-bedroomed flats and then cannot move to anywhere else in that
community, so we end up with a community of either childless couples or
old people. Those with children are forced to move out of inner London.
I am sure that that occurs in other inner-London
constituencies.</p><p><a name="06051065000086">My
last point is about the need to invest in development. The Library
produced an interesting briefing for today&#146;s debate, which makes
grim reading. The number of new council properties being developed
throughout the country this year is somewhere around the zero mark, and
the number of housing association properties being developed in the
whole of London, which is at a record high for the past 10 years, is
just 6,000. We need major investment in housing for rent either by
housing associations or local authorities. We should give local
authorities the freedom to invest in building properties for rent if
that is what they want to do, not skew Government financing of housing
investment so that it is impossible for local authorities to build for
affordable rent.</p><p><a name="06051065000087">If
we do not tackle this crisis in London&#151;and it is a
crisis&#151;what will be the long-term effect? More homeless people,
more people living in grossly overcrowded accommodation, and more
children growing up in grossly overcrowded flats. Is it surprising that
young people and teenagers who are forced to share bedrooms with their
siblings&#151;often siblings of different sexes&#151;do not like to
spend time at home because there is simply no space? Is it surprising
that families break up? Is it surprising that those young people hang
around in the streets because they do not 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 86WH</b><br></br>want to be at home in the evening, and encounter all kinds of problems
as a result? If we do not deal with the housing crisis in London
urgently and invest in the needs of the people, we will be exporting
the poor out of London, and creating social divisions and misery for
those people who manage to find somewhere&#151;often somewhere
expensive and inadequate&#151;to live.</p><p><a name="06051065000088">I hope that the Minister fully
understands the crisis facing us in London, and the pain that we see
across our desks at advice bureaux every week when people ask,
&#147;Is it so unreasonable to want a decent flat with a bedroom for
each of my children so that they can grow up like all the other
children do?&#148; It is heartbreaking to hear what people go
through. I hope that the Government will skew investment into new
building rather than frittering it away on the profits of private
landlords and property companies, which is what we are doing through
the perversity of the housing benefit
system.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000481">10.9
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000089"><b><a name="06051065000523">Mr.
Andrew Slaughter (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush)
(Lab):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) on securing the
debate. She is an acknowledged expert in this field, and her
constituency neighbours mine. I do not intend to repeat much of what
she said, but I welcome the return of her forensic skills to this
issue. The loss to aviation policy is great, but the gain to social
housing in London is greater still.
</p><p><a name="06051065000090">I also compliment the
hon. Lady on the timing of the debate, which comes after a series of
contentious local elections, for which many of us have spent the past
six months knocking on doors in our constituencies. Actually, some of
us have spent 18 months continuously doing that&#151;to the extent
that many of my constituents are probably seeking an injunction to stop
my doing it again in the near future. Along with the cases that we hear
of in weekly constituency surgeries, that brought home the real human
tragedy caused by housing problems in inner London, particularly as we
saw at first hand the conditions in which people live in London in the
21st century.</p><p><a name="06051065000091">My hon.
Friend gave several examples of the problem. I shall not give details
of cases but simply say that they range from the extreme&#151;the
consequences of a mother with four children living in a one-bedroomed
flat are traumatic and almost unimaginable&#151;to the more common
situation, which is perhaps worse because of its chronic nature, in
which a whole generation has grown up in overcrowded
housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000092">It is normal
in social housing in my constituency for parents to bring up two or
three children in a two-bedroomed flat. The issue that they raise with
me is the availability of housing now that their children are leaving
college and want homes of their own. In other words, an entire
generation has become accustomed to using living rooms as bedrooms, to
children of different sexes sharing a bedroom, to daily life, whether
it involves doing school work or enjoying recreation, in a space that
is so confined that it does not allow for normal
living.</p><p><a name="06051065000093">It could be
said that that situation was common for our parents&#146; generation,
and that in fact the population 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 87WH</b><br></br>density of inner London has decreased&#151;although it is increasing
again. However, there was always some hope in the past, as the market
was far more flexible. Today, little hope can be offered to most of my
constituents who live in crowded
conditions.</p><p><a name="06051065000094">The
situation is highlighted against a background in which so many things
are improving in housing. I cannot remember an election when I have had
fewer complaints about housing repairs and conditions, or local
authorities and their performance. All those things have improved
markedly, and in large measure that is due not only to the local
authorities but to the Government, particularly for their decent homes
programme, which has transformed entire estates and individual
properties and brought them up to a good modern standard after many
years of neglect. Even though the programme is not complete, people can
now be given a date on which they will have new kitchens and new
bathrooms, or their homes will be made weather-tight and more efficient
and cheaper to run.</p><p><a name="06051065000095">It
is also true that several factors that in the past contributed to a
lack of social housing have been addressed. One rarely hears about
voids; that is, the amount of time it takes to re-let properties. There
are initiatives on empty homes, and better allocation policies. Local
authorities and housing associations, although they are a mixed bag,
have taken action, in so far as they
can.</p><p><a name="06051065000096">It is right to
say that steps have been taken by the Government to introduce more
innovative proposals, but not only the Government have been involved.
The Mayor of London&#146;s policy that 50 per cent. of new units must
be affordable is greatly to be welcomed. Indeed, the only thing that I
would say against it is that the figure is too low. The move away from
building one and two-bedroomed homes to building three-bedroomed and
larger homes is also welcome, but as my hon. Friend said, it has not
gone far
enough.</p><p><a name="06051065000097">Proposals such
as the relaxation of planning powers to allow extensions to be built on
existing properties are often floated. They should be investigated
further, as the solution to a problem is often as simple as providing
an additional bedroom. I think of a family with an autistic child who
lived in a good-quality pre-war council house with a garden. They loved
the house and the area, and used the garden for the child&#146;s
benefit, but they desperately needed an additional bedroom. The
solution was staring us in the face, but planning powers at that time
simply did not allow an
extension.</p><p><a name="06051065000098">There are
ways of approaching this issue laterally or obliquely, but in the end,
as my hon. Friend says, we have to deal with it by supply. That is the
only real solution. We know that 54 per cent. of overcrowded families
and 60 per cent. of families in temporary accommodation are in London.
I have raised that issue publicly and privately with the Minister and
her colleagues, and when I ask questions about affordable social
housing, I tend to get answers about affordable owner-occupation
housing. That is an important issue for young couples who are forced to
move out of London and for people who need some form of intermediate
housing, but at the end of the day the human misery I see every day and
every week in my constituency relates to the lack of supply of
affordable 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 88WH</b><br></br>rented housing, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North
(Jeremy Corbyn) said. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am being
prompted to sit down, and I shall do so shortly.</p><p><a name="06051065000099">I shall conclude with something
slightly more hopeful&#151;and something less hopeful; let us not be
too optimistic. One local authority that I know intimately because I
was a councillor there for 20 years&#151;until last week&#151;is
Hammersmith and Fulham. It has an extremely good record on this issue.
It is a very small and congested inner London borough, but between 1998
and 2006, 2,000 units of affordable housing were constructed, which is
70 per cent. of all housing constructed in the borough, with another
1,000 units in the pipeline.</p><p><a name="06051065000100">In that borough, 99.3 per cent.
of capacity was addressed, compared with 2.8 per cent. in Hillingdon,
3.5 per cent. in Bromley and 3.8 per cent. in Redbridge. Many councils
either do not have the skills or the will to do that. They need to have
their arms twisted to do it far more, but in the end there are some
councils&#151;I am afraid this often does come down to party
politics&#151;that are not prepared to do it.</p><p><a name="06051065000101">On behalf of my constituents
who live in overcrowded conditions, I greatly regret that the control
of Hammersmith and Fulham changed hands last Thursday. I looked back at
the debate that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and
Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) secured in this room on 28 March on the
subject of overcrowding, and a very intelligent speech was made by the
hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), who was very supportive of
many initiatives. He based that speech on a visit he had made to a
housing development in Hammersmith and Fulham the day before, and said
that it was welcomed by residents in the area and all political
parties. Every single affordable housing development in the borough of
Hammersmith and Fulham was opposed by the Conservative party during the
past 20 years. That does not bode well for what will happen there now.
The reasons change, but every single development was opposed.</p><p><a name="06051065000102">Planning powers and Government
intervention are required, but we are talking about not only individual
human misery but social engineering. We are talking about the poor and
those who live in social housing effectively being told that they are
not welcome in the inner city or in areas that are otherwise
prosperous. The gulf between the private
sector&#151;owner-occupation, and even private rented
accommodation&#151;and social housing is so great, it is impossible,
even for those on two or three times the average income, to
bridge.</p><p><a name="06051065000103">The driving
need is for an increase in social rented housing and a form of
intermediate social housing. Unless that need is addressed,
particularly in London, we are not only condemning another generation
to live in appalling and inhuman conditions but changing the nature of
London as we know it: a multi-racial, multi-class and vibrantly mixed
community. That is my fear, and that is why housing will be such an
important issue during the next 10 years. It is a big issue. The
solution, as my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North said, may be simple, but it is difficult to achieve.
I hope that the Government will now give it the attention it
deserves.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 89WH</b><br></br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000482">10.19

Efford (Eltham) (Lab):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) on
securing a debate on this important issue. I, along with other hon.
Members, particularly from London, have raised this issue on a number
of occasions, with questions to the Prime Minister and in Westminster
Hall debates. We have tried to highlight the issue by consistently
stating that it has been overlooked on the political agenda and in
debates about what should be the Government&#146;s
priorities.</p><p><a name="06051065000105">A number
of people have made the point that the Government must be clear about
what they mean by affordable housing. In the past, it has been
interpreted as a need for schemes to assist people to purchase houses.
However, for many people in London, even with the discounts available
through various Government schemes, those homes are just not
affordable. Often, they require a deposit that is out of the
affordability range of most people in desperate housing need.</p><p><a name="06051065000106">I am relieved that people such
as the Chancellor want to see a case made for affordable housing. I am
delighted that we are starting to get some response to the debate, but
I appeal to the Government to take it on board from us that the clear
but unstated hatred of and lack of trust in local authorities to
deliver in this vital area must stop. They are the vehicle for change,
and they can deliver the social housing that will change communities
and provide the opportunities that families are currently being denied.
We must remove the roadblocks in the way of local authorities&#146;
delivery of that change.</p><p><a name="06051065000107">My hon. Friend is right when
she says that supply is the issue. I gave figures for my local
authority whereby housing applications for 2004-05 were running at
similar levels to those of 1999. The acceptance rate was more or less
the same, but the figures for those waiting for housing were up by
almost 60 per cent. Demand is not growing and outstripping
supply&#151;it is the supply that is wrong.</p><p><a name="06051065000108">The figures in my area also
mask the underlying problem of those who are trapped in their family
homes. Every week, my surgery is full of examples of three generations
of a family who live in a house that the Labour party built. The
grandchildren and the parents of those grandchildren are trapped in
that home, and they are unable to move into housing in the same way as
their parents were before them. The grandparents are looking to the
Labour party and saying, &#147;We want you to build houses for our
children, so that they can have the opportunities that we had to bring
up our families.&#148;</p><p><a name="06051065000109">We have seen right to buy
decimate the supply of social housing, but the sad fact is that at the
other end, we have not seen any investment in the stock&#151;to the
point at which local authorities are building almost no properties at
all.</p><p><a name="06051065000110">There is also a
problem with the way in which we construct the finance for building new
social housing schemes, and I believe that we can release much of the
equity in new-build for reinvestment in the public sector. Too often,
when my local authority sells a parcel of its land to the private
sector and then negotiates 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 90WH</b><br></br>under section 106 a proportion of the development of that land for
social housing, the developer walks away with a huge profit from the
sale of the rest of the site. I have spoken to housing associations
that say, &#147;We can manage those schemes from beginning to end; we
can sell the properties, bring the profits back into the public sector
and reinvest them in further schemes in the local
area.&#148;</p><p><a name="06051065000111">We are
frittering away our resources through the way in which we set up the
finances for the development of social housing. We must tell local
authorities that we want them to be more innovative, with
self-financing schemes in some respects. We could consider placing a
proportion of the rents under a prudential scheme, so that they finance
some of the interest that must be paid. We must consider those schemes
urgently.</p><p><a name="06051065000112">Regeneration of the Kidbrooke
area in my constituency will result in 4,400 homes where there are
currently just under 2,000, and about 2,000 of them will be affordable.
Some will be part buy, part rent and others will be for rent through
the social sector. However, it is still not too late to have a greater
proportion of social housing in that development. Most of the land is
in public ownership, and the financing package could be reviewed to
provide more social housing for local people who desperately need
it.</p><p><a name="06051065000113">People in the
eastern corridor of London see beautiful houses being built in the
Thames gateway and are fed up that they and their children do not have
access to those houses because they are priced out. They are
frustrated, and demonstrated that frustration clearly in the recent
local elections. That fuels the lies of extremists such as the British
National party who want to exploit the situation and people&#146;s
feeling of desperation. They have done that successfully because we
left the opportunity open to them and failed to address the problem of
housing demand and the people who desperately need
housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000114">We must
expand the housing stock and provide the opportunity for money to be
invested in houses to accommodate larger families. In return, families
may have to sign away their right to buy for a period or even in
perpetuity so that investment in housing can be made with the
confidence that it will not disappear from the public sector. We must
look at such
schemes.</p><p><a name="06051065000115">Overcrowding
is fuelling antisocial behaviour and is a block to improving standards
in education. Young children who are at school will not sit and watch
&#147;EastEnders&#148; with their parents if they live in an
overcrowded house and sleep in a bedroom with their younger sister or
brother. They will go out on the streets with their friends. They have
nowhere to do their homework. We must cut the vicious circle. Only a
Labour Government will deal with the problem and people need to receive
that message loud and clear. The Government&#146;s duty is to tell
people that housing is a priority and that Labour will deliver for them
once and for
all.</p><p><a name="06051065000116"><b><a name="">Several hon.

Hillier (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op):</b> Time
is short so I shall be brief. Irefer hon. Members to my
Adjournment debate on28 March for comments about Hackney,
where overcrowding contributes to a population churn of more than 40
per cent. in some areas, which has a disastrous effect on public
services.</p><p><a name="06051065000119">I want to
focus on some key points that I would like the Minister to address. Why
is there no explicit measure of efficiency for the Housing Corporation
based on the cost of people living in a home rather than the cost per
house? That defies common sense and has an impact on all the issues
that hon. Members have raised. Will she give a commitment that bid
support in future will reflect the number of people living in a home
rather than the cost per
property?</p><p><a name="06051065000120">There is
also a lack of targeting for large-bedroomed houses in the current
London housing strategy and I should be grateful if the Minister would
comment on that also. Will she look at Housing Corporation funding
rules, because we have the crazy situation locally where for every
pound that a local authority provides to a housing association the
Housing Corporation removes a pound? That defies common sense and needs
to be tackled.</p><p><a name="06051065000121">I must
mention the test case in my constituency concerning the Haggerston West
and Kingsland estate. We are hoping to receive good news about
providing more three and four-bedroomed properties after a long
campaign of more than 10 years by residents, myself and local
councillors, particularly councillor Jamie Carswell, who have fought to
ensure that residents receive the housing they need rather than the one
and two-bedroomed properties that Treasury rules seem to impose on
them.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000484">10.29
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000122"><b><a name="06051065000526">Ms
Sally Keeble (Northampton, North) (Lab):</b> Although my
contribution will last only a minute so that the Minister can speak,
everything that has been said applies to the rest of England. I stress
that a massive housing shortage is building up in other parts of
England. We must not assume that problems of low pay, special needs,
inflation in the private sector and the inadequacies of that sector do
not also apply to the rest of England; they do.</p><p><a name="06051065000123">I have three pleas for the
Minister. One is that she should deal properly with overcrowding, and
bring forward consultation on standards, because we cannot let the
shortage of housing continue to force people to live in such
unacceptable conditions of overcrowding; also, perhaps she could ensure
that proper consultation takes place about special needs and the impact
of that issue on housing standards.</p><p><a name="06051065000124">My second plea is that the
Minister should again examine the preventing homelessness agenda. I
believe that it is leading to a real problem of hidden homelessness.
People are being diverted into private sector renting, and although
they should be diverted after their needs have been assessed, they are
being diverted as soon as they apply, so that they never appear on the
figures. I am very concerned about that. I am also concerned about
standards of training among some of the staff who do the
work.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 92WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000125">My third plea is that the
Minister should attend to what is happening in the growth areas, such
as mine. Lots of new housing is being built in Northampton, but it is
all private sector housing and developers are subject to a requirement
to provide percentages of affordable, not social, housing. As part of
the growth agenda we need to ensure that there are, built in, adequate
supplies of social housing to rent, not just shared equity properties,
about which something has already been said. It should be understood
that there is an economic factor. We need a good housing mix in the new
communities that are being built.</p><p><a name="06051065000126">I hope that the brevity of my
remarks will not be taken to reflect my view of the severity of the
problems.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000485">10.31
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000127"><b><a name="06051065000527">Mr.
Dan Rogerson (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> I shall try to keep my
remarks short to allow the Minister as much time as possible to
respond; I am aware that Labour Members may want to raise additional
points during her
response.</p><p><a name="06051065000128">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North
(Ms Buck) on securing the debate. I know that she has long had an
interest in the issues, and has been raising them for some time. I also
congratulate the Minister on keeping her post during the recent
turbulent period for the Government. I am delighted that she is still
speaking on these
issues.</p><p><a name="06051065000129">Decent housing
should be a right, particularly for children but also for all citizens
of the country. Poor housing leads to poor health and decreased
opportunities in education and employment. In the past century the
supply of social housing meant that people who were unable to enter the
private renting or home ownership sectors had a realistic chance of
being housed. In a time of prosperity such as we are now enjoying, why
are so many more people in the UK suffering from inadequate housing,
or, indeed, homelessness?</p><p><a name="06051065000130">The fact is that successive
Governments have sold off the vital resource of social housing for
rent, without replacing it. Capital has been moved from housing as
capital receipts have disappeared into the Treasury; of &#163;5.5
billion realised from sales of council housing only &#163;3.3 billion
was granted through the Housing Corporation in the 2004-06 grant
round.</p><p><a name="06051065000131">The effects in
human terms of housing shortages can be seen every day, and hon.
Members have referred to individual cases from their constituencies. In
rural areas such as my constituency of North Cornwall there is little
prospect for most families of staying in their home village or small
town. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire
(Lembit &#214;pik), who is no longer in his place, and from the hon.
Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry), about instances in their areas.
Despite excellent work by housing associations, local authorities and
charities to raise the issues and to squeeze the maximum amount of
affordable housing and social rented housing from new developments, the
shortage of properties to rent is still keenly
felt.</p><p><a name="06051065000132">In addition to
the effect on individual families and households of such circumstances,
communities become unsustainable. Vital services suffer, with falls in
school rolls and closures of post offices and shops. 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 93WH</b><br></br>Voluntary bodies such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the
coastguard and retained fire services find it hard to recruit in the
areas that they serve, as the age profile changes, with a bias in
favour of the capital-rich who can afford to live there.</p><p><a name="06051065000133">That frustration is alienating
people from the political process. Electors are losing faith in the
Government&#146;s ability to deliver solutions. We have already heard
how that alienation has had another dangerous effect in urban areas. In
the recent local elections, we saw a small but significant rise in
support for far-right organisations and representatives. In some areas,
people who have traditionally lived in strong communities have found
themselves unable to do so as the housing shortage pushes them away.
Such people are looking for someone who will listen or at least be seen
to be listening. They hear a message from an organisation that says
that it will work outside the political establishment, which has
patently failed to deliver. That offers a scapegoat in other
communities that suffer from inadequate housing, as we have heard. My
father&#146;s roots are in the east end of London and my grandfather
worked in the docks for the whole of his working life, so I am familiar
with the strong communities that exist in the east of London.</p><p><a name="06051065000134">The lack of replacement housing
has also been felt in the type of social housing that remains. The
right to buy has taken away the larger homes, as well as homes in areas
with better transport links and areas that were desirable for all sorts
of reasons. The choice-based letting system has reduced the choice for
tenants. It has also reduced the flexibility for local authorities to
allow for transfers in the system, and for moves up and down the ladder
of dwelling size.</p><p><a name="06051065000135">The
2007 spending review must begin to address that problem in a more
meaningful way. At the end of last year, the number of families waiting
for a council house stood at more than 1.5 million, which is a 50 per
cent. increase since Labour came to power in 1997. Figures provided by
Shelter, in its excellent and shocking report &#147;Building
Hope&#148;, show that 116,000 homeless children are trapped in
temporary accommodation. The Government have set themselves the target
of halving that figure by 2010, but the number of new social rented
homes that will be delivered on current trends will not allow that to
be achieved. Further research undertaken at the behest of Shelter by
the Centre for Housing and Planning Research at Cambridge university
says that we will need an extra 30,000 new social rented homes each
year between 2008 and 2011 to meet that urgent need.</p><p><a name="06051065000136">The lack of accommodation is
forcing people to move into inadequate housing in the private sector
that is often entirely inappropriate to need. Rents there are higher
and housing benefit cannot cover the cost. That puts pressure on the
Treasury, and the hon. Member for Banbury asked whether that was a
sensible use of Treasury
money.</p><p><a name="06051065000137"><b><a name="06051065000528">Ms
Keeble:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman also reflect on the fact
that private sector tenancies do not provide security? For a single
parent with two children to be homeless after six months in one of
those short tenancies is a real problem.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 94WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000138"><b><a name="06051065000529">Mr.
Rogerson:</b> Absolutely. The hon. Lady makes a good point.
There was a case in my constituency recently in which a young family
who had just celebrated the birth of their first child were served with
a notice to quit their shorthold tenancy. That was an incredibly
stressful time for them. Despite the council&#146;s best efforts to
look after that family, they simply joined a list of so many people
waiting for housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000139">The lack of accommodation
pushes people into poverty and can also keep them reliant on relatives
for temporary accommodation. We have heard from Labour Members about
such situations. Such accommodation is called temporary but is, in
effect, semi-permanent. Overcrowding is worsened, and that is not
helped by antiquated definitions that do not take account of the real
needs of children and parents for privacy and space to work and play. I
pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg
Hillier) for her Adjournment debate earlier in the year, about which we
have already heard some
comments.</p>

<p><a name="06051065000140">Future
developments to increase the overall supply of housing may allow the
capital-rich individuals and families to benefit further by taking
advantage of new market housing or even moving into buy to let.
Significant housing investment could have a dramatic effect on the
lives of people and their communities. The letter from the Prime
Minister to the new Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government on her appointment
says:</p><a name="06051065000460"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Thirdly,
you will need to deliver the Government&#146;s policy in response to
the Barker review of housing supply. Helping hard working families and
first time buyers get their foot on the housing ladder should be a key
priority.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000141">Obviously, it
is good to hear the Government setting that out. Even if one is being
generous to the Prime Minister and his comments&#151;not many have
been in recent days&#151;that letter did not appear to say much about
social rented housing; it discussed families getting a foot on the
housing ladder. I would like the Minister to say more about the
emphasis that will be placed on new housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000142">The hon. Member for Regent's
Park and Kensington, North, in her excellent opening speech, discussed
creating a genuine mix of tenure to ensure the availability of social
housing in all areas, urban and rural. She made some excellent points.
Again, my party and I would agree that new investment must not be
financed by rent hikes. The affordability of such properties is the key
to their value in meeting the need. Several hon. Members have pointed
out the difference between affordable housing and social rented
housing, and I was glad to hear them do so because it is a key
point.</p><p><a name="06051065000143">In the 2007
comprehensive spending review, the Government have an opportunity to
turn around years of underinvestment in affordable housing. The
Treasury&#146;s website states that the review involves</p><a name="06051065000461"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a more strategic approach to
asset management and investment decisions, ensuring the UK is equipped
with the infrastructure needed to support both public service delivery
and the productivity and flexibility of the wider
economy.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000144">What could be a
more important investment decision underpinning education, health,
regeneration and the needs of the economy than setting forth an
ambitious 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 95WH</b><br></br>plan for new housing appropriate to the needs of the people? The
Chancellor has spoken a great deal about renewal; this is his
opportunity to
act.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000486">10.41
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000145"><b><a name="06051065000530">Mr.
Robert Syms (Poole) (Con):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member
for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) on raising
this topic. Every time I come to debates on housing, Members crowd in,
trying to make a contribution. It strikes me that the subject ought to
be debated on the Floor of the House, perhaps in a full-day debate. I
know that the Whip is not in his place, but I hope that the Minister
takes the message back that housing is a live issue. When Members of
Parliament discuss housing, one can see that to them the subject is not
just statistics; they talk about families sitting in front of Members
in their surgeries. Nothing is more frustrating for us than to hear
about the continuing need of families who want housing. We know that we
will write letters, phone people up and follow up cases, but there is
probably little hope of such people accessing the housing that they
need. One of the worrying effects of the frustration that people feel
was seen in the local elections&#151;people voting for the British
National party and so on.</p><p><a name="06051065000146">One of the least expected
consequences of the 1997 election was that the building of social
housing declined substantially. As a Conservative Member, I did not
expect that to happen. Although the number of social housing
completions is now picking up, the scale of the problem makes that a
drop in the ocean. We know that there is a major problem.
Owner-occupation, higher house prices and the world of equity
withdrawal is one side of a coin that leaves many people who cannot
afford to get into that world with difficulties in accessing housing.
The homelessness figures and the fact that more than 100,000 families
are in temporary accommodation show that there is a real problem. The
number of first-time buyers has collapsed from a normal yearly average
of about 500,000 to about 320,000 last year, and those who cannot
afford to become owner-occupiers become those on the list for social
housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000147">I am pleased
that my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) joined the
debate to provide the shire counties angle. There is no Member of this
House who does not have housing problems in their constituency. One or
two Members mentioned the economics of housing, but I am not sure that
there are any; it simply seems to be a complicated and complex area. My
hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion that we examine the whole issue in
relation to the way in which housing benefit works is eminently
sensible.</p><p><a name="06051065000148">Council
housing has been little mentioned in today&#146;s debate. I remember
a debate in Westminster Hall on council housing and the fourth way.
Sometimes the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was a little
more concerned about stock transfer than about dealing with council
housing. One of the interesting things that I drew from the Library
brief is that the demand for council housing has picked up
substantially, by more than 50 per cent. In the south-east of England
the relevant figure is 77 per cent. and in London it is 71 per cent.
Despite that, there are 700,000 voids. Although a perfect system is not

<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 96WH</b><br></br>possible, if 1.5 million people are waiting for housing and there are
700,000 empty properties, it should be a great priority of public
policy to fill the voids where possible.</p><p><a name="06051065000149"><b><a name="06051065000531">Clive
Efford:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman also support a move to
allow local authorities to purchase private sector properties that are
left vacant for a long time? In my constituency, a number of properties
have been left vacant for too long and have become derelict, but the
local authority could bring them back into
use.</p><p><a name="06051065000150"><b><a name="06051065000532">Mr.
Syms:</b> The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on the problem
that many empty homes are not accessed by the local community. I am in
the fortunate position of being a spokesman for a party with no
policies&#151;apart from on the environment&#151;but we are
undertaking a detailed policy review. We are also a very broad-based
party, so if the hon. Gentleman has interesting ideas on housing that
he wants to feed into that review, they will no doubt be taken into
account. Given the pressures that we face, particularly in London, it
is difficult for communities to be unable to access the many empty
homes that they see. There are many initiatives to deal with the
problem, including ones to bring flats over shops and elsewhere back
into use.</p><p><a name="06051065000151">A lot more
can be done on many of the estates that have been criticised. There
could be more mixed tenure on some of them, and Castle Vale in
Birmingham is an example of what can be done. If we manage estates and
put a bit of tender care and investment into them, we can make them
more attractive places for people to live. Design was also mentioned,
and we cannot talk about housing without focusing on design and what
can be done to improve some of the existing housing stock.</p><p><a name="06051065000152">There is a major problem, which
needs substantially more debate. There are no easy answers, however,
and public policy must include a range of measures to deal with the
issue. None the less, all hon. Members are very much aware of the
pressures faced by many families in our
constituencies.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000487">10.46
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000153"><b><a name="06051065000533">The
Minister for Housing and Planning (Yvette Cooper):</b> I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and
Kensington, North (Ms Buck) on securing the debate and on her tireless
work on housing issues over many years. I certainly welcome the
expertise and help that she has given me over the past year or so while
I have been working on housing issues. I know that she will continue to
campaign on them in the House and in her constituency.</p><p><a name="06051065000154">As hon. Members will know, the
Chancellor said that social housing will be a priority in the coming
spending review, so the debate is timely. They will also know that we
have made it clear that we need to build more homes for the next
generation. That means more social housing, more shared equity housing
and more private housing. Although I shall talk mainly about social
housing and the issues that hon. Members have raised, I should make it
clear at the beginning that the need for more social housing to be
built should not be 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 97WH</b><br></br>met at the expense of the need for more shared equity housing and more
private housing to be built. We need all three.</p><p><a name="06051065000155">We must be clear that the
long-term, underlying problem&#151;whether we are talking about
social housing in London, affordability in Northamptonshire, or the
issues that have been raised in respect of Banbury and other parts of
the country&#151;is the gap between housing demand and housing
supply. In the past 30 years, we have seen a 30 per cent. increase in
the number of households and a 50 per cent. drop in the level of new
house building. That is unsustainable. Current projections show that
about 200,000 new households will be formed each year as a result of an
ageing, growing population and, primarily, as a result of more people
living alone, but we build about 150,000 to 160,000 new homes every
year. That gap is simply unsustainable, and if it persists, the
proportion of 30-year-old couples who can afford their own home will
decline from more than 50 per cent. today to nearer 30 per cent. in 20
years. If we think that there are pressures on social housing now,
imagine what they will be like in 20 years if we do not build the
additional homes that we need.</p><p><a name="06051065000156">Many people who are waiting for
social housing would prefer to be able to buy their own home or a share
of their own home, but they will not be able to afford to do so if
long-term house prices keep rising beyond their reach. The wider issue,
therefore, is that we need to build new homes for the next generation.
That has been controversial in many parts of the country and with other
political parties, but we must recognise the country&#146;s long-term
needs and the huge and serious consequences in terms of the demand for
social housing if we do not address them. There will be problems with
overcrowding, affordability and constraints on people&#146;s
aspirations for the next generation and the future if we do not address
that long-term need.</p><p><a name="06051065000157">Clearly, we need to proceed in
a sensible way. We must ensure that we fund the necessary
infrastructure and increase environmental standards as we do so, but I
say to local authorities across the country, including the London
boroughs, that they need to recognise their critical role in the
planning and housing systems and in supporting the new homes that we
need for the future. That is why the Mayor wants to increase the number
of new homes in London, and why the Thames Gateway development and
other growth areas are so important.
</p><p><a name="06051065000158"><b><a name="06051065000534">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> Is the Minister&#146;s Department prepared to
intervene in major developments in London or elsewhere if there is
insufficient housing for affordable rent included in the scheme, and to
insist that there should be such housing? Is she prepared to ensure
that major applications are called in for that
purpose?</p><p><a name="06051065000159"><b><a name="06051065000535">Yvette
Cooper:</b> We have a call-in process, and on occasion we call
in developments on that basis if there are concerns about the level of
affordability not meeting the requirements of the local plan and
national planning guidance. Although we have those powers, however, we
think that responsibility for that 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 98WH</b><br></br>lies primarily with local authorities. It is important to recognise that
there is considerable flexibility within the planning system that many
local authorities do not use. They should use their planning powers to
support and promote development and good design, and to ensure that
there is a proper mix of affordable housing, including social
housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000160">I shall talk
about social housing in particular, because that has been the main
focus of the debate. As part of our preparation for the spending review
we are conducting extensive analysis of the future need for social
housing and considering not only overall supply and the level of need,
but aspects such as mixed communities, the location of social housing,
work incentives and the problems of high levels of worklessness in
large social housing estates. Some work has been on that done by Kate
Barker, and some by Cambridge academics and Shelter. We are also
looking at the backlog of need for social housing and people in
temporary accommodation and the need to ensure that they can have
settled and secure accommodation.</p><p><a name="06051065000161">Hon. Members will be aware that
we have increased investment and the number of new social homes
by50 per cent. over a three-year period, and we have said
that we need to go further. We must recognise that there have been
major calls on housing capital investment, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter) said. In 1997 we
inherited a &#163;19 million backlog of repairs and maintenance and
there was a need for a massive programme of investment in our social
and council housing across the country. Had we not introduced the
decent homes programme, we would be here today debating hon.
Members&#146; constituency cases of people living in homes without
central heating and with no prospect of getting it, or in homes in a
shocking state of repair with the windows falling down and leaks in the
roof, and no prospect of getting them repaired. We are not having those
debates because we have invested so much in decent
housing.</p><p><a name="06051065000162"><b><a name="06051065000536">Mr.
Love:</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for giving way
and for her comments so far. We talk about building 10,000 homes this
year, but everyone knows that that will not be achieved; Barker
suggested building 17,000 homes a year, and the Cambridge study
suggested an additional 10,000. Can the Minister reassure Labour
Members that the Department recognises that there is a substantial gap
there? Until that issue is addressed, problem cases will continue to
come to our surgeries, and, perhaps more important, housing will become
a much larger political issue, and we may well face the consequences of
that in the next general
election.</p><p><a name="06051065000163"><b><a name="06051065000537">Yvette
Cooper:</b> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point.
We have said that we need to increase social housing. We are already
increasing the level of new build of social housing, but we have made
it clear that we need to go further and that that will be a priority
for the spending review. We have taken Kate Barker&#146;s
recommendations extremely seriously, but we are doing further work on
the issue to assess what levels of investment will be needed in future.
That is why I said the debate is timely: it can feed into the work not
only in the Department but across the
Government.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 99WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000164"><b><a name="06051065000538">Ms
Keeble:</b> On the point about central heating, there need to
be clear specifications as to what is acceptable heating. I deal with
many cases in which if people have storage heaters or if a previous
tenant, perhaps an old person, said that they did not want central
heating, the house is ring-fenced and does not get the improvements
that it needs. There are still questions about what qualifies for some
of the specifications, and the problems
remain.</p><p><a name="06051065000165"><b><a name="06051065000539">Yvette
Cooper:</b> We have set straightforward, decent homes
standards, but I am happy to talk further to my hon. Friend about the
detail.</p><p><a name="06051065000166">We must
recognise that construction costs and, in particular, land costs have
increased. Part of the reason why land costs have increased is that
there is a rising housing market at a time when we are simply not
making available enough land and building enough homes. The land costs
feed into social housing costs, creating pressure on the social housing
budget. That is why all these issues must be seen as part of a wider
issue about making available land for new homes and tackling the
pressures in the housing
market.</p><p><a name="06051065000167">We recognise
that we are left with significant challenges. We need to increase
supply and consider social housing as well as shared equity and private
housing. That requires investment, which creates serious challenges for
Opposition parties, given their position on the third fiscal rule.
Investment in infrastructure is also required, which is why the
consultation on matters such as the planning gain supplement is such an
important underpinning. Again, that is a challenge for Opposition
parties.</p><p><a name="06051065000168">I disagree
with my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) that we are
hostile to the role of local councils. I have said before that I
believe they play an important role in the planning system. I also
believe that their role in housing is hugely important. I am not
talking simply about the work that they can do through section 106
agreements and partnerships with registered social landlords. Clearly,
there are wide differences between the levels of social housing that
some local councils are able to achieve through section 106 agreements
and those that others can achieve. 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 100WH</b><br></br>However, let me say to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North
(Jeremy Corbyn) that most of central Government&#146;s funding for
new homes goes through housing associations, because they can lever in
additional independent investment so that we get up to 40 per cent.
more homes for the same money. That is worth doing at a time when we
need to increase
supply.</p><p><a name="06051065000169">We could use
local authorities far more to create more supply and we are considering
a series of ways to do that, such as local authorities using their own
land to support new homes&#151;both social housing and shared equity
housing, interestingly. We are working with some of the local
authorities in London that were previously under Labour control. We
hope that, although they have changed hands, they will continue to be
interested in this issue, but we do not yet know whether they will
be.</p><p><a name="06051065000170">We are also
examining the use of housing benefit. Hon. Members asked about housing
benefit and the fact that, particularly where people are in temporary
accommodation in high-cost areas, a lot of money is paid through
housing benefit. What more can we do to bring those costs down and use
the savings to invest in increasing social housing? We are providing
support for an interesting pilot programme in Newham, which involves,
in effect, buying back properties to increase social housing over time
to help people out of temporary
accommodation.</p><p><a name="06051065000171">Several
hon. Members referred to overcrowding, which we take very seriously.
With my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington,
North, I have visited families in very serious circumstances. We must
do the consultation on the overcrowding standards, but that will not
solve the problem. We must consider a much wider overcrowding strategy.
Overcrowding is particularly a London issue, as we can see when we
compare the figures for London with those for areas outside London.
Overcrowding makes a big difference in London, which is why we are
working with the Greater London authority to try to integrate
approaches to overcrowding into homelessness intervention
strategy.</p><p><a name="06051065000172"><b><a name="06051065000540">Mrs.

Workers</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000488">11
am</h5><p><a name="06051065000173"><b><a name="06051065000541">Chris
McCafferty (Calder Valley) (Lab):</b> May I say at the outset
what a great pleasure it is to be speaking in this Adjournment debate
with you in the Chair, Mrs. Dean?</p><p><a name="06051065000174"><b><a name="06051065000542">Mrs.
Janet Dean (in the Chair):</b> Order. Will Members who are
leaving do so quietly, please?</p><p><a name="06051065000175"><b><a name="06051065000543">Chris
McCafferty:</b> I requested this debate because I am concerned
that the Government&#146;s new proposals, part of the
&#147;controlling our borders: making migration work for
Britain&#148; programme, will have a devastating effect on migrant
domestic workers, who make up one of the most vulnerable groups of
workers in the UK.</p><p><a name="06051065000176">Unfortunately, I believe that
the proposals will establish legal channels allowing migrant domestic
workers to be brought into the UK for the purpose of exploitation. By
removing even the most basic employment rights and leaving them
powerless before abusive employers, they will effectively legalise
trafficking, which I am certain the Government do not intend.</p><p><a name="06051065000177">In fact, the proposals are a
complete reversal of the Government&#146;s previous policy, which was
specifically intended to protect vulnerable workers. Migrant domestic
workers are an exceptional category under immigration law. Since 1998,
an employer has been able to apply for a migrant domestic worker to
obtain a special visa. The rules of the visa allow the worker to change
employer&#151;a right that many other visa categories do not have. In
order to qualify for the visa, migrant domestic workers must have been
working with their employer for a minimum of one year outside the UK.
When the employer applies for a tourist or a settlement visa, they can
also apply for a migrant domestic worker visa for their employee. At
present,80 per cent. of migrant domestic workers accompany
tourists, and 20 per cent. accompany those with settlement visas. The
law was introduced to encourage wealthy foreign nationals to come to
the UK and help boost the UK economy.</p><p><a name="06051065000178">About 10,000 migrant domestic
worker visas were issued in 2003-04. If, as proposed, the visa were
curtailed and became a six-month, non-renewable, non-transferable visa,
the impact would be devastating. Migrant domestic workers who enter the
UK accompanying their employer can leave that employer if they are
abused or exploited. That gives them vital protection against violence,
mistreatment and exploitation. They receive basic protection under UK
employment law, and they are entitled to the national minimum wage,
statutory holiday pay and a notice period. As a worker, their visa is
renewed annually, and renewal is dependent on the migrant domestic
worker being in full-time employment as a domestic worker in a private
household. There is also a right to apply for settlement and for family
reunification.</p><p><a name="06051065000179">Those
rights were won after 10 long years of organising and campaigning by
migrant domestic workers themselves, with the support of the labour
movement, trade unions and the British public. When the Labour
Government came to power, they did not 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 102WH</b><br></br>forget the commitment that they made in opposition, bringing migrant
domestic workers out of the shadows of illegality and into the
light.</p><p><a name="06051065000180">Unfortunately,
although the regulations provide some protection, they do not mean that
employers stop abusing their domestic workers. Kalayaan, an
organisation that helps migrant domestic workers and campaigns on their
behalf, has documented the abuse that occurs within the relationship
between migrant domestic workers and their employers. Among 114 workers
registered at Kalayaan, during the two sample months of August 2004 and
August 2005, 75 per cent. reported psychological abuse; 34 per cent.
reported physical abuse; over 57 per cent. did not have their own room
and reported sleeping in public spaces, such as the living room,
kitchen or hallway or shared rooms with children, ensuring that they
were always, &#147;on call&#148;; and 40 per cent. reported having
to sleep on the floor. Kalayaan registers approximately 400 migrant
domestic workers per year who have left their employers because of
abuse. That is obviously just the tip of the iceberg. Many are unaware
of the organisation, or their rights, and are too scared to seek
help.</p><p><a name="06051065000181">Under the
current system, those workers have been able to escape abuse by leaving
their original employer, provided they find employment of a similar
nature and are able to maintain their immigration status as a domestic
worker. The Home Office paper on the points-based migration system, as
it was presented to Parliament in March, does not include migrant
domestic workers. However, the draft proposals presented to Kalayaan by
the immigration and nationality directorate show that it will restrict
domestic workers accompanying their employer to a maximum of six
months, with no right to change employer and no route to
settlement.</p><p><a name="06051065000182">The
proposals raise the most serious concerns. First, they will effectively
legalise trafficking. If these proposals come into force, migrant
domestic workers will be outside the managed migration system. Instead,
they will come to the UK as business visitors, tied to their employer
for a maximum of six months. They will have no option to change
employer during this time, or to renew their visa, which will make it
virtually impossible to challenge any maltreatment or abuse. Indeed, it
may encourage it. That is in direct contravention of the Home
Office&#146;s stated policy to protect victims of trafficking, and to
stop trafficking &#147;at
source&#148;.</p><p><a name="06051065000183">Secondly,
the proposals will lead to an increase in abuse and illegality. Taking
away the provision to renew their visa or to change employers, as well
as making the employer responsible&#151;which it would&#151;for
ensuring that migrant domestic workers leave the UK at the end of their
stay, will dramatically increase the power that the employer has over
the worker. That will inevitably lead to increased levels of abuse and
more migrant domestic workers will be forced underground where they
will be further exploited by employers taking advantage of their
irregular
status.</p><p><a name="06051065000184">Finally, the
proposals will remove full access to employment law. Despite the
immigration and nationality directorate stating that migrant domestic
workers will be recognised as workers under the new scheme, it cannot
be possible in practice to access UK 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 103WH</b><br></br>employment law within the six months allowed, without the right to find
alternative employment. As soon as a migrant domestic workers leave an
employer, they will be homeless and destitute with no right to support
themselves in work. As I understand it, there is a belief in the Home
Office that employers settling in the UK will probably keep their
migrant domestic worker for six months until they find a new one in the
UK. They will then send the migrant domestic worker back home. Whether
they are sent back to the employer&#146;s country or their own is not
yet clear.</p><p><a name="06051065000185">Many
employers hold their workers&#146; passports illegally. Last year, I
introduced a Bill that would have made the retention of another
person&#146;s passport illegal. It is not yet illegal here, and
employers often hold their workers&#146; passports. There is a danger
that migrant domestic workers will not be sent home but will be held
here, completely illegally, for much longer.</p><p><a name="06051065000186">Six months is not an effective
time to mount a challenge under employment law if an employer is
abusing staff. I am aware that the Home Office is seeking to identify
abusive employers at the port of entry, which is excellent. However,
migrant domestic workers have revealed in confidence to workers at
Kalayaan that they are trained to answer such questions at United
Kingdom
embassies.</p><p><a name="06051065000187">Changes to
the migrant domestic worker visa mean that employees would be
completely tied to the employer. Many employers already believe that
they have ownership of their staff, and withhold their passports or
keep them locked away in their houses. Many migrant domestic workers
are terrified when they seek help from Kalayaan or other
organisations.</p><p><a name="06051065000188">Employers often tell such
workers that they will be illegal if they leave their employer, that
they will be deported, and that immigration will seek them out.
Unfortunately, if the migrant domestic worker visa is not continued,
that may well become true, and trafficking in such workers will
effectively have been legitimised, leaving employers in complete
control.</p><p><a name="06051065000189">In my
experience, migrant domestic workers are among the most conservative
groups of people one could ever meet. They want to do things correctly,
to pay their taxes and to live within the rules. They are not
scroungers. This ill-conceived policy will have a devastating impact if
it is enacted as it stands.</p><p><a name="06051065000190">I fully accept that managed
migration is in the interests of the UK and I support the
Government&#146;s policy of delivering a system that they describe as
firm but fair, simpler, more transparent and more rigorous&#151;a
system that will benefit our economy and protect our borders. However,
over the generations migrant workers have enriched the UK both
economically and culturally. We need to ensure that the UK economy can
safely continue to benefit from the input of migrant workers, and that
they can live here safely.</p><p><a name="06051065000191">The fact is that the abuse or
exploitation of migrant workers, who have every right to live and work
here, continues apace at the hands of unscrupulous employers. A major
challenge for the Government is to ensure that those vulnerable workers
receive the full protection of our employment law. I therefore request
that the Government review their own evidence&#151;evidence that
resulted in changes to the existing 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 104WH</b><br></br>immigration law in 1998&#151;in order to afford protection to migrant
domestic workers. As a minimum, the existing provisions that protect
the human rights of that marginalised and vulnerable category of
workers must be
maintained.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000489">11.14

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Joan
Ryan):</b> It is a pleasure to respond to this Adjournment
debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley
(Chris McCafferty) on securing it. The debate will probably stay in my
memory for a long time to come, as it is the first time that I have
spoken for the Government as an Under-Secretary of
State.</p><p><a name="06051065000194"><b><a name="06051065000545">Chris
McCafferty:</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend on her
promotion, which is well deserved.</p><p><a name="06051065000195"><b><a name="06051065000546">Joan
Ryan:</b> I thank my hon. Friend.</p><p><a name="06051065000196">I welcome the opportunity to
reply for the Government on this important subject. I take seriously my
hon. Friend&#146;s concern, which she has expressed on a number of
occasions. She raised some important points, which I wish to
address.</p><p><a name="06051065000197">Before I
respond to the debate, however, I shall begin with an overview of the
Government&#146;s approach to managing migration to the United
Kingdom and thus put in context the position of those who are the
subject of the debate and who are provided for under current
immigration rules.</p><p><a name="06051065000198">The Government are&#151;and
have been&#151;very clear that migration makes a substantial
contribution to economic growth. It helps to fill gaps in the labour
market, including key public services, such as health and education.
Migration also increases investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in
the UK. Culturally, we are enriched by people with diverse backgrounds
from other countries. With an expanded EU, an accessible and mobile
work force are already contributing to our growing economy, closing
many gaps experienced by employers. Our starting point is that
employers should look first to recruit from the UK and the expanded EU
before recruiting migrants from outside the EU.</p><p><a name="06051065000199">Migration needs to be properly
managed. It is understandable that people migrate to seek a better life
for themselves and their families, but that can leave settled
populations, including many in the UK, concerned about the impact on
jobs, public services and their way of life. The system should
therefore be focused primarily on bringing in migrants who are highly
skilled, or bringing in migrants to do key jobs that cannot be filled
from the domestic labour force or from the EU. The system should also
be robust against abuse. Only those of benefit to the UK should be
admitted, and once here they must comply with the conditions of their
leave.</p><p><a name="06051065000200">That, then, is
the underlying strategy. On that basis, we outlined our proposals for a
five-tier managed migration system in the Command Paper &#147;A
Points-Based System: Making Migration Work for Britain&#148;, which
was presented to this House on 7 March. The new points-based system
forms part of our five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, which
was 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 105WH</b><br></br>published in February 2004. A thorough consultation on the points-based
system was undertaken following the publication of a consultation
document, &#147;Selective Admission: Making Migration Work for
Britain&#148;, and those proposals were generally well received by
stakeholders and the media.</p><p><a name="06051065000201">The aim of the new system is to
develop a more efficient and transparent migration system, which sets
out clearly who is permitted to come to the UK and why. We want to
design a system that is better able to identify and attract those
migrants who have most to contribute to the UK&#151;one that offers a
more efficient, transparent and objective process and which improves
compliance while reducing scope for abuse. As part of that work we have
reviewed existing routes for employment, training and study with a view
to identifying which are of most benefit to the UK. Underpinning the
new migration system will be a five-tier framework replacing more than
80 work and study routes. That will help people to understand how the
system works and will direct applicants to the category that is most
appropriate for them.</p><p><a name="06051065000202">Tier 1 will cover those highly
skilled individuals who can contribute to growth and productivity. Tier
2 will be for skilled workers with a job offer, who can fill gaps in
the UK labour force. Tier 3 will provide forlimited numbers
of low-skilled workers needed to fill temporary labour shortages. Tier
4 will accommodate overseas students and tier 5 will cover what we
describe as youth mobility and temporary workers: people who are
allowed to work in the UK for a limited period, primarily to satisfy
non-economic objectives. Examples might be a teacher on an exchange
scheme or a sportsperson coming here to take part in a charity
event.</p><p><a name="06051065000203">We also intend
to set up an independent body to identify employment shortages across
all sectors of the economy, known as the skills advisory body. It will
build on existing structures and expertise&#151;in particular the
skills for business network, which is funded in part by the Department
for Education and Skills. Shortages identified by the skills advisory
body will inform Government decisions on the use of migrant labour
within tiers 2 and 3 of the points-based system.</p><p><a name="06051065000204">I shall turn now to the
position of overseas domestic workers within this framework. Overseas
domestic workers accompanying their employer to the UK are generally
low-skilled. As I have explained, our policy under the points-based
system is to phase out low-skilled migration in response to the number
of workers available from the newly enlarged EU. We expect that in most
cases EU countries should be able to provide us with adequate labour in
this respect. However, as I said earlier, tier 3 of the points-based
system may provide for limited numbers of low-skilled workers to fill
specific temporary labour shortages where those are identified by the
independent skills advisory body. We have also proposed that in the
Command Paper.</p><p><a name="06051065000205">We do
not currently have any evidence of a shortage of domestic workers. Were
the skills advisory body to identify one, and were we to decide that
immigration was the appropriate response, we could set up a 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 106WH</b><br></br>quota-based, operator-led, time-limited route under tier 3 for overseas
domestic workers with countries with which the UK has effective returns
agreements. However, admission on that basis would be temporary. If
employers want to employ low-skilled domestic staff on a long-term
basis, they can look to the resident and EU labour market. There is
evidence that that is what they are doing. More than 14,000 nationals
of the new member states registered under the worker registration
scheme as cleaners and domestic staff between May 2004 and 31 December
2005. We will not therefore be providing a route for overseas domestic
workers under the points-based system. Those who are skilled and can
meet the relevant requirements may be able to come to the UK under tier
2. We will also be making very limited provision for those currently
referred to as domestic workers to accompany another visitor to the UK
in certain defined circumstances, under the arrangements for business
visitors. An example of that might be where a family on holiday in the
UK want to bring their nanny with them.</p><p><a name="06051065000206">We of course recognise that
there are real concerns about abuse and exploitation of overseas
domestic workers, and we will continue to make every effort to protect
migrant workers in general from abuse while they are in the UK. Were
domestic workers to be provided for under tier 3, we would of course
need to ensure that they were not being exploited, and we would work
with trade unions and others to achieve that.</p><p><a name="06051065000207">My hon. Friend raised some
specific points about abuse. It is important to state again that we
recognise the concerns about abuse and exploitation of domestic workers
in private households. However, immigration is not the way to deal with
that. We are dealing with it in a number of ways. To understand how we
are addressing matters such as abuse and trafficking, which my hon.
Friend mentioned, it is important that what we are discussing today is
seen in conjunction with other Government legislation. We have
introduced legislation comprehensively to criminalise trafficking in
human beings. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced wide-ranging
offences covering trafficking into, within and out of the UK for any
sexual exploitation. A new offence of trafficking people for
exploitation covering forced labour, removal of organs and the
trafficking of vulnerable people including children is included in the
Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. The
maximum punishment for all these offences is 14 years&#146;
imprisonment. That shows the seriousness with which the Government view
these types of offences to do with abuse and
exploitation.</p><p><a name="06051065000208">We also
have the Reflex joint taskforce, and with the establishment of the
Serious Organised Crime Agency, the UK will continue to focus on
targeting the organised crime groups that cause the most harm. We
recently launched a public consultation on our strategy to combat
trafficking and are committed to developing a national action plan to
provide a comprehensive, end-to-end approach covering different
elements, from prevention, including demand reduction, through
investigating and prosecuting traffickers, to protecting and supporting
victims.</p><p><a name="06051065000209">My hon.
Friend mentioned interviews at port of entry. We are not in a position
at present to insist that 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 107WH</b><br></br>the national minimum wage is paid to certain categories of workers,
within which overseas domestic workers would fall, but we do attempt
through interview to establish terms and conditions that meet the
requirements that we would expect for all domestic workers in the UK,
not just overseas domestic
workers.</p><p><a name="06051065000210">We are
reviewing future requirements for admitting domestic workers to the UK
and have already offered to liaise with Kalayaan, which has worked very
hardon the issue. Options might include retaining
theexisting requirement for employment to have existed for 12
months prior to coming to the UK, and insisting that the domestic
worker is paid at least the national minimum wage. Those useful
discussions would deal with points that my hon. Friend
raised.</p><p><a name="06051065000211">On access to
employment law, we are working with the Department of Trade and
Industry on the protections that are available in respect of business
visitors under UK employment law, but we must bear in mind that they
will be covered by other aspects of UK legislation such as the Human
Rights Act 1998.</p><p><a name="06051065000212">In
conclusion, I hope that I have clearly set out the position for the
House and addressed some of the concerns that my hon. Friend raised
eloquently and with feeling. After a lengthy process of review and
consultation, we have set out plans for winding up the quota-based
schemes for admitting low-skilled workers for specific sectors, in
light of the availability of labour from an expanded EU. Alongside
that, we will not in the future provide a specific route for overseas
domestic workers, who are generally low-skilled, under the points-based
system.</p><p><a name="06051065000213">I hope that I
have given some assurance to my hon. Friend about the
Government&#146;s commitment to protect all workers from abuse and
about our awareness of the issues that she raised. Furthermore,
although we shall not pursue a policy of offering overseas domestic
workers from outside the EU a route for settlement, we remain strongly
committed to dealing with any abuse to which such workers could be
subjected.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000490">11.29

Duddridge (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con):</b> I am
grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject of cancer services in
south Essex, which is a subject that I have been working on over the
past few months with my hon. Friends the Members for Southend, West
(Mr. Amess), for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Rayleigh (Mr.
Francois), co-ordinating some of the activity in south Essex on our
collective behalf.</p><p><a name="06051065000216">I
am acutely aware that cancer is an emotive subject, with one in three
people directly affected by it and virtually all of us indirectly
affected. It was with some trepidation that I began to engage with the
subject matter locally, but the bottom line is that, without being
sensationalist, I genuinely believe that there will be a materially
worse service in south Essex as a result of the changes that are taking
place.</p><p><a name="06051065000217">Those changes
are the merger of the South Essex cancer network with the Mid Anglia
network. I shall give a bit of the history of what has been happening.
As far back as the mid-1980s, there was a threat of merger, which
disappeared following a local campaign. The Calman Hine report in 1995
rightly suggested introducing cancer networks, and a year later the
South Essex cancer network was created. In 2001-02, the network came
under threat and mergers were proposed across the whole of Essex. There
was a lot of local debate, and a large campaign was run by the
<i>Southend Echo</i> and a number of colleagues who were in the House
at the time to keep hands off the cancer network and to leave it as it
was.</p><p><a name="06051065000218">This morning, I
was reading the papers from back then and Mike Richards, the cancer
tsar, said that he could barely come to the House of Commons without
someone mentioning Southend to him. He kindly agreed to come down to
Southend and decided that it was right for south Essex and for cancer
patients that the merger did not go ahead at that point. More recently,
in December 2005, the strategic health authority started a
consultation, which although it was extensive was fundamentally flawed
and a bit of a sham. I will explain the distinction later and go into
the consultation process in more detail.</p><p><a name="06051065000219">In terms of parliamentary
activity, we have been doing an awful lot. We spoke in the Opposition
day debate on cancer, have met the strategic health authority a number
of times and a petition has gained about 5,000 signatures. Collectively
and individually, we have made formal consultation submissions to the
SHA and, of course, as one would expect, we have been corresponding
with the main players and have visited the cancer centre a number of
times. Unfortunately, on 29 March the SHA decided to press ahead with
the change. Since then I have tabled a number of written questions and
written to the Secretary of State. The Minister was kind enough to
reply to those, and I shall go into those matters on which I was
disappointed by the lack of detail in the reply and those on which I
was looking to tease out whether the merger will be good for patients.
The case has certainly not been proved and, on balance, would be
adverse at the moment.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 109WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000220">In summary, the South Essex
cancer network was created 10 years ago. I hope that the Minister will
consider not effectively abolishing it through merger. The network
covers a population of approximately 730,000 and the main hospitals of
Southend and Basildon. In many ways, the merger has been brought about
because of activities outside south Essex, specifically the decision by
Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire to pull Ipswich out of the Mid
Anglia network to the north. Crucially, the South Essex network had no
involvement in that decision but was fundamentally affected by the
knock-on effect.</p><p><a name="06051065000221">The
South Essex and Mid Anglia networks are two of the three smallest
cancer networks in the United Kingdom. I wrote to the Minister asking
for details of the population size, but I could not get definitive
figures, so perhaps she can correct me and give some figures on the
smaller cancer
networks.</p><p><a name="06051065000222">I want to
prove, first, that there was no need for change, secondly, that one
size does not fit all, in terms of cancer network sizes, and, thirdly,
that the consultation was fundamentally flawed and that the decision
had been taken well before the start of the consultation. I also have a
number of questions that I hope that the Minister will answer either
today or in writing, as she considers appropriate.</p><p><a name="06051065000223">There are things that I shall
not touch on. Essex cancer services is a broad subject, and I shall
focus primarily on the network and the merger. I shall not talk in
detail about changes to upper gastrointestinal, urological and head and
neck cancer services, although other Members may want to contribute on
those subjects in more detail, as they are not uncontroversial.
However, very few people are affected by those cancers, and the big
issue for me is the network overall, rather than the merger of services
for those specific
cancers.</p><p><a name="06051065000224">My hon.
Friend the Member for Rayleigh, when introducing me to the subject,
summarised the whole issue by saying, &#147;If it ain&#146;t broke,
don&#146;t fix it.&#148; That is probably a fair reflection of the
overall feeling in south Essex. The cancer network is doing a fantastic
job. In fact, it is one of the leading cancer networks in the United
Kingdom, and I would like to pay particular tribute to the lead
clinician, Dr. Colin Trask, and the lead manager, Kevin McKenny, who I
am sure will read the report of the debate with great interest. The
service has a fantastic reputation not only locally, but among its
peers. I could quote a whole series of barometer statistics about
cancer care, but suffice it to say that statistically it does an
excellent job.</p><p><a name="06051065000225">At the
moment, most of the cancer care network, and most transport
communications, in Essex go east-west, not north-south, because when
people are treated in Essex and are looking for specialist services,
they look to London. There are no significant patient flows north-south
or south-north, so the merger is inappropriate, given the movement of
people.</p><p><a name="06051065000226">Early on, our
campaign talked about saving the cancer centre. A few people have
called us sensationalist. It is true that the cancer centre will not
close tomorrow, next week, next month or even next year, but I feel
that this is a case of death by a thousand cuts. A salami-slice
approach is being taken to reducing things&#151;a little bit is taken
off here, and a little bit is 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 110WH</b><br></br>taken off there. There will be a reduction until a critical mass is
reached, which will mean that Southend cancer centre will not be able
to attract the excellent clinicians that it does at the moment and
maintain its excellent
reputation.</p><p><a name="06051065000227">Also, we
are told that the change is purely administrative. If it is purely an
administrative matter, then given that there is so much public opinion
against the change in south Essex, and given that we are talking about
only 20 or 30 people in terms of gastrointestinal cases, why press
ahead with it? I have a sinister suspicion that the change is not
purely administrative, but is a stepping stone to other changes, and I
seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance that that is not the
case.</p><p><a name="06051065000228">I need to be
careful when talking about the Mid Anglia cancer network, because
clearly we south Essex MPs are proud of our services, but perhaps I
could quote what other people have said, rather than making a judgment
on the network myself. Some people have told me that the Mid Anglia
network is unstable at the moment, and others say that there are lots
of problems with Ipswich having left. I recognise that there may be
benefits for Mid Anglia in the merger, but there are certainly no
benefits for my residents in Rochford and Southend, East, or for
constituents generally across south Essex. Perhaps the strategic health
authority is formulating an equation for the greater good of the
residents of Essex, but the equation does not work for me. South Essex
loses a little and Mid Anglia gains a lot. That may work overall, but
it does not work for my
constituents.</p><p><a name="06051065000229">There is
a feeling that bigger is better, but I am not sure that that is right
when it comes to cancer networks. It seems from speaking to some
patient groups and GPs that the opposite might be true and that some
cancer centres may be too large. One of the greatest challenges is to
identify cancer early at GP level and to refer patients to the correct
person for a proper diagnosis. A closer relationship between the cancer
networks and individual GP practices would be more easily facilitated
if the networks were slightly smaller. I am suggesting not a radical
change, but a change in direction, and it may be better to keep them as
they are or to reduce them
slightly.</p><p><a name="06051065000230">The cancer
centre made the point that it is already working across boundaries in
some cases and sharing best practice. I shall go into more detail about
how one size does not fit all. I mentioned the 1995 Calman Hine report.
It is 10 years old but is still relevant and still resonates. I want to
draw attention to some quotes from the report. The first is about the
size of the population and
states:</p><a name="06051065000462"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
size of a population served by a Cancer Unit cannot be inflexibly
defined but will be determined by the number of cases of each cancer
type being seen
there&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000231">It is critical
that a network is based on the number of cancer incidents rather than
the population. South Essex has pockets of deprivation with, sadly, a
higher incidence of cancer and demographically it has a much older
population. Those were the two reasons given by the Government&#146;s
cancer tzar for not going ahead with the decision to merge the network
in 2002. Those reasons remain true
today.</p><p><a name="06051065000232">Secondly, the
report states:</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 111WH</b><br></br><a name="06051065000463"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Decisions will have to
be taken forward in the light of local circumstances and take account
of the views of patients&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000233">patients do not want
this&#151;</p><a name="06051065000464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;and their
carers as well as the professionals involved in providing
care.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000234">It
continues:</p><a name="06051065000465"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The Group
recognise that the development of the ideal pattern of service should
build upon existing patterns of referral and care and should take
account of geographical
constraints.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000235">That is the
opposite of what is happening. There are no existing patterns of
referral north and south and there are transport constraints. It is
normally quite difficult to travel around south Essex and people who
need cancer care do not want to be stuck in traffic for hours before
receiving important
treatment.</p><p><a name="06051065000236"><b><a name="06051065000548">Mr.
Mark Francois (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> I apologise for
interrupting my hon. Friend because he is making a good
speech.</p><p><a name="06051065000237">To amplify
what my hon. Friend said about the quota being under 1 million, when
the network was established it was specifically given a derogation from
the 1 million level because the NHS accepted that there was a higher
than average number of elderly people and that actuarially,
unfortunately, cancer would be slightly more prevalent in that
population group. There was enough business to make a cancer network of
750,000 viable. The point that I want to stress is that that was built
in from the day when the network was established. It was looked at from
day one and accepted, so it should not be
overturned.</p><p><a name="06051065000238"><b><a name="06051065000549">James
Duddridge:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that. He has
been involved in the matter for a considerable period, more so than I
have. I completely agree that the 1 million figure is largely arbitrary
and inappropriate for the South Essex cancer network. It does not take
account of the local
situation.</p><p><a name="06051065000239">I explained
why I found one of the replies to a written question unhelpful. I was
trying to probe whether there was a statistical correlation between the
size of the cancer network, the number of treatments and the success
rate. I also asked the Secretary of State for the population catchment
size for each cancer network in England and the Minister
replied:</p><a name="06051065000466"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Department does not hold the population catchment size for each cancer
network. However, a typical cancer network services a population of
around one to two million.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18
April 2006; Vol. 445, c.
385W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000240">That statistic perhaps
went into the first column of some form of analysis. The second column
would have been the actual cancers identified each year. Around 3,500
cancers are identified in the South Essex cancer network. The following
column would be an indicator of the success of those units&#151;for
example, long-term survival rates. I appreciate that that is a much
harder figure to obtain, but nevertheless it is important. I seek the
Minister&#146;s guidance on the exact measure that she could take
within the Department.</p><p><a name="06051065000241">The final column would be the
statistical correlation between those first three numbers. Nowhere in
my discussions, the circulated paperwork or the responses to my
questions have I seen that statistical analysis for the cancer network.
Following a meeting, the medical director of the strategic health
authority kindly 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 112WH</b><br></br>provided details for the three specific cancers, and although I cannot
engage in the detail of the medical situation, there seemed to be a
case that bigger might be better. However, no one has tried to prove,
in anything that has been provided to us, that bigger is better for
cancer networks, and many of us have been extensively involved in this
subject for the past few months, and some of us for much
longer.</p><p><a name="06051065000242">I am
concerned that this is d(c)j  vu in respect of 2001-02. I
feel embarrassed that back then, before I was an MP, colleagues were
successful and that I do not seem to be getting a very good deal for my
constituents. I worry about that, and I ask the Minister to give me a
ray of hope, or at least an explanation. I do not want the cancer
network 10-year birthday to be celebrated with effective abolition by
merger.</p><p><a name="06051065000243">To call the
consultation a sham would perhaps be unprofessional, and such language
might be unparliamentary. I use those words in anger, because I was
very upset by the way I was treated, not individually but as an
MP&#151;as a statutory consultee&#151;and, more importantly, by the
way all the patient groups were treated. There was overwhelming
opposition, which I think is best summarised by the people at the front
line who are running the network.</p><p><a name="06051065000244">The South Essex cancer network
did not support the SHA&#146;s proposals to merge. It gave a number
of reasons why: there</p><a name="06051065000467"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;is
no demonstrable patient
benefit&#148;;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000245">there is a
great risk of losing the clinical cohesiveness and ownership that
exists in south Essex; patient flows should determine network
configurations, and there are virtually no patient flows from south to
north or vice versa; current network arrangements meet national peer
review measures already; the restructuring of cancer networks is not
required to meet national cancer site-specific guidance, with south
Essex plans already either approved or well advanced; the south Essex
network currently has arrangements that are working perfectly well; and
the merger will produce only marginal cost savings. Finally, the cancer
network pinpoints a distinct lack of clarity about the future of the
Mid Anglia cancer network based on current arrangements. Therefore,
there is strong opposition from the people who actually run the
network.</p><p><a name="06051065000246">Other key
authorities also opposed the merger. The two primary care trusts within
my constituency&#151;Castle Point and Rochford PCT and Southend
PCT&#151;did so. The two local authorities in my area wrote to ask me
to raise the matter. They did not just send in a consultation; they
passed council motions saying that they did not want it, because it was
bad for constituents. That view came from both Southend and Rochford.
Patients&#146; groups have also come to me both formally and
informally and said that they oppose the
merger.</p><p><a name="06051065000247">As I am an
inexperienced MP, the petition that we put together was my first one. I
sent it to a number of doctors&#146; surgeries&#151;about
20&#151;as well as to a number of pharmacies in my area, because I
thought that that would be a way of demonstrating the size of support
to the Government. I am not sure what level of support I thought would
be successful, but I was thinking in terms of a couple of hundred
names, and that if there 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 113WH</b><br></br>were more than 1,000 I would be celebrating. However, 5,000 people
responded. There is a massive amount of local support and
concern.</p><p><a name="06051065000248">I wrote to
the Secretary of State. The Minister was kind enough to reply, saying
that the merger was a local matter, that the Secretary of State would
not intervene, and that I should raise any concerns with Essex SHA. In
many ways I agree; it is a local matter, but I do not consider the SHA
to be local. To me, local is Southend, Rochford and the wider cancer
network. I find the strategic health authority somewhat out of touch in
that regard, and in regard to other matters as well. I hesitate to go
into more detail, but I do not think that it has a role as things
progress. It certainly does not add value for my constituents. I want
more people on the front line. However, I apologise, Mr. Atkinson, for
going slightly off on a tangent, and I shall return to the subject of
cancer.</p><p><a name="06051065000249">The Minister
has a role. When the Government&#146;s cancer tsar last came to
Southend and examined the problem it paid dividends. I do not demand,
or even ask, that the Minister should come to Southend, although it
would be very welcome. I am more concerned that she should review the
matter. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friends are asking whether she
will come; she would be more than
welcome.</p><p><a name="06051065000250">What I said
about the consultation being a sham involves a key point. When Ipswich
left the Mid Anglia cancer network, the writing was on the wall. It was
always going to be difficult to justify maintaining two smaller
networks, if, indeed, it was Government policy and advice that 1
million-plus should be the population number. That has produced upwards
leverage.</p><p><a name="06051065000251">Following
the Minister&#146;s letter, I telephoned the strategic health
authority to check that it had not been missed the letter in the post
in early May, prior to the debate, and it kindly faxed its response to
me this morning. In fairness, its representatives are disappointed that
I consider the consultation to have been a sham, but not nearly as
disappointed as I feel about the whole consultation
process.</p><p><a name="06051065000252">I am not
criticising a lack of activity in the consultation; there was lots of
activity and lots of money was spent on it. However, I believe that the
decision was taken well before the consultation. Several more
seasoned&#151;perhaps one could say more cynical&#151;colleagues
told me not to bother to get involved. They said, &#147;We see this
time and again; consultations take place but the decision has already
been taken.&#148; Furthermore, in the health sector locally there is
some consultation overload. I was considering five or six NHS
consultations in south Essex in January, so things are quite difficult.
Also, in each case the questions being considered were mergers, and
getting bigger. I cannot help thinking that there is an underlying
philosophy that bigger is better, but I do not think that that is
right. Both on the specific cancer issue and on other things, bigger
may be considerably worse. We should reduce the size of some of our
operating units.</p><p><a name="06051065000253">I
said that I would try to include some questions to make it clear what I
want to achieve in raising the debate. The best thing would be for the
Minister to say, &#147;Ah, yes, there has been a terrible mistake and
we shall sort it out.&#148; I do not imagine in my wildest
imagination 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 114WH</b><br></br>that that will happen, but a ray of hope for my constituents would be
most appreciated. I should like to find out more about why change is
needed. I think that I have demonstrated that the cost benefits will be
marginal, that there are no demonstrable patient benefits and there
will be much administrative disruption, and that there is much
opposition.</p><p><a name="06051065000254">I should
be interested to know more about the 1 million figure and why there is
no flexibility, when the cancer tsar showed flexibility in 2001-02. Has
there been a policy change since then, or has more information, of
which I am not aware, become available? As to the tabular information,
I do not ask the Minister to provide anything in that exact format.
However, something a little more solid statistically, which correlates
population numbers, cancer incidence and survival rates would be
helpful to enable us to go forward. If the Minister is right that
bigger is better, why should the figure be 2 million? Perhaps it should
be 4 million? We need a strong evidence base to enable us to
proceed.</p><p><a name="06051065000255">I hesitated
before putting my questions, because the issue that they raise is,
&#147;What if the merger does go ahead?&#148; I should like the
Minister to confirm that what is happening is 100 per cent. about
administration. The South Essex cancer network and the doctors in
Southend would like a promise that there will be no patient movements
south to north or north to south, other than in the three specialist
cancer centres, without consultation.</p><p><a name="06051065000256">I should also like more
information about the consultation. I talked about the cancer centre
suffering death by 1,000 cuts, and one concern is that smaller changes
will happen below the radar, and without the involvement of local
community leaders and community groups, once we are part of a bigger
cancer network.</p><p><a name="06051065000257">Macmillan Cancer Relief raised
the problem of the travel costs that would be involved should patient
flows be significant. Bus routes are poor, and there are virtually no
rail routes north and south&#151;certainly not from my part of south
Essex. The charity is concerned about the extra costs, and that is a
valid concern, although time is also a great worry.</p><p><a name="06051065000258">I said that I would not talk in
detail about upper GI, but I have had several letters from people in
Basildon asking why there is no options appraisal for upper GI in
Basildon. I simply throw that issue out to the Minister, and she might
want to comment on it. That might be helpful for members of public in
that part of the world.</p><p><a name="06051065000259">In summary, the merger of the
South Essex and Mid Anglia cancer networks is opposed locally and
represents a threat to the longer-term future of the Southend cancer
centre. The case for the merger is weak at best and fundamentally
flawed at
worst.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000492">2.56

her mind for a moment the thought that she will hear mainly from
Conservative Members this afternoon. Instead, I ask her to consider
carefully the advice that she is being given, because it was wrong four
years ago, and nothing whatever has changed the argument today. I also
hope that she will accept my hon. Friend&#146;s invitation to visit

should know that there is great pride in cancer services in our part of
Essex, and that is particularly clear from the support for local
hospices. Last week, I was proud to accompany Vera and Ivan Heath, both
of whom are 90. They have no children and little family, so they have
decided to benefit others by giving their money to the local community
now, rather than waiting until they die. I was honoured to be with Ivan
at Little Haven hospice, which he presented with a cheque for
&#163;250,000. I was also honoured to accompany him to St.
Luke&#146;s hospice, which was opened by the late Princess Diana of
Wales and the Duchess of Norfolk when I was the Member of Parliament
for Basildon. Ivan gave St. Luke&#146;s &#163;50,000, which is a
wonderful gesture.</p><p><a name="06051065000263">On
Fridays, I sometimes go round my colleagues&#146; constituencies.
Last Friday, I was at Stock Brook Manor in the constituency of my hon.
Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron). I enjoyed a charity golf
day, which was organised by the Donovan family, and a whole number of
celebrities attended. The event raised in excess of &#163;60,000 for
Little Haven hospice. I just want the Minister to appreciate, if she
does not already, that there is an enormous amount of good will towards
cancer services in Essex generally. In particular, we are very proud of
the services at Southend hospital, which really is a true centre of
excellence.</p><p><a name="06051065000264">In the
debate in February 2002, to which a different Minister replied, I
applauded the cancer plan, and I do so now. It is right that cancer, an
illness that affects one in three people in the UK, should be given the
priority status that it already enjoys in the national health service.
However, as I said in that
debate,</p><a name="06051065000468"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;As
we have a first-class service and that is what the Government want, why
change it?&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6 February 2002;
Vol. 379, c. 1002.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000265">That is the
issue, and it must not be clouded by anything else. We have a
first-class service and it should not be changed, whatever briefing the
Minister has been given.</p><p><a name="06051065000266">Professor Richards decided
that, given the high number of cases treated by the centre and the high
proportion of elderly residents in the area, the benchmark figure of 1
million inhabitants ought not to apply to the South Essex cancer
network. I represent the constituency with the most people between the
ages of 100 and 112 in the UK. For the reasons that I mentioned,
Professor Richards decided to support the arguments advanced by my
colleagues and me.</p><p><a name="06051065000267">The factors have not changed,
so why, four years later, is the size of the network a reason for
merging it with Mid Anglia? It seems absolutely implausible&#151;
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 116WH</b><br></br>how can the argument have changed in four years? So far, Essex strategic
health authority has been totally unable to provide me and my
colleagues with any evidence to show that small centres are less
effective in treating certain sorts of cancer than larger
ones.</p><p><a name="06051065000268">A press release
issued by Essex strategic health authority on Tuesday, 21 February
2006&#151;still within the period of the public
consultation&#151;made the case for large specialist surgical
centres. It
stated:</p><p><a name="06051065000269">&#147;National
guidance recommends that the surgical part of treatment of
gynaecological, upper GI, urological and head and neck cancers should
be provided in centres serving at least one million people. The
national guidance is known as Improving
Outcomes.&#148;</p><p><a name="06051065000270">The
recommendation to replace what the release calls
&#147;fragmented&#148; services with other clinical set-ups is made
without statistical evidence to back up the assertion that bigger is
better.</p><p><a name="06051065000271">The Essex
strategic health authority consultation on the reconfiguration of
cancer services was conducted from 12 December 2005 to 13 March 2006,
after which it was decided that the changes proposed in the
document&#151;that is, the merger of the cancer networks and the
relocation of specialist cancer operations&#151;should go ahead. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East asked, what
was the point of the consultation? Members of Parliament and our
constituents have been treated like complete idiots and I, for one,
will put up with it no longer.</p><p><a name="06051065000272">If the strategic health
authority had already made up its mind, what on earth was the point of
going through the consultation? It was more of a gesture towards
openness than real dialogue; it did not take into account the views of
the south Essex hospitals, the South Essex cancer network, the 5,000
members of the public&#151;who, as my hon. Friend mentioned, signed
the petition&#151;or the Members of Parliament and councillors who
represent those people and all opposed the strategic health
authority&#146;s
proposal.</p><p><a name="06051065000273">The Minister
values the work of the Health Committee, on which I am privileged to
serve. She knows that it recently conducted an inquiry on the
reorganisation of primary care trusts. Our report found that
consultation was woefully inadequate, mainly because of the top-down
nature of the process, which imposed change, even when it overrode the
needs of local communities, to make financial savings.</p><p><a name="06051065000274">I say to my hon. Friends that
that is what the issue is all about. It has nothing to do with best
practice. The argument, accepted four years ago, is even stronger
today.</p><p><a name="06051065000275">I end by saying
that I had the pleasure of visiting, with a number of my hon. Friends,
the Southend cancer centre at Southend hospital on 31 March. We were
absolutely in awe of the quality of the services; the centre is meeting
not only its targets for breast and cervical screening, but the
national cancer waiting times: 100 per cent. of its patients receive
their first appointment within two weeks and their first treatment 31
days after the decision to treat. I know that the Minister, when she
replies to the debate, will congratulate the hard-working staff on
their achievements.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 117WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000276">Waiting times and clinical
targets are, however, only half the story of cancer treatment.
Macmillan Cancer Relief has been making the case for a more
comprehensive cancer plan than the one that the Government launched in
2000. The plan would provide for vital supportive and palliative
aspects of cancer care as well as diagnosis and treatment. The
additional investment in specialist palliative care at Southend cancer
centre is already making a difference in that area, along with an
agreed framework for implementing the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence guidance on supportive and palliative care and for
establishing a network user partnership group and a network patient
information project.</p>

<p><a name="06051065000277">I
could go on, but I hope that my hon. Friends will catch your eye, Mr.
Atkinson. I ask the Minister again to consider very carefully the
arguments that she is hearing this afternoon and to reflect again on
the advice that she appears to be receiving at the
moment.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000493">3.6
pm</h5><p><a name="06051065000278"><b><a name="06051065000551">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) on making
a very measured, well thought out contribution and on leading the drive
to save the cancer centre in south Essex. He has done a wonderful job
and shown that he has a lot of energy. Whether or not he is successful
is no measure of his abilities and potential in this
place.</p><p><a name="06051065000279">I declare an
interest: my son is a neurosurgeon who practises in London, and often
in south Essex, treating cancers and such like, and he will do so in
the future.</p><p><a name="06051065000280">South
Essex cancer service is an excellent clinical network. I am a
Conservative because I believe in cherishing what is good. That is why
I am speaking in the debate and supporting my hon. Friend. At the start
of the process, the question should have been, will merging South Essex
cancer network with Mid Anglia cancer network help or hinder the
continued improvement that we have seen in the South Essex service? For
me as an MP, the question was, what will it mean for the people of
Castle Point, whom I have a duty to represent, and for my area of south
Essex? This is not mindless nimbyism. I have a duty to look after the
interests of my constituents, and if I do not no one else will. That is
why they send me to this place. I therefore hope that the Minister will
forgive me if I speak from the viewpoint of south Essex, rather than
the overall viewpoint. It is her duty to look after that, and I know
she does so
carefully.</p><p><a name="06051065000281">What is
wrong with our cancer service that requires it to be merged with Mid
Anglia and what benefits will we get in return for the merger? What
benefits will we get to match the costs and risks of that change? Let
me set out some facts about what we are achieving in south Essex.
Merging with the relatively not-so-high-achieving Mid Anglia will, some
claim, weaken the South Essex cancer network and the service that it is
able to provide for our constituents. Merging will certainly disrupt
its excellent progress, although I accept that Mid Anglia has many good
points and I am sure that excellent staff work in that service, too. I 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 118WH</b><br></br>would not in any way bad-mouth them. It must be said, however, that
South Essex is reputed to be one of the best services in the country,
notwithstanding its smaller size. In fact, its success might be a
result of its size; we certainly have no evidence to convince us
otherwise.</p><p><a name="06051065000282">There are
excellent staff at all levels at South Essex, and I pay tribute to
them. They are hard working, dedicated, professional and very caring
people, as I am sure the staff are at Mid Anglia cancer
network.</p><p><a name="06051065000283">South Essex
is meeting national targets for screening, particularly for breast
cancer and cervical cancer,as my hon. Friend the Member for
Southend, West (Mr. Amess), whose speech I am delighted to follow,
pointed out. However, we need dramatically to improve our screening in
those areas and to continue to make advances. We are cutting waiting
times from diagnosis to treatment, which is one of the most important
factors in achieving successful outcomes. We need to make dramatic
improvements, and we are doing that in south Essex, but those
improvements might be jeopardised by the change and disruption of the
merger.</p><p><a name="06051065000284">Our patient
outcomes are improving and are now much better than those in many
cancer centres in the UK; they are said to be better than those in the
mid-Anglia area. We have extremely good financial controls, management
and peer reviews, and, added to all that, the convenience of access to
a local service. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend,
East pointed out, at length, the natural flow of movement in the health
economy, which is east to west&#151;certainly not north to south.
There are good reasons for that, not least the infrastructure and the
difficulty that people have travelling north to
south.</p><p><a name="06051065000285">Those who were
consulted in my area said that the merger plan was against the best
interests of patients in south Essex and the excellent staff who work
in that area. It certainly lacks clarity of purpose and any detail
about defined, discernible, demonstrable benefits, or even a set of
properly laid-out costs. It also lacks any schedule as to how those
changes are to be achieved, and detail on what the timing and costs
will be. I shall return to that point in a
moment.</p><p><a name="06051065000286">If we put all
those considerations together, we see why the objection to the merger
was both hostile and comprehensive, certainly in south Essex, if not
the north of the county. The objectors included most of the relevant
bodies of opinion, including the south Essex MPs&#151;we have ample
evidence of their interest this afternoon. Many excellent councillors
and good councils supported our stand on this, as did the hospitals,
patient groups, South Essex cancer network and, probably most
importantly, the public. Their support is demonstrated in the
petitions. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend,
East, that was not my first petition. The media certainly support our
side of the argument on behalf of the public.</p><p><a name="06051065000287">The anecdotal evidence confirms
that the public are very much on our side. I spoke to around 1,000
people&#151;some of whom I questioned and some of whom questioned me
on this matter&#151;in the run-up to the recent local elections, and
they opposed the merger almost to a person. We have massive evidence
that the groups that should have been and were consulted strongly
oppose the merger. I hope that if we are to 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 119WH</b><br></br>push forward with the change&#151;if it is going to happen
anyway&#151;we are all proved wrong, but I do not have any evidence
to support that.</p><p><a name="06051065000288">I see
that the Minister is listening carefully. In a nutshell, it seems that
the merger will bring disadvantages, disruption and little demonstrable
benefit. It brings unquantified risk without proper weighing of the
costs and could set back the steady improvements that we have been
achieving in the South Essex cancer network. I accept that it could
accelerate improvements in the north, but that is not what I am here to
talk about. I am here to represent my constituents, and the Minister is
perfectly aware of
that.</p><p><a name="06051065000289">If the merger is
not handled well, it could impede the plans of South Essex and progress
on treatments and outcomes, cutting cancer waiting times, delivery on
top targets, improving patient information and care, and improving
services to the community. It might also affect links with primary care
networks, our excellent local GPs and the wonderful Macmillan nurse
network in south Essex, to which we all pay
tribute.</p><p><a name="06051065000290">The
Government and the SHA have failed to make any coherent or decisive
case for the merger, certainly to the public. That is largely due to
the consultation period of three months&#151;I believe that it ended
on 13 March&#151;which was said by some to be a sham. I am a moderate
man in my language, so one would not expect me to make that claim. The
public were angry about the consultation. They felt that they had been
steamrollered by the strategic health authority towards a decision that
had already been taken, and that there was an element of deceit and
pretence in the consultation. In some ways, I feel sorry for the SHA,
because it tried to proceed professionally and comprehensively. I do
not bad-mouth the SHA, but I heavily deprecate the Government. The SHA
was unfortunate, because its consultation was judged against the
backdrop of the recent consultation on the police mergers, which was a
sham. I say that even though I am careful with my
language.</p><p><a name="06051065000291">There was
evidence that views were not properly considered but simply cast aside.
It is easy for us in the south, who were against the merger, to say
that and to ignore those in the north, whose views are obviously valid
as well. The Minister has to make a balanced decision on that, and will
do. In any event, the consultation document was claimed to be a
shambles. A powerful letter from the patient and public involvement in
health forum for Basildon and Thurrock hospitals, addressed to the
Secretary of State and dated 3 April,
states:</p><a name="06051065000469"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
made it very clear to the SHA that we had concerns that the
documentation was not fair, honest, and was biased towards Bloomfield
Hospital Chelmsford&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000292">The
words</p><a name="06051065000470"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;not fair, honest,
and biased&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000293">were
underlined.</p><p><a name="06051065000294">The
results of the consultation&#151;although not clear, at least as far
as the south was concerned&#151;were taken by the SHA, which steamed
ahead in the opposite direction. It made few arguments, to me anyway,
for the benefits of change to the south and gave me little in the way
of estimates of costs. Those are not just the financial costs, but the
human costs, the operational 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 120WH</b><br></br>costs and the costs in terms of patient outcomes. The problem for the
SHA is that the Government have stopped listening to the people and the
people perceive that. The SHA is judged against that backdrop and in
the shadow the mistrust that the public hold for public bodies.
However, that is not the fault of the SHA; I lay the blame for that at
the Government&#146;s door.</p><p><a name="06051065000295">The merger proposal looks very
much like part of the Government&#146;s now not-so-secret
regionalisation agenda, which is hitting local democracy and removing
local accountability. Their agenda covers things as diverse as police,
planning, health, economic development and so much else. It is a Big
Brother agenda, the people have tumbled it and action will be taken at
the polls to reverse it.</p><p><a name="06051065000296">Experience shows that such
mergers typically cost much more than was anticipated at the outset.
They typically fail to deliver the anticipated benefits or
results&#151;not that I see net benefits for my constituents from the
merger in any event. Such mergers disrupt and set back progress towards
important delivery improvement targets. The plan must be carefully
controlled if it goes ahead and we should ensure that we achieve the
targets that we set out to achieve.</p><p><a name="06051065000297">The Government seem to be
obsessed with reorganisation for its own sake. Yet again, we see them
shuffling the deckchairs on the NHS deck. They should focus on tackling
improvements, such as removing postcode prescribing and making better
treatments and drugs available&#151;for example, temozolomide and
Gliadel implants for brain cancers and Herceptin for certain stages of
breast cancer&#151;as well as spreading the good practice that we see
in other countries.</p><p><a name="06051065000298">I
ask the Minister to rethink the proposal, even at this late stage. It
is never too late to accept that the case for merger has not been made,
as it certainly has not in this
example.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000494">3.19
pm</h5><p><a name="06051065000299"><b><a name="06051065000552">Mr.
Mark Francois (Rayleigh) (Con):</b> I commend my hon. Friend
the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) on
securing this debate and on introducing it so ably and comprehensively.
I also congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Castle Point (Bob
Spink) and for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on their contributions. I
understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)
may yet be hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson, so that he can have
a few minutes before the winding-up
speeches.</p><p><a name="06051065000300">It is a
pleasure to see on the Conservative Front Bench my hon. Friend the
Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), who will reply for our party. This
is very much an Essex production, from our
perspective.</p><p><a name="06051065000301">Some of
us have been around this loop before. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Rochford and Southend, East said in his introductory remarks, there was
a campaign several years ago when the Government unfortunately came up
with proposals to transfer some cancer operations away from Southend to
as far afield as Ipswich. They caused tremendous disquiet in south-east
Essex and local Members of Parliament chipped in and lobbied the cancer
tsar and Ministers. As we heard, the cancer tsar came to Southend and
considered the issue in detail. Importantly, as an 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 121WH</b><br></br>expert, as the Government&#146;s adviser on cancer, he decided to
leave well alone. He was not a politician but an expert on cancer. As a
result of his review, there was transfer of some local
operations&#151;just a few&#151;between Southend and Basildon
hospitals, but in essence the operations remained in south Essex and
the South Essex cancer network remained intact.</p><p><a name="06051065000302">The Government&#146;s adviser
on cancer came to Southend, looked at things on the ground, as they say
in modern parlance, and having done that, decided that it was best to
leave well alone. I suggest to the Minister in all
seriousness&#151;this is not a partisan point&#151;that that is a
very powerful consideration in this
context.</p><p><a name="06051065000303">There is no
debate about the quality of care for cancer patients at Southend. There
are various problems in the national health service. The Minister has
had many letters from me about problems with dentistry and, most
recently, clinical dental technicians&#151;I take the opportunity
briefly to remind her of them&#151;but no one is saying that there is
a problem with clinical outcomes at Southend. It is not as if the
service there is
deficient.</p><p><a name="06051065000304">Several of
us had a meeting with the medical director of the Essex strategic
health authority some weeks ago, and we pressed him repeatedly on this
point. We asked him to provide clinical evidence that there was
something wrong with the outcomes at Southend. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Rochford and Southend, East said, we have still had no
conclusive evidence from the Essex SHA or from anyone else that there
are poor outcomes at Southend that would necessitate a merger. We do
not believe that there is a compelling clinical rationale to undertake
the move. If there is, we genuinely are not aware of
it.</p><p><a name="06051065000305">Moreover, it is
important to note that the cancer tsar accepted the case for derogation
below the 1 million figure. As I said in an intervention, that
derogation was there from the start of the network. The matter was
considered when the network was set up, and it was considered again by
the cancer tsar a few years ago. Both times, the answer was that it was
all right at 750,000 for all the reasons that have already been given.
Now, suddenly, that is being overturned, and I do not believe that that
is wise.</p><p><a name="06051065000306">I too am a
moderate man, but I shall say it: the consultation was a complete sham.
In fact, because of the shape of my constituency, I have responded to
seven NHS consultations in the past few months. Briefly, they were on
proposals to merge the Essex SHA in a regional SHA, to abolish the
Essex ambulance trust and make it a regional ambulance trust, to reduce
the number of primary care trusts in Essex, to turn the two mental
health trusts in Essex into foundation trusts&#151;that I actually
support&#151;to relocate the non-cancer head and neck services to
Broomfield, and lastly, this one to abolish the South Essex cancer
network. For each of those seven consultations, the recommended option
was adopted&#151;every time. It is difficult indeed not to become
cynical about such exercises when it seems, particularly in the NHS,
that proposals are put out to consultation but the decisions have long
been taken. The Government go through a consultation exercise only
because it is a statutory requirement.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 122WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000307">That is even more galling
because the policy of the Department of Health is to encourage local
decision making, to push such decisions down to local level. I am sure
that we will hear that in the Minister&#146;s summing-up speech. If
the Government are going to do that, they should be consistent. If they
are putting decision making at the local level so that when things get
difficult Ministers can say, &#147;It wasn&#146;t my fault,
guv&#148;, the flip side is that they should listen to what local
people say.</p><p><a name="06051065000308">If there
is local consultation and 5,000 people sign the petition and the local
councils and many of the local medical professionals say, &#147;We
don&#146;t want this,&#148; that should be acknowledged. It is
pointless to go through sham consultations if local people are ignored.
I am afraid that that is exactly what has happened in this instance. If
I sound angry about it, it is because I am.</p><p><a name="06051065000309">We are worried about the thin
end of the wedge argument, and we are worried that whatever may be said
today, the issue will be revisited and reconsidered in a few
years&#146; time, a few more operations will be moved away, it will
be reconsidered again, and eventually the centre at Southend will be
under threat. We are not making it up, because the centre was under
threat some years ago. We are genuinely concerned about that, and it is
partly why we are taking part in this debate.</p><p><a name="06051065000310">I reiterate to the Minister
that the network was given a specific derogation below the 1 million
quota when it was set up. That derogation was reaffirmed by the
Government&#146;s own cancer tsar&#151;not someone from
Conservative central office, Labour party headquarters or the Liberal
Democrats. The Government&#146;s own cancer tsar considered it and
reaffirmed the 1 million derogation, which it is now proposed to
overturn. There is no compelling clinical evidence to back up that
decision; it is done simply for administrative convenience to fit in
with the figure of 1 million and make it neat. Local people were
consulted, they said that they did not want it, and they were
systematically ignored.</p><p><a name="06051065000311">I believe that the Minister is
a reasonable person. I have dealt with her before on other issues, and
I mean this genuinely: she is a reasonable Minister and she is
fair-minded. Not all her colleagues are, but she is. I make a genuine
plea to her to reconsider the matter. If she wanted me to sum up the
whole case, I would do it like this: Minister, it really ain&#146;t
broke down in Southend. Please, please don&#146;t fix
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000495">3.27

Brooks Newmark (Braintree) (Con):</b> I, too, congratulate my

as well as the proposed change. During the Opposition day debate on
cancer services, the Health Secretary said that the decision on the
future of cancer networks in Essex would be made locally. The emphasis
on &#147;locally&#148; is what interests me. Do not my hon. Friends

primary care trust has received a five-star rating for vital cancer
services such as cervical screening. However, it received that rating

impositions. It is not only acute and specialised services that are
important in effective treatment of cancer; the early detection and
easy access to primary services are essential, too. That is why I
emphasise that localism and local services are important.</p><p><a name="06051065000314">Although the consultation said
that the amalgamation would affect only a small number of complex
surgical cases, what guarantees do we have that routine services will
not be compromised by the proposed changes? Now that the Minister is in
front of me, I should like to make a quick aside. People in my
constituency are battling to secure the future of a new community
hospital in Braintree, yet the Government still make strategic changes
a priority over the improvement of basic local services. My
constituents want a community hospital, they have been promised one by
the Government, and they are still waiting for the Government to
support that.</p><p><a name="06051065000315">My
genuine concern is about meeting local needs. In a press release, I
read with interest that the strategic health authority on 29 March
said:</p><a name="06051065000471"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
board of Essex strategic health authority today agreed a recommendation
to create a new cancer
network&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000316">about

south-east, south-west, mid and north-east Essex. It was one of four
key decisions about cancer services made by board

release continues:</p><a name="06051065000473"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Speaking after the

local requirements. Local people want local services to meet local
requirements. They do not want a national diktat.</p><p><a name="06051065000319">I share the concern of my hon.
Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), who has said that cancer
survival rates in this country are worse than those in Albania. That is
a shocking statistic. While we must acknowledge that more people are
being diagnosed with cancer, waiting times for surgery and radiotherapy
have been getting longer. That is of tremendous concern to me. How will
the merger improve survival rates, diagnosis and early detection? Any
restructuring should ideally be about such things.</p><p><a name="06051065000320">I have always been supportive
of the Schumpeter principle that small is beautiful. On the proposed
merger of the cancer networks that co-ordinate treatment in south Essex

hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien), said that my hon.
Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East has made a cogent
case on behalf of south Essex MPs about the cancer network and the
appropriate size of the South Essex cancer care centre, considering
local conditions. He added that he hoped that people at both national
and local decision-making levels have taken due account of that strong
and well made case. In that context, I find it difficult to understand
why the Government are pursuing a merger that is unpopular, unnecessary
and likely to be ineffective in meeting local patients&#146;
needs.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000496">3.32
pm</h5><p><a name="06051065000323"><b><a name="06051065000554">John
Pugh (Southport) (LD):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for
Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge) on securing the debate
and on having introduced it in a reasoned and sensible
fashion.</p><p><a name="06051065000324">I labour
under the disadvantage of not being familiar with Essex&#146;s
facilities, geography or history. Therefore, I shall confine myself to
making some general remarks about cancer provision and the difficulties
of locating it. In my youth, cancer was considered to be a certain
death sentence and was discussed in hushed tones of horror. Now it is
seen as treatable, curable and liveable with. There is no secret to
that: there have been advances in knowledge, both scientific and among
the public, and there has been early screening and detection, more
sophisticated treatment and skilled intervention. For that reason,
people will travel far to exercise their right to the best clinical
outcome. The &#147;best&#148; often means the most specialised,
because such units, by and large, have the best outcomes.</p><p><a name="06051065000325">I shall draw a parallel with my
constituency, although it does not resemble Essex in any way. There is
sincere and justified outrage in it about accident and emergency
facilities not being available for children, but my constituents
travel, not with joy but with a degree of equanimity, to places such as
Clatterbridge hospital. They go through Liverpool, cross the Mersey and
through the Wirral because they know that Clatterbridge hospital has
specialised, effective and very skilled
treatment.</p><p><a name="06051065000326">The
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence argues that
centres of excellence should have catchment areas that contain about 1
million people, though I note in passing the remarks made about the
derogation; I assume that the Minister is in a position to respond to
that. When people come up against that fact they immediately come up
against two problems in any area. Where will the centres of excellence
be? What can be done to minimise travel for all
concerned?</p><p><a name="06051065000327">On the
&#147;where&#148;, everybody would ideally want the specialised
unit&#151;in fact, every such unit&#151;to be in their town. We
know that that is not possible, so a decision must be made. There have
been many complaints from the Members who represent Essex
constituencies about how the decision was made and the calibre of that
decision making. Such a decision should be made openly, in an unbiased
fashion and on agreed criteria. Although I accept what hon. Members
said about the strategic health authority&#146;s decision-making
process, I 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 125WH</b><br></br>note from its website that it publishes seemingly objective criteria,
and one can consider the outcome.</p><p><a name="06051065000328">I share the feeling about
consultation in the NHS. It is normally dire, formal and pretty
unproductive, and it normally results in what the authorities had
already thought of. Perhaps someone can clarify the matter, but I see
that one or two earlier options were dropped during the consultation
process. The website states that option this or option that were
considered during the informal process but were abandoned. It may have
led to the inevitable result, but it was not simply a rubber-stamping
process&#151;unless, of course, that was the initial
intention.</p><p><a name="06051065000329">We know
that the results of such a process will not be universally liked.
However, there should be a degree of professional and public support. I
am concerned that, as Essex Members have pointed out, the merger does
not seem to have professional support, any more than it has the support
of the public.</p><p><a name="06051065000330">In
areas other than Essex, such decisions are not so contentious, largely
because they have centres of clinical excellence with form and an
established reputation, and there are often clear candidates for
specialisms. Even then, conflicts can sometimes be caused by regional
loyalties. For instance, large centres of population or even centres of
excellence might be on the periphery of a region, which can create
additional travelling difficulties. In fact, change always creates
difficulties. People do not normally welcome change in their local
health facilities, and the matter is complicated if a degree of
political rivalry is added.</p><p><a name="06051065000331">The second problem that dogs
the idea of centres of excellence is that of travel. It is recognised
that although some treatments need to be undertaken in centres of
excellence, many do not. Out-patient appointments, diagnostic
processes, check-ups and even chemotherapy can take place elsewhere in
the clinical network, and somewhere nearer home. That is justified; it
is a serious attempt to minimise patient travel and the cost to
patients and relatives. Patients like their relatives to be with them,
because cancer is intrinsically an extremely stressful process, and
they need the support of the family and the wider community.</p><p><a name="06051065000332">Networks need to be designed
properly, and consultation is part of the process. It should be genuine
to get the fit absolutely right. Things can be blown apart if factors
other than clinical matters are taken into consideration, such as
administration or finance. I wonder how the Government&#146;s drive
for all NHS facilities to have a degree of financial independence and
autonomy will fit with the drive for effective and decent clinical
networks for cancer or for anything
else.</p><p><a name="06051065000333">The
Government&#146;s strategy is not wrong in principle, and the
Minister will, I am sure, say that we should be alert to the
commendable results in cancer treatment. I am not certain that they
have the template right for Essex. I can pass no judgment on that. I
have listened to what other hon. Members have said, but I am not in a
position to judge. However, it is possible to get it right with
adequate consultation and the adequate sharing of appropriate evidence.
My fear is that administrative, financial and other considerations may
prevent a good template from emerging for
Essex.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 126WH</b><br></br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000497">3.38

John Baron (Billericay) (Con):</b> I, too, congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James
Duddridge) on introducing the debate, on the comprehensive, thorough
and incisive way in which he introduced it, and on his campaign to
prevent the merger of the South Essex and Mid Anglia cancer networks. I
also commend him for his excellent and heartfelt contribution. I hope
that the Minister takes the time&#151;I shall ensure that she has the
time&#151;to answer the points that have been raised.</p><p><a name="06051065000335">We know that cancer networks
have played an important role in developing cancer services since their
inception 10 years ago, following the Calman Hine report commissioned
by the last Conservative Administration. The proposed merger is
important, as it would create a new organisation covering a population
of approximately 1.4 million. I am sure that the Minister is aware of
that. Although such a change relates primarily to the management and
administrative arrangements for planning cancer services, I hope that
from the heartfelt contributions to this debate that she appreciates
the real concern that the needs of south Essex will be overlooked by a
larger and more remote network. She should not take that concern
lightly.</p><p><a name="06051065000336">In Essex as
a whole we have had a spate of reorganisations of services, including
those relating to PCTs, SHAs, the ambulance service and cancer
networks. The common theme seems to have been a desire to create
ever-larger, more regional organisations. The concern for many people,
as expressed in the debate, is that those structures will become more
remote and less responsive to the needs of local residents. I do not
believe that that concern is fully appreciated by those making such
decisions.</p><p><a name="06051065000337">In my
constituency, for example, people were particularly vexed about the
proposal to scrap Essex police and our local PCTs, and we campaigned
accordingly. Given the importance of Southend hospital to the structure
of the South Essex cancer network, my hon. Friends are rightly
continuing to raise their concerns about the cancer reorganisation.
They have made the case against the merger in detail, but I want to
highlight one or two points in the hope that they will be addressed by
the Minister when she winds up.</p><p><a name="06051065000338">Will the Minister explain why a
merger of cancer networks is so vital in the east of England at this
time? As she heard from almost every contribution, South Essex cancer
network has a good reputation&#151;an excellent reputation, in
fact&#151;for planning and commissioning cancer services. Naturally,
there is confusion about why arrangements are now being thrown up in
the air. If the argument is about population size and the need for
networks to correspond to areas of between about 1 million
and2 million people, what does the Minister make of the
point&#151;made on several occasions&#151;that was conceded by the
cancer tsar Mike Richards four years ago when he said that due to its
age profile and areas of relative deprivation, the cancer case load in
south Essex at least makes up for the shortfall in
population?</p>

<p><b>10 May 2006 : Column 126WH</b>&#151;continued</p>



<p><a name="06051065000339">During
the past four years, the population in south Essex has probably grown
faster than most other areas, which raises the question of why we have
to tinker with 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 127WH</b><br></br>the current arrangement at all when it works so well. If the Minister
has formed a different opinion, perhaps she could explain to us on what
evidence she has done so because it is not clear to my hon. Friends why
that should be the case. They have made a powerful argument to keep
things as they
are.</p><p><a name="06051065000340">What is more, the
small population of the Mid Anglia cancer network seems to have been
brought about by the withdrawal of Ipswich, a decision taken by
Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire SHA. It seems somewhat unfair, to
put it mildly, that south Essex should effectively lose its cancer
network on account of a decision taken by a different health authority,
a point made by several of my hon. Friends.
</p><p><a name="06051065000341">Another concern is
that current patient flows do not argue in favour of an enlarged
network. Consultants in south Essex are not in the habit of referring
patients to centres further afield, and I have seen no evidence of any
sudden, recent, increased desire to do so. It simply does not exist. In
those cases where patients will have to travel further for treatment as
a result of the merger, what financial assistance is the Government
going to provide for their travel costs, given that cancer treatment
often involves a number of visits to hospitals or other centres? The
point has been raised before, but the Minister would do well to dwell
on it because, in some cases, we are talking about quite increased
distances of travel. That should receive urgent
consideration.</p><p><a name="06051065000342">There
is naturally a degree of confusion about the motivation for the change.
It appears that the SHA is putting a desire for administrative
neatness, and reorganisation for reorganisation&#146;s sake, over and
above the concerns of local people. I would reiterate one point to the
Minister. The consultation on the merger appears to have been
inadequate, lasting only a few months and ignoring strong opposition
from my hon. Friends, councillors, hospitals and many residents,
including the 5,000 who signed the petition. To many, it appears to
have been a sham, designed to give a veneer of credibility to a
decision that had already been made, without reference to
people&#146;s concerns. That comes on top of many other
consultations, such as those on primary care trusts, strategic health
authorities and police reorganisations, which have led to a growing
view that people&#146;s concerns are not
addressed.</p><p><a name="06051065000343"><b><a name="06051065000556">Mr.
Francois:</b> Just
ignored.</p><p><a name="06051065000344"><b><a name="06051065000557">Mr.
Baron:</b> As my hon. Friend says, the feeling is that
residents&#146; concerns are
ignored.</p><p><a name="06051065000345">As I
mentioned, in my part of the county people were particularly vexed at
the thought of losing their local PCTs. However, despite the concerns
expressed by those PCTs, the local MPs&#151;both Labour and
Tory&#151;and many residents, our views were ignored and the original
proposal, chosen prior to the consultation, was taken up. Such fig-leaf
consultations have sorely tested the patience of people in south Essex.
The consultation that we are concerned with in this debate seems to be
yet another example of
that.</p><p><a name="06051065000346">The SHA does not
even have the support of the South Essex cancer network for the
proposal. The network has argued that a merger runs the risk of
compromising the clinical cohesiveness and ownership 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 128WH</b><br></br>in the region. Much progress has been made recently on implementing the
national cancer plan and improving services in the community. The
network is understandably wary of accommodating the challenges and
difficulties of the Mid Anglia cancer network because the people who
will suffer if it goes wrong will be the patients.</p><p><a name="06051065000347">I would welcome the
Minister&#146;s explanation of why the merger is going ahead. She
will notice that I have given her additional time to respond, in the
hope that she will be generous, both in dealing with the concerns
raised by my hon. Friends, and in taking their
interventions.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000498">3.46
pm</h5><p><a name="06051065000348"><b><a name="06051065000558">The
Minister of State, Department of Health(Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I add my congratulations to those that have
been offered to the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James
Duddridge) on securing the debate. As hon. Members said, he put his
case eloquently on behalf of his constituents. There were some
extremely relevant contributions, including the remarks of the hon.
Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) about the excellent work of the
hospice movement.</p><p><a name="06051065000349">The
hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) talked about the success of
staff in his area in meeting targets. I, too, want to thank and
congratulate the dedicated and committed staff in the area, who have
achieved massive changes to mortality rates, among other things, thanks
to extra investment, which has led to increased staffing. Of course,
increased investment is nothing without strong input from the staff and
a willingness to embrace some of the changes.</p><p><a name="06051065000350">I want to respond to several
issues that were raised by, for example, the hon. Member for Rayleigh
(Mr. Francois), particularly with respect to the comments made by Mike
Richards, and the evidence on some of the changes that have been made.
The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) asked how the changes would
fit with other services. I hope to touch on that too. The hon. Member
for Southport (John Pugh) acknowledged that specialist treatment is an
important consideration in the wider debate, and talked about how to
deal with the fact that not every service can be available in every
hospital. Those are some of the issues that we must grasp. The hon.
Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) spoke from the Front Bench about
travel costs&#151;I shall refer to that&#151;and about the point
that was made by Mike Richards.</p><p><a name="06051065000351">As I said, we approach the
subject against a background of improvements in the treatment of
cancer. That is clear when we consider the situation in Essex, where
there is an increased number of cancer consultants, diagnostic
radiography staff and therapeutic radiography staff. That has made real
changes to the way in which cancer care is delivered. However, it is
also important to recognise that many of the improvements took place
because of the establishment of cancer networks, which started a number
of years ago.</p><p><a name="06051065000352">We have
to be absolutely clear what we are talking about when we consider
cancer networks. They are about professionals, patient representatives
and other organisations, perhaps from the voluntary sector&#151;
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 129WH</b><br></br>hon. Members referred to the work of Macmillan nurses in their
areas&#151;getting together and considering how services can best be
delivered over a whole area. It is important that we take note of how
that local delivery is considered to be best shaped. In my area, there
are often intense arguments about whether a service should be moved
from one trust to another, and local people often deeply resent
services being changed, but we also have to recognise&#151;this is a
crucial part of the debate, and a number of hon. Members raised the
point&#151;the evidence on whether the population coverage for
specialist treatments and centres makes a difference.</p><p><a name="06051065000353">I challenge many of the
assertions made by Opposition Members about there being no evidence.
There is evidence from the improved outcomes guidance and other
national guidance which shows that when it comes to treating some
specialist cancers, it is important to have a larger population. We are
talking not about just providing a convenient service, but about saving
lives. The evidence is very clear: it is obvious that if people,
particularly consultants, do not see a certain number of patients every
year with those specialist cancers, they cannot be expected to have as
great an expertise in them. There is very clear evidence, and we should
accept that.</p><p><a name="06051065000354">Hon.
Members talked about south Essex and their constituents, but it is
important that we think wider than that, because Members of Parliament
have a responsibility for all members of the public, who are all
possible patients, and who may be affected by decisions that we
make.</p><p><a name="06051065000355"><b><a name="06051065000559">James
Duddridge:</b> I agree that there is a case for saying that
bigger is better for some very specialist cancers. There is some
evidence for that, in terms of evaluating specifically upper GI,
gynaecological, urological and head and neck cancers. I know that there
is a debate about those. However, we are saying that absolutely no
evidence has been put before us to show a statistical correlation
between larger cancer networks and better clinical outcomes. We are
talking about network sizes, not specific cancers. Those specific
cancers relate to only 20 or 30 people; we are talking about 3,500
people who are affected in south
Essex.</p><p><a name="06051065000356"><b><a name="06051065000560">Ms
Winterton:</b> But we are talking about the ability of a
network to plan for a specific population base, and that is where the
statistics and the evidence come into it. I absolutely understand what
the hon. Gentleman says about Southend cancer centre, and this is no
slur at all on its ability&#151;I will come to that&#151;but we are
talking about the ability of a wider cancer network to make
plans.</p><p><a name="06051065000357">I will not go
into great detail on the reason for the consultation, because that has
already been stated&#151;it is the withdrawal of east Suffolk from
the Mid Anglia cancer network. However, I want to address some of 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 130WH</b><br></br>the points that were made. It is worth noting that all other clinical
networks in Essex&#151;cardiac, neonatal, critical care, pathology
and neurosciences&#151;are configured on an Essex-wide basis. That is
important in terms not only of achieving outcomes, but of providing a
stable foundation for those who enter the medical profession. For
example, it is important that networks can provide a proper population
base and a high level of expertise to ensure that consultants who want
to specialise in a chosen field develop professionally.</p><p><a name="06051065000358">I also want to give some
reassurance. Essex SHA is not planning to close the cancer centre in
Southend. Indeed, the position is quite the opposite, and the SHA is
committed to supporting a thriving cancer centre in Southend. That
includes the provision of out-patient care, diagnostic tests,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, palliative care and some specialist
surgery. The only services to be moved from Southend to Chelmsford will
be those for people with head and neck cancers. That move has the
overwhelming support of senior clinical staff and will affect
approximately 20 to 30 people a year in Southend. It will mean that
patients who must have surgery for those less common cancers will have
access under one roof to consultants and surgeons who are experts in
oral and maxillofacial surgery, ear, nose and throat, and plastic
surgery. Ultimately, it makes sense for those services to be together,
because those cancers might require other treatments, such as plastic
surgery. There is also the question of whether people will have to
travel and whether their expenses would be covered. That is addressed
by the hospital costs travel scheme, and people below a certain income
level would qualify for that. Those are the only changes that will be
made.</p><p><a name="06051065000359">It is important
to stress that there are no plans to downgrade services at Southend
hospital. Indeed, as many hon. Members said, services have increased,
and the hospital is now a cancer centre for south Essex, providing
neurological and gynaecological cancer surgery services. Yesterday, I
met Dr. Paul Watson, the medical director of Essex SHA, who assured me
that there are no plans to reduce any other services currently offered
at Southend hospital, and I understand that he has said that
publicly.</p><p><a name="06051065000360">Finally,
the issue of Mike Richards&#146;s last visit to the area was raised.
There was no derogation that he would have given in those
circumstances, although he obviously gave some advice. I shall not ask
him to overturn a decision that has been made on very reasonable
grounds, and I stress again that we are talking about saving lives in
many instances. However, I shall ask him to look at the operational
framework, which is due to be introduced in October, so that we can
reassure hon. Members that the changes have fitted in exactly with what
I have said.</p><p><a name="06051065000361">I hope
that that gives hon. Members some comfort. As I said, I am not asking
Mike Richards to overturn the decision, but I would like him to look at
the operational plans to ensure that the decision will improve services
in the local area, and I would like them to be reassured of
that.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 131WH</b><br></br><h3 align="center"><a name="06051065000004">Identity Card

cards would have done nothing to prevent the7 July bombings
last year in London.</p><p><a name="06051065000365">Today I would like to focus on
another cause of concern, which is the cost of the ID card scheme. The
debate is set against the backdrop of a six-month countdown that
started when the Bill received Royal Assent, and as each day passes
until 30 September we come closer to the date on which the Government
will have to reveal to Parliament the estimated likely cost of the
identity card scheme over the next 10 years. How that will work in
practice with 30 September falling on a Saturday during recess, I am
yet to discover, but I am sure that many of my party colleagues are
looking forward to receiving the report. It will hopefully contain more
information about the cost of the scheme and with any luck we might get
some information from the Minister
today.</p><p><a name="06051065000366">Back in 2002
initial Government proposals suggested that an entitlement card scheme
would cost &#163;1.3 billion over a period of 13 years, which would
include the three years that it would take to set up the necessary
systems and the 10 years in which the first cards would be valid. In
November 2003, the then Home Secretary made a statement in the House in
which he stated that the cost of an ID card would be &#163;35. That
changed again and by April 2005 the Government estimated that the cost
of an ID card would be &#163;15 with a fee of &#163;85 for a joint
passport and ID card application. However, that figure changed once
again after the Identity Cards Bill was introduced after the general
election a year ago.</p><p><a name="06051065000367">The previous Minister, now
Minister of State in the Department of Health, the hon. Member for
Leigh (Andy Burnham), stated in the Identity Cards Bill debate on 13
February that the cost of a stand-alone ID card would be &#163;30 and
the cost of a biometric passport &#163;63, so the combined cost would
be &#163;93. It could be argued that the number is only valid for the
first year of the scheme, which will not be up and running until
2009.</p><p><a name="06051065000368"><b><a name="06051065000562">Mark

problem is compounded in rural areas? In Wales, four facilities to
renew passports have been announced. From October, the renewal of those
passports will involve the collection of personal data. There are four
new passport offices in an incredibly rural area and the cost to
individual householders will be far greater than the cost of the
application.</p><p><a name="06051065000372"><b><a name="06051065000566">Jo
Swinson:</b> Absolutely. My hon. Friend is right to mention
the additional travel costs that individuals will face when they go to
have their details processed. For many people, those costs might end up
well in excess of &#163;93. In addition, how can we be certain that
the cost will remain at &#163;93, given that it has already escalated
on several occasions?</p><p><a name="06051065000373">My hon. Friend the Member for
Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) questioned the Home Office on how
much money had been spent on the Government&#146;s ID card scheme
from April 2003 to December 2005. He was informed that &#163;32
million had already been spent by the Government on the scheme before
the legislation was passed by Parliament.</p><p><a name="06051065000374">The former Home Secretary made
the House aware that a small contribution from public funds would be
required towards the running costs of the scheme. However, we have
never had much clarity on the interpretation of &#147;a small
contribution&#148;. That is a rather ambiguous phrase, and it leaves
a great deal to changes in circumstances and the patterns of take-up of
the card. Now that ID cards are on the way, I ask the Minister whether
the Home Office has any firm figures so that we can be aware of how
much this small contribution from public funds might be.</p><p><a name="06051065000375">The Government have
consistently refused to publish their estimate of the set-up costs of
the database design of the national identity register. They argue that
that might jeopardise the procurement of the contracts for the
database. The London School of Economics has tried its best to make up
for the Government&#146;s lack of clarity with several extensively
researched reports published in the past 12 months, most recently a
report on the Home Office accounting of the ID cards scheme in March.
The previous Home Office Minister, the hon. Member for Leigh, in his
best defence of the Government, suggested that the LSE figures for the
ID card scheme were designed to confuse and frighten people. A lack of
any financial preparation for the national identity register is far
more confusing and frightening for the taxpayer when no estimates are
being put forward by the
Government.</p><p><a name="06051065000376"><b><a name="06051065000567">Mark
Hunter (Cheadle) (LD):</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that
given the Government&#146;s lamentable record to date in delivering
IT infrastructure projects on budget and on time, they would have been
better advised to spend the millions and millions of pounds that the ID
card scheme will now cost us on improving police presence on our
streets?</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 133WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000377"><b><a name="06051065000568">Jo
Swinson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. I will
return later in my speech to the issue of the Government&#146;s
handling of IT systems and their ability to deliver. I accept that
there are many projects that taxpayers&#146; money could be better
spent on&#151;regardless of whether the amount is &#163;3 billion
or &#163;5 billion, or &#163;10 billion or &#163;19
billion.</p><p><a name="06051065000378">For clarity,
let me remind Members of the supposed aims of the ID card scheme
according to the Home Office regulatory impact assessment which it
published in November 2004: to reduce illegal migration and illegal
working; to enhance the UK&#146;s capability to counter terrorism and
serious and organised crime; to reduce identity fraud; and to implement
a more efficient and effective delivery of public services. On all
these points the Government are weak in both clarity and their
hoped-for delivery. After last July, the terrorist attacks blew out of
the water the suggestion that the counter-terrorism side of the
card&#146;s purpose would be effective. The country is all too aware
that a piece of plastic will not act as a deterrent or as a tool
against terrorism. There is strong evidence that terrorists do not hide
their identity. The release of the foreign national prisoners which
unseated the former Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Norwich,
South (Mr. Clarke), also suggests that an ID card scheme would not have
helped. The problem was not the identity of most of the foreign
prisoners; the immigration and nationality directorate and the Prison
Service knew the identity of most of them. The problems arose because
the two parts of the Home Office were not communicating with each
other. That poses a lot of questions, and does not bode well for the
national identity register.</p><p><a name="06051065000379">The Home Office&#146;s
current estimate of the cost of introducing and implementing the
biometric passport and ID card scheme is &#163;584 million each year
for the next 10 years; the total cost of that is &#163;5.8 billion.
However, that figure does not provide a true picture of the total cost
of the ID card scheme. There are a variety of hidden costs in respect
of ID cards.</p><p><a name="06051065000380">The
Government have consistently refused to say how much the plans will
cost other Departments, despite several parliamentary questions on this
matter. I hope the Minister will enlighten us; if he is unable to do
so, perhaps he will undertake to consult his ministerial colleagues in
other Departments so that they can present to the House a realistic
estimate of the overall cost to the Government of implementing the
scheme, rather than simply the cost to the Home Office. If we do not
have the full, total figures, it is impossible for the people and the
taxpayers to make a realistic assessment of whether this is good value
for money.</p><p><a name="06051065000381">Some of the
hidden costs, other than the costs to other Departments, include the
cost of designing the database, which, as I have said, the Government
will not reveal. One would expect that it will be a complex and
technologically sophisticated database, and security measures will need
to be incredibly robust given the nature and the quantities of data
that will be stored on the database. Therefore, this is unlikely to be
a piece of software that comes cheaply. There is also the cost of the
scanners and the readers. Many problems have been reported in trials
with the accuracy of some of the reading equipment. That varies in
terms of the different types of biometrics used. People with 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 134WH</b><br></br>disabilities have reported problems with using some of the biometric
readers; for such cases, more than one type of scanning equipment may
be required at sites where the ID cards will be used.</p><p><a name="06051065000382">An individual card reader is
estimated to cost about &#163;275, and a card and fingerprint reader
about &#163;500. However, many people, such as manual labourers,
cannot use the fingerprint reader with great accuracy because their
fingers are often worn down. Facial scanners would cost &#163;750 and
iris scanners, which are the most accurate, are very costly at
&#163;3,500.</p><p><a name="06051065000383">The
aims of the project were about delivering better public services, but
if the costs I have mentioned are multiplied across the various
Government Departments, hospitals and police stations up and down the
country, they soon start to escalate, and the costs to other
Departments should be borne in
mind.</p><p><a name="06051065000384">I am also
concerned that some of the costs of the scheme are being concealed in
other budgets. A large part of the money being used for the scheme is
said to be going only towards the upgrade of the UK Passport Service,
as if all the biometric data were absolutely necessary for that. We
must scotch that myth. Under international regulations, all the
different forms of biometric data do not need to be stored on the
cards. Yes, we have to have facial recognition, but fingerprinting and
iris scanning are optional, not mandatory. No other country has as many
biometric details stored in their ID cards or passport systems; this
project is far more ambitious than the others, and the Government would
do well to rethink
it.</p><p><a name="06051065000385">We also have to
consider the cost of replacing the cards. Currently, it is estimated
that once every 10 years will be sufficient. However, biometric data
diminish over time; people&#146;s appearance changes and as time
passes, the scans&#151;particularly those for facial
recognition&#151;become less accurate. The operator of the national
fingerprint information system, Northrop Grumman, argues that cards may
need to be replaced as often as every three years; even if it were
necessary only every five years, that would significantly increase the
cost of the scheme and increase the figure of&#163;584
million a year.</p><p><a name="06051065000386">Taking
into account various of those factors, the London School of Economics
report estimates the true cost to be anywhere between &#163;10.6
billion and&#163;19.2 billion. Even at the optimistic end
of that range, the costs would be almost double those projected by the
Home Office.</p><p><a name="06051065000387">In
assessing the costs of such a scheme, it is also important to compare
them with any expected benefits. Given the Government&#146;s track
record on IT projects, already mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member
for Cheadle (Mark Hunter), such benefits may be dubious.
</p><p><a name="06051065000388">Hong Kong has a
widely praised ID card scheme. In the <i>Sunday Herald</i> of 28
November 2004, the consultant responsible for implementing it said of
the UK
scheme:</p><a name="06051065000477"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;&#145;Saying
you&#146;re going to introduce a nationwide identity card is easy.
Making it happen is a different matter...This would be the most
ambitious IT project in UK history, an enormously complex system
involving untried technologies, and success seems unlikely when you
consider the public sector&#146;s abysmal track record in this
area.&#146;&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051065000389">For
example, EDS was the company responsible for developing the tax credits
database. I am sure that in 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 135WH</b><br></br>the past few years, most Members have had contact with constituents who
have been on the receiving end of that flawed system because of
overpayments, underpayments or administrative failures. EDS has
negotiated a &#163;71.25 million settlement with Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs to compensate for the IT failures that have plagued
the system since its inception. Yet that very company has been awarded
another Government contract&#151;to revamp Ministry of Defence
systems. Unlike other contracts, which have been worth tens of millions
of pounds, that contract is worth &#163;4 billion. I hope that the
Minister will be able to assure me and the taxpayer, first, that the
national identity register contract will not necessarily cost that
much&#151;an estimate of how much he thinks it will cost would be
very much appreciated&#151;and secondly, that careful consideration
will take place before an IT contractor is chosen, particularly if a
company such as EDS is placing a bid.</p><p><a name="06051065000390">The Home Office&#146;s own
report shows that for other Government Departments to take up and
benefit from the ID card scheme, there will need to be high levels of
take-up. For example, the Department for Work and Pensions and Revenue
and Customs are unlikely to get large benefits until 80 per cent. of
the population are using the scheme. When does the Minister expect us
to reach a level of 80 per cent. take-up with a voluntary
scheme?</p><p><a name="06051065000391">In their
manifesto, the Government said that they would introduce a voluntary
scheme. We have had many debates on whether requiring people who have
passports to have ID cards complies with the assertion that it is a
voluntary scheme. I would argue that that represents a great degree of
compulsion. I still believe that 80 per cent. is a fairly optimistic
level to achieve in a short space of time. Although 80 per cent. of
people have
passports&#151;</p><p><a name="06051065000392"><b><a name="06051065000569">Mr.

something before she sits down. This matter is of great concern to my
constituents. I receive a lot of correspondence on this matter
supporting both sides of the case. It is unclear to me whether her
opposition to ID cards, such as I take it, is on a matter of principle
or practice. We have to accept that the relevant costs are variable and
will inevitably be imprecise at this stage, but is there a cost at
which the implementation of ID cards would be acceptable to
her?</p>

<p><a name="06051065000393"><b><a name="06051065000570">Jo
Swinson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
As a Liberal, I have a principled objection to ID cards. We do not need
the system, and no evidence has been presented to the House to suggest
that it is necessary. However, as the debate is about the cost of the
scheme, I have focused on those particular arguments.</p><p><a name="06051065000394">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point is well made. I am opposed to ID cards in principle, as are many
people. I am sure that some of his constituents have written to him
voicing that view. Hon. Members might know that there is a strong
campaign at renewforfreedom.org, which is encouraging people to renew
their passports before the ID cards database comes into effect. I 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 136WH</b><br></br>wonder whether the Minister thinks that that will have an impact on the
likely take-up of the scheme and, therefore, when the anticipated
benefits might be achieved by Government Departments.</p><p><a name="06051065000395">However, I am keen to press on.
The cost of the project has spiralled, and it has been characterised by
a complete lack of clarity about what it is intended to achieve. The
stated aim of the project has changed from anti-terrorism to tackling
benefit fraud, to making things easier for Government Departments, to
making it easier to prove one&#146;s identity without having to take
one&#146;s passport out with one, but we have not heard a strong
argument for introducing ID cards. The likely cost is incredibly
worrying, and we can expect it to increase further because not all
aspects of the scheme have been included in the projections. The scheme
offers poor value for money.</p><p><a name="06051065000396">I understand that the Treasury
has asked for an annual review of the scheme&#146;s cost. I hope that
the Minister will tell us when that review will be undertaken. Will it
be published in front of the House? If the costs escalate, on the
annual review basis, at what point would the Government reconsider the
merits of the scheme and review its implementation? Are they committed
to implementing ID cards no matter how high the costs and how small the
benefits?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000500">4.18
pm</h5><p><a name="06051065000397"><b><a name="06051065000571">The
Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> I hesitate to say this because the hon. Member
for East Dunbartonshire(Jo Swinson) has been in the House for
only a year and her reputation is strong and growing, but, with the
best will in the world, I have never listened to such
clich(c)-ridden tosh since the last time I heard a Liberal speak
on ID cards. That is a shame because there are serious and substantive
matters of practicality rather than principle that we now need to
consider. This is such an important debate, regardless of where one
started from in terms of the Bill, which means so much to the country,
that it demands slightly better than a clich(c)-ridden rehash of
the arguments of the past two or three years. I say that with real
regret.</p><p><a name="06051065000398">The hon. Lady
is wrong in so many instances that I am not sure that I could go
through them all in 10 or15 minutes, but let me start at the
beginning. She is wrong to suggest&#151;I do not want anyone to be
misled in this regard&#151;that somehow by 30 September, as a result
of amendments to the Bill accepted by the Government, there will be a
full and detailed cost breakdown of every single aspect of the project.
There will not. That was not the substance of the Lords amendment that
we quite rightly accepted, which was that we should report to the House
progress on the project, including costs, on a six-monthly basis. It is
entirely right and proper that the House should know such
things.</p><p><a name="06051065000399">I suspect that
the paucity of intellect in many of the hon. Lady&#146;s arguments
comes from a complete lack of understanding&#151;God knows, I do not
understand it entirely&#151;of how government works. The Liberals
seem to think that we have thought of a number and doubled it, and that
is the apparent cost of the ID cards. Whatever the Government, internal
governmental processes and accountability simply 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 137WH</b><br></br>would not allow that. She is quite right to quote the figure of
&#163;584 million; she is quite wrong to ascribe that in full or in
part to ID cards, with a little bolt-on for the new biometric passport
scheme. It was the other way around. We have said throughout that about
70 per cent.-plus of those costs are for the biometric passport.
</p><p><a name="06051065000400">I had a look, and
never have I found in this House&#151;admittedly before the hon. Lady
became a Member of the House&#151;any peep, any whisper from the
Liberal Democrats countering the introduction of biometric passports.
Nothing. By the bye, I did not find anything from the official
Opposition either. That is right and proper. The consensus was that we
must have a far more secure international travel document than we have
had hitherto.</p><p><a name="06051065000401">The
hon. Lady is right&#151;in a fourth-form sort of way&#151;to
suggest that what we are seeking goes far beyond international
requirements in international agreements. They require facial
recognition and fingerprints, but not the all-singing, all-dancing 13
biometrics that we suggest. That is not a critique of where we are
going with the project, because I guarantee her and the House that
everybody else internationally will get to where the UK is starting
from. It is not sufficient to suggest that somehow there is a flaw in
the entire project because we are going for an absolutely
copper-bottomed gold standard biometric system for passports and ID
cards. As far as I am aware, apart from the rumbling around the edges,
there is continuing support for a biometric passport.</p><p><a name="06051065000402">I accept in full the point made
by the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) about our network of
offices and application by interview. I appreciate that it will cause
difficulties in rural areas. It was discussed at length during the last
Committee sitting of the Bill and previously, but the interview is a
necessary part of obtaining a biometric passport, and those matters
must be overcome. By the bye, it was probably the most far-flung
Liberal Democrat, the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr.
Carmichael), who made that point, and given his constituency, he can
make it in far stronger terms than anyone else. It is an issue, there
are 70 offices, and we may need to consider mobile facilities and
others in more detail, and we have said that we will; but there is no
other way to capture people&#146;s biometrics, even for the first
phase for the new passport, other than through application by
interview. It is a fair point, and one that we are
addressing.</p><p><a name="06051065000403">On the
hon. Lady&#146;s points&#151;again, clich(c)d, I am
afraid&#151;about the trials thus far, there has not been in
substance a mock-up of every aspect of capturing people&#146;s
biometrics. She knows that; she has read the reports. They are, for the
individual, about physicality, ergonomics and all the other elements of
having one&#146;s biometrics captured; no more than that. The trials
did not use the tip-top, state-of-the-art biometric capture technology
that exists for passports and will exist when ID cards come in. One
cannot say from a series of tests about the ergonomics and physicality
of the process of having one&#146;s fingerprints, irises and
everything else captured, that the incumbent and subsequent flaws in
many aspects of it are due to flaws in the technology. One simply
cannot say that, and the hon. Ladyknows it.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 138WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000404">But let us return to cost, which
is what the debate is principally about. I cannot remember who said it,
but I agree, in response to the hon. Lady&#146;s question, that
saying we will introduce ID cards is easy, but making it happen is a
different matter. I agree with that in spades, given the complexity of
the project. However, it is not the case that we should simply think of
a number and double it. Nor is it the case&#151;there is a
fundamental flaw in the argument&#151;that all that money could be
spent on so many other things. Much of the set-up costs will already
need to be in place for the biometric passport system, with which
everyone broadly agrees. Beyond that, the only moneys available are, as
the hon. Lady correctly says, the &#163;30 fee for a stand-alone ID
card or the &#163;93 fee for the combination ID card and passport.
There is no other money.</p><p><a name="06051065000405">As I said earlier, unless the
hon. Lady is suggesting that we scrap the Bill and scrap any notion of
going forward with the ID card project, but keep in place the
&#163;30 per head and the &#163;93 per head&#151;she is clearly
not saying that&#151;then there is no additional pot of money for all
those mythical policemen, security services and others. It is a
complete and utter fallacy to suggest that there is, but that is what
has been said on countless leaflets&#151;during the general election,
before the Bill came to the House and subsequently. The net result in
Harrow was one Liberal Democrat councillor, which is one too many. None
the less, that flaw demeans the nature of public policy debate in the
House. There is no additional money, unless the hon. Lady is suggesting
that we should keep that little tax of &#163;30 or
&#163;93&#151;which is about &#163;30 more than is now charged
for passports&#151;and she clearly is not suggesting that.</p><p><a name="06051065000406">It is equally facile to
suggest&#151;as the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats did
at length&#151;that if we cannot come clean about the set-up costs,
we must be trying to hide something. That shows a fundamental lack of
understanding about basic public procurement, whether under a Labour or
Tory Government or anyone else.</p><p><a name="06051065000407">The hon. Lady wants a degree of
financial transparency and prudence, and a cost base that
works&#151;entirely praiseworthy ambitions&#151;but one cannot do
that by giving a blank cheque to all potential IT procurers without
exposing every aspect of the architecture of the database and the
commercial structure. It is easy to say that because the Government are
hiding behind commercial confidentiality, they must have something to
cover up. It is an interesting point, but a fourth-form one.</p><p><a name="06051065000408">The Government stand by the
regulatory impact assessment for the Bill and the costs therein. In
January 2006, the Office of Government Commerce carried out a gateway
zero review of the overall programme and we were advised that we can
proceed to the next stage. That internal process continues. There must
be rigour and probity. It is not in the Government&#146;s interests
for costs to spiral as the hon. Lady suggests. The review team has full
access to our business case for the setting up and the issuing of
cards, including on the anticipated use of the scheme in the public and
private sectors.</p><p><a name="06051065000409">What
the hon. Lady said about the durability of biometrics was entirely
wrong. What she said about Northrop Grumman happened in 2002. I freely
admit that the development of the technology improves by 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 139WH</b><br></br>leaps and bounds year after year. It is wrong to compare smartcards with
highly developed biometric cards.</p><p><a name="06051065000410">It is a canard to say
so&#151;I have said it myself of other projects&#151;but as and
when there is time, the Government and the public sector are getting
rather good at large IT projects. Invariably, past failures have been
the result of a big-bang instant roll-out&#151;rather like the
passports. That will not be the case for ID cards. We think that the
cost structure is robust. We are absolutely certain that the country
needs ID cards. I do not know when the next cost review will be
published, given that 30 September is the six-month deadline. Whether
we go for July or slip into October, once we are ready I will be more
than happy to discuss the review in detail with the hon.

Morden (Newport, East) (Lab):</b> I am grateful for the
opportunity to have this debate, and I thank my hon. Friend the
Minister for being here to respond. I make no excuses for being
parochial and talking about a hugely successful recycling scheme, which
is a model of best practice, based in my constituency. I ask my hon.
Friend to look at that scheme, which we can all learn from, and to
listen to points raised by community recycling
groups.</p><p><a name="06051065000414">In the race to
avoid being buried under a mountain of landfill, and facing hefty
penalties, local authorities are in danger of grasping at easy waste
options, often ignoring community enterprises such as Wastesavers in my
constituency, which offers cheaper, cleaner systems and added benefits
for the local area. It is relevant that we are discussing this matter
today. The waste strategy consultation closed just yesterday, and this
major national debate is one that normally enjoys significant
cross-party
agreement.</p><p><a name="06051065000415">We all
understand the need to reduce landfill, and to recycle and reuse our
precious resources. We all produce waste&#151;that is a fact. We
create 100 million tonnes of industrial, commercial and household waste
annually, and it is growing at a rate of 3 per cent. each year. The
Government have rightly introduced stringent targets backed up by a
punitive landfill tax that will increase by &#163;3 per tonne in
2005-06 and by at least &#163;3 per tonne in subsequent years to a
rate of&#163;35 per tonne by
2010.</p><p><a name="06051065000416">Newport city
council, which partly covers my constituency, has developed a highly
innovative partnership with a provider of waste services in the
area&#151;a community enterprise called Wastesavers, which handles
dry recycling and furniture. It isdifficult to ignore the
recent achievements of Newport Wastesavers. It provides the most
cost-effective recycling scheme in Wales, and arguably in the UK. With
the support of the council, it has scooped prizes at the resource
awards and the national recycling awards, and collected the prestigious
Marks and Spencer award for a community recycling project in
2005.</p><p><a name="06051065000417">Eighty per cent.
of households in Newport participate in recycling. The partnership
between the council and Wastesavers has resulted in Newport doing far
better than the Welsh average. It recycled or composted 27 per cent. of
total municipal waste last
year.</p><p><a name="06051065000418">With a sustained
partnership with the council and a determined and dedicated group of
people, Wastesavers has moved from humble foundations and now occupies
a purpose-built clean-stream resource recovery centre in my
constituency. It employs more than 50 people who provide kerbside
collection services for recyclable material and a furniture reuse
project that helps disadvantaged families in Newport. Operating since
1985, it takes pride in being a true recycler&#151;it does not do
waste but aims to make everything reuseable or recyclable in any way
possible. Over the years, it has innovated and expanded its range of
services in Newport, and in the process has 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 141WH</b><br></br>demonstrated that the community sector is capable of delivering economic
efficiencies as well as environmental
benefits.</p><p><a name="06051065000419">I visited
Wastesavers in Newport. What comes across is its enthusiasm and
professionalism, and most of all the simplicity of an operation that
achieves the lowest costs and highest participation rates that I have
come across. So what makes it
successful?</p><p><a name="06051065000420">First,
Wastesavers works in partnership with the council and the community.
The council took the radical and difficult decision to reduce
collection of traditional black-bag waste to a fortnightly service
while Wastesavers collected the recycling weekly. Therefore, recycling
became the default waste action. In areas where that system operates,
the rate of households participating has risen to a
staggering90 per cent. The model has been so successful that
it is being rolled out into more areas of Newport, and it has generated
much enthusiasm for recycling among the public, including those
residents who were sceptical when the fortnightly refuse collections
started.</p><p><a name="06051065000421">Secondly,
Wastesavers is efficient and therefore cheaper. Newport pays only
&#163;41 a tonne for recycling, which is only a few pounds higher
than its cost of landfill. I understand that charges in other
authorities are at least several times that cost, and anecdotally I
have heard of authorities being charged up to &#163;400 a tonne. The
&#163;41 rate is not subsidised by grants but is a reflection of the
true cost.</p><p><a name="06051065000422">Thirdly,
Wastesavers separates at source so that it can command higher returns.
Residents separate, wash and sort the materials themselves and put them
out in kerbside boxes. The result is clean, contaminant-free materials
for collection. Those valuable products command the highest prices from
customers who are prepared to pay for the highest-quality materials. I
used to live in an area where all recyclables were collected in green
bags and I often wondered how all that was recycled; did it not just
get all squashed together and mixed up? The answer seems to be that it
is squashed together and mixed up and much of it does not end up being
recycled. The high level of contamination of materials collected in
that way means that they have to be incinerated or sometimes they even
find their way into
landfill.</p><p><a name="06051065000423">Wastesavers
keeps things simple, investing in people, not machines. Clean, sorted
material comes in, because people sort it themselves, so the
Wastesavers depot has no need of big, expensive sorting machines. It
invests in training and developing its people and it provides
opportunities for the whole community, with employment possibilities
for people on probation and people with learning difficulties. Fifty
per cent. of people who come on placements become permanent employees,
and 80 per cent. of the employees were previously unemployed. That is a
testament to true social
enterprise.</p><p><a name="06051065000424"><b><a name="06051065000574">Philip
Davies (Shipley) (Con):</b> I congratulate the hon. Lady on
securing this important debate. Does she agree that the organisation to
which she is referring and ones such as the Bradford Area play
association and the Windhill community furniture store in my 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 142WH</b><br></br>constituency bring not only waste management and recycling
benefits&#151;that is important enough&#151;but community benefits,
which she is also mentioning? That is the crucial part of why such
organisations should be
supported.</p><p><a name="06051065000425"><b><a name="06051065000575">Jessica
Morden:</b> I agree and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. I congratulate him on the successful scheme in his
constituency&#151;may it go from strength to strength. I agree that
it is the community benefits that we get from such schemes that add
value. They are not just commercial operations; they are adding
something to the
community.</p><p><a name="06051065000426">Wastesavers
looks to the future and educates the next generation of recyclers. A
not-for-profit organisation, it runs fantastic educational programmes
on recycling, and the results are everywhere. Yesterday, pupils of
Llanmartin primary school visited me in the House of Commons and spoke
enthusiastically about their school recycling programme, which was
inspired by Wastesavers. Wastesavers provides a model of good practice
that is efficient, effective and
economic.</p><p><a name="06051065000427"><b><a name="06051065000576">Mr.
Michael Wills (North Swindon) (Lab):</b> I, too, congratulate
my hon. Friend on securing the debate. She is a powerful advocate for
both her constituency and the scheme. What advice would she give people
such as me, in my constituency? Swindon borough council has made
recycling a relatively low priority. We have only 0.24 recycling points
per 1,000 of population, compared with the national average of 0.41 per
cent. I am struck by the contrast between Swindon borough council and
Newport borough council, which seems to have played a very
entrepreneurial and constructive role. How would my hon. Friend advise
people such as me? I want Swindon to do better on recycling and to
follow the good practice that she is
outlining.</p><p><a name="06051065000428"><b><a name="06051065000577">Jessica
Morden:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that point. One
success of the Wastesavers scheme is the strong partnership that it has
had with a committed local authority. I am sorry to hear that he does
not have a successful recycling scheme in his area. I suggest that he
speak to Community Recycling Network UK, which I am sure can suggest a
way forward for him and his local
council.</p><p><a name="06051065000429">As I said,
just yesterday pupils of Llanmartin primary school visited me and
talked enthusiastically about their programme. The educational benefits
and the will of Wastesavers to do such work with the community are
great. Is it really simple to be so economic, effective and efficient?
It is, but what annoys Wastesavers and similar organisations
represented by Community Recycling Network UK is that the potential for
community enterprises to do even more seems to be slightly ignored in
planning for the
future.</p><p><a name="06051065000430"><b><a name="06051065000578">Mark
Williams (Ceredigion) (LD):</b> I share the optimism in the
hon. Lady&#146;s speech; I share also the frustration of some
community organisations. Does she agree that sometimes we have had
difficulties with the Environment Agency&#146;s interpretation of
licensing exemptions, particularly for small recycling schemes? In my
rural area, small community schemes find, for instance, a &#163;6,000
charge for a licence prohibitive of future recycling
work.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 143WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000431"><b><a name="06051065000579">Jessica
Morden:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I
think that Wastesavers is entitled to an exemption because the
materials are sorted at source&#151;residents sort the materials
themselves&#151;so perhaps one answer for the residents of Ceredigion
would be to consider that type of operation. I am sure that the
Minister will respond to the point and I thank the hon. Gentleman for
his intervention.</p><p><a name="06051065000432">Many
councils take a mechanical approach to recycling and, threatened by
rising targets and penalties, are willing to sign up to long-term
contracts for treating waste, sometimes for up to 30 years. Such
contracts are likely to involve thermal treatment, incineration or
anything that keeps waste out of landfill. Machine-based systems to
sort or treat waste are costly to install and can produce low-grade
recyclable materials or even destroy a valuable resource. Crucially, we
end up paying more for materials to be destroyed than we do to have
them recycled, with all the economic benefits that that brings to the
community and the environment. Something simple is being made
complicated and more
expensive.</p><p><a name="06051065000433">Committing
to a 30-year contract for incineration of up to 60 per cent. of waste
might solve a landfill problem for a local authority in the short term
but will prevent the expansion of the community recycling model, which
would add the social benefits and the ability to deal with the
long-term problem, as I have
outlined.</p><p><a name="06051065000434"><b><a name="06051065000580">Kerry
McCarthy (Bristol, East) (Lab):</b> Is my hon. Friend aware of
the work of the furniture re-use network, which has its national
headquarters in my constituency? It promotes the reuse of 1.5 million
items of furniture a year and does some incredibly good work throughout
the country. There are also local organisations in Bristol, such as the
SOFA project and Emmaus, which reuse more than 10,000 items a year,
most of which go to low-income households. Does my hon. Friend agree
that the issue is not just about environmental concerns but, as the
hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) said, about tackling social
exclusion? Such organisations have an important role to play in
that.</p><p><a name="06051065000435"><b><a name="06051065000581">Jessica
Morden:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. Wastesavers also has
a furniture recycling project that adds much to the community in
Newport, so I commend the projects that she has mentioned. We are
fundamentally ignoring the principles and the success demonstrated by
community recycling schemes such as Wastesavers, which have been run
throughout the country. Such schemes are rapidly increasing the tonnage
that they recycle and therefore reducing waste to landfill at the same
rate.</p><p><a name="06051065000436">Anecdotally,
some Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs officials have
indicated to the community recyclers that they believe that it would
only ever be possible to divert 40 per cent. of household waste to
recycling. However, Wastesavers and its colleagues in the community
recycling networks think that that is not an ambitious enough target.
They think that they can do a lot better and believe in striving
towards a state of zero waste. However, that takes time and will
require us to look at the issue from 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 144WH</b><br></br>the other side, creating a service designed around recycling, rather
than modifying the existing waste
services.</p><p><a name="06051065000437">In the short
term, it is vital that we do not hamper progress towards the goal of
reducing and recycling all waste by committing to very long-term
contracts that prevent the growth of other models. I look forward to
seeing the evidence and the outcomes of the waste strategy review,
which closed yesterday. In the meantime, I ask the Minister to take
note of the excellent alternative systems on offer&#151;perhaps by
visiting Wastesavers with me and meeting representatives of the
networks that support them, such as Community Recycling Network UK and
its Welsh counterpart Cylch. I also suggest that a comparative study be
commissioned to evaluate the wide variety of systems on offer, the
range of costs and the various social and environmental outcomes that
can be achieved. Without that information, we could find ourselves in
an expensive recycling
trap.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051065000502">4.43

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Mr. Ben Bradshaw):</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Newport, East (Jessica Morden) on securing this debate
and on her excellent speech. It is encouraging to see such a high level
of interest from all three major parties&#151;that is not always the
case in shorter Adjournment debates&#151;and all hon. Members who
have intervened have made important points.</p><p><a name="06051065000439">As my hon. Friend pointed out,
we have just finished a major public consultation on the review of our
waste strategy. In the renewed strategy, which we will publish later
this year, the Government are determined to see an enhanced role for
the community and voluntary sector. We have made considerable progress
in recent years, which all hon. Members recognised, although it has
been rather patchy, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr.
Wills) pointed out. We have trebled the amount of municipal waste that
we recycle or compost and we are on course to hit our targets. It is
not every Department that can say that about all its targets.</p><p><a name="06051065000440">That is partly the result of
the excellent work of local authorities, working in collaboration with
the private sector and the community and voluntary sector. It is also
the result of the work of our public, who are increasingly aware of the
importance of sustainable waste management; that subject is rising up
in the public consciousness. If people are asked in opinion polls, for
example, whether they think it is important to recycle, about 90 per
cent. say yes; but only about 45 to 50 per cent. recycle regularly. We
must close that gap. As my hon. Friend pointed out, one of the best
ways to do that is by providing a high-quality kerbside recycling
service for the public.</p><p><a name="06051065000441">Those services have increased
hugely in recent years and my hon. Friend has rightly&#151;not just
in this Adjournment debate but several times in DEFRA
questions&#151;drawn attention to the Wastesavers project in her
constituency of Newport, which, as she says, is a beacon for the rest
of the country. In partnership with the excellent local council and her
constituents, it has achieved a tremendous increase in the percentage
of recycling.</p><br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 145WH</b><br></br><p><a name="06051065000442">It is interesting that my hon.
Friend used a slightly different figure from the one that I have heard
cited previously for the cost per tonne achieved by Wastesavers in
Newport. Getting the cost down so low is an incredible achievement. She
will, I am sure, appreciate that part of the explanation is that the
organisation is community-based and that some of those involved are
volunteers. They work efficiently and well, but she is right to point
out that there are wide variations in the costs not only of recycling
and kerbside collection but of waste management by local authorities as
a whole.</p><p><a name="06051065000443">My hon.
Friend will be pleased to know that the Government are considering that
issue, not just as part of the review of our waste strategy but as a
result of the Gershon report in 2004, which identified potential for
considerable savings in our waste management and collection systems. We
should be interested in studying the experience of Wastesavers, which
one of my officials has already visited. I should be delighted to take
my hon. Friend up on her invitation; she can show me around. I am keen,
in the months ahead, following the closing of the consultation
yesterday, and before the publication of our renewed waste strategy, to
examine best practice and ensure that we get the strategy
right.</p>

<p><a name="06051065000444">We need to do
that&#151;my hon. Friend has, again, made the point
well&#151;because although we have made dramatic improvements in this
country in recent years we have an awful long way to go. We still use
landfill far too much. Landfill, as everyone recognises, is the least
environmentally friendly way of managing our waste. We need to get our
recycling and recovery levels up to those of continental Europe and our
landfill levels down.</p><p><a name="06051065000445"><b><a name="06051065000583">Kerry
McCarthy:</b> Is the Minister aware that one of the problems
of current landfill policy&#151;according to Bristol city council,
which, again, does not have a good record on recyling&#151;is that it
is more economically viable to recycle heavier objects? When I have
tried to encourage the council to recycle plastics, it has replied that
that is not cost-effective, because plastic does not weigh as
much.</p><p><a name="06051065000446"><b><a name="06051065000584">Mr.
Bradshaw:</b> My hon. Friend is right. It is depressing, when
some local authorities are as good as Newport and are doing so well on
recycling, that others, such as Bristol and Swindon, do so badly. There
is no excuse for it, and my hon. Friends may want to take a stark
warning back to their constituents and local authorities. Their
constituents will pay the price for poor performance on
recycling.</p><p><a name="06051065000447">As the
landfill tax escalator hits in as one of the major financial
incentives, council tax payers in Bristol and Swindon will pay the
price for the poor performance of their local authorities. In recent
years, the ratcheting up of the system has been made even more
effective by the introduction of the landfill allowance trading scheme,
which is rather like the emissions trading scheme, one of the
mechanisms used to deal with climate change. Local authorities that
perform badly can buy extra landfill allowance from other local
authorities, but, again, that will involve a 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 146WH</b><br></br>cost to council tax payers. It is not merely good for the environment to
recycle, reuse and compost; it is, in the long run, also cheaper for
council tax payers.</p><p><a name="06051065000448">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy) is right about the importance of
community recycling network schemes. I know of the headquarters in her
constituency, and in fact I met the chief executive, or whatever he
calls himself, fairly recently. He has had some very constructive
meetings with my officials to make sure that those schemes are not
forgotten in our consideration of our new waste strategy.</p><p><a name="06051065000449">My hon. Friend the Member for
Newport, East, is absolutely right to point to the perverse incentives
in our waste policy under the weight-based system. That system
sometimes incentivises local authorities to collect heavy waste for
recycling, because that boosts their recycling rates, and waste that is
easy to collect. I shall give her a good example: hon. Members may have
noticed that recently many local authorities have rapidly expanded
their so-called green waste collections of garden waste. That has been
a very easy way for local authorities to increase their recycling
rates, but of course it is much easier for local authorities in leafy
suburbs and rural areas to do that than it is for local authorities in
some inner-city areas. There is a real problem with the incentives in
the current weight-based system, and we are actively considering that
as part of the waste
review.</p><p><a name="06051065000450">My hon. Friend
may also be interested to know that my officials are working with
Wastesavers in her constituency to look into how it achieves what it
does, and to get it to be an exemplar for other social and
community-based recycling and waste management organisations across the
country. That is because we want a lot more successful, social and
community-based, voluntary-based organisations involved in how we
manage our waste, for the very reason touched on by a number of hon.
Members: we are not just talking about a sensible, efficient and
environmentally friendly way of managing waste; the issue is also about
getting community action and community spiritedness on the whole issue
of managing waste.</p><p><a name="06051065000451">If
people based in, and coming from, the community are running such
organisations and providing the sort of opportunities to which my hon.
Friend referred&#151;opportunities for disadvantaged people, people
coming out of prison who want to rehabilitate themselves, people with
learning disabilities and so forth&#151;that is a fantastic
contribution that they can make. Also, people benefit enormously from
the sort of work that that involves, and as my hon. Friend rightly
says, it is often a stepping-stone by which they can re-enter the
full-time employment market, so it is a virtuous circle.</p><p><a name="06051065000452">We would like enterprises such
as Wastesavers in Newport to expand. There are examples of other bodies
that have expanded and gone to other places, but my understanding is
that Wastesavers is quite happy staying the size it is, and as a result
it has agreed to share its business plan with anyone who is interested.
My hon. Friend has already established herself in the House as a great
ambassador for sustainable waste management and for Wastesavers in her
constituency. May she go far afield, singing its praises and suggesting
that people in other parts of the country talk to Wastesavers&#151;a
process that we will certainly 
<br></br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 147WH</b><br></br>encourage&#151;to see whether they can replicate elsewhere its
wonderful practices in Newport.</p><p><a name="06051065000453">The hon. Member for Ceredigion
(Mark Williams) is absolutely right to say that in the past there have
been issues to do with prohibitive licence costs for composting and
recycling organisations. Community composting organisations raised that
with me very soon after I took on the waste brief, just under a year
ago. They were worried that they would be put out of business by some
of the new charges coming in. We shelved those charges, and over the
past 12 months we have undertaken a review of them. I am confident that
in the next few weeks we will come forward with a revised system that
will benefit the sorts of recycling and composting organisations to
which the hon. Gentleman referred, and that should be cheaper for the
Environment Agency. I am absolutely determined not to put barriers in
the way of those sorts of very sensible and effective community
organisations.</p><p><a name="06051065000454">I

retain that responsibility because I very much enjoyed seeing the waste
review through. There is huge and growing interest in the matter, as
the debate has illustrated, and it will be a huge environmental
challenge for the country. If we fail to get it right in the next few
years, not only will the environmental consequences be extremely
serious, because we will continue to produce methane through
landfill&#151;hon. Members know that it is one of the most damaging
greenhouse gases&#151;but the country and individual local
