 I am happy to agree to this adjournment in the special circumstances that we are needed elsewhere. I shall raise a point of order in the Chamber after questions to try to ensure that we have a system that does not put us all in the position of having to adjourn a debate that could more easily be postponed until the important statement is over. In the circumstances, I am happy to agree with the Government's motion.
