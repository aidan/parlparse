</p>



<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60328h01_spnew0"><b> Adam Afriyie  (Windsor)</b>  (Con): I am pleased to open a debate on a subject that affects millions of commuters throughout the country. The future of our rail services is vital not only to my constituents but to the constituents of many hon. Members. The train is the great connector. It connects workers to their offices, children to their schools and families to each other. After placing the railways in an historical context, I shall raise several matters of concern for my constituents, and conclude by asking the Minister some direct questions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">The world&#039;s first public railway was built in Britain on 23 May 1823. It was the Stockton and Darlington railway, and it received Royal Assent in that year. With railways came the promise of economic prosperity and the realisation that people could transport themselves to where jobs were without having to relocate. Trains supported the industrial revolution, transporting coal, manufactured goods and working people the length and breadth of Britain in record time. Naturally, safety became an important concern, especially when a Member of Parliament for Liverpool was fatally injured by Stephenson&#039;s Rocket, the first steam locomotive, in 1832.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">In the 1960s, the future of rail came into sharp focus with Dr. Beeching&#039;s drastic programme of reforms, which closed many lines and hundreds of stations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60328h01_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Those reforms closed 5,000 miles of track and 2,000 stations in this very month&#151;two years before the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) was born. The only passenger rail service in North-West Leicestershire&#151;Swannington and Leicester, which also carried coal to that city and was the third line after Stockton and Darlington and Liverpool and Manchester&#151;was lost as part of the Beeching cuts. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the lesson for the Minister from that period is that we have been fighting for the restoration of passenger services almost ever since, and that once lost, it is enormously difficult to restore such desperately needed services?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60328h01_spnew2"><b> Adam Afriyie </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a precise and good point. If people choose to change their behaviour, perhaps by taking a job elsewhere or by organising their lives differently, once they have done so, it is difficult to reopen lines because by the time closure is reconsidered, the demand has vanished.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">More recently, transport and the railways were placed at the heart of new Labour policy, when in 1997 the

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;there are not . . . far fewer journeys made by car&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">If that were not enough, he went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;It is a tall order, but I urge you to hold me to it.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">The reality is far from the fantastical ideal envisaged by the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">I quote again, this time from passengers, where
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;at the station, all the people were talking at once; they were telling the fat director what a bad railway it was&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">Of course, I quote from &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;, a seminal work by the Rev. W. Awdry. Hon. Members and users of the railway services recognise that the Government&#039;s railway ambitions were more like a children&#039;s story, given the reality of rail today. The Government have a strange logic when it comes to rail services. On the one hand, they demand that we give up our cars; on the other hand, in the Windsor and Thames Valley region in particular, they make it difficult for us to take the train.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">I shall move on to matters of concern to Windsor constituents. I have a letter written in August 2005 from Vivien of College crescent. She says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;I started work in London in February 2005 based on the fact that I could make my journey, door-to-door, in a journey time of approximately 75 minutes . . . I&#039;ve paid &#163;810 to park at Slough station.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">Commuters from Windsor need to get to Slough first in order to get to Paddington and central London. Her letter continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;This allows me to catch the fast trains to London Paddington and provides the shortest journey time.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">She points out that before December 2004, the journey time was 30 minutes on average, and that now, based on the new timetabling arrangements, it will be approximately 39 minutes. She concludes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;Additionally, I will certainly no longer feel that the current season ticket and the parking prices are acceptable to receive a slow stopping service into and from London.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">The point is clear. A small increase in journey times from areas such as Windsor, which are closer to London, will have a big impact on how commuters choose to travel. People have a choice. They can either drive their car, take the train or make some other arrangements. If one&#039;s journey time is 45 minutes door to door using the train and 55 minutes using the car, even a five or 10-minute delay to the train or a change in scheduling will almost certainly result in someone driving to work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">I have another letter, which is from the Windsor and Slough Passenger Association. Its members are representative of the hundreds of commuters throughout Windsor, and they raise several concerns. Overcrowding often means that commuters, many of whom may have health issues, are forced to stand for their entire journey. Even at my age I find it hard to stand for more than 30 or 45 minutes without some inconvenience. The Minister knows the train services we are talking about.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">A lack of ventilation and air conditioning means that passengers travel in conditions that are often worse than those for cattle going to market. In addition, working ticket machines are scarce, and ticket office opening hours are erratic to say the least. As if that were not bad enough, security at stations is often poor, with 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
inadequate staffing, and the elderly and the young often feel threatened either late at night or during less busy times of the day.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">The Windsor and Slough Passenger Association made the effort to respond to the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s consultation on rail franchises. In the association&#039;s response, it pointed out that the journey time from Windsor to Paddington was approximately 30 minutes before 2004, whereas after the implementation of the new franchise and its new timetabling and schedules, the journey times will increase to 39 minutes. It says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;This demonstrates a 30 per cent. deterioration overall and is evidence of a continual process of deceleration.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">Not exactly a ringing endorsement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">Sadly, although services have deteriorated by 30 per cent., passengers have not seen an equivalent decrease in fares. When taken together, all those factors erect sizable barriers to choosing to use the train.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">In conclusion, I have four direct questions for the Minister. First, does he acknowledge that a small increase in journey time for commuters closer to London will encourage them to use their cars? Secondly, how does he intend to supply enough parking spaces close to stations? Thirdly, what steps is he taking to improve the security of stations? Fourthly, is he confident that the Government will deliver on their promise to move millions of people from their cars to the railways? I am not so sure.

<a name="60328h01_time1"><h5>9.38 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60328h01_spnew3"><b> Mrs. Theresa May  (Maidenhead)</b>  (Con): It is a pleasure to attend an Adjournment debate under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. It is the first time that I have done so. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) on securing the debate, which is a matter of considerable concern to my constituents, who predominantly use Maidenhead and Twyford stations, and also use the branch line stations of Wargrave, Furze Platt and Cookham.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">I also congratulate the Minister. I attended an Adjournment debate last week in which no Labour Back Benchers were present&#151;there was only the Minister. At least this Minister has a Labour Back Bencher present, although whether he will take as a positive the presence of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) is an entirely different matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60328h01_spnew4"><b> David Taylor </b> : I can reassure the Minister. He knows of my admiration for him, and he has an outstanding invitation to visit the route of the national forest line, where we are trying to restore passenger rail services. It was created by George Stephenson, to whom the hon. Member for Windsor referred.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60328h01_spnew5"><b> Mrs. May </b> : I think that the Minister has received invitations from some of my constituents to go and wait on Maidenhead or Twyford station for the 7.27, to understand the impact that cutting that service will have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">In his intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor, the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire made the point that once services were 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 190WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
cut, it was very difficult to restore them, which is indeed the case. The sad fact for my constituents is that when Thames Trains was given the franchise for the local services, it increased the number of services and improved the services available to my constituents, but since the decision was taken to merge the franchise between Thames Trains and First Great Western, services have been cut year on year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">I have a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu about the debate, because I have been fighting cuts in services since December 2003, when it was first suggested that the timetable should be changed and there should be cuts as a result of the merged franchise. To that extent, I feel sorry for the Minister, because he has been saddled with the impact of the decision to merge the franchise, which was taken by the Government and by Richard Bowker when he was chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">I want to talk about issues that relate specifically to services for my constituency and I shall start with the timetable. We fought long and hard for a restoration of good fast services to Paddington from Maidenhead and Twyford, and my constituents were very pleased when changes were made to two services. The situation is a little complicated because both services leave at 7.27, although they go from two different stations. One train is the 7.27 from Twyford; the other is the 7.27 from Maidenhead. Extra carriages were put on the 7.27 from Twyford to accommodate the large numbers of people wanting to use that service, and a similar thing happened with the service from Maidenhead. That was a real victory for local passengers and commuters, whose voices were heard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">What will happen under the new timetable in December 2006? Those two trains, which are already overcrowded, will be scrapped and replaced by a single train. That means fewer spaces on the train for my constituents, and the service will be going later, which will cause my constituents considerable problems. Many of them will not get into Paddington early.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">One problem that we have with the approach taken by First Great Western and the Department for Transport on the timetable is the failure to understand two things. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor said, for people commuting from stations close to London, the time that the journey takes is crucial. On a good day, it takes someone who lives in Maidenhead about 45 minutes to drive to London in their car. If a train service is available that takes 20 or 25 minutes, they get on the train. If they are now told that their train service will take 35, 40 or 45 minutes, it is a toss-up, but they will probably get in the car, because the train is so overcrowded that it is unpleasant. The Department needs to understand the crucial importance of journey time for local commuters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">Secondly, the Department needs to recognise the importance that the services have for local people in enabling the economy of the Thames valley to thrive by allowing easy access into London. Obviously, many of my constituents boost the London economy by coming into London to work. Setting aside for a moment the impact on people&#039;s lives, which is crucial, cuts in services will also have a major impact on local businesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">My constituents are, rightly, up in arms about the proposals. They are not quite sure whether to blame First Great Western or the Department for Transport. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 191WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
First Great Western tells me clearly that the Department for Transport is responsible. However, the message that I am now getting from the Department for Transport is that perhaps the situation is not quite as easy as that and there are some issues to do with First Great Western. Frankly, for my constituents, in a sense it does not matter who is at fault. There is a problem that needs to be fixed. The ultimate decision lies with the Government, so my constituents will ultimately say that the Government have to fix the problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60328h01_spnew6"><b> Adam Afriyie </b> : The problems do not exist only in our neck of the woods, in the Thames valley region; they stretch much further. I have been in correspondence with my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey), who is sadly away on military training today and cannot participate in the debate. He points out that commuters living in Didcot face the loss of the 5.46 and 6.12 morning services and of the 5 and 5.18 evening services. They are at 80 per cent. of capacity, and the station is one of the 10 busiest stations on the First Great Western line, so my hon. Friend has similar concerns. People in other places are having to make similar judgments to those that have been described, so the problems that we are considering are widespread throughout the country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60328h01_spnew7"><b> Mrs. May </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention; he is absolutely right. Many of our hon. Friends cannot attend this Adjournment debate, but they are also affected by what we are discussing. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) presented a petition at the same time as I did in the House of Commons with the signatures of more than 900 of his constituents, who were concerned about cuts to local services. The petition that I presented contained more than 1,700 signatures, and we have now had well over 2,000 signatures from people who are against the proposed cuts. Similarly, my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson) has concerns about his local services being damaged, and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is concerned about the branch line through to Bourne End.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">We are talking about damaging changes to the timetable, which will have a significant impact on people throughout the country. I say to the Minister that for those of us with constituencies from which people commute to London and to which people commute from London to work, as is the case in Maidenhead, the Government need to take into account the time that that journey takes and the frequency of the service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">The Government also need to recognise that working life is no longer nine-to-five. My constituents do not aim to be in the office by 9 am; many of them, particularly those who commute to the City of London, have to be in the office by 8 or 8.30 am. Should Crossrail ever arrive, it may improve things, but in its absence, commuters have tube journeys to make after they get to Paddington. They do not leave the office at 5 pm; many leave at 6, 6.30 or 7 pm, or even later. The timetable needs to reflect the fact that working life today is not nine-to-five. Sadly, neither the Department nor First Great Western seems to have understood that.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 192WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">The time that journeys take is crucial. Fast services at peak times to Paddington from both Maidenhead and Twyford and from Paddington to Maidenhead and Twyford need to be reinstated in the timetable to accommodate the needs of my constituents.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60328h01_spnew8"><b> Adam Afriyie </b> : It strikes me that for people who live in the parts of the Thames valley region that are closer to London, five or 10 minutes one way or another make an enormous difference to their choice of travel. If, for example, someone has to consider child care, a 10-minute difference in arrival back home makes a huge difference to their life. However, someone who has a two-hour or two-and-a-half-hour journey into London is less likely to be susceptible to a small change in the timetable of five or 10 minutes. It would therefore make much more sense to have fast trains stopping perhaps in just two or three locations to pick up more local commuters to London.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60328h01_spnew9"><b> Mrs. May </b> : My hon. Friend is absolutely right and I am grateful to him, because he brings me to the next point that I wanted to discuss. There is a fundamental misunderstanding by those who are taking the decisions in the Department and at Network Rail&#151;which I also consider has some responsibility in this regard&#151;in that they are focusing on trying to improve the reliability and journey time of long-distance services, even though it is commuters on local services who are most affected by a change in journey time, who most care about that length of time and who are most likely to get out of the train and into their cars if their journey time is lengthened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">The crucial thing for my constituents is fast and semi-fast services at peak times. If we are to reinstate the decent services that we used to have with Thames Trains, the local services need to be allowed to go on the main fast line. The one thing that has caused most problems for my constituents and others is that, now, most of our services have to go on the slow line. That does not mean only that they take longer; they are often held up by slow, stopping trains. The Government&#039;s emphasis on long-distance services only is misplaced, partly because that contradicts other Government policies to try to get people out of their cars and on to public transport. That is the first key issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">The second issue relates to branch lines. We fought long and hard to ensure that the Henley branch line and the Marlow-Bourne End branch line were not included as community railways. I believe that if that were to happen, the services would deteriorate. They are part of the mainline service. They are commuter services. The Henley branch line runs from Twyford, Wargrave, Shiplake and Henley, but under the new timetable, for no accountable reason, a number of trains will run from Twyford to Henley without stopping at Wargrave and Shiplake. When I challenged First Great Western about that, its response was that the Department had asked it to run some trains on the branch line but did not say that they had to stop at the stations. For goodness sake, what is the purpose of running trains on a branch line if they do not stop at the stations to allow passengers to get on and off? Will the Minister consider the specific issue of stops at Wargrave and Shiplake stations? If the trains do not stop there, people will get in their cars to drive to the nearest station to access trains.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 193WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">It was interesting to see the table in the <i>Evening Standard</i> and other newspapers recently showing the most overcrowded trains on the rail network throughout the country. The 18.06 from Paddington to Maidenhead and Twyford was the sixth most overcrowded train in the country, despite the fact that the Government keep telling us they do not have any measurements for overcrowding and that no safety limits are set for the number of passengers allowed on trains, and that First Great Western keeps saying, &quot;No, no, no, we do not want overcrowding; we are doing everything we can to stop it.&quot; That is just one example. I have already mentioned the morning trains and how overcrowded they are. There are safety issues and the new timetable will exacerbate those safety issues by merging trains. Hundreds of people get on the early morning trains at Maidenhead and Twyford. In future, those hundreds of people will get on one train instead of two at around 7.27. There will be real safety issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">The key issue is that people&#039;s lives will be severely damaged as a result of the proposals. I already know of people who have had to change jobs because of the timetable. Henley further education college had to change its timetable for lectures to enable people to get there on time. The last timetable changes had an impact on the ability of my constituents to get to Henley on time. That FE college had to change its entire morning timetable to accommodate a change in the branch line timetable. Heaven alone knows what will happen if trains on the branch line do not stop at the stations en route to Henley.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">People have had to change their jobs and the FE college has had to change its timetable. People have been getting off the trains and into their cars because there are so many problems with the timetable. Businesses have come to my constituency because it is a good place to locate and has good transport connections, particularly to Paddington. I fear that if those connections go, the economy of my constituency will be affected. I urge the Minister to listen to those thousands of people who are telling him that the new timetable will cause a significant problem in their lives. They are fed up with the cuts in services during the past few years under this Government. We need those fast and semi-fast services and we need reinstatement of the sort of timetable that we had until recently and preferably the sort of timetable that we had under Thames Trains. We need our trains back on the main line. If a service is provided more people, not fewer, will use public transport. I urge the Minister to listen to the thousands of commuters whose voices are raised against him.

<p>
<a name="60328h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">I suppose that we are about half way through the 10-year transport plan and it is appropriate for us to ask whether that has been successful in the context of rail travel. The answer is a resounding no. That is a tragedy for our constituents, particularly people in places such as the one I represent who rely heavily on transport of one sort or another and would prefer to rely on public transport, particularly trains, but find increasingly that that is difficult.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60328h01_spnew11"><b> David Taylor </b> : The hon. Gentleman referred to the preference of many people for public transport. Ten years on, is he still attracted to the privatisation that his party pushed through&#151;he was not in this place at the time&#151;or, with the daily, weekly and monthly evidence, is he now as attracted to the idea of a publicly owned, publicly run national rail network as I and many Labour Back Benchers are?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60328h01_spnew12"><b> Dr. Murrison </b> : I think I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He makes a point that he knows full well I do not agree with. If I were to point to a success in public transport during the past few years since privatisation, I would say that volume of freight and people carried has increased. I would also point to the investment in public transport, particularly the railways. It is difficult to conceive how that increased volume might have been achieved given the economic circumstances prevailing at the time without the increased investment.

<p>
<a name="60328h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">In retrospect, we can all look for improvements in the way in which things might have been done and only an extremely foolish politician would stand here and say that everything went swimmingly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60328h01_spnew13"><b> Mrs. May </b> : As my hon. Friend is looking for examples of what happened under privatisation and the advantages following it, he might like to think about the changes at stations in the Thames valley. When Thames Trains took over the franchise, it provided improved services for my commuters at no cost to the Government because it did not require a subsidy. Under this Government, services have been cut during the past few years.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="60328h01_spnew14"><b> Dr. Murrison </b> : My right hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, which illustrates the point I was trying to make in response to the intervention from the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">My principle concerns are about my rural services. There have been cuts on First Great Western&#039;s Cardiff to Portsmouth line. I received a letter this morning from a constituent in the village of Dilton Marsh who is concerned about the effect of the new timetable on that community. There have been cuts to the mainline Paddington service which affect the town of Westbury and there is a proposal that the direct service from Bristol to London Waterloo, which stops at towns in west Wiltshire, should be removed. I know that the Minister is considering the invitation to tender. I have not yet heard his decision, but I hope that he has relied on the new figures that have been provided for him by the west Wiltshire rail users group. They seem to conflict starkly with those produced by his Department. He will recall that during our meeting we cast some doubt on the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 195WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
methodology used by the Department for Transport when compiling those figures. There were software problems and a number of other issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">Essentially, the west Wiltshire rail users group believes that the authorities have grossly underestimated passenger usage. I can tell the Minister that, from my personal observation, the figures on which his Department is relying are well wide of the mark. I hope that when making his determination he pays proper attention to the new data that have been gathered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">Although my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) believe that timetable changes particularly affect those who live close to London and commute, we must appreciate that connectivity is an important part of people&#039;s decisions to travel by train or use the convenience of their own car. I am not sure that the Minister has yet considered the importance of direct services, albeit stopping services, which the Bristol to London Waterloo service necessarily is because it stops at towns in west Wiltshire. It is important psychologically that people can latch on to a direct service that will take them all the way from their town in west Wiltshire to London Waterloo. That is important to them and if they have to change at Salisbury they will think twice, especially as that connection is sometimes unreliable. They will either not travel or they will take their car, with the obvious impact on road congestion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">I am concerned about a suggestion in the <i>Evening Standard</i> on 16 January that the Government were reducing services on rural lines to provide scope for investment on overcrowded services in the south-east. I am not sure about the veracity of that report. Generally speaking, I rely on what I read in the <i>Evening Standard, </i>but it would be useful to know what assessment the Minister made of that report and whether there was any truth in it, as it would be a great shame were that to happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">We know very well that the Department controls, in fairly minute detail, what happens on our train services. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire railed against privatisation. We must appreciate that the level of control that this Government have over the railways is extraordinary. Therefore, I suspect that to some extent his concerns about privatisation and the rustication of control of public transport have been assuaged somewhat by the Government&#039;s recent attempts to command and control the rail network. That being the case, the Minister must accept responsibility for what happens.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60328h01_spnew15"><b> David Taylor </b> : I was not necessarily railing against privatisation. I was trying to avoid the Government&#039;s being sidetracked into rural closures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60328h01_spnew16"><b> Dr. Murrison </b> : I am sorry, but I did not catch the hon. Gentleman&#039;s last point. I assume that it was a statement rather than something to which he wanted me to respond. I thought that he was railing against privatisation, so I am glad that he corrected the record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">My point is that we must recognise that Ministers control the rail network to an enormous extent and therefore must take responsibility. In making decisions&#151;some of which will be popular and some of

<br>&nbsp;<br>
which will not&#151;about invitations to tender and new franchises, I hope that the Minister will not try to foist responsibility on to train operating companies. The TOCs will say that the Department is to blame, and the Department has a tendency to say that it is all up to the TOCs to make decisions as to whether they can run a service commercially and so on, but given the extraordinary level of control that Ministers now have over everything that happens on the railway, that is disingenuous. My constituents will look to the Minister, not the TOC, to make a favourable decision on our service to London Waterloo.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">That is all that I wanted to say. Again, I thank the Minister for his courtesy in the meeting that we had a few days ago. I hope very much that he will pay close attention to the passenger data that the West Wiltshire rail users group presented to him at that time, and, in so doing, make the right decision for rail services in west Wiltshire.

Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) has done the House a service in initiating this debate on community rail, which is what I shall focus on this morning. I wish to direct the attention of the House and the Minister to the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">I do not believe that there will be any significant new road building in counties such as Oxfordshire in the next 10 to 20 years. There will not be any widening of the M40 motorway, although there may be some marginal improvements to the A34, which is the road from Oxford to Newbury. The county&#039;s road network will probably be the same in 10 or 20 years as it is now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">However, Oxfordshire is a fast-growing county. Banbury and Bicester, the two main towns in my constituency, are growing at an exponential rate. I suspect that Bicester is one of the fastest growing towns in the country. Planning permission was granted only last week for new housing estates in Banbury, and new estates have been proposed for Bicester. Oxford is now set to grow as well. That simply means more and more cars on the roads, and, given that there will be little extra road capacity, more and more congestion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">On Friday, it took me an hour to drive from Banbury to the county hall in Oxford&#151;an hour there and an hour back&#151;and that was not during the rush hour but in the middle of the day. As our roads get more and more congested, travelling time will increase. Yet within that equation, the local railways are under-utilised and undervalued. The two lines, one from Oxford to Banbury and one from Oxford to Bicester, have, in a sense, become branch lines. There used to be a line from Oxford to Stratford-upon-Avon, but the Government in their wisdom moved that franchise to Chiltern Railways. That was excellent news for that company, which has done an excellent job on the whole of its franchise from Marylebone to Birmingham, but it now means, in effect, that the only trains from Oxford to Banbury run between Oxford and Banbury&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">I was talking about community rail. In Oxfordshire, the roads are becoming more and more congested, and there is an opportunity for rail to take people from Banbury and Bicester to Oxford for study. Many people go to Oxford for the college of further education, and many go for shopping, leisure, recreation and work. With the current system, community rail services get completely lost in the franchise that has been given to First Great Western. I make no particular criticism of First Great Western, but it is really a long-distance train operator. Its skill is operating trains from Exeter and Bristol to London. I do not say that it is not interested in community rail, but it sees it as a contractual obligation to the Government. It is not desperately concerned about the long-term transport needs of counties such as Oxford.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">The system is not integrated. The county council looks at roads and bus services. It is able statutorily to subsidise loss-making bus services and to consult with people, but it has no involvement with rail services. At a local community level, we do not have an integrated community transport strategy, because rail is left in limbo.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">What First Great Western and other train operators do depends largely on the contractual obligations placed on them by the Government. There are huge demands on the Government&#039;s rail budget for subsidies, so they are not particularly interested in subsidising loss-making and community lines in counties such as Oxfordshire. Therefore, there is spiralling decline. The Government say, &quot;The Oxford to Bicester railway line needs only a few services each day, so that is all we will provide money for,&quot; First Great Western says, &quot;We are not going to run any services for which there is no subsidy&quot; and the service goes further into decline. Commuters and other passengers from Bicester to Oxford then find the service less and less reliable, and find other ways of travelling from Bicester to Oxford&#151;often by bus or coach. Although buses and coaches carry large numbers of people, journey times are often much longer than on trains because of road congestion going into Oxford.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">The Government think that they have got around the problem by introducing community rail partnerships. I can see that they might be of value in areas with a high number of tourists, where a branch line might be on the verge of closing and the Government, working with 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 198WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
community groups and the tourism industry, might manage to preserve it, but that is not the situation in Oxfordshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) that community rail partnerships have been for many the beginning of the end. It is not community rail partnerships that we require, but an integrated transport strategy for counties such as Oxfordshire that looks at the next 10 to 20 years and asks where rail fits in. Rail will not fit in if we have, as we do at the moment, an ever-declining service on the rail lines from Oxford to Banbury and Oxford to Bicester.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor mentioned the Beeching cuts. I suspect that, if what we know now had been known in the mid-1950s, many of the lines cut during the Beeching period would not have been cut. Many of those could have provided good rail services today. My concern is that, if we do not focus on the potential for the use of rail in areas where the roads will become increasingly congested, by the time that we wake up and recognise the value of the railways as a means of getting people around not only long distances but locally from one town to another, they will have become run down to such an extent that they will not be revivable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">I have a couple of requests for the Minister. Can he and his officials have another look at community rail? They should not just say, &quot;Okay, we will shove off that bit that is too difficult on to community rail partnerships.&quot; Instead, they should ask how, in counties such as Oxfordshire&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) makes the same point about Wiltshire&#151;we can ensure that rail services help people with journeys of often no more than 20 or 30 miles to the nearest university city, major town or connecting town. How can we do that and how can we integrate the system more with county councils?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">Subsidies are clearly an issue. I asked the same question in the House. There is considerable subsidy in the rail network, but my constituents are no less worthy of rail subsidy to go to work, study or school than long-distance commuters who come from Exeter or Bristol to London. There has to be some transparency about the subsidies given out on the railways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">Can we please find ways in which to work out how to optimise the opportunities that rail transport and the railway network offer us? Otherwise, I can see that each year First Great Western will apologetically come and talk to the Cherwell rail users group and others and say, &quot;We are terribly sorry. This is the requirement that has been placed on us by the Government. We are fulfilling that contract but we have to meet other obligations and we have that difficulty.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">My other point is by way of parenthesis but it follows on from what my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead and my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor said. A number of commuters use the local services as connecting services via Oxford to London. There is a broad difficulty. To everyone in areas such as Oxfordshire and the Thames valley, its seems that First Great Western has either taken the decision or been told by the Government that the stretch of rail from Reading 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 199WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to Paddington must be as high speed as possible to enable long-distance trains to get through more quickly. The irony is that many local services are being held back. Not only are the number of trains from Islip, Tackley and Heyford fewer during the day, but the time of running is considerably longer, as is the time that those people have to wait for connections at Oxford. That is simply because of how the stretch of line between Reading and Paddington is used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">That must be considered, otherwise the irony will be that those living nearer to London will find their services becoming more and more disrupted. Apart from anything else, I cannot see that that makes good economic sense for First Great Western. All that will happen is that those nearer to London will take other options, not least getting in their cars and going up the M4 or the M40. That will mean a considerable loss of revenue for First Great Western. There has to be fairer access to the stretch of rail between Reading and Paddington, so that the people who live nearest to London and others are not penalised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">My concern is that we do not seem to have an integrated transport plan and local plan for how to use rail to the best effect as a community asset in areas in the south and south-east of England in particular. Housing numbers in those areas are growing exponentially and as a consequence car and road usage will grow. We are bound to see greater road congestion. Railways provide a wonderful, unique way of relieving that congestion cost-effectively. However, people will use them only if services are adequate and reliable. Services will not be adequate on the present system, with the Government giving minimal subsidy to the rail operators. The rail operators do not see an opportunity but a duty that they have to fulfil. We are missing an opportunity, which is sad. I hope the Minister can address it.

I feel that he missed a bit from when the Conservatives were in power: privatisation, the effects of the introduction of Railtrack, and the doubling of costs. To be fair to the Government, the problems that we are dealing with now come from the underfunding in the Conservative years and the subsequent privatisation that, it seems, increased costs.

cost-cutting, or whatever it was, caused the problem. After nine years of Labour Government, surely he cannot still be making the same old point that we are totally tired of.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60328h01_spnew25"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : I am not here to defend the Government, but long-term underinvestment cannot be addressed overnight.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">Five issues need to be addressed. Although the debate this morning has concentrated on London and the south, as I represent a northern constituency, I want to make it clear that some of the issues that have been mentioned affect the rail network and commuters as a whole, and are not merely London-centric.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">The first issue is the rail franchising system and the unprecedented power of the Secretary of State under the Railways Act 2005. The second is overcrowding on commuter services. The third is the age and suitability of much of the rolling stock. The fourth is the cost per mile. The fifth is the issue of capacity and bottlenecks, which have a major effect on future development and expansion not only in London but in the big cities, including Birmingham and Manchester.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">The Railways Act gave the Secretary of State unprecedented powers. He stipulates and controls the franchise and can set the timetable within that. If we consider the issues that have been referred to, it is clear that many of those problems have come about as a result of setting the franchises so tightly. Although the Secretary of State sought to deny responsibility for such issues in the House last week, in my view he cannot escape that fact. Those powers exist and they have clearly been exercised. He can also require a review of rail services&#151;we saw two published last week&#151;and close unpopular routes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">If we look at the new franchises, and particularly the west country franchise, which was let to First earlier this year, we see that train numbers have been reduced despite unprecedented increases in passenger numbers. On the St. Ives Bay line, for example, passenger numbers are up 25 per cent., but the number of trains has been reduced from 26 to 23 each way in the summer and to 16 in the winter. On the Maritime line, passenger numbers are up 21 per cent, but the number of trains has been reduced from 13 to eight each way. It is the same on the Looe Valley line, where passenger numbers are up 16 per cent., but the number of trains has been reduced from 13 to eight each way. That is the direct result of a franchise that will deliver &#163;1.13 billion to the Treasury over the next 10 years. In the past, many people would have expected the more profitable lines, such as the Bristol to London line, to help to subsidise some of the rural and branch commuter services, but that has not happened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">If we look elsewhere, we will see the same process beginning as each franchise is let. In my area, for example, the operator of the northern franchise wanted to introduce new services and an improved timetable, but the new franchise system has prevented them from doing so. That has had the consequence of continuing overcrowding, but the issue has not been addressed on lines such as that from Huddersfield to Manchester, which has only two carriageways. The review that was published last week contained no plans whatever to increase capacity on such lines.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 201WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">As for overcrowding, the numbers of excess passengers are quoted for London, and the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) asked a telling question last week about commuter services in London, but similar figures are not available for elsewhere in the country. Overcrowding affects commuters who travel into not only London, but Manchester, Birmingham and our other big cities, and the House needs all the figures to be made available when we debate the development of services. The review that was published last week is meaningless for the northern franchise because it gives no information to back up some of the points that it makes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">I turn now to the age and suitability of the rolling stock. A few weeks ago, I asked a question about the plans for each franchise and about what would be done to improve the age of the rolling stock. Of course, the average age, which the Government quote, has improved, but if we look at services other than those on inner-city lines or serving London, we see that things are different. The average age of northern franchise rolling stock is 19 years, and there are no plans to renew it. That is totally unacceptable. We have inefficient, old rolling stock that costs a fortune to run, but we are not dealing with the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">On the cost per mile, we are sometimes quoted figures for some rural lines that show that such lines are inordinately inexpensive and cost too much per mile. However, we do not see the figures. If we are to have an honest discussion about which services should be provided, we need the figures to be produced. It has now been decided to axe certain services in the west country, but such decisions should not be made just by the Department for Transport&#151;they should involve local people. A key point about the Railways Act is that it removed control from passenger transport authorities and councils, which no longer have a proper say in the letting of franchises.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">To sum up, I would like to see four things. As the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) said, we need the network to be looked at as a whole, and there should not be this piecemeal letting of franchises. Secondly, we need more profitable lines to subsidise less profitable lines. Thirdly, we need long-term investment. The original plan talked about having franchises of 15 and 20 years, so that improvements could be made, but that is not happening, and all the franchises that have been let are for shorter periods. Finally, we need passenger transport authorities and local councils to play a greater role in setting priorities as part of an integrated transport plan. In short, we do not need the greater centralisation of the rail network that we are currently seeing. We need the Minister to be open about what is happening and we need to have an honest debate about the problems that we face.

It is no good, therefore, fighting the battles of 10 years ago; we need to move on and to deal with the problems of today and tomorrow. That, however, is where the Government are letting people down.

<p>
<a name="60328h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">What the Government are doing is repeating what happened all too often in the days of British Rail. BR would decide that it no longer wanted to maintain or pay for a line, so it would dramatically scale back the services on it. Similarly, we now have lines in the west country, for example, where the number of trains a day has been cut by 50, 60 or 70 per cent. Not surprisingly, ridership on those lines will fall dramatically, and I would be prepared to bet that, in a short time, people in the industry and the Department will say, &quot;These lines are no longer affordable. We need to close them.&quot; We are at the start of a slippery slope. Of course, there are no closures on the table today, but the Minister must surely realise that the cuts that he is making are creating the climate for closure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">I visited Dunbridge station, in Hampshire&#151;in this case, one station is affected, not the whole line&#151;where the number of services is falling from more than 20 to about five or six a day. The first morning train into Salisbury will now be at 10 o&#039;clock in the morning, and anybody who goes into Salisbury will not be able to return until 7 o&#039;clock in the evening. The morning train that children from the villages take to school is also being axed. That station will be in jeopardy because usership will fall, and somebody will turn round and say, &quot;The station is not economical. We will get rid of it.&quot; The Government are starting rail services down a slippery slope in Cornwall, Hampshire and Oxfordshire.

<p>

Timetabling is now decided in broad terms, although not to the exact minute past the hour, because Ministers do not decide whether a service will come at three minutes or 16 minutes past. However, they do decide how many trains there are from Twyford to Henley and how many pass through Bicester or use Westbury station on a typical day.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60328h01_spnew28"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : I do not want to eat into the hon. Gentleman&#039;s time and this is the last time that I will impose on his generosity. Is he saying that a Conservative Government would make no changes at all to services in what is a multibillion-pound business? 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 203WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Is he saying that the timetables and the specification of any franchise should be left wide open and that there should be no base specification and no indication of what the Government want?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60328h01_spnew29"><b> Chris Grayling </b> : In those comments, the Minister highlights the amazing contradiction in what the Government are doing. He says that this is a multimillion-pound business and asks whether the Conservatives would intervene to decide things. It is not the job of politicians to decide what trains run at which times on the railways and where they stop&#151;that is surely the job of rail professionals. That is where the Government are going wrong.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">The reason why these changes are taking place is that the Government have set themselves a goal of realising significant savings from the railways. The changes and the reductions in specifications on rural railway lines are all part of an attempt by the Government to extract as much money as they can from the railways, to counterbalance a big jump in public subsidy in the past few years. On the one hand, the Treasury is trying to squeeze the new franchisees and get as much money out of them as it can; on the other hand, it is trying to reduce the specification for those franchises as far as possible, so that services to stations such as Westbury are removed from the equation. That means that Dunbridge in Hampshire gets fewer trains every day and that the Looe branch in Cornwall and all the other affected areas in Cornwall get fewer services. The changes are all about cost saving.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">The Government are looking in the wrong place for efficiencies in our rail network. There are still huge issues around how Network Rail works. We still spend far more on rail maintenance and rail renewal than other countries. The hon. Member for Rochdale referred to Network Rail, and to maintenance and the level of investment in the railways. It is true that, for the past few years, the Government have been investing huge amounts of money and borrowing huge amounts through Network Rail to spend on infrastructure. In the end, however, we must surely catch up and start spending money on the real challenge in our rail network, which is to improve capacity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">Over the past few years, the Government have dramatically increased the amount of public money that they are spending on the railways. The Minister will no doubt tell us about the &#163;87 million a week that is spent on the railways, and yet at the end of that time, with all that money being spent, where are we today? Most of the major rail projects in the 10-year plan have been scrapped. The modernisation of the Great Western route was part of the plan. Platform extensions, Thameslink 2000, Crossrail and the modernisation of the east coast main line were all promised by his predecessors by 2010, yet most will simply not happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">At the same time, having spent all that money on the railways and increased public subsidy to such an extent, the Government are now cutting services in many parts of the country. If we cut rail services, fewer people are likely to use the railways. More people will get their car out of the garage and drive instead. When there is no train, the families in Dunbridge in Hampshire who have to get their kids to school in Salisbury every morning will get their cars out of the garage and drive them to school. That is surely the opposite of what the Government intended when they set out in office.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">At the end of nine years, the Government have talked grand talk about transport and spent a lot of money&#151;in the same way that they have spent a lot of money on the health service and education&#151;yet we see the same picture in terms of delivery. There have been few improvements to capacity, although the network has succeeded despite the Government&#039;s efforts, because the private rail companies have managed to boost passenger ridership enormously in the past few years. Large amounts of money are being spent, but capacity problems are not being addressed and projects that could deal with them are being kicked into the long grass. The Government&#039;s only solution is apparently to go back to the old-fashioned route of Dr. Beeching: to cut services and downscale the number of trains serving stations, with the inevitable consequence that in the end they will close.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">The result is that the railways are weaker. In many parts of the country, public transport services are disappearing, as a result of which more people will get out on to the roads. That is not where the Government started nine years ago and it is not what I believe they intended to do, but it is what is happening. It is time that we took a new direction and got better value for the public money being spent, rather than just chopping services in areas where the amount of money saved is, in fact, small. Having a train stop five times a day instead of 20 times a day saves a small amount of money and makes little difference to cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">It is time that the Government got to grips with the real cost issues on the railways, addressed the capacity problems and came up with a proper strategy for the future of our railways, instead of meddling in detailed jobs such as timetabling and services, which are properly left to rail professionals.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60328h01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg) </b> : In the short time available, I should like to do deal with as many issues as I can, but it will not be possible to deal with all of them. I congratulate the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) on securing this important debate. I note that his reading was &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. He may want to read through the &quot;National Rail Timetable&quot;, from which he might get more information. He might also notice that it is a lot thicker than it was 10 years ago. In other words, there has been an increase of around 20 per cent. in services on our railways since his party was in government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">All hon. Members who spoke in this debate care passionately about their local rail services. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), who is not here now, mentioned the Ashby and Coalville services in Leicestershire. I am sure that he will realise that we will need to engage the local authorities and Network Rail to develop a business case for that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">I note that when I asked the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) to name all the lines that were being closed down, he could not do so. It is ridiculous to suggest that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State or I are an incarnation of Dr. Beeching, who reduced the number of stations from 5,000 to 2,700. We currently have about 2,500, so on that basis we would have no

&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 205WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
stations left at all. I do not honestly think that the hon. Gentleman thinks that that we intend to cut hundreds or thousands of stations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">It is important to look logically and clearly at where we are with today&#039;s railways. Of course, there will be changes and, of course, we have to look for value for money. As has been mentioned a number of times, there is demand where there are particular crowding and capacity issues, which is a big challenge that we will have to address and that we are addressing. I shall explain in the few minutes available what we are doing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">We are spending &#163;87 million a week on the railways, with record investment in rolling stock and the youngest rolling stock for years. Overall passenger satisfaction is up&#151;I am not pretending that there can be no more improvements, but it is improving. We have 20 per cent. more services than in the mid-1990s. On public performance measures, we are now above the 85 per cent. target for reliability of trains, and the target for this year may be exceeded, although we shall have to see what the latest figures say. The trains are more reliable, which is important to commuters, as well as rural rail travellers. A number of our train operating companies now achieve more than 90 per cent. reliability. We have been working with the industry to bring about those improvements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">Let me give some examples of what has been happening with the railways. The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) mentioned the northern franchise, but the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell suggested on the radio a few weeks ago that we were going to cut the northern service. Well, we have not done so and we have no intention of doing so. He will probably be aware that TransPennine express will get new rolling stock, so investment in trains is taking place there&#151;the northern rail services are obviously heavily subsidised. I announced 17 new trains for South West only a few weeks ago, so it is nonsense to suggest that no improvements are taking place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">Of course, we have&#151;through longer trains and platforms, better timetabling and route utilisation strategies&#151;to get better capacity out of the network. More than 1 billion passengers will use the railways this year, which is the greatest number since the early 1960s, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 206WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
but on a much smaller network. We have got more passengers on to the network. There are challenges, but people are using the network because they see investment going in and an improved service that is an alternative to using their cars.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60328h01_spnew30"><b> Dr. Murrison </b> : The Minister talked about rail utilisation strategies. Why does the rail utilisation strategy of 2003, which recommended an enhancement of the Bristol to Waterloo service, appear to have been ignored?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60328h01_spnew31"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : The hon. Gentleman may want to read the latest rail utilisation strategy on South West, which Network Rail announced last week. I listened to his arguments about that service. We are considering the issue and will announce something shortly. Some &#163;7.6 billion has been invested in the west coast main line and, with the channel tunnel rail link and the Thameslink box station, investment is taking place all the time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">On First Great Western, I have had a number of meetings with hon. Members, as has been made clear. We have listened and our officials are talking with First Great Western to consider what improvements we can make as part of that franchise process. However, as I have already made clear, the franchise is very large and we have to consider how to get the best benefit for the most passengers, and the best value for money, ensuring that the resources are best used rather than used on services that hardly anyone or no one uses.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60328h01_spnew32"><b> Mrs. May </b> : Does the Minister not understand that, in terms of benefits for sheer numbers of passengers, he needs to focus on the commuter services, not the long-distance services?

We are looking at the issues and at how we can address the concerns that have been raised.

<a name="time_9">
<a name="60328h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60328h02_spnew0"><b> Meg Hillier  (Hackney, South and Shoreditch)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): It is a pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, Miss Begg.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para0"><a name="stpa_87">Overcrowded housing is an important issue, both in my London constituency and nationally. I shall talk about the reasons for that and then consider some of the solutions that the Government could consider more firmly. As a Hackney and London MP, I view these matters from the perspective of a city that is rapidly growing. London&#039;s population is set to grow by the equivalent of a city the size of Leeds by 2016. Indeed, we are already in the middle of that growth and are seeing the pressures put on all services in London, particularly housing. London is also a young city. In Hackney, 22.1 per cent. of the population is under the age of 16. Children and families need homes to live in&#151;and they need them now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para1"><a name="stpa_88">Overcrowding may be concentrated in London, but it is not just a London issue. London and the south-east are widely acknowledged as the powerhouse of the British economy, and we need to create housing stock for our workers. The cost of not tackling overcrowding is high.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para2"><a name="stpa_89">I shall highlight some of the problems in my constituency. Hackney is the third most overcrowded borough in London, with one person in 10&#151;8,000 families&#151;living in overcrowded accommodation. The number of households in this one London borough who live in overcrowded conditions is greater than can be found in whole cities. Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Bradford also suffer from overcrowding, but each of those cities has fewer such households than Hackney. In Greater London, 174,200 households, including 261,000 children&#151;one fifth of London&#039;s children&#151;live in overcrowded conditions. That figure rises to 30 per cent. among those who live in social housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para3"><a name="stpa_90">The debate about overcrowding often has to deal with technical definitions and financial models. However, as I know only too well as a constituency Member, there is a human side. It is the people who are suffering from living in overcrowded conditions&#151;the children who miss out and the families who suffer stress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para4"><a name="stpa_91">According to a survey of English housing conducted by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 500,000 households nationally&#151;900,000 children&#151;live in overcrowded conditions. The problem has grown in London since 1991, and severe overcrowding has risen by almost 50 per cent. Black and minority ethnic families are six times more likely to live in overcrowded conditions than white British families, and overcrowding is particularly prevalent among Bangladeshi and African communities. That is why three east London boroughs top the unenviable overcrowding league.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para5"><a name="stpa_92">The Mayor of London&#039;s involvement in housing has helped to sharpen the political focus on the issue, which is too big a problem for individual boroughs to deal with alone. Later, I shall touch on some of the funding problems of London boroughs. Nationally, the Minister of Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Miliband), and his 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 208WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
colleagues are debating the question of city regional government. I may not always see eye to eye with the Mayor of London&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60328h02_spnew1"><b> Michael Gove  (Surrey Heath)</b>  (Con): Hear, hear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60328h02_spnew2"><b> Meg Hillier </b> : That may be a moment of agreement with the Opposition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para6"><a name="stpa_93">The creation of strategic London government was an important and helpful step towards seeing the wider picture on housing, including overcrowding. Under this Government, we have seen a welcome growth in the number of affordable homes, but the balance of the various types of home is not right. The pressure for unit numbers&#151;whichever party is in government will always exert political pressure to increase quantity&#151;is often at the cost of a greater balance that would allow people to move within their communities rather than having to move out of London. I have much anecdotal evidence showing that those of my constituents who have the wherewithal to move from inner London to outer London or even outside London are doing just that in order to find the housing that they need. Over-focusing on one and two-bedroom properties in private and social housing stock is either driving families out or condemning them to live in cramped and unhealthy conditions, and many of their neighbours are in the same position, which often creates near ghettos of overpopulated areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para7"><a name="stpa_94">The problems of imbalanced communities and affordable housing are not unique to cities, but they are acute in London, which is why I shall focus on their impact on the city. We need a greater supply of larger affordable housing, but other mechanisms are also needed in order to adjust the playing field so that, for example, it can become more cost-effective to upgrade older, larger homes than selling them to pay for smaller units.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para8"><a name="stpa_95">Another issue that impacts on housing supply in London is under-occupancy. According to the ODPM&#039;s survey of English housing, 9 per cent. of London&#039;s social rented sector is under-occupied. Freeing up those larger homes will not solve overcrowding, but it could help, and many councils are at the forefront of initiatives to encourage tenants with spare bedrooms to move to smaller properties. For example, Hackney is adjusting its lettings policy to give more priority to overcrowded families. It is also increasing financial support for under-occupying tenants to cover the cost of moving to smaller properties&#151;a simple thing that is often the brake on people&#039;s desire to move. It is also encouraging under-occupying tenants to move by offering them not only what they need, but a second bedroom, so that relatives who visit can use the spare room. That is one reason why people do not want to move from larger properties. I am delighted that Shelter, the housing charity, has highlighted Hackney&#039;s approach as good practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para9"><a name="stpa_96">Even if all tenants with spare rooms moved to smaller properties, however, it would not solve the problem. I want to move on to some bigger solutions and issues. The main solution is a greater supply of housing, and altering the financial incentives for housing associations that are developing new social housing would help provide the right size and mix of units. I shall highlight 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 209WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
supply and size of housing and consider some definitions of overcrowding, as well as mentioning the effects of not acting. I am not a technical expert on housing matters, but I worked in the housing field for more than a decade. I hope that the Minister is listening hard, because the stark fact is that the current definition has been extant since 1935. It is rather out of date. I see him nodding; he may like to comment in his winding-up speech.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para10"><a name="stpa_97">The Housing Act 2004 allows the Government to modernise housing standards&#151;a provision that I welcome. However, the Housing Act 1985 contains two legal definitions of overcrowding. I shall not go into detail, but I want to highlight the room and space standards. The room standard allows a large kitchen to be counted as a sleeping room. It puts no limit on the number of same-sex cohabitants in such rooms, and it does not include children under the age of 10. Under that definition, children under 10 are wiped out.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para11"><a name="stpa_98">Under the space standard, children under the age of one do not count at all. A room is counted if it is a bedroom or living room, as are kitchens and dining rooms. Families can live in severe overcrowded conditions without hitting the Government&#039;s radar. Applying those definitions to the reality shows that it is probably a great deal worse than was suggested by the figures that that I cited earlier. I remind the House&#151;I hope that the Minister will hear what I have to say&#151;that, in theory, four children under the age of 10 could share a living room as a bedroom without being technically severely overcrowded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para12"><a name="stpa_99">I was delighted in 2003 when my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) promoted a private Member&#039;s Bill that recommended not counting living rooms or kitchens and giving every occupant of the household equal worth. A change is certainly needed, and I am pleased with the Government&#039;s recent announcement that they will consult on the statutory overcrowding standard. It is a step forward, but it is long overdue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para13"><a name="stpa_100">The Government have rightly highlighted the importance of education, on which debate is raging further down the Committee corridor today. Overcrowding has a big educational impact. A Shelter survey carried out at the end of last year showed that 80 per cent. of families felt that living in overcrowded conditions was damaging their children&#039;s educational prospects. That is self-evident. Overcrowding prevents children from having a quiet space to read, do their homework and study for exams. In my constituency, we have a number of homework clubs. Indeed, a local vicar in Haggerston in south Hackney, the Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin, has opened her home to local schoolchildren to provide them with space and peace to do their homework. I applaud her philanthropy, but the Government need to tackle the problem more systematicall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para14"><a name="stpa_101">There are also international examples of the impact of overcrowding on education. Research entitled &quot;The Urban Prospect&quot;, published in 2001 by New York&#039;s citizens housing and planning council, showed a link between overcrowding and lower levels of educational attainment. The study found that overcrowding reduces the probability of boys completing secondary school by almost 11 per cent., and that of girls by about 6 per cent. I do not doubt the Government&#039;s commitment to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 210WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
improving educational standards, but we need to do that across the piece. A home with the space to study must come high up the list.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para15"><a name="stpa_102">The links between overcrowding and health are well documented. When I entered politics, the then director of public health stressed to me that the provision of better-quality housing for families living in poor, overcrowded homes would have one of the best impacts on local health. We have come on a bit during the past 12 years or so. However, I cite the Shelter survey again: 90 per cent. of families felt that overcrowding was damaging their children&#039;s health; asthma was the condition mentioned most often. It will not surprise hon. Members to hear that 86 per cent. of those surveyed felt that depression, anxiety and stress resulted from living in cramped quarters; every week, we see in our surgeries the impact of overcrowding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para16"><a name="stpa_103">Research also shows links between overcrowding and respiratory and infectious diseases. British Medical Association research shows that overcrowding in childhood significantly affects stature, rates of disease and rates of early mortality in adulthood. If we do not tackle overcrowding, we will condemn today&#039;s children to a life of health inequality. Tuberculosis is another problem that is particularly prevalent in London, and it is directly linked to overcrowding. I commend work done by the London assembly on the impacts and causes of TB, which is on the increase. In Hackney, TB rates are similar to those in China. In 2001, all but three of the 15 London boroughs with above-average overcrowding had an above-average incidence of TB. We know from research that overcrowding plays a larger role in the incidence of TB than that of migration or ethnicity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para17"><a name="stpa_104">The critical argument is about the shortage of housing supply. The Government have done much good work to tackle the problem, but the concentration on one and two-bedroom properties has meant that the problems have not been entirely addressed. On 8 March, the Minister for Housing and Planning announced that in London the proportion of new housing built with three bedrooms or more would increase from 27 per cent. in 2004&#150;06 to 35 per cent. from 2006&#150;08. That was very welcome. In Hackney, the fruits of that policy are eagerly awaited, especially by the tenants of Haggerston West and Kingsland estate, who await a determination about their estate transfer, which has been discussed, in particular, because of the need to include larger family properties on the estate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para18"><a name="stpa_105">Supply is one part of overcrowding, but we need other ways of tackling the problem in the short term. I commend the 10-point plan drawn up by the Association of London Government, with the support of the National Housing Federation. The key points include a call for a national target to reduce overcrowding, which I support. People often mock nationally set targets, but all types of professionals on the ground tell me that Government targets have a beneficial impact because they focus local delivery, so a national target would be a good step forward. I also support the ALG&#039;s calls for the Government to have an overcrowding unit; perhaps it is time we had an overcrowding tsar. The Minister is smiling at the idea; perhaps he could have the job.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para19"><a name="stpa_106">I should also like grant funding to be re-jigged to make the building of family-sized units easier and more affordable. Local housing associations in Hackney tell 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 211WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
me that although we need more family-sized units locally, they do not provide the rent return that comes from building more one and two-bedroom properties. That is perverse situation, which we need to change by considering the cost per person of building a home, rather than at the cost per home. It is a typical clash between the Treasury and the delivery arm of the Government. The common-sense argument is there, but we need to make sure that it is translated. I am not sure whether the Minister can make pledges about what the Treasury can do, but perhaps he can comment on any discussions between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury on this issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para20"><a name="stpa_107">I turn to the need for one small but important measure in London. A number of housing associations have been selling their larger properties, particularly street properties and older properties. We need a brake on the sale of such properties, incentives to do them up and more support for tenants who want to move out of larger social homes and into other properties. Perhaps we could collate the existing funding mechanisms and provide extra support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para21"><a name="stpa_108">One of the bizarre aspects of current policy is that housing corporation funding rules reduce, pound for pound, the money that housing associations receive from local funding. I am a great believer in decentralisation and in local government having a role strategically, and in some cases in delivery terms, in tackling the detailed needs of an area. It seems an emasculation of local government, however, to say, &quot;Fine, you can fund housing associations to provide more housing&quot;, but then to remove money from the national pot.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para22"><a name="stpa_109">In the 2004 spending review, an extra 10,000 new socially rented homes were promised by 2007&#150;08, and a total of 75,000 homes over three years. That has been very welcome and I do not underplay the step change the Government have made in focusing on housing. However, I am looking to the next comprehensive spending review, as no doubt the Minister is, although perhaps he cannot commit at this point. I should like the Government to commit to the recommendations of the Barker review and ensure that the resources are available to deliver on those pledges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para23"><a name="stpa_110">The Government have done a great deal and recent announcements give me great hope, but I urge the Minister to start acting now to ensure that the benefits accrue for this generation of our children, as well as the next.

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="60328h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dan Rogerson  (North Cornwall)</b>  (LD): I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) on securing this debate on an issue that, as she rightly points out, affects Members of the House weekly at our surgeries and in our post bags, although it particularly affects those experiencing the effects of overcrowding. We have already heard that 500,000 households suffer from overcrowding. Each of those could tell us a story about how overcrowding has affected a group of people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para24"><a name="stpa_111">The definitions of overcrowding were set a long time ago, when ways of living and working were very different. Those definitions need to be reviewed and we 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 212WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
need to change how overcrowding is handled in respect of the provision of new social housing. We have heard how overcrowding can damage not only physical but mental health; depression is becoming a bigger element of the burden on local GPs&#039; surgeries. Overcrowded housing must be a significant factor among those that cause people such distress that they need to go to GPs&#039; surgeries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para25"><a name="stpa_112">We have heard about the effects of overcrowding on young people&#039;s educational opportunities&#151;the chance to study, read and do homework. It also affects their opportunity to play, however, which as we all know is an important part of a young person&#039;s life. Why should some young people not have the chance to play and enjoy life as their classmates can?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para26"><a name="stpa_113">A family who live in a housing association property in my constituency came to see me recently. They do not have the resources to move on to the private sector, so they went to the housing association and said that they could put together the funding to add a little extension or conservatory to their house. That would have given their children, who had to share a bedroom, a place to play. That suggestion was constructive; the family had obviously explored all the avenues. The housing association considered the proposal and was supportive, but the plan did not stack up for the planning department and the family were unable to carry it out. People in such situations are thinking constructively and trying to work with the authorities to overcome their situations. At the end of the day, however, if the housing stock is not there, we shall find that such situations are ongoing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para27"><a name="stpa_114">We have heard a great deal about the situation in Hackney and across London, but the problem also exists in rural areas. Colleagues who represent urban areas would doubtless echo the comments made about the situation in Hackney, but village communities in North Cornwall face a significant problem because the number of second homes has reached an unsustainable level. Young families cannot afford to stay on in the area where their parents grew up and are being forced to look further afield for accommodation. They find that because they are all being driven into the towns, no accommodation is available in urban centres either.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para28"><a name="stpa_115">In essence, the problem is caused by a lack of new social housing. The right to buy has meant that many council houses have passed out of the social rented sector. The comparison between the number of council houses that have been sold and the number of people who are on waiting lists for social rented accommodation shows quite a correlation. We need more action from the Government to replace housing stock that has moved out of the social rented sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para29"><a name="stpa_116">We can also consider the problem of overcrowding not just in terms of small homes&#151;one or two-bedroom properties. The problem of homelessness at home also exists. Some families who would otherwise have moved out of their parents&#039; accommodation are unable to do so because there is no alternative accommodation for them. It is not just that the accommodation is not large enough, but that it does not exist.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para30"><a name="stpa_117">Again, I can give an example from my constituency. A young single mother had to return to her parents&#039; home, a one-bedroom council property, because of a relationship breakdown. She and her child were 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 213WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
applying for council properties but stayed with her parents in that one-bedroom council property&#151;there were three adults and one child&#151;for a year until she was able to move out. That represents a year out of that child&#039;s life and education. That distressing problem for the whole family was caused not by the size of the property, but by the lack of affordable property for her to move on to, full stop.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para31"><a name="stpa_118">We need larger homes to be available. I am interested as to whether the Minister will come forward with any proposals about how the Government plan to address that issue and to examine standards, to which the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch referred. She also mentioned that moving towards a target for tackling overcrowding might be helpful. That is worth examining, particularly if it is linked to powers for those in local areas to address the problem. We would hate a target to involve no extra funding or powers enabling local housing associations and local councils to act to meet it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para32"><a name="stpa_119">The hon. Lady was getting to the nub of the problem when she spoke about how housing associations can set their rent levels in terms of the number of people in the property. There is an incentive to build denser, newer developments of smaller properties, as opposed to larger properties that would meet the need that we are discussing today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para33"><a name="stpa_120">My party believes that the way to address some of the problems is, first, to free up councils and housing associations to take every opportunity to provide more housing and to give them more flexibility to consider its nature. Some councils are working hard to explore every opportunity to provide housing. South Shropshire district council has, in some village developments, sought to ensure that every new development of two houses or more must have an affordable home. That is a step forward. It has had to sell that proposal to the local communities involved, but the response has been good and it has been able to provide more affordable homes as a result.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para34"><a name="stpa_121">We would also like mutual housing associations&#151;associations that would give their tenants, as their shareholders, more say in future development. All parties support greater investment in shared equity, and mine is keen to promote a golden share option, to ensure that those properties remain locally available for renting in the longer term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para35"><a name="stpa_122">I also want a right to invest, so that people can build up equity in their council housing or housing association property in order to give them the opportunity to move on into the private sector. That would help them, and it would also help to release the properties for future generations. Moving on in terms of shared equity also needs careful consideration; there should be an option for people to move up in the scale of property where required and for them then to be given incentives to move down again. We have heard that that is happening in Hackney.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para36"><a name="stpa_123">For those reasons, I hope that the Government will come forward with proposals over the coming months and years to increase investment in the provision of affordable housing and to ensure that some of the new ideas being piloted in councils around the country 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 214WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
can be explored and perhaps pushed forward. Overcrowding is a serious problem for those in urban areas and a serious and growing problem for those in rural areas. We need more affordable housing, and we need to ensure that the affordable housing that is provided meets the needs of the communities that it is there to serve.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para37"><a name="stpa_124">I congratulate the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) on securing this debate. I know that she has spent more than a decade taking an interest in housing issues, and her speech did her great credit. She reflected both on the problems in her constituency and on the broader issue that we face in tackling overcrowding in housing. Her speech was a model of clarity and exposition, and I congratulate her on it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para38"><a name="stpa_125">I believe that the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) was making his Front-Bench debut, and I thank him for laying out the issues from a rural perspective with particular clarity and for contributing to what I hope will be a broad consensus on the need to tackle this issue. Westminster Hall is not usually an arena for vicious partisanship, and I hope that it will not be so today. In sharing a commitment to tackle the problem, I hope that we can establish a degree of consensus across the Front Benches.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para39"><a name="stpa_126">I also want to thank Shelter, the campaigning housing charity, not only for its sustained campaigning effort for many years, but for its poster in Westminster station. Those of us who regularly use the Jubilee line will be familiar with that striking and effective poster. It shows a number of children in the House of Commons, crawling over the Dispatch Box and so on, and vividly and graphically brings home to parliamentarians and others what the reality of overcrowding might mean. The picture paints a thousand words&#151;words that are conveyed more effectively than the thousand words of mine that the <i>Hansard</i> reporters are recording today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para40"><a name="stpa_127">The scale of the problem was outlined with particular authority by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch. She reminded us that about 500,000 households in Britain today experience overcrowding. As we know, that means that almost 1 million children are growing up in circumstances that are an affront to social justice. She reminded us of the particular problems that she encounters in her constituency. Across London, 175,000 households experience overcrowding, which means that about 261,000 children are growing up in circumstances that they should not have to face. The Minister represents a seat that covers the London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets&#151;the two local authorities in London that have the most severe overcrowding problem&#151;so he will know the scale of the problem from his constituency postbag.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para41"><a name="stpa_128">As both speakers have spelled out, the consequences of the problem are particularly severe for children. The consequences in health terms have been graphically spelled out. As the hon. Lady pointed out, respiratory problems, particularly tuberculosis, are on the increase, and overcrowding is a crucial factor. The hon. Member 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 215WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for North Cornwall said that when it comes to mental health and well-being, overcrowding contributes to stress and anxiety, and in the worst cases to depression.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para42"><a name="stpa_129">There are compelling reasons for dealing with overcrowding in terms of both public health and educational outcomes. As both speakers pointed out, it is increasingly difficult for children and teenagers living in overcrowded housing to get the space that they need to devote themselves to the study that will allow themselves to make the most of their lives and their potential.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para43"><a name="stpa_130">Nearly a century ago, Virginia Woolf wrote a book entitled &quot;A Room of One&#039;s Own&quot;. Part of the burden of that book was the difficulty that women had faced in the past, overwhelmed as they were by crippling domestic duties, in managing to clear both the time and the space for creative endeavour. Her plea then&#151;an explicitly feminist plea&#151;is one that should be made on behalf of our children and teenagers today. They need a room of their own&#151;their own space in which they can not only grow and develop psychologically, but study and make the most of their homework. Such a space would help young people&#039;s schooling and ensure that they become all that they can be.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para44"><a name="stpa_131">We recognise that this problem has a direct effect on health and educational outcomes for our young people and that we need to address it, and I suspect that there is a consensus throughout the House on that. How should we go about addressing it? As the hon. Lady pointed out, her colleague the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) tried to introduce a private Member&#039;s Bill to modernise the definition of statutory overcrowding. The last time we had a statutory definition was in 1935, when there was a national Government and Ramsay MacDonald was the Prime Minister; some of us, I suspect, are nostalgic for those days, while others perhaps are not. In 1935, the definition was accepted simply as a working definition; it was seen not as the ideal, but simply as a means to an end&#151;a staging post on the road to improvement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para45"><a name="stpa_132">I suspect that there is broad consensus at present that the time is long overdue for revisiting the definition of statutory overcrowding. Indeed, that has certainly been hinted at by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. As the hon. Lady also pointed out, both the room standard and the space standard in that definition are outdated. We cannot have a situation in our country in which living rooms are counted as bedrooms in working out whether individuals are suffering from overcrowding, and in which four children sleeping in one room does not count as overcrowding. That offends against common sense.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para46"><a name="stpa_133">Legislation on its own is not enough, however. We can legislate to deal with this problem, but that is not a magic wand. It is helpful in setting a benchmark and in governing our direction of travel, but it will not in itself resolve the problem. What can we do? As both hon. Members have spoken have pointed out, we need to address the issue of supply and to ensure that, as we increase and free up supply, we have the right mix of houses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para47"><a name="stpa_134">When we examine supply, we discover that there have been melancholy trends in the statistics since the early 1990s. Again, I make my comments in a spirit of bipartisanship, and although some of my remarks may 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 216WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
be construed as critical of the Government&#151;and, indeed, they are&#151;some of them are also critical of the Conservatives towards the end of our time in government, when our contribution to and investment in social housing started to fall. There has been a fall in housing supply since the very early 1990s. According to the ODPM&#039;s own figures, that reduction meant that over the period broadly from 1991 to the beginning of the 21st century we had an excess in the growth of households over the amount of new homes of about 500,000. Therefore, 500,000 households did not get the houses they deserved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para48"><a name="stpa_135">Since the beginning of the current century there has been a welcome increase in housing supply, but it is still the case that household growth outstrips the supply of new housing, and the most recent ODPM figures on household growth emphasise that households are growing at an even faster rate than we envisaged. It is therefore incumbent on all of us to do everything we can to free up supply further.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para49"><a name="stpa_136">The point has been made, not least by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, that the constrictions in housing supply have been particularly acute in the social housing sector. Even though there has been a welcome increase in the amount of new development in the private sector, there is still not enough of it and there has not been a matching increase in the supply of social housing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60328h02_spnew5"><b> Meg Hillier </b> : What is the current policy of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party on right-to-buy sales, which in London in particular have caused a significant loss of social housing&#151;and especially of housing units of the size that we have been talking about?
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"><a name="60328h02_spnew6"><b> Michael Gove </b> : I thank the hon. Lady for mentioning the right to buy, because I believe that it was a hugely successful policy in its time and that it still has some relevance. I think that most people now agree that when the right to buy was introduced, the proportion of people living in social housing was too large to allow true pluralism in housing supply and mix of tenure. There was an unmet need for ownership, which the right to buy succeeded in meeting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para50"><a name="stpa_137">Inevitably, however, as more individuals who want to own have moved towards ownership the demand for the right to buy has dropped. We have certain concerns about the way in which that demand for ownership among people in social housing has been constricted by some of the restrictions on the right-to-buy policy that this Government have introduced, but I do not want to labour that point at present. None the less, the amount that people are offered as a discount has fallen, and as a result, fewer people than might have wanted to take up that right have done so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para51"><a name="stpa_138">One of the key points about the right to buy is that it contributes to a net increase in housing supply. When individuals buy, the money that the local authority or housing association&#151;or other registered social landlords&#151;get from the sale can contribute to new capital investment. I acknowledge that there is a net reduction in social housing as a result of the right to buy, but there is a net increase in housing supply overall, and that is my party&#039;s aim.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para52"><a name="stpa_139">Part of that increase has to be an increase in the supply of social housing. As the hon. Lady pointed out, we can help local authorities that are encouraging more 
<br>

<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 217WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
efficient use of their own housing stock and tackling the issue of houses where individuals have surplus bedrooms by encouraging them to move and providing the right incentives for them to do so. I applaud local authorities of all parties that have tried to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para53"><a name="stpa_140">As the hon. Lady hinted, however, we should explore new and innovative ways of supporting RSLs and private developers in supplying an increased level of social housing. I learned last week from <i>Inside Housing </i>magazine that the ODPM is looking afresh at the extent of the involvement of private developers in the supply of social and affordable housing. If that is indeed the direction of travel in which the Minister and his team wish to move, we would like to encourage them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para54"><a name="stpa_141">The hon. Lady also pointed out that the current way in which housing associations receive their funding does not encourage exactly the right mix of housing stock. Specifically, it encourages using houses or flats that are too small for current needs. This is an area in which the Treasury is perhaps not on the side of the angels; if so, this is not the first occasion on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been a roadblock to reform. However, I hope that the Minister and his colleagues in the ODPM will bring their considerable weight to bear in encouraging him to move out of the way on this issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"><a name="60328h02_spnew7"><b> Meg Hillier </b> : I would be interested if the hon. Gentleman could outline his party&#039;s policy on funding larger social units.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60328h02_spnew8"><b> Michael Gove </b> : I am attracted by what the hon. Lady has said about the need to change the funding mechanism in order to help create larger social housing units, because what we need to do overall is ensure that we move away from the constricted spaces that we are offering people both in the social housing sector and in private sector developments. I will address shortly the question of constricted space and what we need to do to encourage the right sort of development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para55"><a name="stpa_142">In talking about housing supply overall, however, I want to touch briefly on the contribution that the private rented sector can make. Although there will always be a valuable role for RSLs to play&#151;in my view, it will be an increasingly important role over the coming few years&#151;we also need to recognise that private landlords can play a significant part in meeting housing need. My only specific comment on this issue will be to ask a question of the Minister: has the ODPM fully considered the consequences of the level of regulation, following on from the Housing Act 2004, that has been placed on private landlords? Some of that regulation was welcome in that it increased the standards of private rented accommodation, but Conservative Members have received representations from private landlords that some aspects of that regulation might create a constriction of supply. I would be interested to hear his views about the likely future supply of private rented housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para56"><a name="stpa_143">One way in which we can increase housing supply overall is by encouraging private development. I was fortunate enough yesterday to spend some time with my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) in Hammersmith and Fulham, looking 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 218WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
at a new housing development there, which has been welcomed by many residents in that area. It is striking that that development has been welcomed, because one of the things my right hon. Friend pointed out in a recent article in <i>The Independent on Sunday </i>is that in order to deal with the pressing need to increase the supply of housing in this country, we have to tackle the resistance to development that is a feature of life in Britain today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para57"><a name="stpa_144">We are all familiar with the &quot;not in my backyard&quot; culture. We all know that there is resistance to development, but rather than simply deprecating it, we should try to understand it. Rather than condemning a little more, we should try to understand a little more. If we try to understand why there is resistance to development, we find that local people often feel that they are not consulted properly about the nature of development. They feel that distant planning decisions are taken at the level of the ODPM, which often overrides local authorities&#039; opinions. New development is often not of an aesthetic standard that they would welcome. Also, new development often comes without the infrastructure for which local people feel a need, so greater strain will inevitably be placed on existing infrastructure as a result of individuals coming into an area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para58"><a name="stpa_145">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney made another point: in an increasingly environmentally conscious age, it may be appropriate to ensure that any new developments make their contribution to the battle against climate change. Many people would be more inclined to welcome development if they saw that developers took that into consideration when supplying new housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para59"><a name="stpa_146">If we are to tackle resistance to development, we must ensure that local people are given a greater say; work with developers and perhaps use urban design codes to ensure that new housing is of the right aesthetic standards; and ensure that local authorities are properly funded in terms of the infrastructure that they need, and so can welcome development. At the Invermead development, which we visited yesterday, all three considerations were taken into account. People in Hammersmith and Fulham were consulted before the development proceeded. The building is of a high aesthetic standard and is, as far as possible, in keeping with the existing architectural standards. Also, infrastructure has been respected. The development is on the site of the old Queen Charlotte&#039;s maternity hospital, but it includes a brand new community health centre. That way, an emotional and practical link with the original site is maintained, and people can see that a key additional infrastructure benefit comes along with the housing. We believe that if we tackle all three concerns, we can build consensus across the country in favour of the development that is needed in order to meet demand for new housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para60"><a name="stpa_147">The hon. Member for North Cornwall made an interesting point about the situation in south Shropshire, where the local district council, which I think is Liberal Democrat at the moment, has a particularly tight target for affordable housing when it comes to new developments. An interesting proposition put forward by a number of Members from all parties is that under current regulations that govern when new developers have to build affordable housing into a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 219WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
development, the level is set too high. The trigger point of 15 homes for new housing developments may need revisiting for two reasons: first, we may not be getting the supply of affordable and social housing that we need; secondly, that target encourages dense, flatted developments of 10 to 12 flats on sites of existing family homes, rather than the imaginative sort of developments that we might wish for.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para61"><a name="stpa_148">If local authorities could set their own target, as South Shropshire district council has sought to do, they could decide that a development of five new private houses would trigger the need to provide affordable housing. That would have a double benefit: it would potentially increase the supply of affordable housing, while reducing the transformation of multi-bedroom family homes into flatted developments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60328h02_spnew9"><b> Meg Hillier </b> : The hon. Gentleman may find that he agrees on that point with the Mayor of London, who has sought to introduce a lower threshold in exactly the way that the hon. Gentleman describes.

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60328h02_spnew10"><b> Michael Gove </b> : It is a rare moment when I find myself in agreement with the Mayor of London, but I am not sure that I actually do in this case. I believe in the devolution of power, as the Mayor does, and I believe that it is worth exploring whether local authorities should have that power, but the Mayor has sought to introduce mechanisms that we fear have constrained developers in some respects. However, I shall not devote my remaining time to criticising the Mayor of London; I will leave that to other members of the hon. Lady&#039;s party, who can do it with greater authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para62"><a name="stpa_149">The hon. Lady congratulated the Minister for Housing and Planning on her commitment to increasing the size of new social housing in London. Having talked about the need to free up supply overall, I want to touch on the type of homes that we want, because the Minister for Housing and Planning makes an important point. Unfortunately, only 6 per cent. of new social housing in London has four or more bedrooms. That is part of a broader pattern in this country. In 1990, only one eighth of new homes were flats. By 2004, just under 50 per cent. were flats. We need to address the reasons why we are producing dwellings that are smaller than we need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para63"><a name="stpa_150">It is a melancholy fact that Britain has not only some of the oldest, but some of the pokiest, housing stock in Europe. In particular, we are bottom of the European league for the size of new houses. We have not only the smallest new houses in Europe, but the smallest rooms in the smallest houses in Europe. Why? Well, the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch touched on one reason: Government funding and the way in which it affects our housing associations and other registered social landlords who supply social housing. However, there is another reason, too&#151;one on which there is a divide between the Front Benchers&#151;and that is the way in which the Government operate planning policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para64"><a name="stpa_151">Under planning policy guidance note 3, or planning policy statement 3, the Government have encouraged density. Increasingly, they have made our urban areas the site of dense, flatted development. Family homes have been replaced with new dwellings under the &quot;pile &#039;em high, sell &#039;em cheap&quot; principle. We need to recognise 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 220WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the current definition of gardens as brownfield land is wrong; gardens are green lungs in our cities, sources of biodiversity and&#151;for families that are growing up&#151;valuable space in which children can have the freedom to develop and, as the hon. Member for North Cornwall pointed out, play and grow. We believe that we should look more broadly into how communities can grow organically, so that the need for more family homes can be addressed and so that the relative oversupply of flats, as compared with houses, can be corrected. Most people in this country want to live in family homes with or near green space, and we should go with the grain of that aspiration.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60328h02_spnew11"><b> Meg Hillier </b> : I fear that the hon. Gentleman, in his erudite and typically well researched speech, is confusing density with types of property; there can be dense housing with gardens, and high-rise blocks are not necessarily any denser than street properties. I would like him to outline his party&#039;s policy on where the 1 million extra people in London will go if we do not develop homes in the inner city.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60328h02_spnew12"><b> Michael Gove </b> : The hon. Lady sets two challenges. The first is that density need not mean constriction or high-rise developments. That is certainly true. We know from Edinburgh, Bath and indeed Islington that housing can be both dense and attractive. Unfortunately, the melancholy trend at the moment is towards densification through the replacement of family houses that have green spaces with flatted developments in which the green space is built over, and with smaller dwellings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para65"><a name="stpa_152">Unfortunately, as I pointed out earlier, not only are our new homes smaller than those in other European countries, but the rooms in them are smaller. That contributes to the broad problem of overcrowding and the lack of supply of the types of houses that we need. The hon. Lady and I agree about the scale of housing need in London. As I have pointed out, there are a number of things that we can do to encourage the right sort of development in London, but we also need to recognise that communities across the country need to grow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para66"><a name="stpa_153">One of our differences with the ODPM is that its approach to allowing communities to grow under the sustainable communities plan means that some are perhaps growing at too fast a rate, in the way set out under central plans. We would like local communities to be given a greater say in how development occurs, and we would like organic growth. I do not believe that there is a hamlet in this country that cannot afford a few extra houses, a village that cannot afford significantly more than that, or a town that cannot afford, and would not welcome, significantly more again. I would like a spread of housing development across the country, with local people persuaded and encouraged to accept development&#151;provided, that is, that their voice was respected, that the aesthetic standard of those new houses was high, and that infrastructure proceeded hand in hand with the new housing development.

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60328h02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Andrew Love  (Edmonton)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I apologise for arriving late for this important debate, Miss Begg. It was the attractions of Bill Clinton that kept me away for so long.

<p>
<a name="60328h02_para67"><a name="stpa_154">I want to press the hon. Gentleman on the phenomenon of the expected increase in the number of households containing single people or childless couples. Although I accept his argument that there is a need for family accommodation in social housing, I point out that we will need more small-scale accommodation to house the rapidly increasing numbers of childless couples and single people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60328h02_spnew14"><b> Michael Gove </b> : I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point, and I entirely understand why he was absent. Bill Clinton is a bigger attraction than any of us. At the beginning of my speech, I said that the Opposition recognise that the scale of future household growth requires significant additional housing. Like the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch, I paid tribute to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s private Member&#039;s Bill and his crusade to deal with the definition of statutory overcrowding. I am delighted to see him in the Chamber.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para68"><a name="stpa_155">This country has become more prosperous during the past 30 years. One key thing about countries that become more prosperous is that people generally like to live in more spacious homes with access to green space. It is an entirely worthy aspiration. I do not think that just because individuals no longer live in large or extended families, we should automatically say, &quot;You&#039;re condemned to live in this type of housing.&quot; Flatted developments and sheltered housing will be appropriate for certain people towards the end of their lives, when they want to live in a smaller space because larger space becomes unmanageable. As the hon. Lady said, enlightened local authorities are providing incentives for people to move out of social housing that may be too big for them. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation made this discovery:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;People&#039;s least favourite type of development in their community is the high rise block.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para69"><a name="stpa_156">Only 28 per cent. of people say that their preferred form of living is high-density city centre living. There is clear evidence that the popular demand is for more space in greener cities and greener communities. That is the direction of travel in which housing should go.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para70"><a name="stpa_157">Finally, because I have taken up far too much time, I have just a few questions for the Minister. First, we should all like to know where we are on progress towards a new statutory definition of overcrowding. Secondly, what new initiatives might we see from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to increase the supply of social housing and to ensure that it is of the right kind? Thirdly, as a general indication, has he considered the effect of regulation on the private rented supply?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para71"><a name="stpa_158">Finally and perhaps most importantly, what will be done in the next few years to encourage development and to free up supply? In particular, does the Minister accept that when it comes to tackling the resistance to development in our country, it is not enough to belabour those who resist it? We must take them with us by understanding their concerns, so that we can address the pressing need, which I think everyone agrees we have, to deal with the problem of overcrowding, the health and education challenges that it poses us, and in particular, the challenge it poses us to ensure that our society is socially just and inclusive.

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60328h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : Miss Begg, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair presiding over this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) on securing this important debate. As a fellow east London MP, she knows that I share the type of casework that she receives. I have close, first-hand knowledge of the serious problems that she raises, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) acknowledged. I also associate myself with his generous tribute to my hon. Friend, as well as the welcome that he extended to the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para72"><a name="stpa_159">I welcome the characteristically thoughtful, well crafted and constructive contribution of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. I hope to continue the debate in that spirit. However, the consensus seemed to break down towards the end, particularly when the hon. Gentleman was tested by some of my hon. Friend&#039;s questions about his party&#039;s financial commitment to the house-build programme that I shall outline. I believe from the Sunday newspapers that his leader is about to make a pronouncement about the new-build programme, so perhaps that was the reason why the hon. Gentleman was unable to supply as much information as might have been helpful. None the less, I am conscious that both Opposition parties have made a constructive contribution to the debate, and I welcome it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para73"><a name="stpa_160">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch said, the statutory overcrowding standards have been with us for a considerable time&#151;indeed, they have remained unchanged since 1935. Back in 1935, those provisions were considered very much reforming measures. The key motivation was to promote better health. Given the other social advances since 1935, overcrowding is now much less likely to indicate grossly insanitary conditions or a high risk of the spread of life-threatening diseases, notwithstanding the qualification of tuberculosis, as my hon. Friend mentioned. However, I recognise that overcrowding can still raise health concerns, bringing on stress, making the spread of infection easier, and increasing the risk of accidents in the home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para74"><a name="stpa_161">The Government do not defend the current overcrowding standards. They are very out of date. They discount sleeping in rooms other than bedrooms and they tolerate unacceptable degrees of sharing by children who, by any modern standard, are old enough to need their own space. That is why we took powers in the Housing Act 2004 to amend the standards, and undertook to consult on how the powers might be used. Some hon. Members feel that we have taken rather too long to consult, but we needed to consider the statutory standards in the context of our housing policies, and I shall explain how we are doing that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para75"><a name="stpa_162">Information on overcrowding under the 1935 standards is not collected systematically, but we believe that about 20,000 households are statutorily overcrowded. That is roughly 0.1 per cent. of households. The other measure is the bedroom standard, a long-standing statistical measure that is used in the English housing condition survey and represents the main source of data on 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 223WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
overcrowding. We know that 2.5 per cent. of households&#151;just over 500,000 households&#151;are overcrowded by that measure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para76"><a name="stpa_163">Both of those percentages are small, but I do not underestimate the impact on overcrowding upon those families, nor do I seek to diminish the wide variations that the figures conceal. For instance, overcrowding is more of a problem in London, where 150,000 households are overcrowded, of which 29,000 are severely overcrowded in the social rented sector. Overcrowding throughout the whole of London is 6.3 per cent. by the bedroom standard. Specifically in the social sector in London, it is calculated at 11.8 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para77"><a name="stpa_164">Ethnicity, as mentioned by hon. Members, is also a significant issue. Within London&#039;s social rented sector, for instance, the rate of overcrowding is 7.8 per cent. for white households, but 17.8 per cent. for black and minority ethnic households. The highest rate of overcrowding by ethnic group in London&#039;s social rented sector is 29 per cent. among Bangladeshi households. They account for just 3 per cent. of all households but 10 per cent. of all overcrowded households in London&#039;s social rented sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para78"><a name="stpa_165">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch raised the question of the Association of Local Government&#039;s 10-point plan on overcrowding, which has been welcomed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60328h02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Love </b> : Before my hon. Friend reels off the estimates about overcrowding, may I inform the House that according to the English house condition survey, more than 900,000 children are affected by overcrowding&#151;about 260,000 of them in Greater London? Does he accept that if the Government are to achieve their ambition of halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020, action has to be taken on overcrowding?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60328h02_spnew16"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. The whole House knows the work that he has undertaken on this subject over many years. He brings a great deal of expertise to bear on our proceedings. I fully accept his point about children and child poverty. The tone of this morning&#039;s debate and the constructive comments from all Members who have contributed reflect the all-party support for dealing with the matter as seriously, positively and constructively as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para79"><a name="stpa_166">I was talking about the ALG&#039;s 10-point plan. We understand that the ALG will finalise the report and publish its action plan in June. Obviously, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consider it carefully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para80"><a name="stpa_167">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch referred to relations between the ODPM and the Treasury. She will know that we have doubled investment in social housing since 1997. Substantial progress has been made on cutting rough sleeping, getting families out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, dealing with the repairs backlog that we inherited in 1997 and tackling the 2 million homes below the decency threshold. In addition, the numbers of new homeless are falling. Given all that, our priorities are to help people out of temporary accommodation and to deal with overcrowding, especially in London.

<p>
<a name="60328h02_para81"><a name="stpa_168">Over the next two years, the Government are investing nearly &#163;4 billion in the Housing Corporation&#039;s national affordable housing programme to deliver 84,000 new homes&#151;21,000 more than in the past two years. Of those, 49,000 will be new build social rented homes. That constitutes a significant increase in the annual supply of new social housing to help those who cannot afford to rent privately.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para82"><a name="stpa_169">I heard what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath said and I shall return in a moment to the issue of the private rented sector. In particular, I heard what he said about people who oppose the rate of house building and our plans and about the need to take people with us. There is support for many of the Barker proposals, but there is also a lot of resistance in a variety of areas. The hon. Gentleman may have to accept ultimately that some people simply will not want to see development in their area. Obviously, a balance needs to be struck. We hope that we can take people with us because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch said, the number of extra homes that we will need, not only in London but throughout the country, is considerable&#151;it is estimated at 4 million. Given the lack of new build in the past 30 years, we are having to catch up in a very short time.

<p>
<a name="60328h02_para83"><a name="stpa_170">I want to press the Minister a little on the Barker proposals. As he outlined, the Government are increasing the supply of affordable rented accommodation, which is very welcome. According to the official statistics, about 10,000 additional units will be completed, yet the targets in the Barker report were for 17,000 to 23,000 additional units of affordable accommodation. I recognise that, under the current spending review, that will not be achieved, but I hope that the Minister will take back to the Department the fact that Parliament would like those Barker proposals to be implemented, as the Government have already indicated, under the next spending review.

<a name="60328h02_para84"><a name="stpa_171">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) makes a pitch for the Barker proposals. I hope to return to some of the Government&#039;s commitments later in my speech. If I do not cover the figures, I will write to my hon. Friend, but I think that they are included in my speech. As he suggests, the Barker report is fundamental to the Government&#039;s direction of travel. There is a commitment. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch raised the relationship between the ODPM and the Treasury. That relationship clearly involves dynamism. We are clear that we have to address the question that has been raised, and I will provide some reassurance shortly in respect of numbers and the immediate future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para85"><a name="stpa_172">My hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning recently announced a new programme of work to deal with overcrowding and its impact on children. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 225WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We are increasing the proportion of new social housing with three or more bedrooms to be built in London from 27 to 34 per cent. in the 2006&#150;08 affordable housing programme. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch welcomed that in her opening speech. We are building on the preventive measures that have been successful in reducing the number of new homeless families in London by 25 per cent. in the past year. We are encouraging London boroughs to make better use of cash incentive schemes and tailored support to help single people wanting to move out of larger accommodation and to help families to move to other areas where they can find larger homes. Against that background of specific measures, we shall consult in the next few months on the statutory definition of overcrowding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para86"><a name="stpa_173">As my hon. Friend said, there are examples of good practice. Hackney and Tower Hamlets are two of the local authorities that are hardest pressed in respect of overcrowding and they are seeking innovative solutions to assist their communities to have better housing conditions. I recognise that overcrowding is seen as a neglected problem, but it would be wrong to think that authorities have not been considering the issue or not reporting the contribution that overcrowding makes to the totality of housing need in their areas. All local authorities have carried out housing needs surveys, which included assessments of overcrowding. Those surveys, along with other data on housing needs, inform the assessment of the need for new affordable housing set out in authorities&#039; housing strategies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para87"><a name="stpa_174">Part 7 of the Local Government Act 2003 puts the strategies on a statutory footing for the first time, because the Government believe that a robust strategy is essential to the delivery of local authorities&#039; housing functions. Our guidance stresses the importance of addressing all relevant issues in housing strategies. One element of the strategy in respect of which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath requested information was private landlords&#039; role and regulation in that regard. The Government agree that private landlords have a vital role. There are many good landlords, but there is also a lot of poor stock and bad management, as hon. Members know. The package of measures in the Housing Act 2004 addresses that. Responsible landlords and their associations recognise the need to raise standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para88"><a name="stpa_175">The provisions may look like over-regulation, but we need to protect tenants as well as encouraging existing and new landlords. We think that our policies strike that balance, but we are always open to representations from any associations that believe that more can be done. I would also welcome anything that the hon. Gentleman for Surrey Heath might wish to contribute to the discussion and the solution or partial solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para89"><a name="stpa_176">I return to overcrowding as a health and safety issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch may want to bear in mind that the new housing health and safety rating system, which will come into operation on 6 April, will enable local authorities to assess overcrowding as a potential health and safety hazard. The principle of the system is that authorities will consider what action to take to deal with health and safety hazards in dwellings on the basis of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 226WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
statutory powers and duties, supported by regulations and guidance. Authorities will have a number of options to deal with the hazards identified under the new system. Those options will range from mere notification of minor remote hazards up to prohibition or closure where justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para90"><a name="stpa_177">That does not mean that overcrowding will disappear. It will not always be possible to establish serious health and safety risks from overcrowding, and the system will not deal with gender separation. None the less, it will bring crowding and space into the mainstream of health and safety issues relating to housing. Where overcrowding aggravates other hazards such as fire risk, strong action will be possible. In addition, the provisions in the 2004 Act for the licensing of higher-risk houses in multiple occupation, which will also come into operation on 6 April, will play an important part in ensuring safe conditions and adequate amenities in properties that, by definition, contain more than one household.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para91"><a name="stpa_178">The hon. Member for North Cornwall raised the issue of the right to buy. I know of the suggestions that right-to-buy sales are eroding the stock of local authority homes, and the argument that the Government should reduce the maximum right-to-buy discounts available to tenants to reduce sales. The Government support the principle of the right to buy. It has helped many thousands of families to realise their aspiration to own their own home and it has helped to create many stable mixed-tenure communities. However, we were concerned about its impact on the availability of affordable housing in some areas and about exploitation of the rules. We therefore lowered maximum right-to-buy discounts in 41 areas under housing market pressure. We also changed the rules in the Housing Act 2004 to restore the scheme&#039;s focus on long-term home ownership and the building of sustainable communities, and to tackle exploitation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para92"><a name="stpa_179">We are keeping right-to-buy discounts under review and do not rule out further changes, but they must be targeted and proportionate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60328h02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Love </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for being so generous in giving way during his speech.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para93"><a name="stpa_180">The critical issue about continuing right-to-buy sales is that capital receipts should be reinvested in local housing to provide further accommodation. Will the Minister consider that and ensure that we continue to reinvest those receipts to provide more housing?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="60328h02_spnew20"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : As a regular attender at ODPM questions in the Chamber, my hon. Friend knows that that matter has arisen a number of times during parliamentary questions and that a number of debates have been raised. The assurance from the ODPM is that a number of initiatives are under review on how best to stimulate the housing market, including the new social homebuy and shared equity schemes, in addition to the new money that the Government are putting in and the building programme. The matter is very much to the forefront of the Government&#039;s consideration and I am sure that it will feature strongly in the 2007 comprehensive spending review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para94"><a name="stpa_181">On the educational impact, my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch referred specifically to the impact of overcrowding on 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 227WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
educational attainment. The ODPM commissioned a review of the evidence and literature on the impact of overcrowding on education and health in 2004. That review, which was carried out by De Montfort university, identified only a few previous studies of the relationship between overcrowding and educational attainment and was thus unable to draw conclusions. However, the review concluded that such a relationship existed for both health and education and drew attention to a study carried out in Paris in 2003 which pointed to a strong relationship with education. It is worth noting that no single definition of overcrowding was used in the studies, but the review tells us clearly that the need to safeguard children&#039;s educational attainment should be in the front of our mind as we tackle overcrowding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h02_para95"><a name="stpa_182">In conclusion, I do not believe for a second that I have satisfactorily responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch or to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in that I do not have a magic wand to provide a solution to the problem that we all agree is clearly desperate for many thousands of families. However, I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend that the Government are determined to bring overcrowding to the front of our mind in taking our housing policies forward.

This week, three independent health watchdogs have highlighted concerns about the treatment of the elderly in our country. This topic is rather current so it is appropriate for us to debate it in the House today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para0"><a name="stpa_183">The objective of any civilised society is to treat the elderly with dignity and respect, but there are examples of the elderly being neglected and patronised in all parts of the country. This represents an ongoing battle that we must pursue and win. The Labour Government have done a great deal to help senior citizens during the last eight or nine years, and this is not an opportunity for me to have a go at the Administration. Rather, it is an opportunity to ask some questions that constituents have put to me because they feel strongly about the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para1"><a name="stpa_184">The Government, the national health service, local government and care homes are inextricably linked. They are all interdependent. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what studies have been done of that link and how greater efficiency and care can be guaranteed. If we provide good care in nursing homes and care homes that gives peace of mind to senior citizens, how much will the NHS save in the long term? Many medical friends of mine confirm that stress can have a great impact on senior citizens and the illnesses that they can have. Providing them with a guarantee of long-term care in a nursing home would go a long way to preventing other illnesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para2"><a name="stpa_185">I represent Shrewsbury, and many owners of nursing homes and care homes in Shropshire want the Government to listen to them more. They do a very good job of looking after people in Shrewsbury, but believe that the huge amount of regulations and red tape that have been foisted on them are having a major impact on the cost of running their establishments. They have to pass their costs on to their clients. I understand that the Government have a responsibility to set uniform standards across the country, but if the Minister were to come to any care home or nursing home in Shrewsbury, she would find that the standards were extremely high. I wish that we could give the owners and managers of care homes fewer targets and less red tape and allow them to get on with the job of running their establishments. The resulting costs are passed on to their clients, which is part of the problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para3"><a name="stpa_186">I would like tax breaks for private companies to allow them to develop new care homes and for the training of their staff. Another of their major problems is that they cannot find enough staff to look after patients, so they have to spend a great deal of money on finding people and training them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para4"><a name="stpa_187">Constituents in Shrewsbury have been coming to my surgery in growing numbers to tell me of the financial headaches that they have in relation to this issue. Many of them, such as Mr. Cartwright of Shrewsbury, have had to sell their parents&#039; homes in order to pay for long-term care. Once they have sold their homes, they then have to manage the assets, which are eked out over a certain amount of time to pay for the costs. Many 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 229WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
constituents feel that such care should be entirely or partly funded by the NHS. This generation feels that the state&#151;the NHS&#151;is responsible and the Government should help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para5"><a name="stpa_188">People genuinely feel that they have paid taxes for all of their lives and that long-term care should be either partly or totally paid for by the state. That is a frame of mind that many people have and it is difficult to change it in the short term because people have high expectations. Later on, I shall talk about my generation of citizens and how we shall have to deal with the problem, but many of my constituents in Shrewsbury resent selling their homes at the moment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para6"><a name="stpa_189">Many people have worked hard and saved up in order to pass an inheritance on to their children. They come from an era after the war when many worked extremely hard and made huge sacrifices in order to make investments and buy homes that they could then pass on to their children. I am about to become a father for the first time, but I am not thinking about passing on my wealth to my children; I want to enjoy myself while I am still alive. However, the generation before us certainly felt that it wanted to save up and pass on money to the next generation. That is not possible if people have to sell their homes to pay for care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para7"><a name="stpa_190">Rural areas such as Shropshire are underfunded. I pore over all of the funding statistics for the police, children in schools and social services. In every single funding table, Shropshire is right at the bottom. I know that it is a long way away from London and that it is a rural area, but as the MP for Shrewsbury, it really concerns me when I see Shropshire at the bottom of all the funding league tables. Ultimately, when there is a lack of funding, the emphasis on looking after the elderly falls on local authorities that simply cannot sustain such levels of expenditure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para8"><a name="stpa_191">I now come to my generation. We have to get people ready to deal with the situation. As a 34-year-old, I cannot totally rely on the state to look after my mother in 20 years&#039; time if she needs care. I very much hope to be able to look after her in my own home, but not everyone can afford to look after their elderly relatives in their home as part of the family. My generation will experience this problem in 20 years&#039; time, when our parents, who are now in their late 50s or early 60s, will be in their 80s. Taxation is going up significantly and young people are not saving as a result; they are also burdened by the high cost of buying their first home. From talking to young people in Shrewsbury, it seems that very few of them are saving at all. They are making little provision for looking after their elderly relatives. When I say this to people of my age, they look at me with a blank expression; it has not even registered that they should be taking out insurance or saving up to look after their parents in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para9"><a name="stpa_192">In the House, we tend to look at things as they are now, because we deal with problems that face us today, but I hope that the Government will consider the problem in relation to the future, because it is important that my generation should start to be more accountable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para10"><a name="stpa_193">The Government&#039;s role is to incentivise people of my generation to make provision for their parents, who will live much longer than people do now. Some of them 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 230WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
will live to be 90 or even 100, by which time many will have eked out their savings and downsized their homes. My parents, who have retired, are going to sell their family home and move further away from London in order to release capital to pay for their retirement. When they are older, they will have even less to look after themselves than people do now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para11"><a name="stpa_194">The Government should look to partner people of my age in preparing themselves and their families for the future. I hope that the Minister can tell us what steps the Government are taking to provide tax incentives for people to make such provision. Various insurance companies are starting to do work in this field and to introduce proposals to protect people in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para12"><a name="stpa_195">The Government have introduced other major initiatives such as baby bonds. People might ask, &quot;Why is a Tory trying to interfere in this aspect of society? Surely you should leave market forces to deal with it,&quot; but I say no. I feel passionately and compassionately about this matter. It is our responsibility to ensure that our parents and other people are looked after, particularly in 20 or 30 years&#039; time, and that there is some form of private insurance in place, or that the state has looked into this matter with a view to providing a solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para13"><a name="stpa_196">The most important point that I make today is about my constituents, many of whom have come to see me, such as Mr. Cartwright. Many of them&#151;I am going back from my generation to the generation of today&#151;are arguing with the Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority and the ombudsman about who is responsible for paying for their relatives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para14"><a name="stpa_197">Mr. Cartwright&#039;s mother died two years ago, but he is, unfortunately, still going through the protracted and painful process of interacting with the local health authority and the ombudsman because he is convinced that his mother should have received free care in her nursing home. She did not. Everything had to be sold; all of her assets went and she was left, on the day she died, with about &#163;250 in her account. Fortunately for her&#151;I hate to say this&#151;she died at the right time, because there was no money left to look after her. I would like the Minister to look into the case of Mr. Cartwright of Telford estate, Monkmoor, Shrewsbury, because he has suffered greatly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para15"><a name="stpa_198">Our fellow citizens&#151;they are more than constituents&#151;are going through an extremely traumatic battle of ping-pong between the ombudsman and their health authority, and they are not getting satisfactory answers to their genuine concerns. I know that the Government have to deal with hundreds of thousands of cases, but one reason why I asked for this debate is because one thing that a Member of Parliament can do is focus the spotlight on constituents who have faced trauma.
</p>

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60328h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Caroline Flint) </b> : I am pleased to take part in this Adjournment debate with you, Mr. Hood, and the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski), whom I congratulate on securing it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para16"><a name="stpa_199">The hon. Gentleman made several interesting points. He is right to draw attention to the shifting issues over a number of generations. When the national health service was introduced by a Labour Government&#151;I am afraid 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 231WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the Conservative party voted against its creation&#151;the health issues faced by politicians and health professionals were different to those faced today. People died a lot younger in 1945 and the following decades than they do in the 21st century. We welcome that, but it brings challenges regarding people planning for their future and the sort of care that they want and need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para17"><a name="stpa_200">The hon. Gentleman will know from his constituency work, as I do from mine, that the needs of older people vary enormously. The other week, I met a woman in her 80s who was active and fit, and lived independently in her own home, but I have also met people in their 70s who do not have her level of fitness and need a variety of care. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para18"><a name="stpa_201">There has also been a change in the expectations of different generations as they get older. I was a little perturbed to hear someone on the radio use the term &quot;elderly&quot; to describe people aged over 50. That was somewhat ridiculous. The issue of what people expect is important. The expectations of my grandmother&#151;she was born in the first part of the 20th century&#151;and of my mother, who was born at the end of world war two, in relation to their lifestyles, perceptions and needs in their 50s, 60s and 70s, are very different to what I expect for myself and my children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para19"><a name="stpa_202">A good change is that people are less deferent and do not simply accept what they are offered. They now have some say in how services are provided. That is one reason why the Government have tried since 1997 to look not only at nursing care homes&#151;that very phrase conjures up a particular picture of older people living in those facilities. They have also considered how services can be provided nearer to home by health services working with local authorities, and enabling people who choose to do so to live as independently as possible in their own homes or in family homes with others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para20"><a name="stpa_203">There have been dynamic changes in the provision of supported or sheltered housing. Technology has moved on to such an extent that older people can run their own lives knowing that there is someone catering for their needs. I pay tribute to what has been done in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) with Housing Hartlepool. I recently visited Richard court, which has a 24/7 service whereby a resident can call a number and someone will be ready to answer their call and assist them with health-related needs, repairs or concerns about intruders or people causing problems in the area. Clearly, steps are being taken to provide a variety of assistance such as supported housing and care within a home setting, and to use technology to meet people&#039;s needs as they grow older. That is absolutely right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para21"><a name="stpa_204">An estimated one in three women in Britain, and one in five men, will eventually need some form of long-term care. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the funding of such care is an issue that will touch many people&#039;s lives at some point. We have to deal with people who are in that situation, and with people and their families who are approaching such decisions. We must also consider younger people, who might not think about this issue, and what their needs will be 30, 40 or 50 years down the road.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para22"><a name="stpa_205">It would be helpful at this stage to draw out some of the distinctions between nursing care and other support. Nursing care is care by a registered nurse, who provides, plans and supervises a person&#039;s health care.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 232WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para23"><a name="stpa_206">In 2001, we delivered on the commitment set out in the NHS plan to remove the anomaly that residents of care homes did not automatically receive free nursing care as they would in other care settings. That was an important, positive and progressive decision by the Government and it ensured that 42,000 people now get nursing care free of charge from the NHS, when they would previously have had to fund it themselves. That is a clear change. I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#039;s recognition of the positive changes since 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para24"><a name="stpa_207">Charging for care is not new. People have always had to pay or contribute towards the cost of social care. The National Assistance Act 1948 sets out the framework within which local authorities decide what people can afford to contribute. Capital assets and income, including the former home, have always been taken into account in making that assessment. That is nothing new; it was there at the start of the NHS and has influenced policy ever since. However, no one should be forced to sell their home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para25"><a name="stpa_208">Working with local authorities, the Government have recognised the opportunity and local authorities provide an interest-free loan secured against the property. That means that where the arrangements are appropriate, someone can keep their house even if they are in some form of residential care. However, as and when they die the council or the local authority has a claim against the cost of that individual&#039;s social care. That is a step forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para26"><a name="stpa_209">Local authorities means-test whether people have to make a contribution. They have to give a direction of choice, with a variety of providers. When someone chooses not to opt for the local authority choice, there is also provision for them to consider something that suits their needs elsewhere. If they are eligible, the local authority will pay its part of the cost with the option of the person topping up the payments if they want a choice other than those it provides. Efforts have been made to consider how we deliver that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para27"><a name="stpa_210">I am pleased to say that in 2005 Shropshire county council moved from a two-star to a three-star rating for its services for children and adults. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it is working to improve its services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para28"><a name="stpa_211">The other support available includes personal care&#151;help to carry out personal activities such as bathing, dressing and undressing, eating and using the lavatory&#151;and continuing health care for people who require the highest degree of support, where the NHS pays the entire cost of care, as it would if their care was being provided in an NHS hospital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para29"><a name="stpa_212">The past two decades have witnessed significant changes. In many respects, there used to be no choice. Care was provided in a long-stay hospital ward or not at all. Now, increasingly, people get intensive support that enables them to live independently in their own home. I think we would all agree that many people would like to have that choice, if it is appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para30"><a name="stpa_213">The shift away from the acute sector has in many respects been positive, not least because it has enabled care to be delivered more appropriately and effectively. It is interesting how different practices are used in different parts of the country. Care has been delivered in a more homely environment, allowing people to maintain their independence.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 233WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para31"><a name="stpa_214">As I said before, people have always had to pay for or contribute towards the cost of social care. Removing means-testing for care services would have profound and long-lasting implications. Personal care alone would cost an additional &#163;1.5 billion a year, rising to an estimated &#163;3 billion a year by 2020. Board and lodging would cost many more billions a year. There is a balance to be struck between providing nursing care free, as it would be in an NHS setting, and coming to an arrangement to pay for the personal care towards which someone in a different setting has to contribute. We have tried to consider systems that deal with that as smoothly as possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para32"><a name="stpa_215">Provision of free personal care could divert resources from services that benefit all older and disabled people. The announcements made in the past year and in the Budget of free transport for older people, for example, have a cost, as does the winter fuel allowance. We have to come up with a package in which the Government play their role and take their responsibilities, but within that there is a challenge for individuals and their families to look at their own lives and plan for their futures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para33"><a name="stpa_216">I cannot answer all the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions about tax incentives, but I shall be happy to pass them on to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), who is the Minister responsible. I hope that he will be able to write back to the hon. Gentleman.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para34"><a name="stpa_217">Eligibility for NHS-funded continuing care has in recent years been the subject of much debate. NHS continuing care eligibility criteria were designed to identify those who have a primary need for ongoing health care, as distinct from help with the daily activities of personal care. That has proved to be problematic, not least for individuals and their families&#151;I think Mr. Cartwright probably falls into this category&#151;who could not understand why similar types of care were sometimes free and sometimes means- tested.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para35"><a name="stpa_218">We are aware of the difficulties around the interpretation and application of the criteria and concerns about whether they have been too restrictive in practice. Individual court judgments of which the hon. Gentleman might be aware have provided some clarification of the responsibilities of the NHS and social services for long-term care, including the Coughlan judgment in 1999 and the recent Grogan judgment. We acknowledge that mistaken decisions about individuals&#039; eligibility have been made in the past and we have asked strategic health authorities to review their eligibility criteria again following the Grogan case and to ensure that their eligibility and decision-making processes are lawful in the light of that judgment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para36"><a name="stpa_219">We have already announced plans to develop a national framework for NHS continuing health care to achieve greater clarity, transparency and consistency in making decisions. I will ensure that my hon. Friend the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 234WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Under-Secretary is aware of the comments raised in relation to Mr. Cartwright&#039;s case. I cannot say that he will be able to intervene, but I will ask him to consider the case. It is clear from what the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said that Mr. Cartwright is pursuing his case through the channels that the Government have set up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para37"><a name="stpa_220">We plan to consult publicly on the national framework soon. It will sit alongside a broader range of measures to improve the quality of care and provide a fairer system. We take the care of our older people seriously and, as the hon. Gentleman will know, this Government published the national service framework for older people in 2001.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para38"><a name="stpa_221">One of the central pillars of the framework is the single assessment process, which is meant to ensure that the needs, wishes and perceptions of older people are placed at the heart of the assessment process and that the subsequent planning and delivery of services are informed by that. Linked to the assessment process is the fair access to care services guidance, which was issued to councils in May 2002 and implemented in April 2003. It provides councils with an eligibility framework for adult social care to use when setting and applying their eligibility criteria.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para39"><a name="stpa_222">Extra care housing offers independence and choice to individuals to own or rent self-contained flats yet also have access to 24-hour support of the type that is provided in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool, as well as other services such as meals, domestic help, and onsite leisure and recreational facilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para40"><a name="stpa_223">We have also introduced &#163;185 million each year for the carers grant, which provides local authorities with the means to provide respite breaks and services for carers in England. We have introduced a performance indicator, which ensures that councils recognise that support for carers continues to be a priority for the Government. We need to build on that to improve health and well-being so that more people can remain independent in their homes, where appropriate. At the same time, we have to ensure that where that is not possible people in residential care settings are treated with dignity and respect. Not only the individuals but their families should feel fully supported by the care plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para41"><a name="stpa_224">Such developments are leading to a more flexible pattern of provision of care, which can better respond to the needs and wishes of patients and their families. A record number of people are being supported to live independently and are being offered a choice of care and support when they leave hospital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h03_para42"><a name="stpa_225">The steps that we are taking are improving the situation. We must continue to provide wider choices. This is not a debate that starts and finishes with a general election&#151;

<a name="time_15">
<a name="60328h04_time0"><h5>1 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60328h04_spnew0"><b> Ian Lucas  (Wrexham)</b>  (Lab): It is a great pleasure to have secured this debate on my twin passions of manufacturing industry and renewable energy. It is a particular pleasure to have secured a debate under you, Mr. Hood, and to have the opportunity to speak to my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy on this important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para0"><a name="stpa_226">This has been an auspicious seven days for microgeneration. The Chancellor&#039;s announcement in last week&#039;s Budget of an additional &#163;50 million in investment for microgeneration has been widely welcomed, even by Greenpeace, which said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;The measures on energy efficiency and microgeneration are very positive and will help bring forward low-carbon buildings and a decentralised energy system.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para1"><a name="stpa_227">That is high praise indeed from an organisation that has been one of the Government&#039;s most vociferous critics, and I am pleased that the Government have taken such positive steps.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para2"><a name="stpa_228">At the outset, I should declare that I have a substantial constituency interest in microgeneration. Sharp, in my constituency, is one of the few United Kingdom plants manufacturing photovoltaic solar cells. It had been in Wrexham for about 20 years before it began manufacturing cells there in July 2004. Since its decision to invest in Wrexham and to show confidence in the work force there, it has been rewarded by the work force with a tripling of photovoltaic solar cell production at the factory. The site has therefore expanded and there has been real development in the renewable energy sector in north Wales. Indeed, north Wales is developing a reputation as something of a renewable energy hub. We have the North Hoyle offshore wind farm, and the planning stage has begun for Gwynt-y-Mor wind farm, which will produce energy on a much larger scale. I enthusiastically support that project.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para3"><a name="stpa_229">In north-east Wales, we also have a strong tradition in manufacturing industry. That is very important in my constituency, where a quarter of the work force is employed in manufacturing. There are also historic energy links because the north-east Wales coalfield produced energy for many years and was part of the powerhouse that the UK economy was in the past. I want that energy production to continue in the new century, with microgeneration and manufacturing developing together to create new jobs and new potential in the north-east Wales economy. In the renewable energy industry, we have a huge opportunity to develop the UK&#039;s manufacturing base and we must seize it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para4"><a name="stpa_230">I am presently engaged in discussions with Wrexham county borough council and the Welsh Assembly to develop the use of renewable energies in Wrexham. We must use the fact that the town now has a reputation for producing manufacturing goods in microgeneration to ensure that the development that is taking place in the town uses renewable energy as far as possible. In that way, the town will become a showcase for the potential of renewables and demonstrate how the difficulties of global warming can be addressed.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 236WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para5"><a name="stpa_231">As I mentioned, production of photovoltaic solar cells in Wrexham has tripled in less than two years, and there is huge and increasing demand for them, but they are largely being exported. As the Minister is aware, the biggest market for them in Europe is in Germany. For some years, the German Government have pursued an active strategy of promoting solar energy, and their successful 100,000 roofs programme is recognised to have caught the German public&#039;s imagination, encouraging individual householders to take steps to produce their own energy, rather than see it as something that is always produced far away by a large power station.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para6"><a name="stpa_232">What is perhaps less well known is that the solar industry in Germany has been successful in promoting employment. Against the backcloth of the difficult employment situation in Germany over the past five years, photovoltaics have been a manufacturing success story. According to the Bundesverband Solarindustrie, 30,000 people are now employed in Germany in the production, distribution and installation of solar systems, with 20,000 employed in photovoltaic technology and 10,000 employed in solar heat technology. In the past year alone, 5,000 new jobs have been created in the booming photovoltaic sector, and it is predicted that as many people will shortly be employed in solar energy as in heavy coal mining. Over the past five years, turnover in the German solar power sector has increased by an average of 43 per cent. per annum and turnover for 2005 is predicted to be &#8364;2.7 billion.

<a name="60328h04_para7"><a name="stpa_233">Solar energy and microgeneration are therefore big business, and I am pleased to say that the United Kingdom is benefiting from the development of photovoltaics not only in Germany, but in other European economies, such as Spain and the Netherlands. The factory in Wrexham, for example, is exporting to those countries on a huge and increasing scale as their domestic markets develop. However, those who work in the UK microgeneration industry have been frustrated by the fact that development in our domestic market has been rather slow in comparison, and that is where the Chancellor&#039;s announcement last week can be so important. The energy White Paper set out the goals for energy policy, including renewables, but there has been confusion over the successor to the clear skies programme in the past two years. The announcement of the low-carbon buildings programme, coupled with the Chancellor&#039;s commitment to provide an additional &#163;50 million in investment, is a real opportunity to get the development of microgeneration back on track.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para8"><a name="stpa_234">I make a plea that the central focus of the strategy to take microgeneration forward should be not simply on the UK domestic market, but on the individual domestic consumer. Indeed, I sense that we are on the cusp of a large increase in demand for individuals to make their own contribution to the fight against global warming. In that respect, I must pay tribute to the excellent work of my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen), who has done so much to take forward the concept of individuals taking responsibility for their own carbon footprint. In my constituency, Sharp recognises that more work needs to be done on education and has committed itself to developing an education centre on the Wrexham site. It is encouraging 
<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
local schools and local industry to visit the plant and become much more aware of the potential of photovoltaics and of the way in which the industry can develop to provide a renewable base in the fight against global warming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para9"><a name="stpa_235">However, the Government must play a central role. In designing the new low-carbon buildings programme, they must commit to a real expansion of stream 1 funding to help make microgeneration accessible to the domestic consumer. The present proposed funding is &#163;3.5 million, falling to &#163;2 million in year two of the project and &#163;1 in year three. However, public demand is much greater and was about &#163;4.5 million last year so, even at the present stage, public demand exceeds the fund&#039;s capacity to deliver. Given the Chancellor&#039;s announcement this week, it is important that we increase stream 1 funding to at least the level that is required to meet current demand. Indeed, I hope that we can increase it above that level so that future demand can also be met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para10"><a name="stpa_236">I also make a plea for simplifying the process of securing the benefit of grants for consumers. I confess that I speak as someone who downloaded the application forms for the clear skies programme around 18 months ago. Confronted with those long forms, which have sat on the corner of my desk since, I never got past the first page, which asked for the square metreage of my roof. I did not undertake to investigate that&#151;I thought of sending my son up to check, but thought that somewhat reminiscent of chimney-sweeps in the 19th century. The forms are seriously intimidating to someone who is keen to invest in microgeneration. A straightforward system for individuals would be much more effective, so that they could ensure that they had easy access to microgeneration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para11"><a name="stpa_237">The cause is very noble. We are all committed to addressing the problems of global warming. We have heard the news on climate change in the past three days, which is of some concern. We need to establish that individuals have a responsibility to make a contribution. The Government need to put in place a system that will facilitate that. In addition, we can develop our own manufacturing sector in the industry. There is a real demand across Europe for microgeneration, which a company based in Britain is now meeting, although that demand is less within the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para12"><a name="stpa_238">Given the investment that the Government have put in place, we have an opportunity to create domestic demand in the UK. We have can demonstration projects but, even more importantly, individuals need to decide to join the fight against global warming. If they do so and if we create a strong domestic market, that will mean more employment in the UK in both microgeneration and manufacturing. I suggest that we should work firmly towards that worthy goal over the next few months. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me that commitment.

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60328h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Energy  (Malcolm Wicks) </b> : My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) should be congratulated on his sense of timing. Not only was there a useful Budget announcement on microgeneration, but

<br>&nbsp;<br>
today sees the publication of the climate change strategy and of our microgeneration strategy. His sense of timing should be commended to the England manager&#151;I do not know whether my hon. Friend is a footballer, but we need more of that timing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para13"><a name="stpa_239">My hon. Friend raised important and interesting points about micro renewable energy in the UK, and the contribution of the photovoltaic sector in particular. We remain committed to micro renewable energy and to the development of a sustainable market for such technologies. We have demonstrated that commitment in support of the clear skies and PV programmes, which have made a considerable contribution to the development of markets for those technologies. However, we want to go further and create sustainable markets for technologies of that sort.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para14"><a name="stpa_240">These programmes are due to finish at the end of this month, but they will be superseded, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, by the low-carbon buildings programme, which is due to start in a few days&#039; time, at the beginning of April 2006. Although the current programmes have gone some way towards raising awareness of the potential of renewable energy, we still have some way to go. In November 2005, I announced a &#163;30 million budget over three years, and the Chancellor added a further &#163;50 million in his Budget statement, as has been said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para15"><a name="stpa_241">The low-carbon buildings programme was designed following a review of the UK&#039;s potential renewable energy resources that was conducted in 2004, the renewables innovation review. The review recommended that we continue to support the installation of photovoltaics and other small-scale renewables through a low-carbon building programme. The new programme will mark a significant change to current grant programmes as it aims to take a more holistic approach to reducing carbon emissions, by using innovative combinations of microgeneration technologies and energy efficiency measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para16"><a name="stpa_242">Although there will be continued support for individual installations, there will be a shift in emphasis to large-scale developments. The focus on larger developments is designed to engage the construction sector more widely and to increase the take-up of microgeneration products in new build and refurbished developments. It is hoped that the change in focus will go some way towards constructing standard low-carbon buildings that can be more easily replicated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para17"><a name="stpa_243">The Department of Trade and Industry will be working closely with the Carbon Trust to develop that aspect of the programme, which will be important to ensure that projects deliver the low-carbon developments that we want. We aim to promote those developments in ways that clearly communicate the replicability, cost-effectiveness and appeal of low-carbon technologies. We also need to engage the wider construction industry in understanding the potential of microgeneration technologies and how to use such technologies, combined with energy efficiency measures, to develop buildings with low-carbon footprints.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para18"><a name="stpa_244">We believe that the low-carbon buildings programme and the microgeneration strategy will provide a great stimulus to the microgeneration industry, building on what has been achieved over the past few years. The 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 239WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
microgeneration strategy will aim to tackle the non-grant barriers that have been hindering the development of sustainable markets for microgeneration technologies. One of the barriers has been acknowledged by my hon. Friend and, as by-elections are expensive, we need to prevent MPs from clambering on their roofs to measure square metreage. I am slightly shocked that my hon. Friend did not know the square metreage of his roof, but there we go. That is the sort of planning barrier that we need to overcome, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working hard with us on that strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para19"><a name="stpa_245">The need for improved information provision at all levels and the importance of a trusted accreditation programme for products and installers that can build confidence in the industry are some of the measures that we aim to take to raise awareness of such technologies and to build a sustainable market. Other areas that the microgeneration strategy will address are regulations and planning, and how they affect the development of the policy. The strategy will also look at the physical infrastructure, in terms of technical issues that need to be resolved with metering and the connection of microgenerators to the distribution network. My hon. Friend may have noted that the Chancellor has provided moneys in the Budget for the development of smart metering, so that people will be able to see the contribution that microgeneration is making to their electricity supply. Other issues that we need to consider are relevant to the photovoltaic and other sectors, and I commend the strategy to my hon. Friend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para20"><a name="stpa_246">Sharp contributes to the economic development of Wrexham. I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s point that we can now develop renewables as a major manufacturing industry or industries. I also take his points about the comparison with Germany. Under the PV programme, I understand that Sharp modules have been used on grant-funded work to the tune of more than &#163;790,000 on household projects and more than &#163;2.4 million on larger-scale projects. Let us be clear that Sharp and other companies will continue to benefit under the new programme and the wider measures that the strategy will seek to introduce.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para21"><a name="stpa_247">I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that the new measures are good news for the PV industry. Although the new programme will not be a dedicated programme for PV&#151;I know some have argued for it, and there has been some disappointment&#151;the more holistic approach is important as it will provide ongoing support for the development of the market for PV.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para22"><a name="stpa_248">That change of approach in the Government&#039;s support for the microgeneration industry builds on our past commitment to PV. We have committed &#163;41 million to the major PV demonstration programme and the PV field trials since 2001, and we expect photovoltaics to be a significant technology in the new programme. We want to see the full potential of all microgeneration technologies being developed in the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para23"><a name="stpa_249">The photovoltaics sector also benefits from Government support for industry-led research and development through the technology programme. Research and development into PV technology is important on a global scale in order to reduce the cost of the technology&#151;my hon. Friend will acknowledge, I think, that it is still relatively expensive&#151;and we want the UK to play a full part in that. The most advanced microgeneration technologies and the emerging ones both have a part to play.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60328h04_spnew1"><b> Ian Lucas </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reassuring me about the commitment to microgeneration and photovoltaics. Will he consider the points that I raised on stream 1 funding, as I am a little concerned about engaging individual consumers?

</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60328h04_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> : Yes, of course they will. My hon. Friend will realise that the &#163;50 million has only just been announced. Some of that money will be for social-sector housing, and some of it will be for school programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h04_para24"><a name="stpa_250">It is particularly important that we find ways to ensure that more schools have something to do with renewables, because although we still need to talk about technologies, we need also to win over hearts and minds. We want more of our children to work in schools where teachers can demonstrate how renewable technologies are working; it will help with the school&#039;s role in teaching them about the planet, geography, science and civics. Among other things, that will produce more potential customers for renewables in their own homes. We must not forget that among the greatest teachers of parents are the children themselves. We will be making further announcements about that.
</p>

<a name="60328h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Deaf-blind People (Technology Access)</h3>
<a name="time_18">
<a name="60328h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60328h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Phil Willis  (Harrogate and Knaresborough)</b>  (LD): It is difficult for those of us who enjoy the gifts of sight and hearing to imagine life without either, and impossible to imagine how we would cope. Today&#039;s short debate is about confronting the issues surrounding deaf-blindness and what society, the Government and Parliament can do to support deaf-blind people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para0"><a name="stpa_252">I pay tribute to Sense, the charity that supports deaf-blind people, and its 2005 report &quot;Make Technology Work&quot;, which brought this key issue to the attention of the public and Parliament. I also recognise the contribution of many private sector companies in supporting deaf-blind people with technology. British Telecom has a long-standing tradition of providing assistance and assistive products to people with sensory impairments. I should also mention Ofcom; following the introduction of the Communications Act 2003, it did a great deal of work to encourage accessible electronic communications equipment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para1"><a name="stpa_253">Thankfully, relatively few people are deaf and blind; 23,000 people&#151;fewer than 25 per constituency&#151;are registered for both disabilities in the UK. That figure is small compared with the 378,000 registered as blind or partially sighted and the 8.9 million registered as deaf or hard of hearing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para2"><a name="stpa_254">Of course, very few people are completely deaf and blind; most have some residual sight or hearing. Some people are born deaf-blind as a result of maternal rubella, although thanks to vaccination that is very rare. Some genetic conditions such as Usher syndrome lead to deaf-blindness from late adolescence and people can become deaf-blind at any time through meningitis or accident. However, increasingly, age-related conditions result in sight and hearing loss, and those who already have a sight or hearing problem are particularly susceptible to dual loss later in life. It is therefore important that in responding, the Minister recognises the importance of supporting measures that can assist a wide spectrum of people with hearing and sight difficulties, and not simply the 23,000 registered as deaf-blind.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para3"><a name="stpa_255">Remarkable breakthroughs in medical science have helped prevent deaf-blindness, and they will continue. Last week, the Chancellor announced that the Medical Research Council and the NHS research initiative will combine. That will make huge inroads into some of that work. However, today&#039;s generations of sufferers look to technology for support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para4"><a name="stpa_256">All of us&#151;certainly those in this Chamber&#151;use technology every day. For deaf-blind people, access to technology can be a matter of life and death. Research by Sense has showed that most deaf-blind people use assistive equipment, although sadly, about half of those surveyed have difficulties using the very technology that is there to help them. Many such problems are caused by manufacturers&#039; lack of understanding of the needs of people with sensory impairments, and some of the difficulties could have been avoided if such needs had been considered carefully at the design stage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para5"><a name="stpa_257">Deaf-blindness is a low-incidence disability, meaning that there is low demand for some types of assistive equipment. That causes two problems: there is limited 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 242WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
incentive for manufacturers to make such equipment, and it can be expensive to produce. Some of the equipment that deaf-blind people rely on, such as Braille clocks, vibrating light probes and sound monitors, is no longer available. That means that users who have got used to that technology often cannot get their equipment repaired or replace it if it stops working.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para6"><a name="stpa_258">Low demand means that the market alone will never deliver accessible technology to this vulnerable group; intervention is needed. However, the legal situation is complicated. For instance, manufactured goods are excluded from the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 because they are regulated in Europe and not in the UK. It is ironic that someone with a sensory impairment can sue a retailer under the 2005 Act for refusing to serve them in a shop, but has no redress if none of the equipment on sale in the shop is accessible to them. That cannot be right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para7"><a name="stpa_259">Even when equipment is accessible to deaf-blind people, manufacturers are not obliged to produce instructions in accessible formats. Even the simplest equipment can cause huge difficulties for deaf-blind people. Hearing aids are vital for most such people; however, having a visual impairment makes hearing aids more difficult to use. Changing the battery in a hearing aid can be problematic for a person with low vision, because the battery and its chamber are so small; if the battery rolls away, it can be almost impossible to find. The hearing aid itself can be dropped, and for a person with hearing loss and poor vision, dropping a hearing aid on a patterned carpet can ruin a whole day. They would not be able to see the aid, nor hear where it fell. How on earth would they find it?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para8"><a name="stpa_260">Television is a vital source of information and entertainment for most deaf-blind people and subtitling and audio descriptions are making an increasing proportion of programmes accessible. However, remote controls with rows and rows of small buttons with tiny writing can be difficult to operate. I confess that I&#151;let alone somebody with sight and hearing problems&#151;find them difficult to use. The on-screen menus used to operate some set-top boxes, video recorders and DVD players are inaccessible to many deaf-blind people. The colour scheme and fonts used can make them difficult to read, and there is no sound output.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para9"><a name="stpa_261">Technology is of greatest use to deaf-blind people if it helps them to be independent when they are out and about. Take the case of Jim Hines, who is totally blind and has severe hearing loss. Last year, he had been away from London for a few days and was returning on the evening of Thursday 7 July; he knew nothing about the bombings. On arrival in London, he discovered that there were no tubes, buses or taxis at the station. Jim said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;I didn&#039;t know what to do. Because I don&#039;t have a mobile phone, I couldn&#039;t call for a taxi or for a friend to pick me up. I ended up standing on the pavement outside the station all night, wondering what was going on. It was one of the most confusing and frightening situations I&#039;ve ever been in.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para10"><a name="stpa_262">Jim finally got the tube home on Friday morning. Only after arriving home did he learn what had happened. His friends and family had been trying to contact him. They had rung the casualty bureau, but he was not listed; one can imagine what they thought. Had 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 243WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Jim had a Braille mobile phone with SMS, he could have saved himself and his family huge anxiety, but such phones cost &#163;3,000 and such technology is out of the reach of most deaf-blind people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para11"><a name="stpa_263">What can the Government do? First, let me acknowledge that the Government are doing some innovative work. I particularly compliment them for the initiative to provide tactile internet access for deaf-blind people and the &#163;500,000 research programme that was led by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Ability to use the internet can bring significant benefits for people with sensory impairments, and the translation of palm signing into internet communication through an interactive mouse may well revolutionise communication for deaf-blind people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para12"><a name="stpa_264">It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what other areas of research are planned by his Department. I acknowledge that it would be difficult for the Government to intervene in the commercial technology marketplace, but they have the chance to intervene through public procurement. That would have the twin effect of setting high standards for quality and accessibility and bringing costs down. For example, 700,000 people have now received digital hearing aids through the NHS, at a cost to the public purse of &#163;65 to &#163;75 per aid. Before the aids were available through the health service, people were paying up to &#163;2,000 per aid privately. However, the excellent procurement arrangements organised by the Government need to be supported by reducing the unacceptable waiting times experienced in many areas of the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para13"><a name="stpa_265">Perhaps the Minister will make a commitment today to include audiology, from GP referrals to the fitting of digital hearing devices, in the 18-week target for PCTs. If it is not included, we may well see that crucial service slip down the priority list as other funding pressures emerge. Perhaps he will go a step further, by reassuring the audiology service that recurring funding for service and replacement will be built into baseline budgets this year. Some &#163;38 million was expected to go into routine audiology, but as yet there has been no commitment by the Department of Health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para14"><a name="stpa_266">The success of the Government&#039;s public procurement of digital hearing aids will hopefully give them confidence to seize other important opportunities on behalf of deaf-blind people. The mass distribution of set-top boxes to older and disabled people for the purposes of digital switchover is such an opportunity; it is a key one. That must not be a project just for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport but one in which the Department of Health plays a crucial role at the design stage. Digital broadcasting will open up huge opportunities for deaf-blind people, but if accessible technology is not built into the set-top boxes they will be lost. Will the Minister say what steps his Department is taking to influence the design of set-top boxes for the digital switchover?
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para15"><a name="stpa_267">Another opportunity for the Government to help stimulate demand for accessible technology is the new public sector duty to promote disability equality. Public sector bodies that are procuring equipment should undertake a disability equality impact assessment. Will the Minister tell us how the Government are monitoring that new public sector duty and what steps he intends to take to ensure that deaf-blind people receive appropriate assessment for, and advice about, technological aids by appropriately trained staff? That should be happening 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Mar 2006 : Column 244WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
under his Department&#039;s guidance, but clearly it is not. The Sense survey found that 30 different types of professionals carried out assessments, ranging from therapists to social services staff. A simple step would be for the Minister to issue guidance on what qualifications assessors should have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para16"><a name="stpa_268">Sadly, the Government do not have direct responsibility for the regulation of manufactured goods and the issue of accessible technology; it is the responsibility of our friends in the European Parliament. However, I hope that the Government will make clear their representations in that key area. After all, a misunderstanding of the controls on a cooker can have disastrous effects for any of us, but for a deaf-blind person the problem is acute. Relatively simple universal tactile instructions on appliances such as cookers, ovens, washing machines and mobile phones would solve a great many of the problems, as would a legal requirement to make instruction booklets available in a format that could be used by deaf-blind people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para17"><a name="stpa_269">Despite the concerns of many deaf-blind people about the suitability of existing technology, many responded to the Sense survey in a positive way; whether we are talking about the use of Mobile Magnifier for mobile phones, the cordless telephone or the easier to read flat-screen TV, it is clear that where manufacturers design products with the deaf-blind in mind there is a great deal of satisfaction. Those products can be used by a wide range of other people. There was even praise for some manufacturers. Zanussi offers a simple Braille replacement for the front of its washing machines. It is a simple piece of technology that enables the machines to be used by a wide range of people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para18"><a name="stpa_270">Technology is improving all the time, but the fast pace of change also means that some deaf-blind people fear being left behind. The trend is for smaller pieces of equipment with more functions, and for more and smaller controls. Deaf-blind people are worried that the assistive equipment they own will quickly become out of date and that they will be unable to afford the high price of new equipment. Technology is vital for deaf-blind people, as it is for many of us. Our role as parliamentarians is to ensure that we work with the Government to ensure that their voice is heard.

have been made in the health service over the past six or seven years, which is not an accident; such advances have occurred because we have doubled the amount of money that has gone into it. As a result of the extra 100,000 staff who have been hired and the falling waiting lists, life expectancy has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased. This year, England has the lowest infant mortality rate in its history. Those medical advances and the advances in care and the national health service mean that more children will survive for longer, including many with severe learning disabilities.

<a name="60328h05_para21"><a name="stpa_273">Although the hon. Gentleman is right to say that advances in medical science mean that conditions such as deaf-blindness may in future be on the decrease, the number of children with complex disabilities surviving into adulthood may increase. The health and the care systems need to change to take account of that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para22"><a name="stpa_274">There are great opportunities to use technology to ensure that those individuals are able to live life to the full in future. I think that it was Albert Einstein who, at the beginning of the cold war, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para23"><a name="stpa_275">Over the next few years we have the chance to reverse that aphorism, because technology will enable many people to fulfil the full potential of their humanity. For that to happen, it is vital that public services are reformed so that public servants who are responsible for delivering them have the freedom and flexibility to combine together in new ways to improve them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para24"><a name="stpa_276">The hon. Gentleman will know that our new White Paper confirms the vision set out in the social care Green Paper &quot;Independence Well-being and Choice: Our Vision for the Future of Social Care for Adults in England&quot; and sets out practical steps to turn that vision into reality. We talked about the need to bring far more personalised services together by improving assessment, for example by introducing individual budgets that bring five or six different income streams from across Government together in one care account for the individual to spend as they see fit. Supporting healthier, independent lives through a proper risk-management framework will be important, as will a much stronger emphasis on preventive services in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para25"><a name="stpa_277">Key to all of this is ensuring that the national health service, social care and other local government services, in particular housing, are orchestrated together in a completely new way. That better integration involves thinking holistically about the needs of the individual, rather than simply questioning their eligibility and finding ways to deny them service This agenda is about empowerment. That personalisation is about listening to individuals, recognising their ability to determine what they need and then delivering the sorts of services that are necessary to them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para26"><a name="stpa_278">I want to highlight the things that we hope to sweep away, one of which was highlighted by the Commission for Social Care Inspection report &quot;Real Voices, Real Choices&quot; that was published this week. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;The NHS Audiology department tends to provide information about physical and health related matters, rather than social and emotional aspects of deafness. It should be able to recognise and help with all aspects.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60328h05_para27"><a name="stpa_279">That is exactly the sort of problem that we want to address by bringing the health service and the social care system far closer together.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para28"><a name="stpa_280">This is not a trivial ambition; it is about something important. In the past seven years we have delivered the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth ever known in this country. More people are in work than ever before and we have created a couple of million new businesses. This society is far richer in opportunity, but the challenge is now for us to ensure that everybody in the country has the chance to flourish to the full, irrespective of their background or ethnicity, where they live or what circumstances they have encountered in life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para29"><a name="stpa_281">We know that disabled people are less likely to be in full-time education or in work. They are more likely to feel a lack of confidence and a lack of support. The reasons behind that are not straightforward, nor are they always related to somebody&#039;s health impairment or health condition. Attitudes in society play a significant part. How we structure our services for disabled young people is crucial. That is why the extension of the disability discrimination legislation, the establishment of the Disability Rights Commission and changing the ways in which Jobcentre Plus and Connexions work are very important. Those are ambitions that were encapsulated in our 20-year strategy set out in the &quot;Improving the life chances of disabled people&quot; report. Its aim is very simple but also very powerful: to ensure that disabled people will be given the maximum opportunity to fulfil their potential.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para30"><a name="stpa_282">I shall talk about some of the necessary practical steps, and respond to some of the important points raised by the hon. Gentleman. First, we know that working together at both central Government level and local level is essential. That is why we set up the Office for Disability Issues, to act as a bridge between Departments at the centre by creating the mechanisms to ensure that they work together more effectively. That is not just to do with health and social care issues; it is also to do with matters handled by other Departments, such as trade and industry. The work of the Department of Trade and Industry has an important bearing on this agenda.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para31"><a name="stpa_283">Examples of how that joint working manifests itself are already coming through. We are supporting services at the local level&#151;for example, by working with a wide range of groups to develop revised eye care pathways. In addition to the certificate of vision impairment, we have developed two new documents for use in hospitals and on the high street to facilitate easier access to support services prior to certification. Why is that important? One reason is that it will help social services identify people who need support in a timelier manner, before they lose independence and confidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para32"><a name="stpa_284">Another key way to deliver change is through changing the work force. That is why I am glad to be able to say that the Department of Health is working with the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association&#151;in collaboration with other employers&#151;on a project to redesign hybrid rehabilitation functions in work with visually impaired people. Also, Skills for Care and the Children&#039;s Workforce Development Council are managing pilots to look at work force reform. It is important to ensue that there are new kinds of worker 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
with different sorts of skills because, as the hon. Gentleman highlighted, the problem of assessment is sometimes difficult.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para33"><a name="stpa_285">We are backing these ambitions with significant sums of new investment. If we combine the amount of money that is going into the health service over the next two years with the extra resources going into local authorities, the total sum is somewhere north of &#163;20 billion. That represents a significant step up in available resources, and I am proud to be able to say that it includes &#163;80 million for the preventative technologies grant, which comes on stream in a few days; local authorities will have the flexibility to invest in a range of services. We have looked into procurement arrangements as part of the planning for the spending of that grant, and I will ask Department officials to examine how issues around deaf-blindness have been considered in the development of guidance for the spending of the money, because that could provide an important opportunity over the next one to two years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para34"><a name="stpa_286">There is strong international evidence that we can improve the quality of care through technology. The hon. Gentleman asked about that. The new and emerging applications of the technology programme cover all areas of health and social care; there is a budget of about &#163;1.2 million to develop new and innovative uses of technology. In addition, the annual budget for the health care technology development programme is &#163;2 million. The remit of that programme covers novel information technology that looks into how there might be significant improvements in the performance of health care technologies. Recently funded projects include many of direct relevance to disabled people, such as speech-driven environmental control systems, stair-climbing and walking aids, which are very practical applications. For a number of years, the policy research programme has provided a horizon-scanning role in relation to developments in information and communication technologies. All of these things are important, but unless they are translated into front-line practice, they will be of little benefit to the 20 to 25 people in each of our constituencies who might be deaf-blind.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para35"><a name="stpa_287">We have said that we expect the directors of adult social services in every part of the country to work in partnership with a range of agencies, including children&#039;s services, and health, housing and transport organisations, in order to examine what are the strategic needs of every community. We will provide guidance on how that exercise should be best performed. We expect directors of adult social services to work hand in glove with directors of public health to make sure that there is a shared understanding of the needs of different groups in every community. I said to the House a week or two

ago that, given the number of people with sensory impairments in this country, we would expect such strategic needs assessments to take good account of those needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para36"><a name="stpa_288">One of the reasons why that is important is that we will expect local authorities to ensure that adequate arrangements are in place for people with sensory impairments or other disabilities to be able to access services in the first place. Often, those barriers to access are among the most difficult hurdles for people with disabilities to leap. To ensure that there is this emphasis on service access, the Department of Health is working closely with the Disability Rights Commission. We have jointly produced leaflets&#151;such as &quot;You can make a difference: improving hospital services for disabled people&quot;&#151;for front-line staff in both primary and secondary care. They are important because they explain, and give practical examples of, the ways in which front-line staff can meet the access requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. We are also ensuring that all health and social care staff are aware of the needs of disabled people. The Department of Health and the DRC are producing a comprehensive education and learning programme, which will be available later this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para37"><a name="stpa_289">My final point is that, as we set about undertaking this process of public service reform over the coming years, it is important that change is not just drawn up and designed in Whitehall&#151;or even in the House. Instead, we should listen to the voices of people who need the services as we think about how they should be configured. The CSCI is doing that by involving people who use such services in its inspection process. Its report &quot;Real Voices, Real Choices&quot;, which I referred to earlier, considers the qualities people expect from care services and how that feeds into the inspection processes. It spoke to people who use services, and, importantly, it also spoke to their carers&#151;there are 6 million carers in this country&#151;and those who represent them. What it found was something that we all probably know in our heart of hearts, because it is simple: people want choice and flexibility in respect of services, as well as creative problem-solving, and they also want information that is available at the right time. In other words, they want to be treated with respect by a system that is fair, and which has the capacity to treat them as grown-ups and to let them, where appropriate, take risks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328h05_para38"><a name="stpa_290">We emphasised all those messages in the Green Paper on adult social care and in the White Paper. They reflect what people tell us time and again, and we must now translate that into action, in order to make a genuine difference to people&#039;s lives.
