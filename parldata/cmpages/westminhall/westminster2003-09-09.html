<P>

<a name="30909h01_para0"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Margaret Moran.]</i>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew0"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: Order. Before we begin our proceedings, I welcome hon. Members back from the summer recess, which I hope was enjoyable and relaxing for them all. We now proceed to the first debate in Westminster Hall since the House rose for the recess.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew1"><B> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North):</B> 
 Thank you for your kind words of welcome, Mr. Deputy Speaker, which we extend to you. We hope that you will have a pleasant two weeks, recuperate and then come back again. I am sure that that will do marvels for your health.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para1">Diabetes is a serious problem, as was underlined recently by a distinguished academic scholar and medical adviser to Governments, Professor Sir George Alberti. He said that we are heading for one of the biggest health catastrophes that the world has seen. He was referring not only to diabetes in this country, but to the spread of diabetes across the globe. He warned that the financial and social burden of the disease will be intolerable if Governments do not sit up, take notice and act now, not tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para2">More than 300 million people throughout the world have impaired glucose tolerance. That is a condition that precedes diabetes in which our bodies struggle against the increasing amount of sugar in the calorific foods that we are now subjected to and consume.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para3">There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 generally strikes young people without warning and leads to lifelong dependency on insulin. Type 2 is strongly linked to diet and inactivity. It is estimated that that applies to about 90 per cent. of cases. It used to afflict people from middle age as they put on excess weight&#151;we do not want anyone to be terrified or feel guilty, so let us keep the guilt out of this&#151;but it is increasingly diagnosed in younger age groups, which has rung alarm bells. The couch potato lifestyle, TV viewing, lack of activity and junk food consumption fuel the obesity crisis that is sweeping the US, the United Kingdom and, indeed, the world. In Britain, 1.7 million people have diabetes. A further 2.1 million have impaired glucose tolerance and are at serious risk of diabetes, which eventually, in the worst cases, can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage and be fatal.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para4">As Alberti pointed out, the number of people in the world with glucose intolerance problems is expected to rise from 314 million to 472 million by 2025. He reckons that about 70 per cent. of them will develop diabetes. About 194 million people&#151;roughly 5 per cent. of the world's population&#151;have diabetes. Alberti estimates that the number will soar in developing countries as the unhealthy diet and urban lifestyles of our affluent world are exported to the developing world. In some of our <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 2WH</B></P>
ethnic minority groups, diabetes is running at close to 20 per cent. and it is estimated that that will increase to 30 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para5">Enough of statistics&#151;the severity of the problem is clear to people here. We are increasingly seeing a nation that is overweight and less active and there is no doubt that a correlation has been established between increasing plumpness, less activity and an increase in the risk of developing diabetes. About half the adults in Britain are recognised to be overweight and obese. Diabetes is a diet-related disorder and in a place such as this, one does not need to look far to see the possibility of obesity creeping in as the five-star restaurants increase in number. We should feel guilty about that. Westminster is a place where red fatties mingle with yellow fatties and blue fatties and they seem to enjoy the lifestyle. We do not set much of an example.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para6">The cost of diabetes is estimated to be 9 per cent. of the national health service budget. In 2000, that was &#163;6 billion. There are regional differences, of course, but huge sums have been estimated for the diagnosis and treatment of the problems that diabetes brings.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para7">Yesterday, the head of nutrition at the Institute of Food Research in Norwich made a statement on Radio 4. I have to declare an interest, as I am a non-executive director of the institute. Professor Sue Fairweather-Tait said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The British population could miss out on opportunities arising from the current exciting era in nutritional science, including new tools for preventive health because there is no unifying champion for nutrition in the UK."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h01_para8">We certainly need social and political actions in this country to tackle the problem of the increase in diabetes. We need to think about how good the scientific evidence is and how to handle it. We do not handle scientific information in the best way politically&#151;there was a debate last night in the House about fluoride. We reject some things and we talk about dissidents, but good, proper analysis and the use of research help to establish good policies and social actions. It is known that there is a correlation between the onset and continuation of diabetes and obesity. There should be policies on the nature of the foods that we eat. I do not want to be negative because the Government have addressed the problem in many ways, but a strategic approach across Departments is needed. The purpose of the debate is to ask whether we are playing at it or whether we are serious about tackling the problem now.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para9">We must start with children. Children's commissioners were discussed in the House yesterday as well as the problems of the abuse of children and of the system ignoring them. What children eat is equally important because their health is at stake. For example, sweet drink machines are allowed in schools. The companies that make sweet drinks are clever: they give schools money and install the machines in the school, and that may correlate with the instance of diabetes. There are alternatives such as fizzy and natural water.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para10">The Government have introduced their five fruit policy and are looking at all the other issues such as those involving the NHS. Nutritionists are giving people non-Atkins diets. There is now a national debate about the type of foods that people eat, but it is always conducted in a disjointed way. That is why some of us are now keen on the idea of a new commissioner. Sue <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 3WH</B></P>
Fairweather-Tait was urged on the subject on Radio 4&#151;I do not know whether it was Humphrys or one of the other nasty people that we all learn to love on Radio 4. It may be a bad day to have a commissioner, given that we have just had a debate about a new commissioner for children. I prefer to think of a food tsar or a fatty tsar&#151;somebody who would co-ordinate all the activities across Departments, as has been done in cancer services, to ensure that every voice was heard and that our health would not be affected by the diets to which we are subjected.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para11">Sue Fairweather-Tait has discussed the controversial area of the responsibility that lies with the food industry, the manufacturers, retailers and caterers, bearing in mind that their primary business is to sell food to consumers and to generate profit, rather than to improve the health of the nation. When the Government attempted to recommend a reduction in the amount of salt in diets, the food industry resisted that move. We may have to consider legislation and incentives to encourage the industry to become more proactive. It would be unfair to say that it is doing nothing. McDonald's is offering portions of fruit in a pack, which contrasts with the burgers and so forth. At least an attempt is being made by some parts of the industry to look at the problem.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para12">I said something about the cost to the NHS, which is serious. We need a nationally co-ordinated policy across the health service, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and so on. We should ensure that everything fits together. It is not impossible to induce people to eat differently and think differently about their bodies. It can be done. We go through phases ourselves as adults, but young people are particularly vulnerable to advertising. They need activity that does not simply involve putting shorts on once a week or bringing in a sick note from their parents to excuse them from running around the playing fields.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para13">Sport should be made enjoyable and should build team spirit. It should also make young people think about their bodies, and how they can live well, exercise well and enjoy life to the full. We must ensure that the facilities are there. We need leadership here and I look to the Government for that as they started the process. I want them to recognise that a national nutritional strategy must be more than just a talking shop. It should bring all the parties and stakeholders together. It must have strong objectives, accountability, good leadership and an appropriate level of resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew2"><B> Mr. John Randall  (Uxbridge):</B> 
 I suppose that I must declare an interest as someone who will not win the slimmer of the year award. The hon. Gentleman is a well known and distinguished scientist. Does he recognise that one of the problems for the layperson is that we get so much conflicting evidence, which can be almost sensational? We might hear on the "Today" programme, for example, that salt is good. The next minute it is bad. One minute red wine is good, the next it is bad. The public have become cynical about the information that they are given.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew3"><B> Dr. Gibson </B> 
: That is true and it is not just about food that we get that kind of information. People get <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 4WH</B></P>
confused. Scientists cannot see things as black and white, yet the public are made to believe by the media that things are black and white. I am pretty sure that the sun will rise tomorrow morning in the place that it usually does, but a little part of me says that something might happen to change that. I do not want to make people panic, but who knows what can happen? The most difficult thing for scientists to say is, "We do not know. There is evidence for and evidence against."
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para14">At the end of the day people will judge for themselves. People live in a world where there are risks and they can make their own judgments on the balance of the evidence. Scientists must say, "We know this, we don't know that, but this is how we will find out." That is the purpose of this debate. The hon. Gentleman is dead right. In many areas of food science we do not know the answers. Not enough research is going on. Few research institutes in this country and the rest of the world are getting the funding to answer the questions. I will come to that in a moment when I talk about vitamins and the sort of research that we should be funding.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para15">I said something about the joining up of Departments and the need to have some individual who pulls it all together&#151;a tsar or tsarina&#151;who takes the initiatives and brings the heads together to make it work. It has worked in other areas such as heart disease and mental health. When everyone from the patient groups right up to the consultants is brought together, they learn respect for each other and what they are trying to do.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para16">I want to talk about vitamins and vitamin D in particular. I will do so in relation to type 1 diabetes in young children, because the subject correlates with many of the policies that we are trying to address in this country. Vitamin D is an important factor. It may not be the major cause of diabetes or many other illnesses, but it is a component in the chain that leads to it. Type 1 diabetes is becoming more frequent in every country&#151;the incidence of such diabetes has doubled in 20 years. The annual rate, which is averaged over 44 centres in Europe, is now estimated at 3 to 4 per cent, and the rate for the zero-to-four-years age group is 6.3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para17">A recent editorial in <i>The Lancet</i> asked burning questions. It suggested that the coming together of several public health initiatives may have reduced children's vitamin D intake. Many of us will recall being battered successfully with vitamin D to prevent rickets, and we also remember that, after the war, cod liver oil and orange juice&#151;renowned in many music hall songs&#151;were given to people, including the young, to prevent the development of illnesses. There is a history of supplying vitamin D, and I believe that it would decrease the risk of diabetes.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para18">We are advised to keep babies and toddlers out of the sun to prevent skin melanomas, and that is right. However, we should consider the other part of the argument, which is that people receive most of their vitamin D through an indirect process involving the sun's rays&#151;from a certain wavelength of UV. It is essential that people get sun. It is ironic that, although we have just had one of the best summers for a long time and been battered by the sun, many people in this country do not get much sunlight between October and March. If we are encouraged to remain out of the sun, the vitamins that the body produces by a complex process&#151;the vitamin D pathway&#151;will be suppressed <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 5WH</B></P>
and we will not receive enough. Some evidence now suggests that diabetes is associated with such a phenomenon.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para19">There are also biological and biochemical explanations of the effects of vitamin D on pancreatic cells. A mechanism involving the immune response, which is too detailed to address today, provides a basis for further research, and if there is a mechanism worth exploring, the public may want to know about it. Therefore, we must advise people on how long to be in the sun&#151;it is simply part of the pattern of life and what we take into our bodies.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para20">There is excellent evidence that a lack of vitamin D is associated with type 1 diabetes in young people. Ten thousand Finnish mothers and children took part in a study spanning 30 years, and diabetes development reduced by 80 per cent. for those given vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil in the first year of life. One isolated study is never enough but others have come to bear as well.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew4"><B> Tim Loughton  (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> 
 I am fascinated by what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and he is approaching the matter with his usual scientific expertise. If there is a correlation with access to the sun, is there evidence that in countries that have shorter days and do not have hot, sunny climates, there is a higher incidence of diabetes in children? That would support the prognosis that he is putting forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew5"><B> Dr. Gibson </B> 
: The hon. Gentleman has predicted the next study. There is very good evidence that in Europe, China and other countries, the incidence of type 1 diabetes is higher at higher latitudes where there are fewer hours of sunlight. A series of papers has been published on that subject and although that is not in itself proof, it shows that the hypothesis has merit.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para21">Iceland has an incidence of diabetes type 1 less than half that of Norway&#151;which may be because of the high fish diet. A mixture of factors mingles together and must be addressed for each particular disease. It is impossible to say simply that there is just one factor&#151;there are several factors and correlations. The research that has been done is the best possible without human trials, for which I argue that we must induce the Medical Research Council to consider investment.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para22">Studies in Norway have shown that when mothers received cod liver oil during pregnancy, there was a marked reduction in diabetes in their children. There has been another study across Europe&#151;a Eurodiab study&#151;so there have been three different studies. As well as the correlation with latitude, another interesting fact is that of the children who develop diabetes, more are born in spring and summer than at other times of the year. That is because they are going through the "dark ages" during their development, as they emerge in the spring and summer, and have had less vitamin D induction in their bodies. Those results were found in studies in Scotland, England, Wales, Slovakia and Sardinia.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para23">Alternative explanations have been proposed, such as viral infections. However, I propose the vitamin D hypothesis and say, "Prove me wrong." Let us do the work to establish whether viral infections cause the difference in different countries in relation to the time of <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 6WH</B></P>
year. Viruses tend to be used to explain anything. That argument is used, for example, to explain the incidence of leukaemia near Sellafield; it is said that people arriving from other parts of the country have brought in viruses. That is a reasonable hypothesis, which should not be dismissed, but it requires proper investigation.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para24">It seems that we should be taking action on vitamins. I am in favour of undertaking medical research into that area. The Institute of Food Research in Norwich is examining the correlation between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The immune response involved in that condition affects the development of the heart, and the institute is examining in detail the mechanisms that may be involved. Good research is being carried out in the UK on the correlation between diabetes and other illnesses, but in a piecemeal way.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para25">Research could be undertaken on the levels of vitamins in the blood, on the effect of larger doses, and a trial could be carried out in which supplements were promoted in various parts of the UK. We could consider addressing the question of vitamin deficiencies in a similar way to that in which rickets was eliminated&#151;by increasing the vitamin D content of margarine. Supplementation of milk and cereals could be encouraged through the partnerships that I discussed earlier. We should ask the chief medical officer&#151;Sir Liam Donaldson&#151;about the research that is being carried out on vitamin D supplements for pregnant women. Such research is being undertaken in the UK, but it is not focused on the correlation with diabetes.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para26">Hon. Members will know that a welfare food scheme operates in the UK. I understand that that scheme is under review and I look forward to the results of that review. The Food Standards Agency is also examining those issues. The scheme is intended to provide vitamin D to pregnant women and infants, but the figures that I have seen in the preliminary report from the FSA show that such provision seems to be decreasing, because only those people on income support receive it. Therefore, a large swathe of young people do not have access to supplements of those vitamins, because of their social conditions.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para27">I said that the welfare food scheme began in 1940&#151;with the provision of concentrated orange juice and milk to pregnant and nursing mothers, infants and children under five. The scheme was universal, but has gradually been whittled down to people on income support. Those supplements&#151;vitamins A, D and C&#151;are now given as drops, not as cod liver oil and orange juice, which I miss dearly. People can buy such supplements at mother and baby clinics&#151;and at chemists, if they think of it&#151;but they need encouragement to do so. Resources must be made available for people to access those supplements, and to provide evidence that they are necessary. We must develop our strategy on vitamins and try to relate it to diseases such as diabetes.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para28">I understand that the welfare food scheme is to be rationalised, and I hope that the Minister will comment on that. There have been reports that vitamin D supplements for certain groups of infants have been recommended as official policy but, at present, it seems that not all infants are receiving them. Will the Minister tell me what the Department will do to promote the provision of vitamin D supplements to mothers and infants, and whether it believes that that will be of benefit in terms of elimination of disease?
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 7WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h01_para29">There is also the problem of breastfeeding. Generally, breast milk is deficient in vitamin D, and so supplementation needs to be examined in that area. I do not know whether we will reach the same stage as the United States, where milk is supplemented with vitamin D. I believe that in the UK in the 1950s there was evidence of some sort of toxic effects and outbreaks of disease in infants. The data that I looked at were flaky and dodgy, but they again raise the question of the way science is handled. We need to penetrate the area more radically and consider thoughtfully how good the evidence is. That has not been done for some time and if the Food Standards Agency is doing it now, I beg it to get a move on. The increase in the incidence of diabetes needs tackling now.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para30">We face tremendous challenges with food, obesity and exercise, including on the elements that we put into our foods and generating interest in food. Young people do not always know much about food; it is just what they get stuffed into them. Many hon. Members will have seen how much fast food constituents and their children eat, because of its convenience and the speed of their lives. At the other end of the scale, we have my friend Delia and her mates doing all the celebrity cooking as if everyone in their busy lives has time to use sun-dried tomatoes.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para31">I almost said "sun-fried tomatoes", and some people do fry tomatoes, but when I visit Cromer on the north Norfolk coast for Sunday lunch in some exquisite little pub, they are not eating sun-dried tomatoes. As my wife said the other day, there is not one in sight. It is fish and chips that are being stuffed into everyone's mouths, and there are some wonderful fish and chip shops. They are not necessarily good for the diet, but they provide quick food. I am as guilty as anybody of grabbing a fish supper now and again. I was brought up on them, and they are pleasant.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para32">Prevention is the way forward, particularly with diabetes. We must examine what is in our food and conduct research into vitamins and so on, and we need an organised strategy, with one individual at the helm. That would be a real contribution that would pull together many of our separate debates, as there are all-party groups on every different subject, but nothing pulls them together. When has the all-party food group ever talked to the all-party diabetes group? Members are also interested in vitamins, and we should institutionalise such all-party interaction. It would be important in co-ordinating people's thoughts and working with the Government to influence the food industry to take the problem seriously. People in the industry say that they are doing that, but when I meet them I sometimes think that they are just playing at it.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para33">The explosion in diabetes that I mentioned earlier can be handled. Prevention is possible, and we should rise to the challenge.


<P>

<a name="30909h01_time1"><H5>9.57 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew6"><B> Mr. Adrian Sanders  (Torbay):</B> 
 First, I declare an interest as an insulin-dependent diabetic, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing today's debate. For my sins, I am also the chairman of the all-party group on diabetes and <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 8WH</B></P>
the idea of a joint meeting with the all-party food group is a good one that we can perhaps develop. We have had some joint meetings with the all-party group on eye health and visual impairment, which was perhaps a more obvious connection, but the idea of another joint meeting is food for thought.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para34">The Government have done some good work on diabetes in the past six years. The first move was to allow type 1 diabetics who use the pen injection system to have the needles on prescription instead of making them buy them. That has meant that many diabetics&#151;about 350,000 nationwide&#151;do not have to worry about getting needles. Government Departments tend to be resistant to change and one argument was that users would use a fresh needle every time that they injected themselves. That was probably true for children, because as skin develops, it should not be punctured with a needle that is not as finely sharpened as a fresh one. However, the costings that were made, and which delayed the decision, were based on the fact that everyone would use a new needle every time that they injected. Figures now show that the costs were far less than the Government originally predicted.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para35">There is always a danger when talking about any disease of arguing that a new treatment or a new drug can save costs later. People certainly believe that there are cost implications. The money must, of course, be provided up front. In this instance, however, the Government provided a figure that was far higher than the final cost, which delayed the decision. That was not necessarily the Government's fault, but they did the right thing in the end by allowing prescriptions for pen needles.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para36">Secondly, the Government took action to tackle discrimination against diabetic drivers. As usual, the European directive was interpreted differently by different member states. The United Kingdom recommended that there should be a complete ban on C1 and C2 driving licences for insulin-dependent diabetics. I am very glad that the all-party group on diabetes and other bodies and individuals managed to persuade the Government to reconsider that ban and to remove some restrictions from some categories of driver. A blanket ban could have had an enormous impact on people and threatened their jobs and livelihoods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew7"><B> Tim Loughton </B> 
: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned driving. One of my constituents drives vehicles for a living and was greatly affected by the ban. His diabetes was under control: he took all the medication required of him. He has benefited from the relaxation of the restrictions, but is still required to have regular medical checks, at his own expense, for something with which he has had no problem. We still have some way to go if we are to provide people who suffer from diabetes with a level playing field, given certain restrictions to which they are still subject.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew8"><B> Mr. Sanders </B> 
: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. I cannot comment on any individual case, but we wanted an annual assessment of each individual rather than a blanket ban, and we achieved that. I am not sure that one can argue that we should do away with that annual medical now that we have it, although it could be altered to take account of age. Younger people <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 9WH</B></P>
may have more control and may need to be assessed only every five years, but I do not believe that one can argue against an annual assessment for middle-aged people in their mid-40s and beyond. Incidentally, insulin-dependent diabetics are probably among the safest drivers on the road because their eyesight is tested every year and any problems can be detected annually.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para37">The third good thing that the Government did was to produce the NHS framework for diabetes, on which I shall comment in a moment. There are, however, many outstanding issues, such as screening. It has long been argued that an enormous number of people have this condition. Diabetes UK estimates that probably up to 1 million people have diabetes but are yet to be diagnosed. They are therefore still to be put in a position where they must make some lifestyle changes to change their behaviour, or must adopt a regime that will help them with their diabetes and reduce chronic symptoms and the risk of complications later. There are pilot screening programmes, to which I am sure the Minister will refer. I hope that the results will show the benefits of having a screening system. The hon. Member for Norwich, North talked a great deal about the statistics, which are interesting. Several European countries have a much higher incidence of diabetes per 1,000 of the population than the UK. One reason is that people in those countries have been screened and the disease diagnosed, but the people in the UK have not. Direct comparisons between countries can therefore lead to the wrong conclusion.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para38">Screening programmes present a danger that returns us to the argument about cost: if we screen people and find our missing million, there will be an enormous increase in the demands made not only on resources devoted directly to treating diabetes but on other NHS services such as the provision of nutritional advice, chiropody, eye tests and so on. The Government need to think that through, but costs should not be the reason for putting off screening, as the complications of diabetes are so much greater than the costs of helping a person to control the condition.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para39">Another outstanding issue is employment discrimination. A study was conducted last year into employment practices and the fact that some diabetics still face discrimination in the labour market. There have been changes of policy in some emergency services, to the benefit of diabetics in the police force and the fire service who can now be accommodated in those services rather than losing their jobs. There are many examples outside those two professions of people facing discrimination in the workplace. A submission has been made to the appropriate Department, which we hope will be incorporated in future employment discrimination legislation.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para40">Although I praise the framework, I am worried that, according to the Government's statistics, the number of type 1 diabetics will rise from 1.37 million to 1.759 million by 2010 and the figure may well be higher than that as it was obtained without screening. If nearly 2 million people have type 1 diabetes, the money that is being put into the national health service framework will not be enough. There is a danger that in trying to do what is right, resources will be overstretched. The service for diabetics has been patchy, and the great thing about the framework is that it tries to ratchet up the standard to provide a uniform level of service across the <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 10WH</B></P>
country. However, unless there are sufficient resources, something else will suffer. The number of diabetics requiring help therefore needs to be kept under constant review.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para41">A worrying sign that has come to my attention is that general practitioners are rationing testing strips. In addition to having injections, diabetics are encouraged to test their blood sugar four or five times a day, for which they use the strips. Some type 2 diabetics, who are non-insulin dependent and control their condition with diet and tablets, are not being allowed as many test strips as they have had in the past. I suspect that some work has been done that suggests that people are testing too often, but a principle established by organisations such as Diabetes UK, other patient groups, and especially those in the medical profession who deal with diabetes, is that patients know best when they need to test and how often they need to monitor what is happening to them. A Minister to whom I wrote on the matter replied that what was being complained about should not be happening, and a copy of his letter was sent to Plymouth health authority, which is the one involved. I have not had any further feedback but I would be worried if there were similar restrictions elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para42">The hon. Member for Norwich, North cited the case for prevention. The future for treatment is more technological than pharmaceutical for type 1 diabetics&#151;it is the development of the insulin pump, which the National Institute for Clinical Excellence says will help. The device is no bigger than a pager&#151;I am not wearing a pump, it is a pager&#151;and infuses insulin at small doses set by the patient throughout the day, giving a high degree of control. When someone's pancreas is working it is pumping insulin into them all the time. When they eat, it produces more insulin. The type 1 diabetic, whose pancreas does not work, must take it externally, twice or four times a day, and that clearly cannot be as effective.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para43">The little pumps hold a prospect of much greater control. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has concluded that they should be used only if everything else has failed: if the patient has trouble in using injection systems and the other regimes that can be brought together to help someone who has poor control. Very few people will be given insulin pumps on prescription.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para44">I raise this matter now as a warning, because the pump will develop into a device that will not only infuse insulin but test blood sugar at the same time: it will function as an external pancreas. Such devices have been trialled in Europe and when they have been perfected, or when they satisfy everybody, the demand for them will be enormous. The Department should prepare for that, because it will have a big cost implication, but a corollary is that no testing strips or needles will be needed&#151;although some devices will still be required. Insulin will still be needed. The pump itself will be an expensive piece of kit, but it could wipe out many concerns, problems and complications, if it proves successful.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para45">I am grateful to the Minister, who is shortly to meet some diabetic nurses with me. One small point concerns the disposal of needles and lancets used for blood sugar monitoring. There is not very good information on this. Having been a diabetic for 10 years I suddenly learned <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 11WH</B></P>
that I should be putting my lancets in sharps waste disposal and not wrapping them and putting them in the bin. No one had told me that, and I had not picked up the information anywhere, although I consider myself fairly well informed about these issues. Some local authorities provide very sketchy services. Some local authorities are very good at collecting sharps bins from the homes of diabetics and taking the needles and other paraphernalia away, but others are not. I am glad that the Minister is prepared to talk to us about trying to obtain a consistent service across the country.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para46">I want finally to pay tribute to Diabetes UK, the longest-standing patient group in diabetes. It does an enormous amount of good work on awareness and information. Its lobbying role is important too. Other organisations, such as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, are concerned about type 1 diabetes and finding a cure. They are always trying to raise more money for that objective.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para47">I thank the hon. Member for Norwich, North for initiating the debate. It is important to discuss the subject periodically, to assess developments. As I have said, the Government have done some good things, but enormous challenges and major outstanding issues remain to be dealt with.

<a name="30909h01_spnew9"><B> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud):</B> 
 I thank you for your warm welcome, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I presume that in the coming two weeks we shall play pre-season friendlies, as we have not quite started the season yet. In that spirit, we can have a good kick around and see who the best players are.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para48">I welcome the lead given by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) in the debate. No better person could be found to talk about the scientific rationale. What a pleasure it is, too, to follow the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders), who speaks from his own experiences and who is the leading light in the all-party group on diabetes. Although I do not want to take up much time this morning, I want to reinforce what both hon. Members have said.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para49">We should congratulate the Government on the national health service framework, which has not featured as much as it could have done. That is unfortunate, because one of the criticisms that diabetes sufferers have always made, in my experience, concerns the extent of the postcode lottery affecting what support they receive. That point came out well in the remarks of the hon. Member for Torbay about insulin pens, which are a long overdue consolidation of what should be available to people. We also need to talk about moving towards using pumps and what we need to do to ensure that they are more widely available. That will be possible only if we understand that people should have access to them regardless of where they live, and certainly regardless of their means. That is what the national service framework should try to do, not just in this area but in other areas where we have embarked on this important venture to try to pull services together.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para50">I speak from the experience of talking to members of an active diabetes support group local to Stonehouse, where I live, which is led by Liz Shipman and others. I <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 12WH</B></P>
have come to understand that a key aspect of diabetes, more than many other diseases, is the degree to which people can support each other and show that they can live perfectly normal lives as long as they take their medication and seek urgent medical help where necessary.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para51">The support group always makes the point that the medical profession does not make the best use of it. It is worrying for anybody to be diagnosed with diabetes, but especially for young people and their parents and friends. Members of the support group feel strongly that it could be a valuable addition to the inevitable medical support, yet more often than not, people have found it difficult to access that support mechanism through general practitioner's surgeries. That is rather sad because the best person to help someone through the processes involved with such a life-changing experience is another diabetic. I am sure that the Minister will take that on board in her discussions with GPs and organisations. Such support is valuable, but there are few support groups around the country. If the need is there and is highlighted, more support groups may appear, which could be locked in through GPs' surgeries.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para52">In preparation for the debate, I was pleased to receive a press notice from the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee about the help that it could provide to people suffering from diabetes, such as advice and monitoring, which it believes to be an important part of its negotiations with the Government in readiness for the new contract, which is estimated to begin in April 2004.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para53">Pharmacists see themselves as playing a valuable role in helping with diagnosis and monitoring. Another criticism made by my local support group was that, for a time, it offered to test the general public on behalf of pharmacists to see who was at risk of suffering from diabetes. However, it all went wrong because of the usual problems of insurance against wrong diagnosis. We all know that early diagnosis and intervention are crucial whatever the age of the diabetic, but as the hon. Member for Torbay said, we must recognise that there are cost benefits and should not pretend that we can avoid the issue. We must have a mechanism for testing in the wider community, perhaps on a voluntary basis. I suspect that GPs are unlikely to want to do it because they are inundated with other tasks, but pharmacists may do it, with, I hope, the involvement of lay people. Obviously, one cannot just test people, give them the results and, if they are suffering from diabetes, pretend that they will be anything other than very worried. We must ensure that it is done properly. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take up that point, as it has been clearly highlighted in my area.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para54">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North went on to discuss the wider context: why the number of cases of diabetes is growing and what we should do about that. That wider context is important. Diabetes is, of course, related to what we eat and to our lifestyle. The Government are clearly right to emphasise the importance of fitness as part of lifestyle, and to try to prevent the sale of school playing fields and so on. The danger is that lifestyle and fitness are, unfortunately, areas that are stratified somewhat by class. If people can afford it, they will belong to a health club, but that would be the last thing that those with a lower income <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 13WH</B></P>
would ever budget for. We have to ensure that where the state is involved, it does things properly, for example in schools and by providing recreational facilities in the community. We should be predisposed not to sell playing fields; we should encourage people to use them.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para55">On the positive side, initiatives such as sure start, our work towards a co-ordinated policy ensuring that children have opportunities when they are young, breakfast clubs and after-school clubs can all come together to help. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North talked about the huge area of lost opportunity from the scientific point of view. I want to discuss the practical point of view. We still have only one professor of food policy in this country. I initiated a debate more than two years ago to find out whether the Government were moving towards co-ordinating some response to that matter.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para56">The professor is the well known Tim Lang, who is not everyone's cup of tea, but who speaks his mind and has pointed out that for a long time we have not been progressing towards greater cohesion. He introduced me to the idea of functional food, which my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North mentioned. Last week in Gloucester, I was at Unilever, which I used to call Wall's, where they are talking about introducing an ice cream that is full of energy and health-giving products. If ice cream can be made healthy, presumably anything can. The industry is beginning to pay attention to the idea of functional food, and the Government need to do more.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para57">Local food, organic food, and an intake of five portions of fruit and vegetables a day are not fads. They are a matter of genuinely trying to change mindsets and making people aware that what they eat will have an impact on their quality of life, if not immediately, then in later years. Those ideas will be the greatest way in which we can prevent a huge explosion in diseases such as diabetes. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will say how we can move towards greater co-ordination in that area, if not towards a full-blown food policy, which&#151;talk about tsars&#151;seems somewhat state led. We have to get across the message that the issue is important and is one that we ignore at our peril. The debate has been very useful.

<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Patsy Calton  (Cheadle):</B> 
 May I welcome all of us back? It feels very much like a new term. I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on his continuing success in obtaining timely Adjournment debates.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para58">I am particularly pleased to be here because I did not know anything about vitamin D and its possible association with type 1 diabetes. I feel as though I have learned quite a lot this morning, so I should like to thank the hon. Gentleman very much. It would be especially interesting to follow up that area of research&#151;the hon. Gentleman did not mention this, but Asian and Afro-Caribbean groups are particularly susceptible to type 1 diabetes and there may be a positive link, which chimes with what he was saying.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para59">The hon. Gentleman also referred to the fact that the diabetes time bomb that we seem to be sitting on is a worldwide phenomenon that is gradually coming to affect everyone everywhere and not only us. The issue <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 14WH</B></P>
might need to be explored from the angle of increasingly global food production and the role of the multinational food companies. They obviously have a part to play and it is important that companies such as Unilever&#151;I hasten to declare that I have a sort of interest as my daughter works for Unilever&#151;have a role to play in ensuring that the wider health issues are explored, not only for this country but for other countries.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para60">My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) has more than adequately expressed his concern about the treatment of diabetics. He and others have referred to the discrimination that diabetics can suffer in both employment and social matters such as driving. The Government and the medical profession need to explore issues associated with undiagnosed diabetes, or we shall store up problems for ourselves and the public in terms of the extra costs that will result from late treatment. However, other hon. Members have more than adequately dealt with that subject.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para61">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) mentioned support groups, which have an application beyond diabetes&#151;for example, for sufferers of ME and other illnesses or conditions. Support groups give far more necessary information than the medical profession do. For instance, I was on tamoxifen for about two years before I found out from a support group that some of the side effects that I was experiencing were normal and that everybody else has them as well, so I thought, "I should have come to the support group sooner." Support groups have a role to play across a range of conditions. When primary care trusts are dealing with their very stretched budgets it is important that they do not remove the funding for support groups, as a few thousand pounds can have a great impact. I would therefore certainly support the hon. Gentleman in his view that support groups are often the best way for people who are experiencing a disease to get new information.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para62">I want to focus on prevention and the wider issues involved with it. Although I was particularly interested in the vitamin D and type 1 discussion of the hon. Member for Norwich, North, it is important both to consider the wider lifestyle issues&#151;exposure to sunlight, and so on&#151;and to avoid a medical and pill-popping culture in which every illness is to be cured by popping another pill rather than by changing lifestyle.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para63">I guess that it is received wisdom now that diabetes and other medical conditions such as coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers are linked to over-high body mass. We are in danger of causing difficulties when we try to get over messages if we constantly refer to obesity, which has become a stigmatised expression and one that is not good to use when we are trying to create a no-fault, no-blame culture and to change behaviour without making people feel guilty about the way they are or the way they have been. Guilt will not change behaviour in the long term; it is a wish to experience a different lifestyle that will make people change. Obesity is not a particularly useful term. Over-high or excessive body mass may be better.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para64">We know that poor nutrition&#151;high fat and high sugar&#151;and too little exercise from an early age are linked to excessive weight gain from infancy onwards. A number of nutrition and education factors have been explored today. We need a continuing programme of education and awareness-raising for the public as well as <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 15WH</B></P>
schoolchildren. We always say, "Start with the children", but they do not often control the family's buying habits. They may well control their buying habits at school, but they do not control the wider buying habits of the family. We must raise the awareness of the public as a whole on this issue, and the Government are doing some good things to raise awareness.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para65">It is not enough to talk about raising public awareness alone. A number of initiatives from successive Governments and, indeed, local government have done nothing to reduce our couch potato characteristics. I think of the junk food machines in schools. I remember being appalled as a schoolteacher that a school should have chocolate and other junk foods in a machine in the main corridor and the fizzy drinks machines to which the hon. Member for Norwich, North referred. Schools are the last places where those machines should be put. Too many children are tempted to use the money that their parents give them for food at lunchtime to eat junk foods at break, lunchtime and mid-afternoon. They are getting a very different diet from the one that their parents think they are getting.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para66">I have been asking questions about junk food machines in schools since I arrived in the House. The Department for Education and Skills regards that as a matter for local authorities and school governors. The problem is that with the funding for schools as it is, the profits from such machines are often paying for dinner ladies, so schools and local authorities face a very difficult decision. If they do away with junk food machines, they have to do away with one or more dinner ladies at the same time. We also need to worry about those issues.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para67">Some schools still offer poor variety and poor-quality food. Superstore shopping has caused a change in buying habits towards more pre-prepared foods, which do not necessarily have the benefits of food that has not been pre-processed and packaged. That in itself has made a big change.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para68">I realise that this may seem a little far-fetched, but I think that school league tables have played a part. Many parents believe that they have to get the very best education that they can for their children and that that includes putting them in a 4x4 in the morning and driving them to the school with the best standard assessment tests results. It is now rare for children to walk or cycle to school, which is one bit of daily exercise that they need.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para69">The issue clearly goes wider than the Department of Health. We are talking about joined-up government, so that the Government realise, when they produce a particular policy, that it may have implications that they had never thought about. It is right that parents should be able to get the best possible education for their children, but the children could end up dying at 45 from a heart attack because they never walked anywhere. We have to obtain a better balance. I worry about how many children never see daylight. They go from home to school in the car and engage in practically no sport or physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para70">With the demands of the national curriculum, many schools have reduced considerably the time spent on sport. When we talk of sport, most people think of team <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 16WH</B></P>
games, but they are not necessarily the way forward. Many young people do not want to take part in team games and prefer to be engaged in physical activity that they can pursue individually. I have occasionally covered for absent PE teachers and found that a third or half of the girls did not take part in lessons. They stood to one side, having not brought their kit. We may think that all children are getting an hour a week of sport, but even in good schools, not all of them are. There are some issues to be addressed about the lack of physical exercise that young people are engaged in and the policies that must be explored.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para71">There has been much talk about congestion charging, especially in my local papers in the past few weeks. I wonder whether a half-mile exclusion zone around schools should be considered for each morning and afternoon to ensure that young people walk or cycle at least a mile each day. It would certainly please those people who find 4x4s parked in their driveways when they are trying get out in the morning. I am thinking especially about my own constituency, which has a real problem with the traffic that builds up around schools. The people who live in those areas simply cannot move in the morning because of the numbers of children being brought to school by car. It is a backward step, and I am concerned for the young people who engage in practically no activity, including getting to school in the morning.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para72">A further issue is the low take-up of breastfeeding, which has suffered from the tolerance of the activities of baby milk manufacturers over the years. I remember being shown a breastfeeding film that was obviously designed to make a mother-to-be squirm, as the breast was exposed in various situations that, as a potential new mother, I was nervous about. I then found out that Nestl&#233; was behind the film, and I thought that it was just possible that I was supposed to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding. Some baby milk manufacturers have a lot to answer for, and in the past there has been poor Government support for breastfeeding. There are initiatives, which I would like to see rolled out across the country, but I believe that this House has ambivalent attitudes to that most natural and healthy of activities.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para73">When the Government make new policy or take decisions on planning matters, they should take lifestyle issues into account. To be fair, the Department of Health has produced several documents and initiatives that have highlighted the importance of lifestyle choices and better treatment for diseases associated with excessive body mass and too little exercise. I think of "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation", the NHS plan for investment and reform, the NHS cancer plan and the national standards frameworks for coronary heart disease and diabetes.

I will draw my remarks to a close as I have taken up more time than I should.

 May I echo your warm welcome, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to everyone in Westminster Hall? It was certainly warmer than the temperature here today.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para75">I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), who is a frequent initiator of debates. As usual, it has been most informative because he takes a scientific approach rather than coming up with the usual platitudes. Most of his speech was not directly about diabetes, but it was very relevant because it covered all those situations and conditions relating to its onset and proliferation&#151;subjects that were mentioned in other speeches too. If the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) started to organise all-party meetings he would have to take in more than just the diabetes group, the food group, the sports group and the schools physical education group because diabetes affects so many different aspects of our lives. The hon. Member for Norwich, North encapsulated it all when he asked whether we are simply playing at it or whether we are really serious. His fatty tsar suggestion may not be taken quite so seriously, although the sentiment behind it was correct.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para76">This is an important subject. The ticking time bomb of diabetes, as it has been called, is one of the biggest problems facing the health of our nation and the health service over the short, medium and longer term. It affects so many of our constituents. We have heard the figures: 1.4 million cases have been diagnosed but probably an equal number are still undiagnosed, which is perhaps more worrying. It is the fastest growing disease in the United Kingdom and is predicted to involve up to 3 million in types 1 and 2 diabetes by 2010. It carries serious complications such as amputation, blindness, kidney failure, strokes, and coronary heart disease. Diabetes sufferers are five times more likely to suffer from coronary heart disease. Most type 2 sufferers find out that they have diabetes only when they are treated for one of those complications. On average, they have had the disease for nine to 12 years before they are diagnosed. Diabetes sufferers can live, on average, 10 years less than non-sufferers.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para77">As hon. Members have mentioned, there is a big ethnic impact. Around one in four Asian men over 60 suffers from diabetes. There is a much higher incidence among the Asian, African, Afro-Caribbean communities and, of course, among socially disadvantaged groups. Can the Minister tell us what has been done to help those groups? Internationally, more than 300 million people are at risk of developing diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation. As the hon. Member for Norwich, North mentioned, Professor Sir George Alberti recently said:
<P>

</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h01_para78">That is right.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para79">The cost to the NHS is more than &#163;5 billion&#151;more than the &#163;3 billion spent on alcohol or the &#163;1.5 billion spent on smoking. Moreover, 40 per cent. of that expenditure goes on hospital care and at any time between 6 and 16 per cent. of hospital beds are occupied by people with diabetes. Particularly worrying is the impact on young children, as hon. Members have mentioned. Part of the problem lies in the confusing information about what is healthy eating and what is not. Is it healthy to stay out in the sun more? We are always told that it is not. Being in the sun may have a link with vitamin D, which has a link with diabetes, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. We recently heard that it is not healthy to drink too much water, yet we were always told that we should drink more.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para80">Yet more problems face the average punter. It is no wonder that everybody is confused as to what is and is not healthy. That is why a third of British children are overweight and we are heading towards the catastrophic figures that they have in the United States. One in 10 four-year-olds is diagnosed as obese, particularly young girls. The first cases of adult onset diabetes have recently been recorded in British teenagers, for reasons that hon. Members have mentioned. It is difficult to identify, as children often do not feel unwell on diagnosis of diabetes and do not feel that they have a medical problem. That emphasises the need for better education as to how diabetes can be controlled. It is crucial to tackle the subject urgently and early. It would be financial folly not to do so, and it would have an impact on the health of individuals that could be prevented by better education, better diagnostic testing and adapting lifestyles.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para81">Diabetes is relatively easy to diagnose: a simple blood test has been developed in the US to detect it for up to 12 years. It is a simple procedure that can identify up to 75 per cent. of cases and can be used on patients believed to be at high risk. Will the Minister comment on the lessons that have been learned from America, and how such tests may be rolled out early in this country?
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para82">There are other problems. At present, 90 per cent. of hospitals do not have the recommended number of diabetes consultants or specialist nurses, more than a third of hospitals do not prioritise diabetes in their health improvement plans, and 30 per cent. of GP practices do not have a specific clinic for people with diabetes.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para83">We welcome the national service framework&#151;although it was introduced late in the day, in December 2001, and it was not until January 2003 that the delivery strategy was published. Many shortcomings in the framework remain and the Government have failed to match their good intentions with meaningful action, although the NSF is a step in the right direction.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para84">There are particular problems with the NSF. Many patients feel let down that it does not include national priorities and doctors have accused the Government of shifting the buck by passing targets on to primary care trusts. Many doctors will not meet NSF targets, as many practices do not even conduct basic monitoring. Fewer than half of diabetes patients have had their cholesterol measured in the last year; 25 per cent. have not even had their blood pressure checked; and 60 per cent. have not had their HbA levels measured. Many diabetes patients <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 19WH</B></P>
are wandering around with uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia&#151;that is, high cholesterol, the biggest contributory factor to myocardial infarctions&#151;and unchecked hypertension, despite the fact that there are simple tests that could be used, relatively inexpensively.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para85">Diabetes UK has criticised the failure immediately to find funding for the estimated 1 million people who have diabetes but are unaware of it. There is a failure to provide ring-fenced funding to deal with that, a lack of performance indicators and a failure to deal with staffing and training problems.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para86">The move to create expert patients is a positive one but there are many questions to be asked. The Government's expert patients programme receives just &#163;2 million per year, yet the costs of treating the UK's 1.4 million diabetes patients is &#163;5.2 billion per year. Major investment is needed at the preventive stage.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para87">The NSF is certainly not a panacea, but it goes some way to raising the profile of the problem and flagging up some methods of dealing with it. As it stands it is undeliverable, not least because much of the funding was left to primary care trusts, many of which are already in debt. The cost of treating sufferers is likely to double within the next eight years. According to Stefanie Amiel, an academic and clinician who specialises in diabetes at King's college London, although the NSF is a move in the right direction, there are many unanswered questions. For example, how is the service to existing patients to be improved while the numbers of those presenting with the disease continue to rise? What about the huge number of undiagnosed patients? Stefanie Amiel doubts the "prevention endeavour", saying that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it's a long way from treating the illness".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h01_para88">How are we to bring about a national lifestyle change? The NSF needs to factor in the increase in the number of those with diabetes and the related costs. We will not lower hospital costs by strengthening diabetes care in the community, at least not in the medium term.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para89">There are many other questions that the Minister may like to answer, although there is no time for that now, but I think that we all agree that diabetes is a public health disaster, and we need an early and detailed programme of meaningful measures to tackle the crisis. Spending money now on preventing and managing diabetes will save a lot of money in the long term, let alone a lot of angst and ill health for the increasing number of people who are being afflicted&#151;at an increasingly early age&#151;by type 2 diabetes. I hope that the Minister will deal with many of the questions and accept that the debate is an exercise not just in presentation, but in grasping the problem early and providing solutions to it.

:  As always, it is a great pleasure to be in your hands, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am sure that all hon. Members will agree about that, particularly in this first Adjournment debate after the recess.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para90">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing the debate. While looking through some of the background papers <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 20WH</B></P>
I noticed some interesting initiatives on diabetes in the area of my hon. Friend's constituency. Perhaps I may invite myself there, as I should like to see some of them, and to discuss the subject more. In the light of what my hon. Friend has demonstrated he knows about the subject, I should find that extremely useful. I pay tribute, also, to his contribution in the associate parliamentary food and health forum.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para91">I listened carefully to comments about the possibility of a joint meeting with the all-party diabetes group. I am meeting the group soon, and want to consider ways in which we could work together to raise awareness of the effectiveness of early screening for diabetes, among other things. I hope that we shall be able to work together at that meeting and discuss issues that have been raised here, as well as ways of working with Members of Parliament to raise the issue in their constituencies.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para92">As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) said, this has been a very informative debate. We are obviously in a Chamber full of experts, and House of Commons debates are always at their best when that is so. I do not have time to reiterate the figures that were given earlier, and I would rather deal with the action that we are taking, but we know that, as has been said, diabetes is becoming more common not only in the UK but throughout the world.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para93">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North referred to research on diabetes. Sadly, there are gaps in the research, particularly for type 1 diabetes. I should like to send my hon. Friend some of the research that has been conducted by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition. Perhaps we can pursue the debate about some of the relevant ideas.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para94">The extent of the problems of diabetes and, indeed, obesity was the reason we developed the national framework for diabetes. We involved clinicians, experts and people from Diabetes UK&#151;which, again, I join the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) in praising&#151;because we wanted to put together a framework that would set high standards which, with our delivery strategy, would bring about a consistent approach throughout the country. We believe that that can be done. We want high standards to deal with prevention, provide better care for people with diabetes, and help such people to manage their condition.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para95">We know that to stay healthy and well, everyone with diabetes needs good and regular health care as good control of blood sugar levels can reduce the risk of serious complications and lengthen lives. That means prompt diagnosis, regular checks to identify serious complications at an early stage and treatment to control blood glucose and blood pressure levels.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para96">The hon. Member for Torbay and others mentioned insulin and testing, which we can discuss with the all-party committee. To ensure that the NSF is delivered properly, in April we appointed a national clinical director for diabetes. Her task is to fulfil two early and important national targets: by 2006 a minimum of 80 per cent. of people with diabetes are to be offered eye screening for the early detection and treatment, if needed, of diabetic retinopathy. That will rise to 100 per cent. by the end of 2007 and to meet that target, we are putting an extra &#163;27 million into digital cameras over the next three years. By March 2006, there should be a <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 21WH</B></P>
register of patients with diabetes in all GP practices so that they can be offered the appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking, and systematic treatment in education.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para97">I will certainly consider the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) about support groups and how they can interact with GPs. To take up the matter raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, we will put into the NHS an average annual increase of 7.4 per cent. above inflation over the next five years and three quarters of that budget will go into the hands of primary care trusts. It is important that primary care trusts have the ability to decide what are the local priorities, but by matching national standards with the local priorities we can address some of the problems of shortages in the work force. Extra consultants are being recruited but there are other ways, for example, nurses having an increased role in the treatment of diabetes, and some important projects and pilots are being carried out to look into such matters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew14"><B> Dr. Gibson </B> 
: Will my hon. Friend say what investment is being put into the prevention of diabetes?

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h01_spnew15"><B> Ms Winterton </B> 
: I was about to come to that matter. First, we want to foster healthier lifestyles and the Department of Health is leading on the development of a cross-government food and health action plan, which will pull together all the issues that influence what we eat: it will address food production, manufacture and preparation, access to healthier food choice and providing more information. The welfare food scheme is being reformed and the healthy start proposals will mean that we look at providing vitamins for low-income groups and also consider how we can give access to other foods such as vegetables, fruit and so on. With the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, we are also looking at encouraging increased physical activity through local exercise action pilots&#151;LEAP&#151;and other initiatives. Some of the results of the proposals will be published in spring next year; we are working on the plans at the moment.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para98">I assure my hon. Friend that action is being taken on these matters. I was particularly interested in his comments about a food tsar. What we want is a good plan that addresses prevention, diet and the important issue of physical activity. We have a long-term plan to tackle the issue, particularly through the NSF, but also through healthy eating and other initiatives.
<P>

<a name="30909h01_para99">I hope that what I have said gives hon. Members some idea of the progress we are making on this important matter. We have some way to go but we are well on the way.

<a name="30909h02_time0"><H5>11 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew0"><B> Dr. Alan Whitehead  (Southampton, Test):</B> 
 Last summer, we had a debate in this Chamber on packaging and waste, initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), whom I am delighted to see here today.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para0">In this debate, I want to concentrate more specifically on the workings of the packaging regulations. Since the previous debate, we have received the report of the Advisory Committee on Packaging, which examined the future of the regulations. In July, a consultation paper was issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which largely endorsed the opinions of the advisory committee. The EU directive targets up to 2008 have also been clarified, and the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill, which was a partial response to the EU landfill directive, has been published. It is therefore appropriate to examine this issue now. It is also appropriate to examine it because the questions raised by the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill and the packaging regulations are connected, but the point that we have reached in considering those questions seems to prevent that connection being made.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para1">The packaging regulations deal essentially with commercial waste&#151;in this instance, packaging&#151;but the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill deals with domestic waste, which may substantially include packaging. A good proportion of what is put into rubbish bins by domestic consumers is packaging brought into their houses as part of their consumption of goods.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para2">The packaging regulations have been a substantial success in their own right. Since 1997, the rate of recovery of packaging in the UK has risen from 30 per cent. in 1998 to 48 per cent. in 2001, and the rate of packaging recycling from 27 per cent. in 1998 to 42 per cent. in 2001. In the context of that improvement, we should note that both the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill and the packaging regulations deal with targets. The current consultation paper sets out the next targets that should be reached for packaging. The new targets in the EU directive would require us to raise our game substantially, because 1.3 million more tonnes of packaging would need to be recovered by 2008. Moreover, we would need to meet sub-targets for categories of materials, as opposed to just a general target.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para3">The consultation document also recommends that the increase must include more recovery of reusable commercial materials from domestic waste, but there is no mechanism for reaching targets for particular types of packaging in the domestic waste area, as required by the directive. British Glass, in a recent communication, says that local authorities can reach their targets for recycling and recovery of domestic waste without collecting any glass.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien  (Normanton):</B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. May I draw his attention to a note from British Glass, which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Under the UK's free market PRN system we are likely to witness a significant rise in the price of the glass PRN in relation to prices for other materials. This, in turn, will lead to a massive increase in obligation costs for our customers, the packers/fillers and the retailers."
<P>
</UL></FONT>



<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 23WH</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h02_para4">I wanted to make that point to my hon. Friend, because the matter is important to the glass industry, and the Minister should take note of what the industry is appealing for.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew2"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
: I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. It is important as a by-product of the targets for separate types of packaging that are being suggested for the future. The suggestion that packaging recovery notes for certain types of waste will increase considerably in price should be a proper concern when determining how the mechanism will work over the next few years. The point made by British Glass is therefore important.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para5">The consultative document also addresses the issue of incineration. As a result of the European Court of Justice judgments and an EU position statement of 27 May on whether incineration constitutes recovery, incineration will have to make up a reducing component of those increased targets. However, the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill envisages an increase in the incineration of domestic waste. It is difficult to see how both could be achieved at the same time.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para6">More is to come. The Waste and Emissions Trading Bill and the Government's waste strategy explicitly accept the hierarchy of waste; that is, the highest purpose is the minimisation of waste, then reuse and then recovery. The relevant packaging regulations, on the other hand, do not do so. They require companies that produce more than 50 tonnes of packaging at various stages in the packaging process and have a turnover of more than &#163;2 million either to recover the packaging, which is to follow through their processes, or to purchase packaging recovery notes from whomsoever is recovering packaging to make up the difference.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para7">I shall now make a bold claim: I have not done the two-year advanced course on the theory and practice of packaging recovery notes. However, I believe that I understand roughly how the PRN system works. Essentially, it is, or should be, a self-balancing market process. PRNs are tradable and vary in price according to the relative recovery performance of obligated companies; that is, if those companies are doing well, the price will be low because there will not be many takers, but if they are doing badly, the price will be high. That price hike benefits the registered recoverers, which are the organisations that take packaging and undertake recovery, because, at least in theory, they will have the proceeds from the sale of PRNs at higher prices to invest in better and more effective recovery processes. That in turn should aid the efficiency of the recovery process, which should theoretically drive PRN prices down over a period. I shall not go into the detail of consortium purchases and the obligations that are entailed, which is an entire sub-study course, but I have described the essential mechanism.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para8">However, that is where the problems between theory and reality kick in. First, in order to assess liability, an apportionment of responsibility must be set out at each stage of the packaging process. There are four stages of liability in the system. A percentage of the liability must be allocated, sometimes somewhat arbitrarily. That may create problems for those who are involved in several <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 24WH</B></P>
stages and thereby seem to be repeatedly liable for the same processes, while on the other hand other organisations are let off free.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para9">Secondly, there is some incentive to minimise. Retailers should theoretically put pressure on their suppliers to minimise packaging so that their liability for the purchase of PRN certificates reduces, but in reality that pressure exists only when the price of PRNs is high and, because of consortium arrangements, high over a long period of time. When PRN prices are low, as they are and have been over a period, no such incentive exists&#151;one simply purchases a PRN and has done with it. Similarly, there is no pool of funding to improve recycling at the end of the process, so the system fails to encourage minimisation. In any event, PRN income does not go as far as to help develop markets for what is recovered.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para10">Thirdly, there is a reverse incentive, which is to inflate the success of the obligated organisation in recovering its packaging, thereby evading the need to buy PRNs, even though the waste has not been recovered. There is some evidence that the low price is due to that inflation&#151;a press release from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs this summer showed the results of an investigation into the recovery of wood. That is not necessarily due solely to the fact that fraud is taking place, but because the science of measuring is so inexact in a number of categories that higher claims of recovery are difficult to rebut and are, in effect, almost condoned by the system. It is fair to say that the resources that are available for policing the system&#151;to measure, to prevent fraud and to chase up non-registered free riders&#151;fall way short of the levels sufficient to deal fully with such issues.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para11">The danger is that confidence in the scheme will evaporate: people will go through the motions rather than really work it, because they know that elements of it are not real. If they do take a free ride or inflate their contributions, they may well not be troubled at all.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para12">Despite those problems, the system has made remarkable progress. My concern is not that the system does not work at all, but that because of its perceived inequities, the gap between theory and reality makes enemies of those companies that want to co-operate. I am also concerned that after the consultative document has been produced we will almost certainly proceed with a system that recovers but does not minimise, even though, according to Government policy, we live in a world in which minimisation is a priority and an imperative in waste management. In essence, I am not suggesting that we should have no scheme, but that we could have a much better scheme that embedded minimisation if we worked towards it.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para13">One example encapsulates many of these contradictions. Pallets are ubiquitous in UK manufacturing and bulk retailing. They are literally the base on which almost everything is transported at various stages of manufacture, but especially to retail distribution centres. They are usually made of wood, but need not be. Some pallets entering the UK carry imported goods, but a sizeable proportion is moved internally on so-called blue pallets, which are leased pallets owned by companies such as CHEP and others.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para14">Before the summer recess, I asked a parliamentary question about whether packaging regulations should cover pallets in particular. The Department's short <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 25WH</B></P>
answer was that they already did. That answer is only partly true. It is true that in the case of pallets that are owned, an assumption is made that the first use is recoverable. An obligation is therefore incurred that amounts to one tenth of the waste arising from pallets because it is assumed that they will make repeated journeys. By and large, however, they do not. They probably last half as long as estimated, but the company can obtain credit by sending broken pallets to be chipped. As far as I can see, that recovery mechanism is inflated to start with. However, those companies whose processing involves packaging do not own blue pallets. Therefore, they incur no obligation at all. It is assumed that the pallets are returned to the lease company and in principle are infinitely reused. Proposals advanced as part of the consultation suggest that blue pallets should be treated similarly and incur a one-tenth obligation. However, blue pallets return to the company only in aggregate. Many are lost, damaged, informally reused or sent for chipping with other pallets.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para15">A good symbiosis of recovery and reuse could be achieved by using recovered plastic to make pallets. Such pallets would reliably last much longer&#151;perhaps 10 times as long&#151;than wooden pallets. There is, however, a capital cost in making them, and since pallets carry almost no obligation under the regulations and will not incur any significant obligation in the future, nothing much will change, even if the consultative document recommendations are accepted. We will have a very leaky system with an inbuilt inflation mechanism, as DEFRA's July press release acknowledged. It may work well despite its shortcomings, but it could work so much better.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para16">My plea is that we take the opportunity presented by the consultative document and adopt its proposals that elements of the system need to be placed on the statute book to develop modifications to the system, but bring it into line with the ambitions of "Waste Not, Want Not" and the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill. That could truly set us on the road to the practical achievement of the waste hierarchy that I believe we all agree is essential for future waste management.

<a name="30909h02_spmin0"><B>The Minister for the Environment   (Mr. Elliot Morley) </B> 
:  I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) on securing the debate. He made some important points on packaging, reuse and recycling, and responded to points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). The Government have set themselves very ambitious targets. We also have obligations under various directives, as was carefully pointed out.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para17">My hon. Friend made several points. He referred to the waste packaging directive and how it applies to the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill. That is a fair point to make. We acknowledge that our approach to household waste, which involves reducing the amount going into waste streams and reaching local authority targets, is important in moving towards our targets.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para18">We accept that we need to do more work to relate the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill to the directive. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test will know, that Bill is going through Parliament now, and we must align those measures properly to get the best <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 26WH</B></P>
benefits from them. He is probably also aware that we have an Advisory Committee on Packaging. It is aware of the role of the Bill and I can assure my hon. Friend that it is currently considering how we can best achieve synchronisation between the two measures.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para19">I appreciate my hon. Friend's points about separation of waste. He is right that there are individual targets for individual waste streams. Again, we take those seriously. The waste and resources action programme&#151;WRAP&#151;is charged with developing new markets and providing support for the development of recycling.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para20">I take my hon. Friend's point about PRN notes, which have a value in the way in which they operate. I also understand his point about concerns in the glass sector about the high value of the PRN system. However, that can have advantages as well as disadvantages. Of course there is a disadvantage to the glass industry, in that there is a cost in relation to the value of PRNs, but the idea is that when there are limited recycling facilities, the value of the PRN notes will go up. That value then helps to develop the infrastructure for recycling through the inducements that it gives. We are seeing those benefits in relation to the glass sector, but I understand its concerns. I had a meeting fairly recently to talk about some of the sector's worries and ideas. There has been much good work in the glass sector and important advances have been made, but more needs to be done, on glass and on the separation of a range of other waste streams. My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton made that point.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien </B> 
: I appreciate the Minister giving way. I was making the point that in the present circumstances, the glass industry has one of the best records for recycling material, but in many instances the high price of PRNs, which has to be passed on to consumers, puts glass at a disadvantage on price measures compared with some other container industries. It is against that background that the glass industry wants to raise its concerns about the fact that we do not have a level playing field for those manufacturing containers involving glass and other suppliers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
: I understand that point, but of course other industries are caught by the waste packaging directive. There is also the landfill tax. There are incentives and costs on competing industries, which they have to face. However, I take the point and we are trying to listen sympathetically to what the glass industry has to say. My hon. Friend is right that it has a good record on recycling glass, but there are weaknesses in the sector. The catering and pub trade, for example, have a very poor record on recyling glass, and there are one or two other sectors where more could be done. Nevertheless, that is not to say that the glass sector has not done a lot. Its commitment and the work that it does should be recognised, and I pay tribute to that.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para21">My hon. Friend referred to incineration and the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill. I am not sure that it is fair to say that the Bill automatically assumes that there will be more incineration. He rightly pointed out that the Government have put in place a waste hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy, of course, is minimising waste. The next, as we go down, is recycling, and then reuse. Incineration is low down on the <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 27WH</B></P>
hierarchy, although it is above landfill. There are certain advantages to incineration. If it is applied properly we can, for example, recover waste. We can have combined cycle, where incinerators produce both heat and power. We can also get gasification. There are a number of methods for the thermal treatment of waste that can be beneficial.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew5"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
: The point that I was attempting to address, particularly in the consultation document, was that as a result of the EU opinion in May the likelihood of substantial incineration, which is presently being undertaken and counted as recovering waste and as therefore liable for the issue of PRNs, being allowed is diminishing; it will have to be replaced by other methods of recovery, not including incineration. At the same time in the hierarchy in the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill there is an element&#151;arguably a large one&#151;of incineration, which appears to be increasing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
: It is certainly true that there is an element of incineration. I would like to come back to the point that we have a clear hierarchy of waste treatment and that incineration is low down on that hierarchy. My information shows that very little packaging recovery&#151;if we want to use the term recovery&#151;is carried out through incineration; the figure is something like 500,000 tonnes out of 5 million tonnes. The impact of incineration on packaging is small, and we need to look at the issues of reuse and recycling. It is certainly true that more reuse and recycling will have to take place, and I accept that point.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para22">I accept my hon. Friend's suggestion that there could be a greater use of recycled plastics in things such as pallets. That is a very interesting suggestion. I have seen some technology used for plastics recovery. It was in south Yorkshire, and the company concerned is looking for outlets for the products that it is producing. Pallets could certainly be among them. Through WRAP, we have the facility to give support, encouragement and financial assistance to the development of new markets and new technologies, and one of those technologies is the use of recycled plastics. That is an area that we must address, in terms of separation and collection, as well as reuse, so my hon. Friend is absolutely right. He will also be aware that we are currently consulting on some of these points. There are proposals in the consultation paper to change the way that pallets are handled under the regulations. We are waiting for information on that.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para23">I listened very carefully to the points that my hon. Friend made this morning, and I am sure that we will include his comments in the overall consultation on the proposed changes. Items not covered at the moment are generally excluded, rightly, because of the provisions for reuse. The proposals apply to wood and plastic pallets. He is right that there have been some questions about the figures for the reuse of wood, and we have adjusted those figures. That demonstrates that, with regard to the targets for particular waste streams, we are careful to ensure that the figures and claims and the PRN notes are accurate and reflect the amount of product that goes into separation and recycling. It is important that we <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 28WH</B></P>
have a robust scheme that works and stands up to examination, and that is why adjustments have been made to the figures for recycled wood.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien </B> 
: Local government plays a very significant part in achieving targets. Will the Minister indicate what further assistance his Department can give to local government? I know that there has been some funding, but we need to do a lot more if we are going to separate the various cycles of waste, and local government can play a significant part.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para24">I also wrote to my hon. Friend about plastic bags and the situation in Ireland, where the tax on plastic bags has reduced their number significantly. Is he doing anything to emulate that?

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h02_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
: I shall take the latter point first because I have had a significant amount of correspondence on plastic shopping bags and the tax that was introduced in the Republic of Ireland. I make it very clear that I am interested in that sort of approach.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para25">As a general principle, the Government have applied a range of financial instruments that are designed to be cost neutral overall but to encourage good practice in recycling. The landfill tax is an example of that. Money is recycled by promoting waste minimisation. That tax is designed to encourage the minimisation of waste going into landfill.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para26">The issue of the Irish Republic is an interesting one, and I am currently looking into the figures on that. We are keen to work with supermarkets to encourage the use of reusable bags; there are good examples of that in our country. I am not sure if my hon. Friend knows that although the amount of plastic bags used in supermarkets in the Republic of Ireland has reduced&#151;the tax has some benefits&#151;the sale of black bin bags has increased dramatically. It appears that many people were reusing plastic bags, particularly for waste, and now that they do not have them in the house any more they are simply buying other plastic bags such as black bin bags. That defeats the object in terms of the analysis of the life cycle of plastics.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para27">The figures need to be examined to assess the costs and benefits, and we are doing that. I have an open mind to this approach and if there is evidence that such approaches work and are beneficial, we should consider them, but we also have to look at the whole impact and the life cycle.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para28">My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton also mentioned local authorities. It is certainly true that local authorities are key players in waste collection and waste minimisation, but they are not the only ones. A lot of packaging and waste is generated by industry and retailers, and they have obligations to deal with that.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para29">My hon. Friend asked what help is available. We have the waste implementation programme that has been set up by DEFRA, which is designed to give advice and support to local authorities about good practice and the steps that they can take to minimise waste, and to share good ideas among local authorities. We also have a further two years of the national waste minimisation and recycling fund. That is a challenge fund with a considerable sum of money for which local authorities can bid for major capital investment.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 29WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h02_para30">I have recently been involved in launching several projects in London that have been jointly funded by DEFRA, the office of the Mayor of London and the London recycling fund, which also receives financial support from DEFRA. They have been putting some sophisticated waste separation in place, and there are other investments around the country.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para31">We recognise that local authorities need assistance, which is available for selected projects, but there is wide disparity between the performances of the best and worst local authorities in waste minimisation and recycling. That is not acceptable, and we must focus on those local authorities that are not pulling their weight in meeting targets. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test will share that objective. He has made some very useful suggestions in the debate.
<P>

<a name="30909h02_para32">We have made good progress in recycling and in the recovery of package waste. By the end of 2002, we had 44 per cent. recycling and 50 per cent. recovery of packaging waste. That is up from 30 per cent. recovery and 27 per cent. recycling when the regulations came into force in 1997. That is a considerable increase in a comparatively short time. However, we are not complacent and we recognise that there is much more to do. We have a range of challenging targets and must concentrate on the waste separations and the individual targets for different materials: my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test is right about that. I will take his suggestions away, look at them and include them in our consultation. His input this morning has been helpful and constructive and I will respond in a similar vein.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden  (Shrewsbury and Atcham):</B> 
 I am delighted to have this debate on such an important subject that causes so much angst among my constituents and, I am sure, those of many hon. Members. I have a declaration to make at the outset, which is that I have not seen an NHS dentist as a patient for more than three years. Before eyebrows are raised, I should say that I do not have particularly good teeth to boast about: it is merely that I cannot get an NHS dentist. I have not seen a private dentist either, and I am dreading the day when I shall eventually be faced with having to get one, because it is nigh on impossible in Shropshire.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para0">The problem goes back some 10 years, so before Conservative Members get too excited about a lack of activity by the Labour Government, they should take some of the blame. Back in the early 1990s, changes were made to the contract between the Government, the Department of Health and NHS dentists. Back in 1992, there was an overspend of some &#163;190 million, which resulted in the Department making unilateral fee cuts and a decrease of income of some 7 per cent. That led to a breakdown in the relationship between NHS dentists and the Department, which resulted in the exodus that we have experienced over the past 10 years or so. There are now 5 million fewer people registered with an NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para1">We have now had six years of a Labour Government. The record from when that furore was going on back in 1992 is clear. The Labour party, as I remember quite well having had some inside knowledge of such matters, said in its 1992 manifesto:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will make sure every community has access to dentists, with the resources to provide full NHS cover. We will restore the free dental check."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para2">Although we may have seen some changes in attitudes by the new Labour party and, ultimately, the new Labour Government, all the subsequent warm words of support for NHS dentists have belied what has happened.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para3">In 1996, in the run-up to the general election, the Prime Minister said on page 180 of his book "New Britain: My Vision of a Young Country":
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If things continue as at present and more people reach for their cheque books to pay for private insurance I genuinely believe that the NHS will cease to exist as we know it."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para4">He also said that a decade ago people would not have believed it if they had been told that they could not get an NHS dentist, only a private one. Straight after the general election he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will have a national health service restored to the basic principles of the British NHS&#151;the health service that we founded".&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18 June 1997; Vol. 296, c. 304.]
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para5">I wholeheartedly agree with him&#151;there should be delivery, at the point of need, of a free service, not one that is charged for. However, we have since had six years of excuses and broken promises.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para6">In September 1997, the then Health Minister, the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), said in relation to NHS dentists that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"inequality and inaccessibility must be tackled head on now as part of the Government's drive to modernise NHS services".
<P>
</UL></FONT>

</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para7">In 1999, another former Health Minister, the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), said that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"this Government is committed to providing high quality dental care to a greater number of people."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para8">In January 2000, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, Lord Hunt, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The NHS of the 21st century must be built around the needs of the patient not the system . . . From next year, we want to see everyone able to access NHS dental services, no matter where they live".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para9">So it goes on. One reply after another has been made to parliamentary questions, and one promise after another has been made, and all have failed. In September 2000, Lord Hunt said that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Prime Minister's commitment . . . to give back dentistry to all who need it by September 2001"
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para10">would be met. He added that the Government recognised
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the traditional system is failing some patients and there are still too many patients who have problems finding an NHS dentist. That will change."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para11">Three years on, we are faced with more promises. Just in the past month, Health Ministers have promised that finally there will be change.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para12">I want to give a taste of the problems that people face in different parts of the country. In October last year, people in Rossendale queued for three hours to try to register when they found out that a new dental surgery was opening. In Blackburn, the primary care trust spokeswoman Janet Ledward recently said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have a serious shortage of dentists offering NHS treatment."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para13">In East Lancashire, the dental health consultant Dr. Gary White said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The biggest difficulty is that there simply aren't enough dentists being trained and that's a government problem."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para14">It was widely reported that in July in Carmarthen, south Wales, 600 people queued in the rain around the block when they heard that Brynteg dental surgery was opening. Half were turned away. Surgery staff received abusive phone calls because people were so fed up at not being able to register. London has the worst registration level and some of the worst oral health. In Scarborough, John Renshaw, the chairman of the British Dental Association, said that the situation is "desperate" and is a problem in the south, the north, the west&#151;all over.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para15">Dr. Donald Mackenzie from Lymington in Hampshire recently wrote to <i>The Times</i>, on the basis of his 25 years' experience as an NHS dentist, that he was
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"deeply cynical about the Government's sudden 'commitment' to NHS dentistry, after years of a totally obvious policy of deliberately pushing dentistry out."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h03_para16">A final example comes, of course, from Shropshire. My constituency is in the heart of Shropshire. I recently rang NHS Direct, the telephone service that is supposed to be the magic wand to solve all our ills and problems. I asked about NHS dentists. The lady was polite and helped as best she could. She asked for my name, which I gave, and then my address. As soon as I mentioned Shropshire she stopped me in mid-sentence and said, "Particularly bad area for dentists, Shropshire."
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 32WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para17">I asked whether I could find a dentist in Shropshire and she said: "You can't find an NHS dentist to register with as an adult in the whole county." I said, "Okay, I'll go further afield. How about south Cheshire?" We were struggling, but we managed to find one in Congleton, a wonderful part of the area, which I know quite well, having been born and bred in Cheshire. It is a lovely part of the world, but in spite of the enticement of travel to Congleton to see an NHS dentist, I do not think that patients in Shrewsbury should have to travel a round trip of 80 miles on rural roads to find one. There was none in north Herefordshire, either.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew1"><B> Matthew Green  (Ludlow):</B> 
 As a fellow Shropshire MP I can tell my hon. Friend that until recently I had an NHS dentist&#151;45 minutes' drive away in Worcestershire. Sadly that surgery has now closed its books, owing to the death of one of the dentists. The nearest one at which I could register my family is in Staffordshire. Many of my constituents have had the same problem.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew2"><B> Mr. Marsden </B> 
: My hon. Friend echoes my comments. We face a massive problem in the west midlands. I heard it said that it is the same in Wales. It is the same all over the country. The lady at NHS Direct told me, "We've had hundreds of calls from people in Shropshire, all trying to register with an NHS dentist." It is an absolute disgrace.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew3"><B> Mr. Russell Brown  (Dumfries):</B> 
 I appreciate that on the hon. Gentleman's grand tour of the UK he did not cross the border into Scotland. In view of the great shortage of dentists, what impact does he think the closure of the Edinburgh dental school in 1992 has had on dentistry?

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew4"><B> Mr. Marsden </B> 
: I am no expert on Scotland, but the hon. Gentleman's point shows that this is a deep-rooted problem. It goes back many years. That closure exacerbated a problem that was already quite profound some 10 years ago. I shall speak about dental graduates later.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para18">A few days ago I received an e-mail from a constituent. Mrs. Urquhart and her husband have just returned from the United States. Her husband is serving in the British Army. He has done four years in Germany followed by two years in the United States. She writes:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I understood that dental care was going to be a problem on our return but I am incensed by the reality of the situation. I was given the name of two dentists in Shrewsbury who are accepting NHS patients. Both are only accepting under 18s&#151;I will have to be treated privately . . . I believe that private health care should be a choice but I am being told that there is no choice available to me. We have been accepted onto our local NHS Doctor's list so why is the same facility not available for dental treatment?"
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para19">I concur with that. She continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"After 2 years in the US, I am a big advocate of the NHS. I believe everyone should be entitled to medical and dental treatment, not just those who can afford it&#151;and yet here I am in exactly that situation, dental treatment for those who can pay."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h03_para20">I contacted Shropshire county primary care trust this morning and so this update is hot off the press. It says that

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h03_para22">We face a crisis in Shropshire and right across Britain. Registrations have fallen dramatically. The figures speak for themselves. In 1997 when Labour came to power 19,383,000 adults were registered. According to the latest figures, 16,793,000 adults are currently registered. My big worry is children. In 1997, 7,367,000 children were registered, but the figure is now down to 6,784,000. The future generation should be building a relationship with their local dentist, as they do with their local GP, and talking about ways to prevent tooth decay and gum disease, but they cannot do so. They are given a sticking plaster solution of dental access centres to get emergency care. That is not good enough.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para23">Furthermore, since 1997 NHS patients have had to pay an extra &#163;80 million in dental charges. That is a 20 per cent. increase in six years. A basic examination, a couple of X-rays and one filling will now cost &#163;17.80. Most people simply put that off; they cannot afford it, especially those in socially deprived areas. It is not good enough for a Labour Government to say, "Well, we're afraid you will have to pay it; we have little sympathy for those who have to pay dental charges."
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para24">On completion of their studies, dental graduates are saddled with an average debt of &#163;13,000, and 49 per cent. have to take part-time jobs during their studies just to make ends meet. Is it any wonder there is no throughput of new blood into the service? That is a ticking time bomb that will have an effect on oral health in the future. Many problems are being created now because of the lack of NHS dentists.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para25">There are no exemptions for pensioners, save reductions for those on income support, although I acknowledge that those charges were railroaded through by the last Tory Government, who made pensioners pay. Likewise, there are a host of other small groups, such as prisoners, who are affected. They may be the forgotten people in society, but the Heath Minister's written reply on 4 July to my question on the matter stated that prisoners are now waiting for routine appointments between one and 55 days. That means that prisoners may have to wait for almost two months just to get an appointment. Many people in prison have been taking drugs, and when they start to come off drugs, one of the first things to hit them is the pain from tooth decay. They may not have been able to feel that pain for years, so they may not realise that they have problems.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para26">We are shoring up enormous problems for children. When the Minister rises she will inevitably say that more money is being spent to tackle the problem, which is true, and I agree that the number of treatments is slightly up. However, people want to build up a relationship and have access to professional advice from someone whom they can get to know and trust because they see them every six or twelve months. At a dental access centre, the patient goes in and tries to describe the problem. Time is limited as the conveyor-belt system is designed to get people in and out quickly. I rang one in Shrewsbury this morning to ask how soon I could have <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 34WH</B></P>
a routine dental appointment, and was told that I could not be seen for 10 days. We have some great professionals in the service who do their best, but with the best will in the world, they will not be able to quiz me about my brushing routine or my diet, or talk to me about the problems they may spot in the teeth or gums. All they can do is to say that they have spotted where the problem is, and that they have to take the tooth out or plug the loose filling. They will not be able to build a relationship, which is so important, especially for children.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para27">What do the Government propose to do? Out of a &#163;1.2 billion budget, which will be handed over to the primary care trusts in April 2005, the Government say that they will give an extra &#163;10 million to help out. On the face of it, that sounds like a reasonable sum, but to put it in perspective it is 0.0000008 per cent. of the budget that is currently available to provide NHS dental services. The Department of Heath's blurb sets out what the &#163;10 million is for. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An NHS team, backed by &#163;9 million, will support PCTs where access is most challenging, providing advice and guidance on best practice in increasing access and modernising dentistry locally to tackle longstanding bottlenecks where it is hard to find an NHS dentist. The remaining &#163;1 million will assist PCTs . . . in preparing for the change."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h03_para28">That is derisible. It is an insult to say that that &#163;10 million will start to deliver what we need. The British Dental Association says that it needs at least 4,000 dentists to be able to meet demand. The Minister cannot quibble with that. It is what the British people want. When they are given the opportunity, they seize it with both hands. They want to be able to register with an NHS dentist. They will go to the dental access centres for emergency treatment if they have to, but that is not the long-term solution.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para29">There was an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last Sunday on the recruitment of 200 dentists from overseas. I am greatly alarmed by that prospect. Will we be plundering reserves of overseas professionals, many of whom come from developing nations that can least afford to give up their health care professionals to this country to service our NHS patients? As Ian Wylie, chief executive of the BDA, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is really a sticking plaster for dentistry. We should be investing in homegrown undergraduates rather than poaching overseas dentists, especially where there is under-provision of dental care in their home countries."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h03_para30">The outcome of all this is that we are being forced to take out private medical insurance for dental cover. People in deprived areas will not bother to take out insurance because they cannot afford it. For a family of two adults on level B&#151;that is, people with relatively good teeth&#151;the cost is &#163;16.39 a month, which is about &#163;400 a year. Two adults and two grown-up children in one family are expected to find &#163;800 a year for basic cover. That is not good enough. It is a betrayal of Labour principles of many years to say to people, "We are going to force you to go private, because that is the solution to the crisis in NHS dentistry."
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para31">On 3 August, John Humphrys wrote in <i>The Sunday Times</i>:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have gone down the private road through default and that's not good enough."
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para32">We cannot blame the dentists. They have a choice: charging about &#163;50 on average for an appointment in the private sector or receiving only about &#163;18 on average <P>

in the NHS. Serious money must be invested. We do not need gimmicks from the Government in the form of small handouts, with the claim that they will sort out the problem. They will not.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew5"><B> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed):</B> 
 The problem that dentists most often raise is that they feel unable to complete the treatment that they consider appropriate for the patient under the current NHS financing arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew6"><B> Mr. Marsden </B> 
: I agree. I wait to hear from the Minister how the proposed changes through the PCTs will tackle the source of the problems that my right hon. Friend mentioned. There is incredible frustration because the professionals want to do a good job. They want to improve the whole population's health, but the system very often works against them. It is about time that the Government started to give them what they need so that they can deliver that service. The BDA estimates that some 200 new dentists need to come on stream every year.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para33">We have paid our taxes and the increased charges in national insurance, but we have a threadbare system for NHS dentistry. Only emergency treatment is available. NHS dentistry is inefficient, because it doubles up for many treatments, so there is no chance of developing a relationship with a dentist. As a result, people's health, especially that of the poorest and most vulnerable in society, will be affected for the rest of their lives.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para34">NHS dentistry is a broken promise. It now delivers a two-tier system that forces people into the private sector and into paying money for what should be a basic right. Labour should hang its head in shame.

 I hope to be reasonably brief. In my constituency it is not possible to get an NHS dentist. In July, I raised the matter with the Department of Health, which sent me an encouraging letter saying that not only will NHS dentistry be given a considerable increase in its annual budget, but a working party, led by the chief dental officer, is suggesting field sites. I am not sure what a field site is; the phrase conjures up pictures of things that I do not want to think about in relation to dentistry.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para35">There should be a significant move away from the present system of item of service contracts, but we are in an extraordinary situation where, although a quarter of the population, and many children, can receive NHS dental treatment, the rest of us cannot. That is quite frightening.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 36WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para36">We must be clear. It is not a matter of suggesting that a long-term solution will provide a fully salaried service&#151;that was suggested by the Socialist Health Association more than 30 years ago. We cannot continue to allow a profession such as dentistry to be treated as it is in this country. If it is true that the average dentist earns &#163;60,000 a year without private practice, some would say that dentists are not among the most poorly paid. Some years ago in my constituency, there were no NHS dentists, and I insisted that some should be appointed. All that happened was that a practice ran for a certain time, and then the practitioners looked over at one or two of their colleagues who were extremely well remunerated and decided to accept private patients only.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para37">Indeed, some practices will not accept even children as NHS patients. When I went to that practice in my constituency to discuss what it was doing, the dentist concerned said, "We need exactly the same remuneration as doctors and the same terms and conditions." I pointed out to him that on the door of his practice there was a notice that I thought had some relevance to his rates of pay. It said: "Even if you have received treatment in this practice, if there is an emergency, do not come here. Go to the local accident and emergency service of the NHS." In other words, the practice was not even providing emergency cover.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para38">We must have a little clear thinking about what is going on in the NHS. It is all very well to receive a letter saying, "Of course we are concerned about dentistry in Crewe, but we have had a look at the website, and we understand that there may be some vacancies in Winsford or Northwich for your constituents", but neither area is easily reached by public transport, let alone the kind of transport that would get my constituents to a dentist's surgery when they need care.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para39">It is much more important that we seriously ask the following questions: if primary care trusts are to be responsible for providing health care, who will tell them the terms and conditions on which people will be employed? Will those people be fully salaried? Will the PCTs have enough money to run the service efficiently? If not, what will happen to dentistry in this country?
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para40">I do not believe that anyone can run a health or dentistry service&#151;or, indeed, any of the services provided by the professions supplementary to medicine&#151;on the basis that if the going gets rough, people can always be told that they can pay to get the level of care that they deserve. That is not a responsible attitude, it cannot be defended, and it is not what I expect from a Labour Government.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para41">Some of the problems inevitably stem from the fact that we are not training enough dentists. Certainly, we are not thinking clearly enough about what we do with the ones that we have. There is no use in saying that we are going to move away from piecework in dentistry if we do not actually do it. There is no use in saying that in future we want people who provide dental care for the whole population, unless we not only make it worth their while, but insist that the constant development of private care does not leech away the expertise that the NHS requires and leave large numbers of my constituents with no care at all.

<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 37WH</B></P>
The reason for that is that they create a relationship of reliability and trust. It is even worse when one's children find it impossible to receive NHS dental care. That is returning to a situation that existed when I was a child, when the level of oral care in this country was appalling. It was regarded as an act of God. If a person did not have the money, they could not receive the sort of dental care that was essential.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para43">I am sympathetic to the difficulties that any Government face, but a number of urgent decisions need to be taken. The sums of money being spent on the dental service are obviously not producing the results or the level of care that we want or, to be frank, the level of expertise that is necessary. It is clear that the profession is concerned about its own terms and conditions, but it still has not succeeded in evolving a working partnership with the NHS that will produce the level of service that we all need.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para44">It is all very well to say that a change, by handing responsibility to another part of the NHS, will alter the situation. That is unrealistic. Primary care trusts cannot create dentists if they do not exist. Dentists will be sucked from other parts of the world, and almost inevitably they will not be trained in this country and will come from countries with a lower standard of living&#151;countries that are even worse served by dentists than we are. That is morally unjustifiable, short-sighted and absurd because it does not work. It did not work in the NHS, and it certainly will not work in dentistry.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para45">In my lifetime the provision of sufficient professionals in health care has always gone through a feast and famine cycle. A Conservative Government decide we have too many doctors, so they cut down the number. We decide that we have to do something about it, so we create another way of training people, and then say that we have too many. That inability to match care needs to the number of people being trained and the rates and conditions of pay that they receive is a failure on the part of successive Governments.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para46">I am concerned about what is happening in Cheshire. I do not know why people do not want to go to Shropshire; I would have thought that that was a rather posh part, as it looks rather nice. Usually, there is no difficulty in attracting health professionals to attractive places, but they are not quite so keen on Liverpool 8. Cheshire is getting into exactly the same situation, and it is not acceptable. Health care cannot be rationed by payment. If it is, we get into a situation that we have already reached in my constituency, where some people in need of long-term care no longer have a dentist. When they were told recently that a salaried dentist had been appointed, they were told not to tell anybody else because there would be such pressure on those facilities that the dentist would not be able to cope.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para47">Politics is a difficult art, but on the whole people do not cast their votes on foreign affairs. I was brought up by a man who said that one can make a speech on foreign affairs for 45 minutes, and the first question that will be asked is, "Why doesn't the light at the end of my road work?" So if there is a little message that the Minister wants to take away from the afternoon's debate, I hope that it will be sensible. We need a salaried service to train people and to get dental care operating now&#151;not in five or 10 years. It is an urgent problem and solving it must be high on the list for a Government who want to be re-elected.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden) on securing the debate.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para50">I will start with some basic information. In my constituency, 80,000 people are not registered with an NHS dentist. That is more than the total population of many constituencies represented in the House. That is not because mine is a wealthy constituency&#151;its GDP is less than 75 per cent. of the national average&#151;but because there is a crisis in dental services on the Isle of Wight that extends beyond a shortage of NHS dentists to a shortage of all dentists.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para51">I raised that problem with the Isle of Wight primary care trust not long after I was elected, but the crisis has got worse rather than better. In February I received a letter from the PCT that said:

<a name="30909h03_para53">Perhaps the hon. Lady did not realise that the surrounding area is not replete with dentists, except when they are sailing. People have had to go to Southsea, Portsmouth, Cosham, Southampton or Lymington to find dentists who are taking patients on to their lists.

I acknowledge that, but, within a fortnight, it was taking no further patients because it was full. Since then, not one, not two, but three dentists on the island have said that they intend to retire from practice within the next six months. My constituents do not find that satisfactory. One wrote:

They chose the hovercraft rather than the catamaran, because it is quicker and there is time for the connection. That was a good thing, because the train up Ryde pier from the esplanade left at 11.35 and the bus got in at 11.34. It cost them &#163;19.95 to cross the Solent. They got to Southsea at 12.05 and walked for 25 minutes to the dentist. They had to pay &#163;10 each to register with a new NHS dentist.

It is a particular insult when the Prime Minister said in 1999 that he would provide access to NHS dentists within two years.

<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew12"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas  (Ceredigion):</B> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden) on initiating the debate, but I am afraid that his experiences in Shrewsbury are reflected across the border in Wales. Like him, I do not have an NHS dentist. I have been unable to register with an NHS dentist in Aberystwyth for more than five years. The sheer misery engendered by poor NHS provision in Ceredigion has been a real eye-opener for me in the last three years.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para67">What I have seen is symptomatic of a much deeper deterioration in NHS dental provision. That is going almost unreported, which is why this debate is important. The Prime Minister's commitment, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), has been forgotten, iced over, glossed over and even spun. "You can phone NHS Direct"&#151;that is what the Government meant by a promise of access to an NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para68">In my constituency, NHS dentistry is already the preserve of the few, not the many. Just 31 per cent. of the population are registered with a dentist. That reflects a wider trend in Wales: just two thirds of Welsh children, for example, are registered with NHS dentists.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para69">I can sense already that the Minister will say that NHS dentistry in Wales is now the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales, but remuneration and training are the responsibility of this place, and we have heard from hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber that remuneration and training are at the heart of the crisis in NHS dentistry.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para70">The only response that the Assembly has been able to make is to provide grants to dentists to set up in, for example, rural areas, but as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) mentioned, all that happens is that over time those dentists privatise their lists and become, in essence, private dentists with a very small number of NHS patients, if any. That is a complete waste of public money. It is a crying shame that we are throwing good money after bad, trying to support dentists going to rural areas when we know damn well that in two or three years they will be private dentists and we will have to repeat the same process all over again. I have received an immense amount of correspondence on the issue, like many other hon. Members. Last summer, I went out into the streets of my constituency and did a street survey to see what people were experiencing with NHS dentistry. Some of my constituents' comments, like those of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, illustrate the situation.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para71">A married couple in Cardigan said that they had phoned 20 dentists, who would take patients only if they agreed to be private. NHS Direct could recommend only one dentist in west Wales, and that was in Ammanford. That is a good day's journey away&#151;I hazard to say that it is similar to crossing the Solent. One may only have to cross a river, but that is a long way away in a rural area. Mr. and Mrs. J. in Llanrhystud said that NHS Direct had suggested Barmouth to them. Anyone with any sense of the geography of Wales will <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 41WH</B></P>
know that that is a ridiculous distance to ask people from somewhere south of Aberystwyth to travel for treatment. Somebody in New Quay was told that they could not register, and it was suggested that they go to Tenby or Llanelli. Those are distances of seventy or eighty miles that cannot &#151;I checked that fact&#151;be travelled in a day on public transport. One constituent of mine, an old age pensioner who needed to make two trips to have her dentures redone, was told to go to Brecon. That would have involved two overnight stays. Solutions are very slow to emerge.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para72">The National Assembly, together with the Government, have considered access to NHS dentistry. The Health Committee's report of March 2001 holds the key. It said that the current remuneration system in the general dental service
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is at the heart of the access problem".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para73">That was in 2001, and it remains the position today.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para74">The awful situation in dentistry has allowed fluoridation to raise its ugly head once again. I am opposed to that. I made my remarks on the matter last night during the debate on the Water Bill&#151;the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) was also present. It is interesting to note that the National Assembly Government suggested giving free school breakfasts to children. That was the platform of their success in the National Assembly elections last May&#151;they would provide free school breakfasts for children, but there was no mention of cleaning the children's teeth after that school breakfast. That would do a damn sight more to improve dental health than fluoridating the children's water. Taking the coke machines out of schools would also help a great deal.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para75">Like the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, I feel that only a system of salaried NHS dentists can tackle the huge gap in provision that exists today. We need to consider the introduction of a bulk payment system, and remunerating dentists for the preventive work they undertake and not just the treatment that they carry out. Fluoridation is a cop out, and a tacit acknowledgement by the Government that their provision of NHS dentistry is failing the vast majority of people in this country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew13"><B> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud):</B> 
 I start by concurring with the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas). Fluoridation is the wrong approach to a difficult problem. I despair of the BDA. It is a membership organisation, so it could lead its members by persuading them to come back into the NHS. Let us not fool ourselves, the debate is about money.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para76">What worries some of us is that the same debate could happen with respect to doctors and general practice. We must be aware of the problems that my dentist has spoken about to me. I declare an interest, as I am still with an NHS dentist. I shall not quote him, as he would probably be drummed out of the profession. He said to me from the outset that once people see the other side and the benefits offered by private practice&#151;the fact that they can pick and choose their patients, the plans offered to them, and the hours they work&#151;they will not come back again. It defeats the whole purpose of public service.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 42WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para77">I have always believed that those in public service must accept that they have to make sacrifices as well as taking some of the benefits. One benefit is the belief that people still have&#151;whether rightly or not, I do not know&#151;that the public holds a person in greater esteem because they work in public service. That is not compatible with pretending that those in public service can get the rewards and benefits that they want.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para78">I feel most strongly that the Government have a huge problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) always got the tone right. I receive more complaints about this health issue than about any other. Usually, an MP can sympathise and suggest to constituents ways in which they can work round the system, and can help them to tackle what is undoubtedly a very difficult problem. In reality, however, we must say, "I'm sorry, but that's just tough." That is what we get when we have a privatised system working out of the NHS. It is not acceptable.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para79">The Government are not doing enough, and I worry that they are trying to create the illusion that they are doing something about the general dental service with dental access centres and salaried dentists. When dentists see what they can get by going private, they will leave. Only a small, dedicated group of professionals will want to stay in the NHS&#151;or, dare I say it, those professionals who work in areas where they are unlikely to get enough private patients and who may see the benefits of the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para80">That dilemma is faced not only by the Government but by dentists, who must make those sacrifices if they are to service the population of this country. Negotiations must now take place nationally and locally to try to fix this problem. It has been gestating for too long. We have seen what has gone wrong. I call on my hon. Friend the Minister to tell us what negotiations are taking place, what the cost is and if we are prepared to pay it. We must say to dentists, "This is what the Government are prepared to come up with. What are you prepared to sacrifice to come back to the NHS?" If they are public servants, they must realise that their obligation is to all their patients, not just to children. Concentrating on servicing the needs of children is a nice idea, but when they reach 18 their teeth are no longer of concern. That is unacceptable. We must make progress.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para81">I despair at some of the packages that are presented to patients as though they are what they need. We all know that money is made not in dental care but on hygiene products and all the other things that come with them. They may be important, but they are not the point of a dentist. As my dentist says, a dentist's central concern is pain control. People need a dentist when their teeth are causing them difficulties. We must build prevention into dental care, but let us not fool ourselves that we are getting the icing on the cake. What we want are the ingredients of the cake, and to go back to the basics of good dental care. We are all aware that things will be much worse in the future if there is no preventive approach. I want to know from the Government what negotiations are taking place and what deal needs to be struck, so that we can get on and strike it.

<a name="30909h03_spnew16"><B> Mr. A. J. Beith  (Berwick-upon-Tweed):</B> 
 My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden) described the situation in Shropshire. I am glad that he raised that issue today, and am grateful to many other hon. Members for describing situations similar to the one in Northumberland in the Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency. The problem began to affect Berwick two to three years ago when dentists started to accept only children on the NHS. The situation has worsened, and it is now very difficult to register a child with an NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para82">The initial argument was that patients could go to another town such as Eyemouth, which is not too far away. However, Eyemouth stopped accepting English patients in its dental practices. Dentists started to say, "You can go to Wooler, which is 16 miles away, or Alnwick, which is 30 miles away." The same situation began to develop there. A practice in Alnwick started to practise purely private dentistry. Indeed, it wrote to patients telling them about the virtues of Denplan and saying, "We should like to emphasise that your next appointment will still be available on the NHS. We look forward to discussing the changes with you." Some of those discussions took a hostile turn, especially those involving the patients who showed me the letter.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para83">When the dentists were no longer available 30 miles away, patients were told, "The only thing you can do is to go to the dental hospital in Newcastle 66 miles away", but only emergency treatment is available there. As several hon. Members have said, the situation is unacceptable. It is like saying to someone in London that if they want to see a dentist, they should go to Rugby or Ipswich&#151;indeed, the train services might be better&#151;and that when they get there, they can receive only emergency treatment.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para84">The method that the Government and the health care trust adopted to provide some immediate relief was to try to install a salaried dentist in the infirmary in Berwick, where there is room, and where accommodation has been made available. However, they had great difficulty in making the appointment. One senior, experienced dentist who thought of taking it on told me that he had been informed that if he were appointed, he could provide only emergency treatment, and not the dental care that he thought a patient needed. It would simply be a question of removing the tooth, or possibly repairing the filling, which, as a professional dentist, was not what he would want to do. He was being asked to make the wrong clinical judgment about what was right for the patient.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para85">The dentist also explained to me that the rate of pay was &#163;70 for a three-hour session. For an experienced professional, that is unreasonable&#151;it is an inadequate rate of pay for someone who can provide a high standard of service and who will be called on in a fairly desperate situation. The health care trust has therefore had considerable difficulty in filling that post. People have been assured that there will be a dentist at the hospital, but they still see advertisements in the local paper seeking to fill the appointment.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para86">When I raised that matter in the House on several occasions, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, now the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional <P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para87">However, the leverage to ensure local commissioning has not solved the problem, which has a number of deep-seated, long-standing causes. One of those is the shortage of qualified dentists, otherwise we would not be seeking them from overseas. Reference was made earlier to past decisions that contributed to that shortage, such as the closure of dental training facilities in Edinburgh.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para88">We cannot rely on long-term solutions for our constituents. It is unacceptable that people cannot register with an NHS dentist or obtain proper dental care. I look to the Minister to resolve the situation in my constituency and the other areas affected.

I also thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak, because I realise that this is a devolved issue&#151;responsibility for both the NHS and dentistry has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para89">I should like to make hon. Members aware of the situation in Scotland, because the issue is UK-wide. I indicated earlier the problem that we have had since the closure of the dental school in Edinburgh. There are now two dental schools left in Scotland that produce, on average, 120 graduates per year. However, the demand is such that the system needs to produce 125 to 130 qualified dentists annually. Moreover, some of those who qualify go south of the border, and some go overseas. We tend to focus on the UK's recruitment of professionals from Africa and Asia, but some of our professionals go to north America to ply their trade.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para90">The issue has been brought into focus in my constituency because, in the past couple of weeks, the last NHS practice in Dumfries decided to go private. The letter that it sent to all its patients caused me some concern because it stated that over the past few years there had been a steady erosion of Government funding. Even the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham would probably admit that funding has been provided, although perhaps not as much as people would have liked.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para91">I took exception to that. When I wrote to the local practice to raise the issue, the reply stated that the problem started in 1992, when the Doctors and Dentists Remuneration Review Body recommended an 8.6 per cent. fee increase. That translated to a 7 per cent. fee cut, as it was 15.6 per cent. down. It is a long way back to recover that.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para92">We talk about spin in society, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) that it is the day-to-day things that determine whether the Government are in favour with the electorate. In that context, people may think that solely the present Government are to blame, but hon. Members can see that successive Governments have not delivered the service that we want.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 45WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para93">It has been said that 4,000 extra dentists are required, but what will happen if we manage to secure them without changing our current structure? If we do not change the fee structure, we will lose them too. We are not getting enough dentists through in the first place, but even if we could suddenly magic them up, we would lose them as well. Even if there was an attempt to change the structure, I am not sure whether we could get some of the other people back.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para94">The system is financially driven, which has forced people away. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) made that abundantly clear. Those who have left have seen what happens outside and will not want to come back. We need salaried dentists throughout the United Kingdom, and I want to hear from the Minister how we will tackle this serious problem, which means a great deal not only to hon. Members, but to the general public. We still have 35 NHS dentists in my constituency, but that is half the number that we want, and I worry when I see some of the criteria that must be met. Young people in full employment will get a dentist, but what happens to those who are unemployed? Those are the issues that need to be tackled, and like all hon. Members present today, I want an answer to the problem sooner rather than later.


<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew18"><B> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon):</B> 
 The fact that we have had a large turnout and an excellent debate is a reflection of how seriously people take this issue and how large they judge the problem to be. In preparing for this debate, I quickly looked up some of the figures, rather like one quickly brushes one's teeth before going to the dentist, even if it is the only time that one does it for several months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew19"><B> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford):</B> 
 Speak for yourself.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew20"><B> Dr. Harris </B> 
: The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is probably the only person who does not brush extra hard just before he goes to see his dentist because he is blessed with gorgeous teeth, as he keeps telling everyone.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para95">The problem is that we do not discuss the issue often enough. It is not seen as mainstream NHS, when that is exactly what it is and should be seen as. We owe a great debt to my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden) for introducing this debate, and for providing in its scope and detail one of the best introductory speeches that I have heard. He considered the history of the problem: the worsening access, the broken promises and the failure of policy. He then took us on a tour of the country&#151;like the Consumers Association, the health <i>Which?</i>, and the Audit Commission, he has done that. We are grateful to him for giving us the opportunity to discuss some of the problems in such a structured way.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para96">The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) reflected, as I shall, on how we have got to this position after six years of a Labour Government. The problem of access to what should be basic NHS care has got worse, and continuing initiatives have not tackled the problem. Ministers <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 46WH</B></P>
have given the impression that the problem is due to be tackled, but it has not been. The hon. Lady reflected that her party, which has a long and proud history of at least trying to expand access to NHS care and make it free at the point of delivery, may lose support and votes at the next election unless the Government act soon. Recent moves to give power to primary care trusts to provide NHS care are at least coherent with the need to ensure that commissioning for NHS dentistry services and acute and community dental services are considered together. If NHS dentistry access is defined as access and not registration, and people are still charged and therefore deterred from going, the point will have been missed and yet more expectations will be dashed.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para97">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) cleverly and amusingly showed what nonsense some of the access pledges are, expecting people to travel with or without public transport, as the crow flies, regardless of natural barriers, to receive NHS care when they are in pain or in an emergency.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para98">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) reflected on the problems in Wales and introduced the subject of fluoridation&#151;the debate had been going 46 minutes before he did so. The Government must feel under pressure to make more progress on that issue, given their failure to provide holistic and preventive care in dentistry. Registration would be a means of doing so. The Liberal Democrats wanted to await the outcome of the York report and abide by its findings. Those findings were that fluoridation was safe, but that there was not sufficient, good quality evidence at that time to show that it is adequately effective. That is the authors' interpretation of the York report, although both sides of the debate seem to pray it in aid to support their position.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para99">A fundamental question must be answered. Is it appropriate to fluoridate water, even if it is shown to most people's satisfaction to be effective and safe? Is that adulteration of the water supply going too far? I suspect that that will be left to a free vote, but we will not be in a position even to argue the principle until we see better evidence of the effectiveness of fluoridation. There are other mechanisms for improving dental health&#151;including children's dental health&#151;such as proper access to dental advice and to the best products, which will involve fluoride but not fluoridated water. The Government should allow a proper debate about fluoridation before introducing a Bill that has implications for fluoridation but does not necessarily tackle the principle.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para100">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) showed that there are problems in a market-based system. Private dentistry is a private business. He is right: there has been a failure in the market. An interesting question is whether it would be possible to bring dentistry back into the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para101">My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) demonstrated one of the many sneaky ways in which private practitioners increase their market share under Denplan. Is it appropriate for a dentist to glower over someone in their chair and say, "You are going to switch to this very good, affordable plan that suits me better"? There is a serious question about whether that is the best way to do it. It may be how the Whips in some parties work <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 47WH</B></P>
in Westminster, but it is inappropriate for dental care. He also identified the problem of how long one has to wait for emergency treatment and how it is difficult for dentists who just do emergency work to provide effective and holistic treatment.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para102">The hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) raised the problem of dental supply, which is critical to the debate. It is not rocket science, but Governments have been unable to provide throughput from dental schools to provide adequate capacity in the system and an adequate market, so that the NHS can compete with private dentistry. If private dentists' lists were only half full, because there were more dentists, they would be more willing to work with the NHS at whatever price was agreed. Can we get private dentists back into the NHS if the fee structure is changed? I believe so, but only by tackling the problems in the labour market.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para103">I want to deal with some of the Government's broken promises, such as the broken promise to tackle health inequality. How can we have greater equality of health care when some people have to go private but cannot afford to, and when even those that can access NHS care have to pay charges that deter them and that they perhaps cannot afford? There are also problems of poor access, particularly for those who rely on public transport, because the Government's approach has been to provide access over distance, which is difficult when there is no public transport.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para104">Another failure of the Government relates to prevention. As I and other hon. Members have said, we do not allow holistic or proper preventive care to be given. That is a significant failure of policy. If we can prevent dental ill health, it will be cost effective in the long run. It has been a failure of the market because of an inadequate labour force. It is a failure of choice for patients who are lucky to get any option at all in an emergency or a routine setting. For a Government who talk so much about choice, it must be very disappointing.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para105">We should have an NHS that is free at the point of delivery, comprehensive and universal. Why should teeth be excluded? How can we have a system in which there are charges even for NHS treatment? The revenue raised from charges has risen by 20 per cent. in six years under this Government? When Ministers attack the Conservatives, they talk about an NHS that is free at the point of delivery. They should look to their own policies and practice, because it is not always free. Charges deter people, especially the poorest.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para106">Are the Conservatives willing to apologise for the imposition of that contract in 1992, which everyone agrees started the problem, and for forcing pensioners to pay for dental checks? We must also ask the Government serious questions about the cost-effectiveness of their dental access scheme, because the cost per treatment is significantly higher by several factors than the cost of NHS dentistry by a GDS dentist. There are questions for both the other parties and for all policy makers? Will we have charges for NHS dentistry? I do not think that we should. We will debate this issue at our conference later this month. I hope that it will be the start of the debate and that other parties will also consider the matter.
<P>

<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew21"><B> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford):</B> 
 One of the most interesting and obvious themes of all the contributions today, particularly those of my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) and the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), is the serious problem of access to NHS dentists in this country. Fortunately, my constituents do not suffer to the same extent as those in the Isle of Wight or in Crewe and Nantwich. We still have some good, dedicated NHS practices, and a number of the private practices in Chelmsford see children on NHS terms. Nevertheless, although we do not have the same scale of problem, there is still a significant problem of access to NHS dentists even in areas like Chelmsford.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para107">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight reminded us&#151;I suspect that some hon. Members did not want to be reminded&#151;of the great show of spin at the 1999 Labour party conference, when the Prime Minister, that master of spin, announced that within the next two years everyone would be able to see an NHS dentist. As the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) rather cruelly reminded us, we did not read the small print. Apparently, access to an NHS dentist in most cases means ringing NHS Direct and being sent half way round the country to try to find one.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para108">Four years after that bold promise from a Government who are long on giving promises but short on living up to and realising them, where are we? The percentage of adults registered with a dentist in England has declined from 52 per cent. in 1997 to 44 per cent. at present. Fortunately, the decline among children is less; it has fallen from 62 per cent to 60 per cent. In London, which has the largest population concentration in this country, the percentage of adults registered with dentists has declined from 49 per cent. in 1997 to just 37 per cent. The percentage of children registered has declined from 51 per cent. to 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para109">My constituency and others have seen a consistent and steady decline, so that 1.5 million fewer people are now registered with an NHS dentist than were registered in 1998. That does not take into account the vast number of people&#151;millions&#151;who cannot register with an NHS dentist even if they want to. Probably the most absurd and distressing recent example of the consequences of the shortage was that of an NHS dental practice in west Wales that decided to increase its number of NHS patients by 300. Hundreds of people queued in the streets of Carmarthen overnight, rather as they do outside Wimbledon, in an attempt to be one of the lucky 300 able to register with an NHS dentist. There were allegations that bribes of up to 500 per cent. were offered, although not accepted, to try to get that valuable registration. Hon. Members will agree that that is just not acceptable.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para110">What is needed is greater access to dental services. The need for a short-term fix drives individuals to see a dentist when they have an acute dental problem and they are in pain, but there is much more behind the decision to go to the dentist. It is crucial that regular check ups are carried out. Whether they should be every six months or every 12 months is an argument that I leave to clinical practitioners; some people do not have the luxury of taking such decisions because they cannot get access to an NHS dentist.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 49WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para111">A check-up is crucial not simply to check the health of an individual's teeth, but because it may detect other medical problems. Dentists can pick up conditions in a dental check up that are unrelated to dental care, which is an important contribution to preventive medicine. An early intervention in a patient's medical condition might help to cure or to alleviate their problems. That is why it is so important to minimise the inequalities in dental care and do more to enable people to see a dentist.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para112">As the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) said, finance is at the root of the matter. There is also an historical problem: ever since Nye Bevan set up the health service in the late 1940s, dentistry has been an add-on, not an integral part of the NHS as we understand it, with the principle that it is free at the point of use for all. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) wondered aloud about those discrepancies, and that is where they came from.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para113">It is crucial that the money provided is spent cost effectively and efficiently to improve and enhance levels of dental care. If the Minister has time in her closing remarks, I would like her to explain how it will be spent, because there will be a fundamental change in the provision of dental care from April 2005, with commissioning through the PCTs. We still do not know exactly how the commissioning and the provision of services will be carried out, and we need to know. For example, the budgets will be cash limited, but how does the Minister envisage the commissioning being able to meet the requirements and the needs of the population in the local PCTs? How does the Minister think that PCTs will be able positively to encourage and increase the number of people who have access to NHS dentists rather than their having to rely on private dentistry?
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para114">There has been a problem with capacity in the dental service in relation to dentists and dental nurses. Will the Minister confirm that part of the problem is historic and is due to decisions taken in the 1970s that were based on then valid opinions and the closure of one of the dental schools. It is now clear that we need more dentists. We can of course seek dentists from overseas, but that is a short-term solution. What can be done and what is going to be done to increase the number of trainees so as to ensure that in the longer term we will have enough dentists and dental nurses to fill the capacity that the service requires in order to meet the needs of the population?

<a name="30909h03_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health   (Miss Melanie Johnson) </B> 
:  I thank all Members who have contributed to this useful debate and especially the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden) for raising the issue of NHS dentistry.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para115">I stress at the outset that the Government are not complacent about the difficulties in NHS dentistry. We accept that the situation needs to be improved, which is why only yesterday in another place there was the Second Reading of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, which will reform NHS dentistry for the first time since the establishment of the NHS. It is time for change in dentistry. We have recognised that and are taking steps, as a number of hon. Members mentioned, to make those changes.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 50WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h03_para116">The oral health of the population has improved enormously since the NHS was set up, and it continues to improve. However, I entirely accept that the improvement is uneven and that there remain areas in both inner cities and rural England where dental disease remains high. The Government are committed to reducing those health inequalities. Equally challenging is the fact that in some areas, people have difficulties in finding an NHS dentist. All of us are aware of such problems from our constituents, so it might be helpful if I make it clear that the Bill is not about maintaining the status quo, but about changing it. The provisions are designed to widen access to NHS dental services and provide a more up-to-date legal framework that will better allow primary care trusts to develop and plan those services strategically.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para117">Under the new legislation, which provides a framework to take forward the "Options for Change" paper published in August last year, the PCTs are to be given new powers to provide or secure the provision of primary dental services. The existing powers under the National Health Service Act 1977, under which the general dental services are provided, are to be repealed to make way for new general dental service contracts between PCTs and dental practices.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para118">However, the high street dentist&#151;the general dental practitioner&#151;is a self-employed independent contractor providing the services. Dentists can practise wherever they like and there are no restrictions. Provided that they meet the conditions of suitability, they have an automatic right to provide NHS general dental services. They can accept as many or as few NHS patients as they wish, and they can currently alter that commitment at will without reference to the PCT.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para119">The key aim of local commissioning is to provide a greater degree of operational control for the NHS locally, so that planned services can be matched to the financial resources available. That would mean contracts for an agreed level of service over a fixed period to be delivered to agreed quality standards.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para120">Following the publication of "Options for Change", the dental profession was invited to submit ideas for testing the proposals in that report. The response was overwhelming. There was a very positive attitude among members of the profession to the idea of doing things differently, and work goes ahead with dentists on 50 different sites to test the ideas. I fear that those may be some of the field sites referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). Some 20 of those projects will examine different ways of paying for the service.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para121">We already have experience of nearly five years of local commissioning of dentistry under the personal dental services pilot programme, in which resources are devolved to the front line. Those pilot schemes now treat 750,000 people a year, and have shown what works well and less well. The so-called field sites will build on that learning. The proposals in the Bill will underpin a modernised primary dental service, provided through contracts between the primary care trusts and dental practices.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para122">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham raised the issue under debate, and I believe that it was his local situation that led him to do so. I was pleased to hear that he accepted that it was a long-standing problem. <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 51WH</B></P>
However, I also accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich that urgent action is needed.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para123">I shall quickly outline the situation in Shrewsbury. The three-surgery dental access centre has been operational since 1999. Following a recent expansion programme, there are now seven further centres across the county PCT area. At those centres, salaried dentists employed by the trust provide the full range of NHS treatment. The current priority is to meet the demand for urgent treatment, although some routine dental care can be offered to non-registered patients. A number of other steps have been taken in the area, but time and the need to respond to other questions will not allow me to go into detail about them.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para124">The key point concerns the work force, and we should recognise that that issue is difficult to address locally. It has proved difficult to attract new dentists into the Shrewsbury area for either general dental services or salaried posts in the dental access centre, and there are a number of unfilled posts in the county. The issue is therefore not necessarily as simple as hon. Members make out. The money is available to pay for the dentists, if we could only recruit them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew22"><B> Mr. Marsden </B> 
: I accept what the Minister says. I agree that the PCT will be in a better position to move things forward. However, the Government and the Shropshire PCT have shown a fundamental lack of urgency, and that lack of urgency is replicated throughout the UK. I am not aware that more money will be made available to begin to solve that fundamental problem. People out there are fed up with yet more promises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h03_spnew23"><B> Miss Johnson </B> 
: Since April 1997, dentists' NHS fees have increased by 26 per cent., in line with the recommendations of the independent review body. Anyone would accept that that is a reasonable increase. This year, dentists have received, in addition, &#163;33 million of commitment payments, under a new scheme that was introduced in 2000. There are, therefore, a number of steps being taken to improve funding. I <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 52WH</B></P>
accept that Opposition Members&#151;and some Government Members&#151;may still say that more money needs to be ploughed into the service. However, those Opposition Members who voted against the increases in funding to the NHS have little basis for making that point.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para125">I shall briefly sketch the changes introduced in the Bill, and the effect that they would have. In future, the allocations to PCTs will include funding currently harnessed by their local dentists, and they will be required to spend at least an agreed amount, and more if their local priorities indicate the need. PCTs will be able to take those decisions and employ dentists in the way that I outlined earlier, in order to address the priorities of local provision. At present, the method of payment means that the funds&#151;which, as hon. Members know, are non-cash limited&#151;are spent only to the extent that dentists wish to carry out treatment on the NHS, so that will be a significant change. The reforms have the endorsement of the British Dental Association. I reiterate that a huge amount of extra funding has been provided for NHS dentistry by way of fees and extra money.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para126">Many hon. Members raised the matter of work force planning. A review is under way and we shall report on it by the end of the year. It will include examination of the present age structure, the increasing number of women dentists and the impact of our reforms on contractual and remuneration arrangements. It is intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dental practices. Other issues, which no one has touched on, such as the skill mix of different professions in dentistry, are for the future. Many things need to be done, but as of 2002 there are nearly 18,500 dentists in England. That is an increase on the 1997 figure of 16,700-odd.
<P>

<a name="30909h03_para127">In response to the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas), I point out that the matter in question is a devolved one, and apart from the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, I cannot comment on matters in Wales.

<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew0"><B> Mr. Richard Bacon  (South Norfolk):</B> 
 I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this short debate on disability living allowance, a benefit that is of value to many disabled people. Disability living allowance is paid to those who need help to look after themselves. The allowance has a care component, which is paid to someone who needs to be looked after, and a mobility component, which is paid to someone who needs help to get around. It is paid at different rates depending on how someone is affected by his or her disability.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para0">To help answer the question whether one can get disability living allowance, the website of the Department for Work and Pensions asks potential applicants:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Have you needed help for 3 months because of a severe physical or mental illness or disability, and are you likely to need it for at least another six months?"
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para1">That seems clear enough. However, all has not been plain sailing with the allowance and the Social Security Committee has commented on problems caused partly by court decisions changing the basis for eligibility but also by flawed administrative procedures which, it observed, fail
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in terms of simplicity and workability".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para2">That is an understatement, and, what is more, it is not clear that things have improved since the Select Committee made that comment.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para3">I should like to draw attention to the case of my constituent, Mr. Douglas Gowan, who lives in Hethersett in south Norfolk. Unfortunately, his case is complicated. The sequence of events is as follows. Mr. Gowan, who is English, worked in the United States for an American company called Amjet, which planned to buy a division of Vosper Thorneycroft in the UK. The decision to buy the UK business was taken in May 1999. The plan was for Mr. Gowan to return to England and run the newly-acquired UK business. Mr. Gowan duly sold his house in the United States and returned to the UK. By December 1999 he was a UK resident.

<a name="30909h04_para4">On 11 August 2000 Mr. Gowan had a very serious accident at Heathrow terminal 4, when he fell down two flights of steps leading to the Paddington express, sustaining very serious injuries, which led to massive swelling and inflammation. A doctor at the hotel where Mr. Gowan was staying took him in a wheelchair to St. Thomas's hospital, where he was refused treatment. The hospital said, wrongly, as it turned out, that he was not entitled to national health service treatment.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para5">Although Mr. Gowan had a UK address by then, the hospital refused to recognise it because he did not have a current NHS number. Instead, with the help of a friend, Mr. Gowan went to the private Cromwell hospital, but that was cripplingly expensive, costing several thousand pounds a day. Again with the assistance of a friend, Mr. Gowan obtained a wheelchair-assisted flight to Milwaukee in the United States, where he still had some medical insurance. He was in a very serious condition and had to be stretchered off the aircraft. He was taken straight to Columbia hospital in Milwaukee.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para6">Since the accident, Mr. Gowan has received extensive medical treatment and been seen by various specialists. He has been diagnosed with eosinophilic fasciitis with some variations. It is a rare neuromuscular disorder in which cells are activated to attack the immune system and the muscular control of the body. It is said to affect as few as one in 2 million people. There are periods of intense cramps and extreme pain, and sometimes what would be described in layman's terms as paralysis and total immobilisation. However, it is episodic. Mr. Gowan can lose the use of his legs suddenly, and fall down without warning.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para7">It should be emphasised, since it is important with respect to what happened later in one of the disability living allowance appeal tribunal hearings in Norwich&#151;there have been three such hearings so far&#151;that Mr. Gowan had been habitually resident in the United Kingdom from December 1999 and that that fact is not contested by the Department for Work and Pensions or the Benefits Agency. When Mr. Gowan returned to England, he eventually applied for the DLA on 14 June 2001. The application was not recorded until 9 July 2001, but it is not now contested that he applied in June.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para8">On Friday 17 August, Mr. Gowan was telephoned by a Dr. Alistair Purves, who said that he represented the Government and needed to make a disability assessment. He asked whether he could visit the following Sunday, 19 August. Mr. Gowan found it strange that a doctor should want to visit on a Sunday, but he agreed. When Dr. Purves arrived, he told Mr. Gowan that he did not have the proper forms with him, but he took notes on a plain paper pad. Dr. Purves made no physical examination whatever, but sat in an armchair while Mr. Gowan was on a sofa opposite. Dr. Purves asked questions, made notes and commented at some length on the inadequacies of the US medical system.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para9">On 21 September 2001, Mr. Gowan was informed that he was "not entitled" to the DLA. Dr. Purves's report was enclosed with the letter. For the first time, Mr. Gowan saw what Dr. Purves had written. Let it be remembered that Dr. Purves had not brought the proper forms with him and had said as much to Mr. Gowan when he arrived. Immediately on receiving the form, Mr. Gowan could see that his name was misspelt, the entry for his date of birth was incorrect and the report said that he could walk
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"800 metres in 5 minutes",
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para10">whereas in fact he had said
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"80 metres once a day and it could take 5 to 10 minutes".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para11">There were some 32 factual inaccuracies in the form.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para12">There was a tick in the box that stated that Mr. Gowan had read the form, although of course he had not even seen the form before, let alone ticked any box. Even more seriously, there was a signature purporting to be Mr. Gowan's, although it was in printed, separated letters and was not in fact his signature.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para13">Although I am jumping ahead in the narrative, it may help to explain that following complaints by Mr. Gowan about Dr. Purves's behaviour, including to the General Medical Council, the medical services division of SchlumbergerSema&#151;the contractor that is responsible to the Government for undertaking medical assessments&#151;launched a serious complaint investigation team on the case.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 55WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para14">In a letter to Mr. Gowan on 17 July 2002, SchlumbergerSema stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Medical Services has reviewed the performance of Dr Purves and will now be making a request to the Chief Medical Adviser within the Department for Work and Pensions to remove him from the list of doctors approved to undertake disability assessments".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para15">In short, Dr. Purves was removed for cause.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para16">Dr. Purves does not accept the very serious allegation that he forged Mr. Gowan's signature on the form. However, he does admit ticking the box stating that Mr. Gowan had read the DLA140 form, which of course he had not done.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para17">A letter to the GMC from the Medical Protection Society on behalf of Dr. Purves, dated 18 October 2002, stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Dr. Purves accepts that, while there was no guidance to state he should do otherwise at the time, it was nevertheless an inappropriate shortcut to tick the box indicating that the person under assessment had read DLA140".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para18">That is a fact; it is not in dispute.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para19">It is also not in dispute&#151;I am jumping ahead slightly once again, but it is worth stressing this&#151;that the Appeals Service accepts that Mr. Gowan did not sign the form. The chairman of the tribunal, Mr. McDonald, stated at the most recent hearing, on 14 July 2003:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"You may take it that we accept that you did not sign the DLA140 form".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h04_para20">To return to the sequence of events, after having been told on 21 September 2001 that he was "not entitled" to the DLA, Mr. Gowan filed for reconsideration on 2 October 2001. His request for reconsideration was denied on 3 November 2001, but no reasons were given.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para21">On 4 December 2001, Mr. Gowan filed an appeal, which was heard in Norwich on 18 February 2002. His appeal was denied. However, at the hearing he was denied a chance to present witnesses or even to offer documentary evidence to the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para22">As the right to a fair hearing is one of the most basic rules of natural justice, and the denial of a fair hearing was plainly unjust, Mr. Gowan accordingly applied to the regional chairman of the Appeals Service, Mr. Robert Martin, who is based in Nottingham, for the decision to be set aside.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para23">On 12 April, Mr. Martin set the decision aside, and gave his reasons for doing so. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It appears to me just to set aside the tribunal decision because of the non-receipt of these documents, which are likely to be relevant to the issues under appeal, especially as much of Mr Gowan's argument in the appeal itself turned upon the question of the adequacy of the medical evidence that was actually given before the tribunal."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h04_para24">A new hearing for the tribunal was arranged. Mr. Gowan was informed in a memo some two months beforehand that it would take place on 18 February 2003, by coincidence a year to the day later than the first hearing. He then received a letter of 29 January 2003, which stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Your appeal has been allocated a hearing date for 18 March 2003."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h04_para25">Mr. Gowan naturally thought that that was slightly odd because he had thought that the appeal was going to be on 18 February. He telephoned the Norwich benefits <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 56WH</B></P>
office to check the date as he had his witnesses lined up for the date that he had originally been told. The Norwich office confirmed the date of 18 March 2003, and said that it, too, had received the letter. Mr. Gowan accordingly informed his witnesses, including the medical experts, that the date was now 18 March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para26">On 3 February 2003, Mr. Gowan received a letter stating that the appeal hearing had been scheduled for 18 February 2003 and not 18 March, as had been stated. The letter concluded:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I apologise for any inconvenience my error may have caused."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h04_para27">By that time, Mr. Gowan had told his witnesses about the new date and some of them were now unable to attend on 18 February as they had made other plans. The whole point was that the previous year he had not been able to present witnesses at the hearing. That was why the decision was quashed. It now seemed that he would once again be unable to present his witnesses.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para28">Mr. Gowan asked for a postponement. On 12 February 2003, he received a letter that stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The request for a postponement has been refused . . . The tribunal can decide the appeal even if you are not at the hearing. As you have asked for an oral hearing, you may consider it is important you are there."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30909h04_para29">At that point I decided, as Mr. Gowan's Member of Parliament, that I should attend the hearing with him, as it was looking alarmingly possible that once again there would be an unfair and unjust hearing.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para30">The tribunal met on 18 February 2003 and adjourned the hearing to a later date, having issued directions regarding further evidence that was needed to enable it to reach a decision. I shall describe the directions from the chairman of the tribunal, which I heard myself as I was at the tribunal. Mr. Gowan was asked to provide within 14 days a list of witnesses and any dates that should be avoided, which he did. The Secretary of State was to report within 14 days whether the report by Dr. Purves containing his original assessment of Mr. Gowan's condition was still relied on and, if so, to what extent. To date, there has still been no report from the Secretary of State on whether that report is to be relied on at all.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para31">Another direction was that there should be a complete bundle of appeal papers, prepared as one bundle. On the Friday evening before the third hearing, which eventually took place on Monday 14 July, Mr. Gowan received an incomplete and out-of-sequence bundle at 5.30 pm, and only then after numerous telephone calls and complaints.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para32">Another direction was that the Secretary of State was to produce all documentary evidence relating to the original DLA claim and the new claim, including a report from Mr. Gowan's treating physician, Dr. Naftalin, which entirely rebutted Dr. Purves's diagnosis. Again, that still has not happened, even now.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para33">The hearing was eventually scheduled for 14 July 2003, when the tribunal met again. I also attended that hearing. Strangely, the chairman raised a new point of law at the hearing as to whether Mr. Gowan actually had the right to receive disability living allowance, as it was possible that he did not meet the residency test. As I stressed earlier, the Department did not contest the fact that Mr. Gowan met the habitual residency test. That point was raised by the chairman at the last minute during the lunch hour. He produced a photocopied page <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 57WH</B></P>
of the relevant regulation, but did not produce a second page on which the text continued to state the exceptions to the residency rule. The appeal was again denied and in July Mr. Gowan asked for the reasons to be given. That has also not been done.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para34">Will the Minister explain why my constituent, Mr. Gowan, is being treated like that? As a matter of law, when a tribunal issues a ruling, is it binding on the Government, the Department and the Benefits Agency as well as on the appellants? The Government have failed to do what they were asked: they have failed to report within 14 days on whether Dr. Purves' report is reliable; they have failed to produce a complete bundle of the documents; and they have refused to produce all the documentary evidence relating to the case. Incidentally, the Department admitted at the hearing on 14 July that it knew about the letter of August 2001 from Dr. Naftalin that rebutted Dr. Purves' diagnosis. If the tribunals are binding, and the Government have to abide by their rulings, in the absence of Government compliance with them, can my constituent possibly present a fair case?
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para35">The disability living allowance is a valuable benefit for many people. It is possible that it is abused by some people, and as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I understand the Government's concern to ensure that abuse does not occur. However, it seems to me that the system is not working&#151;there is systemic failure. My constituent, who is currently suffering, is a genuine case who has been waiting far too long to receive satisfaction after an accident that took place three years ago.

<a name="30909h04_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions   (Maria Eagle) </B> 
:  May I first say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, what a pleasure it is to be here before you again so close to the middle of summer? We are not quite used to sitting in Westminster Hall at this time of year.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para36">I also congratulate the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) on bringing the case before the Chamber and setting out the chronology and his understanding of it. He clearly has a close, personal interest in the case and attended some of the hearings and I do not dispute the chronology that he has set out. I will do my utmost to deal with some points that he raised, but I am unsighted on some issues. I have a chronology of the case, but it is not as detailed as his and if I am unable to satisfy him on any points now, I will get back to him later to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para37">I concur with the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks about disability living allowance being a valuable benefit that provides for the extra costs faced by almost 2.5 million disabled people in Britain. I remind him that administering the benefit is extremely difficult. That is partly because of the design of the benefit and the fact that it is not totally medicalised; he might find that hard to believe in view of the circumstances that he set out. Its purpose is to establish the impact of the disability on the claimant and the need for extra care and mobility. That is not dependent primarily on the diagnosis of the condition, but on the evaluation of the effect that the condition has on the care and mobility requirements of the individual. That can vary widely between two people with exactly the same condition, which makes it inherently difficult and subjective to administer.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 58WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para38">There is also the curse&#151;although it is disappearing slightly&#151;of dealing with the benefit in an almost totally clerical manner. Unfortunately, there is scope within clerical systems for things to go missing and for the wrong dates to be sent out. That happens far too often and is something that we are trying to tackle by modernising and improving our systems to cope with lots of very individualised information from different parts of the country. Getting that to where it needs to be in clerical form is not always as easy as it sounds. I am the first to accept that things sometimes go wrong.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para39">I know from my past legal practice that once a case starts to go wrong, it quite often gets worse before it is put right. Listening to the sequence of events that the hon. Gentleman has set out, it struck me that this is such a case. Not only did the doctor turn out to be Dr. Purves who has resigned from medical services and is no longer used&#151;

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bacon </B> 
: It is true that, through the Medical Protection Society, Dr. Purves gave an undertaking to the General Medical Council that he would no longer undertake that kind of work, but the investigation by the serious complaint investigation team at SchlumbergerSema actually found that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Medical Services . . . will now be making a request to the Chief Medical Adviser within the Department for Work and Pensions to remove him from the list of doctors approved to undertake assessments".
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>

<a name="30909h04_para40">It was not merely the case that he resigned; he was removed from the list of those approved and removed for cause.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle </B> 
: It may be pedantic, but he may have resigned just before he was removed. In any event, I accept that he was removed for cause. I would certainly not have liked that standard of service to represent what is on offer to disabled people who are seeking to obtain the benefit or to explore their entitlement to it. I fully accept that his standard of behaviour was completely unacceptable. It was good that he was removed, given what he had done.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para41">The clerical administration of such a complex benefit has inherent difficulties. The volume of people that we assist with it&#151;almost 2.5 million&#151;and the amount we disburse, almost &#163;7 billion a year, shows its value. To give the hon. Gentleman a sense of the scale of the task of my officials in trying to administer the benefit, there are some 700,000 claims, reviews and appeals a year with which to deal. It is inevitable that problems happen, although I do not seek to justify that.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para42">The hon. Gentleman has set out a bad case that got worse. My understanding is that his constituent now has the higher rate of mobility component and the middle-rate care component, ordered from 14 January 2002. I accept that the application to which he refers has not been determined in favour of his constituent. It will relieve us all to know that Mr. Gowan made a further claim and that my understanding is that he is in receipt of higher-rate mobility, middle-rate care benefit following a later application, which appears to have proceeded smoothly. We are therefore dealing with whether his entitlement extended from when he applied <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 59WH</B></P>
on 14 June 2001 to 14 January 2002, so we are considering the value to Mr. Gowan, apart from all the hassle that he has had, which I accept is extensive&#151;

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bacon </B> 
: That is absolutely right. Mr. Gowan is now in receipt of DLA. What is specifically at issue is the question of the six or seven months during which he was not receiving it, but should have been, on the basis of a medical assessment made by Dr. Purves that has been shown to be flawed in so many different respects that Dr. Purves was removed for cause from the list of those approved to undertake assessments. In the light of that, it is important that we understand whether the Government are relying on the report of Dr. Purves. One of the orders that the tribunal made to the Secretary of State was to state the extent to which the Government were relying on the report and it, together with various other orders, has not been complied with to date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew4"><B> Maria Eagle </B> 
: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's question. Were I able to answer it today I would do so now. However, my chronology of the case is not as detailed as his. I guessed that he might raise this issue today but I was by no means certain and I did not have the entire file sent to me in advance. I will look at it. I am not aware from my preparation for this debate whether directions made by the tribunal have been met by the Department. I will look into that and let him have our view. I do not doubt him. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman's constituent did not want the appeal to go ahead in the form it did at the time it did, but my understanding is that the appeal was heard and the disallowance was maintained and that is where it rests at present.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bacon </B> 
: My constituent was unhappy for the appeal to go ahead on 18 February 2003, because of the mess over the dates, which was not his fault. The Department admitted that it was its fault. He was fearful once again that he would not be able to present his witnesses. Indeed, the tribunal adjourned on that occasion because it found that it did not have the evidence required. I do not think that my constituent objected to the tribunal taking place on 14 July. We are interested in a question of law. If a tribunal makes a direction to Government to comply with certain <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 60WH</B></P>
requirements, how, in the absence of such compliance, can my constituent be expected to enter into a tribunal that is fair or just?

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew6"><B> Maria Eagle </B> 
: I am enough of a lawyer not to trade points of law across the Floor with the hon. Gentleman. My opinion about whether it might be legal would be my opinion. I am no longer certificated and so he could not take it as proper legal advice. I will none the less get back to the hon. Gentleman on this point. I hope that he will appreciate that I cannot do so today.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para43">This debate, short though it has been, has been about a particular instance. I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman prefaced his remarks with generalised praise for the benefit and the good that it can do. We do our utmost and strive repeatedly to improve our processes. When one listens to this kind of chronology one could be forgiven for thinking that we do not always do as well as we might, but many customers are content with the way in which they are dealt with by the Department. They often think that we do not deal with them quickly enough.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para44">We are making extensive efforts using new technology to shorten claim forms to try to make them simpler and more workable. We are constrained to a degree by the law, the tests that have developed for establishing whether people are eligible for various care or mobility components and the ever-increasing complexity of the common law surrounding that. We are on quite a drive at present to simplify the applications both for attendance allowance, which is the care component equivalent for those over 65 and DLA, which has the addition of mobility component. We want to make the questions more relevant. We want my staff to talk to customers to trigger the relevant questions to ask, rather to than ask them questions that are irrelevant because they are not applying for one of the components.
<P>

<a name="30909h04_para45">As we go forward with this programme I am hopeful that we will be able to design better application forms that will be simpler, more understandable and more workable for those completing them. The overall aim is to get the entitlement to these benefits right quickly and to get the payments as quickly as possible to those who need them. I regret that Mr. Gowan has had a difficult experience with that first claim, and I undertake to write again to the hon. Gentleman about the point of law that I have been unable to answer. We shall see whether my lawyers will allow me to do that in the way that I want, but I undertake to get back to him about that point.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h04_spnew7"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with what was clearly a very complicated case. The House is grateful for her offer to write the hon. Gentleman when she has considered the matter further.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spnew0"><B> Jim Knight  (South Dorset):</B> 
 I am pleased to have secured today's debate. Affordable housing is the biggest issue for many of my constituents in South Dorset and for many people throughout the south-west.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para0">If, like me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you are lucky enough to have a decent job&#151;I see that you do&#151;and own your own home, albeit with a large mortgage, as I have, you only observe the problem of affordable housing. You may even benefit from it. In the past two years, the value of my property in Weymouth has increased by 50 per cent. That is great for those of us who own our own homes, but what about the rest? Dorset county council recently commissioned MORI to carry out a residents' survey. It found that 30 per cent. of people believed that the lack of affordable housing was the greatest single issue facing Dorset. It also found that almost half of Dorset families had a household income of less than &#163;15,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para1">Some 70 per cent. of householders in Weymouth and Portland cannot afford to buy their own home. How can we sustain our communities if our young families cannot live in them? Last week, I carried out my own survey of residents in the village of Studland in my constituency. Affordable housing was the most important issue for 68 per cent. of them. We spoke to Charles Orchard, a 24-year-old who is still living at home with his parents because he cannot find affordable alternative accommodation. People such as Charles inevitably migrate to towns with cheaper housing, but sadly not for better pay. The average wages in Dorset are the same as those in county Durham. Our tourism economy does not pay well, nor does the care sector or agriculture. The high levels of seasonal employment mean that our unemployment statistics are misleading. Unemployment is high in the winter months when, ironically, the housing supply problem is eased slightly as some holiday lets and caravans become available.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para2">Our low-wage economy contrasts completely with the housing market. We are very lucky in that we live in a beautiful environment. Our coast has world heritage status. All that is crucial to our tourist economy and for growing the seaside trade to a higher value. By increasing the length of the tourist season, we are encouraging more leisure tourism including walking, sailing and diving. However, that precious environment is also driving up the price of houses. The south-west is a very popular place to retire to. I referred to the &#163;15,000 household income, which is accounted to some extent by the larger than average number of retired householders who have relatively low incomes but relatively low outgoings.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para3">Not all pensioners are badly off. It is true that the falls in the stock market have hit most pensioners hard as private pensions have taken a serious blow. Low interest rates mean low income from savings, and inflation and council tax have hit those on fixed incomes very hard. Nevertheless, the relatively high spending power of those retiring to Dorset has combined with those buying holiday homes to create a high demand for our lovely houses in our lovely villages.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para4">Naturally, we want to protect our environment. We have not wanted to build more houses to meet the demand, and prices have rocketed as a consequence. In <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 62WH</B></P>
turn, that means that land values for any development have soared. The planning system does not differentiate between land for executive development, residential development and affordable housing development. That lack of distinction becomes a major block in increasing the supply of affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para5">Inflation in the private sector then coincides with problems in the supply of social housing. The late 80s and 90s saw the sell-off of council houses under the right to buy, but that was not accompanied by any significant investment in new build. When I visited Church Knowle recently, the chairman of the parish council told me that only three out of 150 houses in the village are owned by social landlords. As we drove around, he pointed out all the other houses that used to be council houses until they were sold. They are lovely houses at lovely prices.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para6">The same story is told throughout my constituency. Today, housing associations produce, at most, only a third of the new homes that the Government have asked them to produce to meet those inevitable regional targets. In my opinion, the proposal from the Tories, who introduced the right to buy for council tenants and who are, sadly, not here to listen to the debate&#151;

 Nor are the Liberals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spnew2"><B> Jim Knight </B> 
: Nor are the Liberals, for that matter.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para7">The Tories want to extend the same right to buy to housing association tenants, which would only worsen the situation.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para8">The vision must be that people in social housing and low-cost rented housing should have quality and choice. One of the worst things about the housing cases that I deal with in my constituency is that I know that if I can help influence the council to get one individual housed, it is at the expense of the next deserving case. I know that when a young family threatened with eviction come to see me, they are faced with the prospect of bed and breakfast. That is expensive and normally wholly inappropriate, but the council has little choice. Furthermore, once those people are top of the housing list, they must take whatever they are offered, regardless of schooling, work, transport links or the condition of the property. They have no choice, and once they have moved in, the possibility of transfer is slim. If neighbours moved in next to me and I could not get on with them, I might be able to buy somewhere else and move away from the problem. I have a choice; by and large, social housing tenants do not.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para9">A dad in Worth Matravers&#151;another village near Swanage&#151;came to see me about school transport for his daughter to Swanage middle school. He is on working tax credit and his income is therefore marginally too high for the family to qualify for free transport to school. They live just too close to get in on grounds of distance, so they have to walk all the way to and from school, even during winter, for two miles on a perilous, unlit road with no pavement. Most of us would consider moving to Swanage if we could not drive; my constituent does not have that choice as he is a social housing tenant.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para10">We are a long way from delivering the vision of choice and quality in housing. For now, we just need to try to meet the housing need that we perceive in the south-<P>

west. I was part of a delegation of south-west Labour MPs who had a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister on this subject in July. He told us that our region has had a 30 per cent. increase in funding in this financial year and assured us that the recent Rowntree report that highlighted the problem for the south-west, and Purbeck in my constituency in particular, was forcing the Government to reconsider their priorities and the south-west in particular.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para11">The sustainable communities plan, which was published in February 2003, set out the Government's vision for housing and the level of public financing for the development of new and refurbished affordable social housing during the next three years. Some &#163;22 billion has been earmarked, but most of it is going to London and the south-east. My hon. Friend assured us that he would look at the situation again in the light of the Rowntree report. As he knows, I will be going back in a fortnight, having secured a second meeting, for him to meet representatives from the Dorset chief housing officers group and discuss Dorset's particular problems. I am grateful to him for his concern.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spnew3"><B> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud):</B> 
 My hon. Friend took part in the debate last year on affordable housing, on which the rural group of Labour MPs are publishing a paper tomorrow; that was a quick plug. From talking to my rural housing providers, I know that one issue that has gone down particularly badly recently is the proposal, which the Government are consulting on, to offer grants to developers with regard to social and affordable housing provision. Will he comment on the overwhelming view of the affordable and social housing industry that we should not offer any special grant assistance to developers?

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spnew4"><B> Jim Knight </B> 
: I was speaking earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Diana Organ), who unfortunately had to go to a Select Committee. Had she been able to come here, she would have made a similar point, as well as commenting on the growth of housing association properties that she has seen in the Forest of Dean in the past six years.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para12">The Government have also legislated to end the 50 per cent. council tax discount for second home owners. There are many second homes in my area, and that significant change was welcomed by my constituents. Councils will soon be able to charge 90 per cent. of the full rate. I hope that that will achieve two things; check the boom in holiday home ownership, which has done so much to inflate house prices, and release money for investment in affordable housing and tackling rural deprivation.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para13">I also pay tribute to the Government's work on planning and how planning can assist in tackling the problem. Increasing the amount of housing development on brownfield sites is important in protecting the countryside. Increasing the proportion of affordable housing within developments is also making a difference, but there is a long way to go. That is why I welcome the consultation by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on changes to planning policy guidance 3, entitled "Influencing the size, type and affordability of <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 64WH</B></P>
housing", which recommends allowing planning authorities to designate land in rural areas specifically for affordable housing within their local plans.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para14">However, why stop at villages? Why not include market towns with populations of more than 3,000 and designated development boundaries? Rural towns have few brownfield sites and relatively low land values, so that where there is contamination or other extra development costs it is difficult to have a high proportion of affordable housing without substantial subsidy. However, policy directs those in housing need to those towns. People migrate from rural areas to rural towns, which adds to the housing need of those towns' populations. Such towns have suffered a great loss of previously affordable housing stock through the right to buy. It seems logical to allow planning authorities to designate land for development for affordable housing in those towns, as well as in villages.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para15">In my constituency, sustaining the villages requires developments of one or two dozen affordable homes but that, collectively, will not meet the housing needs of the district, which is generated proportionately in the market towns themselves. However, planning authorities cannot currently generate the capacity to meet that demand.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para16">I also ask the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to look again at a tariff system on all new homes or other commercial development, as suggested in the planning Green Paper. That would counter the evasion by private developers of the thresholds that require them to build affordable homes. A tariff system would generate money to invest locally in varied schemes to tackle that problem. More investment is needed, so I ask the Government to consider the needs of Dorset and the south-west region in the light of the Joseph Rowntree report "Can work&#151;can't buy" that was published in May and to which I referred earlier. I also press local authorities to play their part.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spnew5"><B> Ms Atherton </B> 
: My hon. Friend is making a powerful case about the problems that we face in the south-west. Would he care to comment on the situation of the Liberal Democrat Carrick council in my constituency, which last year failed to provide one affordable house in the district?

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spnew6"><B> Jim Knight </B> 
: I am not familiar with the details of Carrick, but if no affordable property is being built, the administration at that council should look carefully at the proceeds that it will get from being able to charge second home owners extra council tax, so that there is a resource to use.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para17">In the survey that we carried out in Studland, 72 per cent. of residents wanted the extra money generated by increasing council tax on second home owners to be spent exclusively on affordable housing, not cutting council tax bills. No doubt local councils will call on central Government to increase their funding for housing in the region, but they will also have the opportunity, like Carrick, to put their money where their mouths are.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para18">There are four other areas on which I would like the Department to reflect. The first issue is empty homes. I am told that there are 60,000 in the south-west alone. No doubt if we can bring those into use, it will make a <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 65WH</B></P>
substantial difference. I should be interested to hear from the Minister how the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working with councils to release those homes for affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para19">Secondly, I am interested in whether there is more that the Treasury can do. I gather that in the United States there is a tax incentive for property owners to rent out their homes. Given the attractiveness of property as an investment, we should consider whether capital gains tax could be waived or discounted if properties were offered to registered social landlords to manage as homes to let to those in housing need. Alternatively, the Treasury could consider a premium rate of stamp duty on sales of homes where the purchaser will not be using the property as their main home. The proceeds of that could then be reinvested in housing and we could offer some disincentive to the growth of second home ownership in those areas where it is particularly strong.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para20">Thirdly, I ask the Government to explore new forms of shared ownership. The Minister will be interested to know that in Studland a 68 per cent. share in a shared ownership property was recently available. The cost of that share was &#163;124,440, which is no longer affordable; great for the seller, but completely hopeless for the future. If the original conveyancing on that shared ownership property broke the link with the market prices, we could keep those properties affordable. Their resale could be restricted not only to local people, but perhaps to the retail prices index or the rebuilding cost plus any land inflation that had taken place in the meantime.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para21">In summary, I ask the Government to acknowledge and prioritise the problem that we face throughout the south-west, to reflect that priority in a continued increase in resource allocations to the region and to be more radical in changing the planning policy, although, as I said, I welcome the moves that they have made. I also ask them to examine the potential for tax incentives and the conditions in property conveyancing to protect local people in areas where affordable housing is needed, so that we can build homes for people throughout the south-west.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909h05_spmin0"><B>The Minister for Housing and Planning   (Keith Hill) </B> 
:  I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) on securing the debate and on bringing this important issue to the attention of the House in a lively and thoughtful speech, which contained many ideas that will bear further consideration.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para22">I am pleased to see that my hon. Friends the Members for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton), for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew) are present, giving tangible expression to their shared concern about these matters.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para23">My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset is right that the south-west is grappling with rapid house price inflation, which has occurred in a relatively short space of time in many places in the region. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the south-west suffers the double impact of significantly higher than average house prices, and lower than average incomes. My hon. Friend has graphically described the consequences of that state of affairs for his constituents.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para24">Dorset is a very attractive county, and many people are attracted by its quality of life. It has beautiful countryside, pretty towns and villages, and a <P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 66WH</B></P>
breathtaking coastline of international importance that has been recognised as a world heritage site. That highly attractive environment means that it is not surprising that "in-migration" to Dorset is among the highest in the country. As a result, Dorset has experienced the second highest population growth among the English counties, and that trend is set to continue.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para25">An increasing population adds pressures in several different ways; for example, on health and other local services. However, perhaps the most obvious consequence is pressure on housing, particularly when households with equity relocate to a county. We can see the impact of that in a variety of ways. House prices in Dorset have risen by more than 35 per cent. in two years. The average house price in the county is &#163;193,795, which is well above the national average, and only slightly lower than the average for the south-east of England. Across the south-west as a whole, the average house price is &#163;164,036, which is the highest nationwide, outside London and the south-east.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para26">Another pressure on the local housing market, to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset alluded, is second homes. The percentage of dwellings in Dorset that are either second homes or holiday homes is more than four times the national average; in Purbeck and west Dorset they represent 5 per cent. of the housing stock.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para27">The factors at play in Dorset are seen elsewhere in the south-west. The rapid growth in house prices is a product of increasing population and a generally successful economy in an attractive region. Overall, the south-west was England's fastest growing region in terms of population from 1981 to 2001. The rate of increase was more than double the national average. Population growth has been mostly in rural areas, and among people over 45 years of age. However, the overall picture obscures some drastic differences across the region.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para28">Gross domestic product per capita in Swindon is just over &#163;18,000, whereas in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly it is just over &#163;8,000. Average house prices in the Cotswold district are nearly 2.5 times those in Plymouth. In some local government wards in the south-west, mean house prices are eight times the level of mean incomes. The unfortunate flip side of that state of affairs is that the regional homelessness figures showed an increase of 23 per cent. between 1990 and 2000. In 2001&#150;02, the south-west had the third highest proportion of homeless people in England&#151;5.3 per thousand.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para29">In the light of those circumstances, I want to reassure the House that the Government are fully aware of the challenges and difficulties that are faced by many places throughout the south-west, which is a region of huge diversity in its economy and environment. The Government share my hon. Friend's concern about the housing pressures facing Dorset and the south-west in general, and I shall outline some of the measures that we are taking in response.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para30">The Government are spending more money on affordable housing. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset has mentioned the statistic; in 2003&#150;04 we shall provide no less than a 30 per cent. increase in funding under the main approved development programme for social housing. That amounts to &#163;20 million extra for housing in the south-west, bringing the total to &#163;81 million. That will deliver about 2,000 more affordable homes for the region in 2003&#150;04.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 67WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h05_para31">Affordable housing is a big concern in rural areas and the south-west is the most rural of all England's regions, with 93 per cent. of its area classed as rural. Over half the population lives outside major urban conurbations. A key issue for the region is the provision of sufficient housing to meet increasing demand in its rural communities, particularly for local people who cannot afford high house prices.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para32">The White Paper "Our Countryside: The Future&#151;A Fair Deal for Rural England" sets challenging targets for the provision of affordable housing in rural settlements of fewer than 3,000 people. In the south-west, we aim to deliver 350 new affordable homes in villages in 2003&#150;04, and to increase that to, on average, more than 380 per year in the following two years. I shall certainly reflect on my hon. Friend's suggestion that we might widen the scope and role of the affordable housing scheme in market towns, but I can offer no guarantees on that.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para33">Another key action by the Government that will help the housing situation in the south-west relates to planning. The Government's planning policy guidance note PPG3 seeks sufficient, better designed homes to meet housing need. PPG3 requires that we must build compact developments in towns and cities as a priority. PPG3 promotes well designed housing developments that do not waste land and a more sustainable approach to housing planning, which requires better integration of new housing with transport and other community infrastructure and services.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para34">We have to ensure a better mix of housing that reflects the needs of everyone, not just the market for large detached housing. On 17 July I issued a written parliamentary statement relating to changes to PPG3 to widen the range of housing opportunity in terms of size, type and affordability. I welcome my hon. Friend's support for that initiative. My proposals underline the Government's determination that the planning system must facilitate the provision of new homes in the right place&#151;focusing on brownfields first, but using greenfield land where appropriate&#151;and at the right time, to meet planned numbers. My proposals will help to deliver more affordable housing without affecting overall housing numbers, and a better match between a community's housing needs and supply.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para35">Although we have been mainly concerned today with the quantity of housing provision, it is important to say a few words about quality. My hon. Friend is probably aware that the Government have set a challenging target for all local authority and housing association homes to reach a decent homes standard by 2010 and we are working closely with providers to ensure that that target for social housing is met, and that the &#163;19 billion in arrears for repairs to social housing is at last dealt with. We have also set a target to increase the proportion of private housing in decent condition occupied by vulnerable groups.
<P>




<B>9 Sept 2003 : Column 68WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="30909h05_para36">The House should also be aware that we are working with local authorities to end families being housed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation except in emergencies, from March 2004, and to sustain the reduction in rough sleeping, so that from 2002 it remains at or below two thirds of the 1998 level.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para37">In 2002&#150;03 more than &#163;2.6 million of additional funding will have gone to 10 local authorities in the south-west to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping: Bournemouth, Plymouth, Bristol, Exeter, Gloucester, South Gloucestershire, Salisbury, Kerrier, Restormel and Christchurch.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para38">We are delivering up to 460 homes for key workers in health, education and the police service over the three-year period to 2003&#150;04 through the starter home initiative, which will ensure the continuing provision of essential services in the years to come. Beyond 2003&#150;04, investment in key worker housing will depend on regional priorities and contributions from Departments and/or employers.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para39">The mention of regional priorities brings me to a further important development in Government policy. The Government recognise that one size cannot fit all regions. We in London cannot, and should not, set out a prescriptive approach for all the issues facing the south-west. It is important that the south-west owns the agenda and seeks its own solutions. That is why we have set up the regional housing boards, to give each region an opportunity to identify its key housing priorities and to create its own response within a coherent national framework.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para40">The south-west housing body has just prepared its first housing strategy for the region. I shall respond formally to its document in due course, but I am pleased that it has promoted a debate with an impressive range of stakeholders on the future of housing in the south-west.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para41">It is important that the region owns its solutions, so the Government are providing the framework and resources to enable regional stakeholders to deliver more and better housing. We know the challenges all too well. Dorset has one of the fastest growing populations in the country, which is making it more and more difficult for local people on moderate incomes to find a home of their own. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset that the housing needs of the south-west are firmly in our minds, just as much as those of all the other regions in the country.
<P>

<a name="30909h05_para42">My Department's key objective is sustainable communities in all regions. Today's debate has been an excellent opportunity to reinforce the Government's commitment to a better future for the south-west, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this important subject and permitting me to set out the Government's policies in response.
