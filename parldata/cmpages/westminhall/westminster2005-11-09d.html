<p>

<a name="stpa_0">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[Mr. Heppell.]

<a name="time_0">
<a name="51109h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51109h01_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ian Gibson  (Norwich, North)</b>  (Lab): It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. It is a first and I welcome the opportunity to introduce the debate. It is clear that not many people will show particular interest in the subject. Regulation must be one of the most boring issues in Parliament, yet I hope to prove that many problems are associated with it. Moreover, I am sure that many hon. Members have other things on their minds today that are perhaps more pressing than what we are discussing today and do not regard regulation as being as important as some of us believe it is.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">I wondered about the vagueness of the title of the debate because various people telephoned to ask me what I would talk about. The subject is wide ranging and difficult to home in on. I will concentrate on regulation because it crosses various Departments, especially the Department of Health and the Department of Trade and Industry. People are charged with operating the regulations and drawing them up. It is a huge activity throughout many Departments. Although the issue is a quagmire and many people hate regulation, there is no doubt that it is necessary in many circumstances, mainly because the public expect it. It exists for the safety of the public in many cases and we must have good regulation if we are to establish new research, new technologies and new ideas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">I was struck by those who have been lobbying about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such matters. Many people are worried about regulation. I mean not only drug companies, but organisations such as Cancer Research UK, which said that the


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;increase in legislation regulating and inspecting aspects of research has led to concern within the research community.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">It went on to say that regulation


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;is imposing unnecessary and damaging constraints&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">and that European legislation has a great effect in this country. We all remember the big debate about how clinical trials were carried out in Europe, and how the proposals from Brussels were curtailing the innovative work that is undertaken in this country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">I have received letters from organisations such as Kidney Research UK. While welcoming the opportunity to undertake medical research, it must have the freedom to work without unnecessary regulatory burdens. It said that adequate safeguards must be


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;in place to protect individuals against the misuse of organs and tissues&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. organs and tissues should not be retained after death&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">A year or so ago, the Human Tissue Bill was introduced. It provoked much debate and many professionals were upset by the restrictions that were 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 74WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
being brought in by regulation. They said that that would make it difficult for them to hold on to tissues and to reclaim them without consent. Matters concerning who obtained consent created a huge debate within the academic community, as well as much activity and lobbying in both Houses. The Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society regards stem cells as a potential great way forward to controlling problems. It is worried about the regulations that might be attached. Patient groups as well as the pharmaceutical industry are concerned about regulations and their potential to inhibit progress.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">It is clear that medical research has contributed so much not only in this country, but throughout the world. We have learned so much about diseases and we&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are learning more. There is no doubt that there will be more drugs to treat cancer, Alzheimer&#039;s disease and other diseases. There will be a huge explosion of effort in medical research and stimulation, and we do not want that to be inhibited by fearsome regulations that put people off filling in the forms or whatever bureaucracy is associated with such regulations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">The position is becoming interesting and the Government should be examining when regulation is necessary and when it is not. Such questions need to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dealt with at some point not in a piecemeal way, but generally. It is hard to draw up hard-and-fast rules, but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that does not mean that we should not attempt to do so. We want to encourage innovation in research. There is great potential for patient benefit and faster success to find cures for many diseases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">I am pleased that a DTI Minister is replying to the debate because such matters have a huge effect on our economy. Research and development, and the young people whom we train to work in our industries, have made a difference in terms of what we can discover. Not only do we employ those people, but we create a knowledge-based economy, which is one of the Government&#039;s prime targets. For that we should be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grateful. It has taken a long time for it to be acknowledged, but, thankfully, now we are there, with 10-year innovation plans and so on to help things happen. Yet there is still a concern&#151;perhaps not a worry&#151;that some of the regulations associated with the new technology may inhibit the development of our economy. I shall spell that out a little more.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">Medical research is not simply Nobel prize-winning research into a new gene, disease, drug or treatment. It also relates to the care of patients. We must recognise that research can be done into the kinds of bed people are in, palliative care and the circumstances in which people live. We want an evidence-based society that treats the patient from the early diagnosis, at which we are getting better with many diseases, through to when we care for them in our communities. That will enable us to realise that many diseases will be associated with people late in life and will be chronic, and that there will be a patient&#039;s journey from the early stages to the later ones. Much research is undertaken into that, but it is not highly prized or recognised. People feel that it is not Nobel prize-winning stuff. However, it is still important. Therefore, we need innovative ideas across the board.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">Some hon. Members may be confused by the title of the debate. Research is regulated. There are health and safety conditions and laws that must be obeyed. It has sometimes been hard to operate in that environment if people have not been trained properly to understand 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 75WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that the research that they do in their white coats in the laboratories demands care and attention. I refer not only to their own behaviour with others but to the materials that they work with, be they chemicals, gases or anything else. Some of those materials could become available to people who have other plans for them. Therefore, there must be continuing regulation at that level. However, I am concerned about the regulation after that, and today we should try to address the regulation that helps our economy and develops new techniques. I want to give some examples of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">Do we have enough regulation and do we need it at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all? I do not have a hard blueprint in relation to those&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions, but I can see that people can be over-zealous or under-zealous. I shall speak later about human embryology. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) and I were members of the Select Committee on Science and Technology last year when it looked into the regulation of assisted reproduction technology and, gosh, we have the scars on our backs to remind us of those debates, because it is a vehement issue. The body that operates the legislation relating to that, the Human Fertilisation Embryology Authority, was very much in our sights. I shall cite that regulator as an example later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">The Government brought stem cell research into the parliamentary domain and allowed it to go ahead in this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country. Now the argument is whether we are developing the technology fast enough and whether we will be ready for it when it happens. Members will know that Christopher Reeves, who played Superman, supported the work going on in this country, as opposed to the work that was not going on in the United States, which was inhibited by religious fervour. A Republican Government, who in many ways were against science, technology and innovation, were making it very difficult. Therefore, this country is ahead of the game.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">With Richard Branson, Sir Christopher Evans and others, I sit on the Stem Cell Foundation, which has been considering a mechanism to ensure that, as the discoveries fall off the bench, the peer-reviewed papers and so on do not simply stay at the Royal Society and other such institutions, but are used to cure motor neuron disease, Parkinson&#039;s and Alzheimer&#039;s. There is tremendous potential, but getting money fast-tracked is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a real problem and one with which we have not yet dealt.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">Regulation is not the only consideration. We have laws in place, but we also need to know how to develop the research. Regulation could be part of ensuring that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we take the public with us when we start to do experiments, particularly those that involve animals. It is necessary to go through a regulatory process using animals. We all know about animal activists, or terrorists, and the way in which we have had to legislate and to draw up regulations to prevent their activities but to allow an open debate about their beliefs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">This country is doing well on stem cells&#151;for example, in getting legislation and regulations in place and in starting to introduce products that will help people in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the marketplace. That is difficult, as those people are not just constituents. They wear other hats as well. They are members of the public, patients and, indeed, citizens, so it is difficult to address such questions.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 76WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">I sit on various committees for public understanding&#151;the Royal Society and this and that organisation. Everybody means well and wants to get information to the public, but there is still a difficulty in getting scientists and medics to come out of their ivory towers and to talk about things in a language that the public can understand and feed into, thereby creating the feeling that the work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is valued. Without that, we will run into more debates such as the ones on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination&#151;still going strong&#151;genetically modified products and telecommunication masts, where knowledge does not get into the argument. The media and the political activity of other groups take over the debate and determine what happens to many products. These things are all mixed up but necessary: the legislation, the regulations and the interaction with all the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different forces from industry to the public. How we make such interaction happen is important, and we still have much to learn.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">There is a plethora of regulatory and advisory agencies in this country. Sometimes, I think that there are too many. They cross each other&#039;s agendas and have turf wars, almost like Government Departments. The war itself becomes bigger than the actual manifestation of the research in the communities and in the world. A great deal of effort and potential are lost.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">Let us consider drugs, for example. People from the pharmaceutical industry&#151;very powerful, emboldened, wanting to get their products to market&#151;always want to talk about regulation. They talk about bureaucracy and too much red tape. Such talk can go too far. We do need some regulation, but perhaps the case can be made now and again that we stretch it too much. However, regulations evolve&#151;they do not last for ever. In five or 10 years, the regulations that we make now may change because of, for example, new information.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">There are deep-seated problems with public understanding of what some regulatory agencies are about. I have a quote about the United States Food and Drug Administration, which is known as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;a guardian of the United States public health standards and gatekeeper for regulated products&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">that is, food industry products. That is the biggest part of its mission but not the only part. Its other mission is to be


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;involved in advancing innovation&#151;stimulating and encouraging new thinking, new means and new strategies for protecting and promoting the health of our nation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">Sometimes regulatory agencies get muddled up by taking on only their major responsibility, perhaps because of limits on time or resources, but I do not know of any agency that does not have to carry out several major activities. As I shall explain later in discussing the HFEA, there is a case for distinguishing between them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">Of course, strengthening the work on the safety of medicines is extremely important. However, innovation, openness, communication and information, which help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to embolden and to strengthen, for example, the European Network for Drugs and Drug Addition, which meets occasionally, are also important, so there is a regulator looking at that across the board, as well as looking at the safety of medicines. What would be interesting to know is how much effort, relatively, is put into those particular two activities in the States and here.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">The pharmaceutical industry says that the development of a drug is still an art, which is interesting&#151;a matter of intuition, luck and trial and error, instead of what it should 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
be, a mechanical process driven by science-based facts or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probabilities. Lack of those insights at the start of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development process exposes novel drugs to unforeseen obstacles. We often glibly say that research and development is all that needs to happen, but the process is much more sophisticated and difficult to operate than that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">Medical research feeds into the process, and we need&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make sure that we understand that, although regulated, the use of something may not happen right&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away. Seeing the benefits may take time, but we might need the regulations in place. For example, penicillin took a long time to get into use, likewise for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recombinant DNA technology with therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies, which were discovered at Cambridge but, sadly, developed in the United States. The new stuff coming along&#151;cells, tissues, genes, therapies and stem cells&#151;are at early stages yet, but how do we react to those discoveries?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">The example of stem cells is a good one. There was good pressure from the academic community and, particularly, from the patient associations&#151;those for Parkinson&#039;s, Alzheimer&#039;s and others&#151;to wake the Government up to the fact that we needed regulation, that we needed to talk about it and to expose it to the public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">That was a good example of something being taken up, but quite often we sit back and wait for something to happen. GM technology, for example, had been around a long, long time. Scientists, academics and medics said that we would not need any regulation, the public would love GM, which was going to be good for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them. Well, we learned the lesson the hard way. Newspapers took up Frankenstein stories, exposing lies to the community, such as GM technology and plants giving us this and that disease.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">As people know, the argument about the MMR vaccine is still raging on. Journalist Melanie Phillips has taken an anti-science view or, rather, has taken some scientists&#039; view against that of others. We have to see things coming and have the regulation in place, or not, depending on the situation. We cannot wait and say that all the research will find its own level. We have to provoke things and know what the problems might be. We do not have to put them in hard order, but we must have some discussion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">If a pharmaceutical company tries to develop things today, it will have to deal with EU legislation, testing directives, paediatric regulation and tissue engineering regulation. It will remember that we have the Human Tissue Act 2004 and a regulator, the Human Tissue Authority, which was set up to handle questions after Alder Hey. That was a reaction to a situation that we should have seen coming, but which happened because of exposure in the media and a national scandal. That is not how we should use the excellence of knowledge, research and what we discover, nor how we should get&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them into the legislative, regulatory and parliamentary processes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">I want to talk briefly about several of the regulators. For example, we all know about the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. I am not going to go on about NICE&#151;we are all a bit fed up with NICE and the stories on Herceptin, which just keep going on and on. I am not sure that NICE is the best organisation in the way that it works, but the principle of having evidence-based medicine cannot be argued against.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 78WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">How NICE operates is up for grabs at the minute. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asked a question the other week on what the value of NICE was. The Minister told me, but she did not say that the NICE organisation was brilliant&#151;she said that the principle was brilliant. I agree, but we have to look around. We do not need to throw brickbats at NICE, which is an evolving organisation. It may be hard to push, shove and kick it but Ministers and Governments can help with legislation and regulation. We are moving towards a fast-track process and I predict that within a year NICE will have sub-committees. One will deal with cancer drugs, another with drugs for mental health and so on. We are going to be invaded by all the new potential coming out of research. There is a huge feeling that we are not really ready for it and that, if we breathe on Herceptin, it will go away. It will not. That organisation has a list of about 30 cancer drugs, and the suspicion is that all of them will be useful in helping people with certain types of cancer. I will not go on too much about that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">What I want to go on about in particular relates to some of the other authorities. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has a dual role. It considers several things at the same time. It has two principal functions: it is a regulator and an advisory body. It is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charged to keep under review information about embryos and, as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;any subsequent development of embryos and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the provision of treatment services and activities governed by this Act&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">Hon. Members will know that that provision is mainly concerned with the technology of in vitro fertilisation, which changes almost daily in terms of how embryos can be created.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">Regarding stem cells, there is a provision concerning the embryo: how long should an embryo be kept before it is killed, and is it a live being after 14 days or not? Now, the process can be carried out without having to destroy an embryo at all. That is true of mice at the moment, but you can bet your bottom boots that they will be able to do it with human eggs as well. We always start such processes with animals, then the process moves on. Nuclear transplantation started off with frogs, ended up in Dolly the sheep and can now be done with human beings. That is an inevitable process, which we should welcome but be ready for and ready to handle.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">We are ready in some ways. We have considered human cloning and said that we should not allow it. We have jumped ahead there, but that is because of stem cell research. The technology and science of medicine moves on so fast that we are always lagging behind. We often get caught by media scares, patient groups or other groups making the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">There is a problem with regulators having a dual function. The regulator&#039;s role allows it to work within the Act and to discharge its duties accordingly. Its advisory function challenges it to find fault with the legislation on behalf of the Government. That is an ambiguous position. It is a double-handed position, and one role does not always sit easily with the other. The Select Committee was quite light about it compared with Lord Winston, who would abandon the HFEA overnight. He said that it had no useful function and was a pain, and he is considered to be a world expert in this 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 79WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
arena. He suggested that the functions should be separated in two new regulatory bodies. I give that not as an example of something I want to argue, but as an example of how we have to adapt when we consider something in depth in relation to new research and discoveries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">There are many more agencies that have been important in the sphere of health. The regulators are amazing; they spring out of the woodwork all the time. The Minister will probably be able to give examples of where that has happened in his field of expertise. I shall just use the one of health because I mentioned the HFEA. Bodies have been set up for clinical standards, medicines, health care products, equipment and the conduct of health care professionals. The current vogue in politics is to merge those bodies. I mentioned, for example, the Human Tissue Authority, which was set up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a year or so ago by the Government. The intention is to merge it with the HFEA because there is so much cross-function. Considering the bare bones of their job descriptions, it should be possible to find common territory, so that we do not duplicate things. Turf wars could emerge; even if they do not, the process of getting the product into the market could be delayed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has been attacked quite savagely by people in this Chamber. It was set up in 2003 and it replaced the Medical Devices Agency and the Medicines Control Agency, one of which was concerned with technologies such as stents for heart disease and the other one of which was concerned with drug products. Within that context, it promotes public health, patient safety and health care products that meet appropriate standards of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;safety, quality, performance and effectiveness. That is another example of taking two bodies and putting them together so that they function in the same building to tackle the same problems: health and the standards that have to be met.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">Another body, the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, came on the scene about the same time. The HFEA suddenly had to talk to it too, because, again, there was a lot of overlap, although there are differences in function. One body is concerned only with IVF and assisted reproduction. However, the general care and interaction with the public and patients is much the same in both instances. So, again, much more could be done about that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">I am not going to say anything about ethical committees and issues of morality. They often get put at the bottom of the agenda, if there is time to get to them. It is essential that they should be the top one or two items on the agenda. We cannot worry about that because we do not understand ethics. That is true. On our Select Committee, gosh did we argue about ethics. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still do not know what they are and we did not get very far. I do not think that we were going to persuade each other what an ethical position was, but did we argue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">Now, if we are like that, what must it be like on some of those committees? However, there are important, serious questions to be asked and they must be incorporated. Patients can be involved or it can be members of the public, but their view must be taken into consideration. I made that point about the joining together of committees and so on.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">Many complaints are emerging in some areas, not just about regulations, but about having the necessary staff. I am not going to talk about radiographers and radiologists and all the boring stuff that we have been through. I want to talk about clinical people who work in universities and who are interested in clinical infection. They find it difficult to get others interested in that. These people are interested in infectious diseases and, gosh, do we know about those. We are hearing about bird flu just now, as well as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, antibiotic-resistant infections and so on. The official bodies complain that there are not enough people studying those things and that the people who are teaching do not have time to do proper research into those areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">There is a point to be made about regulation in that context, too. There must be enough people to know what kind of research is going on and to subject it to critical scrutiny. Microbiologists and virologists in this country think that they are being left behind. That would mean that, if we had an epidemic of some kind, we would have to buy in the expertise and obtain the knowledge. We must consider problems such as that at the same time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">I have talked about several bodies, how they have merged together and how that has been valuable. Remember that the endgame in all this is to reduce the risks to public health. The process must be seen to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent. It must be based on scientific and medical evidence to support risk management. Sometimes, people have to know what the risk is and there are ways of handling that. If the public are given the knowledge, they can say, &quot;Well, I&#039;ll take the risk,&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m not taking the risk.&quot; I do not know what makes the public choose one rather than the other, but I know this: if we do not ask them early enough, they will get confused messages from the media and others and the whole thing could go wrong. That is important.

The great thing in this country is that young people who work in these fields have superb ideas. That is why I care about people who are doing medical microbiology and virology.

I do not want to talk about such people&#039;s career prospects, but they are making the innovation and product culture very much a part of the British way of life. We do not have to leave the US or Europe to do it all the time, and we do not have to be inhibited by the way in which they carry out research.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">The Select Committee&#039;s report about legislation addresses the question of how much regulation we need. I shall not be able to find the quotation I had from the competitive fifth force, the body in the Minister&#039;s Department which considers such matters. However, it produced a report on regulation in which it said that there is a time for regulation when public concern requires it; there is a time also when one needs to evolve existing legislation and regulation and join the bodies that take care of it, because knowledge moves on; and there is a time for no regulation at all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">Most of medicine is not regulated. Why should assisted reproduction in vitro fertilisation have a regulator all to itself? What about all the other activities in the health service? That is the reason that Lord Winston does not like the HFEA. One could spend one&#039;s whole life analysing the health service and setting up regulators, but it would be inhibitory. Sometimes, one must trust people to set up their own ethics committees. They have concerns, ethics and morality, and they are certainly concerned to ensure that the products we produce are regulated and respected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">Many regulators are respected. It is a good job that they exist, because there are charlatans out there trying to cut corners. There is no doubt about that, and regulation cuts it down.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51109h01_spnew1"><b> Martin Horwood  (Cheltenham)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) on securing the debate on this important topic. It is dear to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart, and the hon. Gentleman should not apologise for it being dear to his. I used to work with and for several medical research charities, and this is an important subject for Parliament to debate. It is risky for politicians, as it includes ethics and morality, which lead us to the grey area between party politics and private conscience in which tempers run high and party Whips are strangely unwilling to provide their usual gentle guiding hand.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;careful attention to the evidence and a rational argument must guide us through this unfamiliar territory. When strongly held personal and religious beliefs lead people to believe only the evidence that suits them, sensible debate begins to go out the window. The least excitable participants in the debate on regulation are those in the business community. As I am sure that the Minister will shortly tell us, it employs significant numbers of people in medical research in the UK. One managing director of a pharmaceutical company told me yesterday that there is much to be positive about in Britain&#039;s commercial position in medical research. He sees Britain as

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">in medical research and says that it scores more highly than most other EU countries. He also said that a positive Government and regulatory environment is essential to that success and spelled out nine areas of concern.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">I will not list them all but will make the Minister aware of a few. They include competition from the US&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market and, increasingly, from China, India and

eastern Europe, as well as the climate of fear that is still being created by violent animal rights campaigners who are now beginning to target small suppliers. Even in a large medical research charity I remember the siege mentality among researchers that was created by the most violent campaigners. Even when we were not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commissioning research involving animal models, we would never say that for fear of starting a process by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which animal campaigners could narrow down and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify the charities that were. The managing director I talked to was from Eisai UK. He cited a lack&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of well trained science graduates, the unrealistic expectations of potential academic partners in terms of intellectual property and the slowness of negotiating agreements and clinical study protocols with NHS hospital trusts. Those were all issues for him. Perhaps predictably, he grumbled a little about NICE&#039;s role in judging the cost-effectiveness of medicines in addition to all the other regulatory bodies involved in the industry. I cannot agree with him there and I agree with the hon. Gentleman. My experience in the area of Alzheimer&#039;s is that NICE&#039;s decisions are not always right, but it is right in principle to have a body to direct prescribing in the NHS on evidence-based lines.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">The managing director of Eisai warned specifically about one aspect of a recent new proposal from NICE to evaluate new medicines at their launch. He was worried that that might delay the entry of products into the market and lose us one of our competitive advantages over many other EU countries. It affects the nature and quality of evidence available on which to make an assessment if one dives into the process so early because there is none of the grubby market-based learning from the drug in the market.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">Charities have similar concerns about the balance between the proper need for regulation and a system that is manageable and proportionate to the risks involved. The hon. Gentleman mentioned what Cancer Research UK had said to the Select Committee and others. It suggested three measures to reduce bureaucracy, simplify processes and increase productivity such as a common system of reporting to reduce duplication and free up time for research. It suggested that application processes should be simplified to address delays and inconsistencies. It suggested simplifying and expediting the ethical review process for clinical research, which would reduce the time taken to start research programmes, making that process as quickly navigable as it believes it is in other countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">CRUK acknowledges that although the regulatory regime for medical research in this country is not perfect, it is of a higher standard than in other European countries, which is a matter of pride. It is also worried about the EU clinical trials directive and particularly how its UK incarnation, the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, has impacted on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-commercial sector, pushing up the cost of clinical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trials and perhaps damaging recruitment. In theory, that should apply equally in all EU countries and there is a thought that we might be gold-plating the regulations. I am not sure whether that is so, but perhaps the Minister could pay attention to that. I hope that he will bear in mind the concerns of both the charity and the commercial sectors.

<a name="51109h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">It is a tribute to the 20-year-old legislation that set up the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that it has largely succeeded in coping with astonishing and often controversial new developments in reproductive medicine. It has combined a willingness to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow effective, important research to proceed and to grow with an understanding of public sensitivities. The novel use of embryonic material is one of the most sensitive areas and the authority is absolutely right to keep that under review. It should remain clearly within the authority&#039;s remit, and that should not have to be brought before judges, or even politicians, too often. The way in which the debate in the United States has been debased by politicians influenced by religious fundamentalism should give us all pause for thought. The result is that scientists such as Stephen Minger of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King&#039;s college, London, and Roger Pederson of Cambridge, have come from the United States to this country, and that is a matter for quiet national pride.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">It would be wise to amend the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 to make clear the authority&#039;s competence in areas of study that were not really foreseen 20 years ago, such as the creation of embryos for the purpose of treatment using stem cell lines. That, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, holds enormous promise for potential therapies for diseases such as Alzheimer&#039;s, Parkinson&#039;s and Huntingdon&#039;s disease.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">It has been suggested that the authority&#039;s remit could be extended to the licensing of clinical trials. It argued that that would have the advantage of encouraging a smooth transition from research to treatment under the same regulator and the same legislation; but, of course, from the point of view of clinical trials, it would be adding yet another regulatory body into the mix. Perhaps it would be wiser if the HFEA were simply asked to issue guidance to the ethics committees already responsible for regulating clinical trials. We are in a new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;landscape in terms of awareness of issues such as children&#039;s welfare, patient safety and personal freedom of information. Those issues may have implications for the wording of legislation and the composition of the authority itself.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">Public opinion is, in broad terms, generally on our side; a recent MORI poll conducted for the HFEA earlier this year showed how far we have come since the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first test-tube baby was a matter of such huge publicity and controversy. The recent poll showed some public concern about unforeseen consequences, and even about risk to future generations, but more than 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. of respondents agreed that human embryo research can improve the quality of life of future generations with inherited diseases, and can enable scientists to increase their understanding of how the human body works. Fewer than 10 per cent. disagreed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">The same cannot be said of the use of animals in medical research; on that subject, opinion is much more polarised, and there is significant public and political disquiet. On regulation, opinion varies. Some people would like us to go towards a free-for-all, and would allow very light regulation of animal research, but others want to ban it completely. Opinion is so polarised that each side in the debate has taken to almost cartoon characterisation of the other. I have been at meetings in the medical research community where anyone who had

the faintest notion of animal welfare or animal rights was characterised as being in the same camp as violent car bombers. On the other side, it seems that it is sometimes claimed that animal research has contributed absolutely nothing to human welfare, has only harmed and killed people and has impeded medical research. The truth, as ever, is somewhere between the two.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">I commend to hon. Members, and to the Minister, the recent report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics. It is a little bit of light reading at 334 pages. I confess that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not read every page of it yet, but from what I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have read, it seems a thoughtful and impressively thorough examination of just about every nook and cranny of the animal research debate, including the issue of the need for regulation. It gives no comfort to antagonists on either side who are in search of a quick win. For those who ask, &quot;What has animal research ever done for us?&quot;, it gives chapter and verse. In basic biological research, it explains: how research with dogs helped to identify the biological basis of narcolepsy; how animal studies revealed the role of autoantibodies in the life-threatening disease myasthenia gravis and contributed directly to better diagnosis and treatment; and how patching the eyes of newborn cats revealed the risk of patching newborn children with one lazy eye. Children with this condition now have each eye patched alternately, saving many of them from blindness in one eye.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">In the study of diseases, the most famous example is that of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&#151;a rare, fatal and fast-moving form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy that affects mainly teenagers. Studies with mice proved the transmissibility of scrapie between sheep species through abnormal proteins known as prions. Those led in turn to experiments that showed the transmissibility of the bovine variety of spongiform encephalopathy&#151;BSE&#151;to primates. The process linking BSE to human variant CJD was therefore clear. The rest, as we know, is political history.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">The report also explores the use of animals for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pharmaceutical research and toxicity studies. It acknowledges that there is controversy, complexity and genuine limitation in both those fields, but in the end it supports their validity as well.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">The notorious failure of pharmaceutical research methodology in the case of thalidomide provides a good example of some of the problems involved. Animal trials failed to predict the adverse effects of the drug on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unborn children of pregnant humans. However, the animal models used were not pregnant. Subsequent experiments showed that had they been, the same limb deformities might have been detected in mice, rats and other animals, and the alarm bell would have been sounded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">Is there no case to answer for animal research and no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need for tighter regulation or, perhaps, for any regulation? Yes, there is. Showing that some animal experiments work for humans does not necessarily make it the right thing to do and does not even show that most research using animals is necessary or beneficial to humans.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">A recent article in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>is pretty damning. Its authors are not animal rights protestors, but professors from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Centre for Perinatal, Pediatric,

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Clinicians and the public often consider it axiomatic that animal research has contributed to the treatment of human disease, yet little evidence is available to support this view. Few methods exist for evaluating the clinical relevance or importance of basic animal research, and so its clinical (as distinct from scientific) contribution remains uncertain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Biased or imprecise results from animal experiments may result in the testing of biologically inert or even harmful substances in clinical trials, thus exposing patients to unnecessary risk and wasting scarce research funds. Moreover, if animal experiments fail to inform medical research, or if the quality of the experiments is so poor as to render the findings inconclusive, the research will have been conducted unnecessarily. Investigating the validity of animal experiments is therefore essential for both human health and animals.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">Examples were given in the article and work on that investigation is urgently needed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">Even if animal experiments are well designed and prove to be beneficial, it is not always clear that they are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really necessary. The Nuffield report quotes a 2003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;study, where head restraint devices were implanted in the heads of rhesus macaque monkeys under anaesthetic and metal coils were then surgically implanted into their eyeballs so that their eye movements were recorded. The purpose of the study was to learn more about the way primates perceive other primates&#039; faces. The pressure group Europeans for Medical Progress, with which I have some issues, claims that similar experimental outcomes have been achieved using human volunteers wearing adapted contact lenses. Even if they had not, many of us would instinctively recoil from the use of intelligent creatures, such as monkeys, in that way for research unconnected with any life-threatening disease.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">That raises the moral question of whether we have the right to conduct experiments on animals and, if so, on which ones and causing what degrees of harm, distress, discomfort or pain. The Nuffield report bravely ploughs into the moral, philosophical and scientific arguments, quoting Aristotle, Immanuel Kant and others along the way; it is a fantastic read.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">My view is that is nearly impossible to draw a categorical moral dividing line between humans and other animals, especially as science reveals more and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more characteristics that we have in common with a few of the most intelligent animals, from tool use to altruistic behaviour and the capacity for language. In other words, some animals must have some rights, but it would take the most pious Jain religious belief or the most extreme support for animal rights to place us on the same moral level as a fruit fly. Lines have to be drawn and moral boundaries marked out across what is essentially an evolutionary and biological continuum.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">The Nuffield report makes no real stab at that almost impossible task, but it concludes simply, powerfully and perhaps rather surprisingly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;A world in which the important benefits of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. research could be achieved without causing pain, suffering, distress, lasting harm or death to animals involved in research must be the ultimate goal.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="51109h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">The report&#039;s authors go on strongly to support the three Rs of reduction, refinement and replacement. They argue for much more promotion of best practice and say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;We acknowledge that the UK has the most detailed legislative framework concerning research on animals in the world. But proper attention to the welfare of animals involved in research and the accountability of scientists who conduct research on animals cannot be achieved merely by having detailed regulations. Regulation can act as an emotional screen between the researcher and an animal, possibly encouraging researchers to believe that simply to conform to regulations is to act in a moral way. It is therefore crucial to promote best practice more actively and to improve the culture of care in establishments licensed to conduct experiments on animals.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">It encourages the UK to take a leading role in the development of alternatives and recommends that each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research application proposing the use of animals should show how the three Rs have been considered and on what grounds any possible alternatives to animal use have been rejected. Interestingly, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has tackled the other end of the research process and suggested that all published research papers from studies using animal models should include information on how the three Rs had been complied with and on the fate of the animals involved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">The Nuffield report also suggests public opinion research, which might start to draw the animal research debate into the admittedly rather fragile kind of public consensus enjoyed in the field of embryology, and away from the current, extremely polarised, views. Those and other recommendations on regulation in the report go well beyond the status quo, and I recommend them to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Minister.

It was an exciting experience, to say the least, to do something that this House should do far more&#151;take a lead in the area of science.

It showed the significance of the British research effort for worldwide well-being. We had many more, slightly exotic, excursions into the realms of scientific research under his excellent chairmanship.

A lot of very important research is done there that has a huge spin-off into medical research, with everyday applications to extremely complex diseases&#151;and to some simple ones as well.

</p>

case of human reproductive technology, for example, the decision on where to draw the line has to be taken by Parliament as a whole, not by the loudest pressure groups&#151;or, for that matter, by Whitehall Ministers. It is often perceived in this country that to be pro-science is to be anti-green, but that is no more true than saying that good greens are anti-science.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">Often in the United Kingdom, there is an assumption that science is bad, dodgy, difficult and something that we really do not want to know about unless we have to. That is most unfortunate, because it is not true of other nations, where the whole concept of science is often thought of very differently. Perhaps the old days, when scientists in this country were extremely respected because they knew so much more than the rest of the community, have gone. Sadly, that respect is not there as it used to be.

</p>


<p>

In those countries, the place of the scientist in the community is different from the position that we have arrived at.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">What has gone wrong? One of the things that has gone wrong is to do with British politicians. We should take a lead, and not run for cover every time science is mentioned. It is significant that only four Members of Parliament are taking part in this important debate. That does not do us much credit, although it gives those of us who are present a little longer to say what we want to say, which is no bad thing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">When considering medical research, debating policy options, scrutinising legislation or deciding how to vote on difficult issues, we must first understand and properly assess the nature of risk. The hon. Member for Norwich, North mentioned that. That is fundamental. There is now an assumption in the public mind that it is possible to achieve a risk-free status for almost everything, and that things should not be done if politicians or scientists cannot guarantee that. If we try to justify doing something by saying, &quot;Well, there is a risk, but we have assessed it and we have made the decision to go ahead,&quot; we immediately have the tabloid press, for example, down on our heads. Anyone who has ever been in a ministerial position knows what can happen if they dare to put their head above the parapet and say that they have assessed the risk of doing something and that they&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to take the public with them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">Public opinion can be gullible if the public are not well informed. That is another major problem in our country, because we do not have nearly enough science education. The right attitude towards science is inculcated at an early age in many societies. The teaching profession&#151;I was a teacher for 16 years&#151;tries hard in respect of science education, but it is an uphill task to try to persuade people to take science in schools seriously.

</p>

study it at school. Why do too few people study it at school? Because science does not have a high enough status, it is too difficult and we do not encourage schools to take it more seriously for pupils at a tender age.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">I asked a group of young professional people aged between about 25 and 35 if it was true that Brits cared little about science. They said that most of us, including journalists, were, to use their words, apathetic, ignorant, indifferent, misinformed and gullible when it comes to science. In their opinion, science is taken for granted until something goes wrong, when the media have a field day. There is open season for pressure groups and lobbyists, and then we enter the fantasy world of Frankenstein food, designer babies and grey goo.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">Later, I attended a seminar of chief executive officers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of blue-chip, science-based companies, a brace of vice-chancellors from science-oriented universities and a few politicians. The subject of the seminar was the state of science education. I expected to get an ear bashing from the industrialists about the paucity of postgraduate science education and so forth. Instead, with one voice, I was told that the most pressing need is for more and better science education for all, from key stage 1 right through life. That is a challenge that we politicians must meet.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">One of the areas where we come across that problem is in medical research, in the regulation of that and in the nature of the science budget. The science budget describes a delicate relationship or partnership between the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Trade and Industry, other Government Departments, business and industry, charities, which have an important role to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;play, international sources, including the European Union, and, of course, the regional development agencies in the United Kingdom, which also have an important role to play in the delivery of the science budget. They all meet as what is called the Funders&#039; Forum.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">One of the problems is that the Government see themselves as the main driver of innovation and research in the UK, simply because they are the biggest customer. That is not unreasonable; 10 per cent. of our gross domestic product is spent on goods and services to do with research. However, the trouble is that, although the Government are a good spender, I am not sure that they are the best judge of research and innovation agendas. Therefore, the relationship between Ministers and science is probably wrong.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">For example, when the DTI published its last five-year programme for science, it said that the Cabinet would define the &quot;grand challenges&quot; facing public policy in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which scientific research can play a major role in establishing the way forward and that that work would be based on departmental proposals. I wonder whether that introverted and interventionist approach can deliver the global advantage so necessary for UK science and innovation and the economic prosperity so necessary for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our nation, particularly where medical research is concerned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">We should follow the good practice of the hugely successful system in the United States, where the federal-funded, fully independent National Science Foundation is responsible for granting research funding, with the exception of medical research funding, which is administered by the independent National Institutes of

Health. The foundation gives the private sector and medical research charities a much bigger role in determining where research should go.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">In biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, British science is ahead of the game. The spin-out of research through innovation to production is remarkable and much to be encouraged. However, as we heard from the hon. Member for Cheltenham, there is still unfinished business in relation to the use of animals in research. The targeting of scientists and their families by extremists is completely unacceptable, as is the economic damage done to the biotechnology sector by threats to trade suppliers, financiers and insurers. None of that is justified or in the national interest. It is driving global enterprise out of the UK.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">I pay tribute where it is due to the Government in taking steps to improve the situation, but we must go further if we are to encourage British scientists to stay in difficult sectors of medical research. We must also challenge and remove burdensome regulation when we can. As the hon. Member for Norwich, North said, there is an enormous burden of regulation. He said that more regulators creep out of the woodwork all the time. Therefore, we face a huge challenge.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">To turn to specifics, it is true that the United Kingdom has been at the cutting edge of medical research. Many of the methods used for large-scale clinical trials were developed in the UK, largely because of the nature, size and scale of the national health service. Other countries that do not have a comparable health service cannot get their hands on the numbers&#151;the captive audience&#151;necessary to do the work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">I mentioned the work done at the Health Protection Agency and the DSTL at Porton Down, but there was also the work done until the 1980s by the Common Cold Research Unit in Salisbury. It did not find the cure for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the common cold, but it laid the foundation for important virology work, which led to British expertise in coping with AIDS. That was an unexpected roll-out of science, which often happens when scientists, almost by accident, come across something that can change the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">I also think of the work on the defence side at Porton Down, which has led to the treatment of wounds. It has been of enormous benefit around the world, not only to the British military, which is the prime purpose of the establishment, but to everybody else. The work at the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DSTL on the detection of chemical and biological agents has been of enormous significance throughout the world, as has the development of protection against those agents through suits and breathing apparatus. It is significant that not only do the military now train people at the Defence Nuclear Biological and Chemical Centre at Winterbourne Gunner, also in my constituency, but,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the Police Nuclear Biological Chemical and Radiological Centre. Every police force in the UK now receives training in those subjects. Therefore, the basis on which we invest in science in this country can have significant spin-offs throughout medical research and everyday life.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">Last year, there was a row between the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Medical Research. It symbolised so much of what had gone wrong with medical research. I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North on the skill and ruthlessness with

which the Science and Technology Committee, of which I was a member, pursued an inquiry. That report did much to heal the wounds and to point the way forward for two world-class institutions. It was a remarkable example of the good work of a Select Committee.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">I happened to be strongly opposed to us getting into that murky water, but the hon. Gentleman was right. It helped to resolve a conflict between those two excellent organisations, and the latest reports are most encouraging.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">In June 2003, the Department of Health produced an encouraging document, &quot;Our Inheritance, Our Future: Realising the Potential of Genetics in the NHS&quot;. It was a remarkable document, and it foresaw some problems facing the national health service&#039;s attempt to integrate genetics, which has not worked out as well as we hoped. The Government have failed to secure the necessary funding to develop research within the NHS. The nation cannot afford not to do that work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">The Government pledged that they would spend 1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. of the total NHS budget on research. They have delivered just 0.96 per cent. That has meant a lack of training opportunities and poorly defined career structures. The lifetime financial rewards in clinical academia are not attractive, and they are certainly less attractive than private sector opportunities. The result was that the number of clinical academics fell by 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">The good news, however, is that the Medical Research Council is working to find a new focus in clinical research, and I congratulate Colin Blakemore on his energy and enthusiasm in steering the MRC down that channel. Getting those scientific bodies moving in the right direction must be like steering a flotilla of large tankers through the English channel.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para100"><a name="stpa_101">What can Parliament do? I have already said that Select Committees have a role. It is their duty and that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Parliament as a whole not only to reflect public opinion, but to delve into the real world, to shine a torch into obscure corners of science and technology and to make sensible and practical recommendations. Sometimes they should be for policy changes and at other times for more research, but always for more open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debate. The Science and Technology Committee made an important contribution in the previous Parliament when it produced its report on human reproductive technology.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para101"><a name="stpa_102">That report was groundbreaking. The hon. Member for Norwich, North said that we bear the scars of that report on our backs, and we certainly do. It was a brave report. It sought to continue the Warnock, gradualist approach to research. Research will always be way ahead of public opinion and knowledge, but we must try to bring the scientists feet out of the clouds and put them firmly on the ground.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">The Government&#039;s response, published in the middle of August, was encouraging. It set out a number of positive results. I shall not go into them all, but will the Minister consider one significant point about the future of medical research? I know that the report is from the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department of Health, but if he could look into the matter I should not expect an answer today.

We still need to challenge the Government on the policy-making role in that case. There is a lot of work to be done.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">The Government said that they would create a regulatory authority for tissue and embryos. That would require primary legislation, so they must present to Parliament in due course their proposals for the role, remit, composition and powers of the authority. My question for the Government is: when? We cannot let the matter drag on for many more years. When will we see the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primary legislation?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">We were encouraged that the Government concluded by saying that they would take the recommendations into account in drawing up the new legislation and that they would expect to include most, if not all, of them. That was a big compliment to the hon. Member for Norwich, North.

The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key) just said that the debate has been quite a canter. I am afraid that, in the 19 minutes that remain in which to respond to the many questions, it may turn into more of a gallop, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall do my best.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibson) said that this was perhaps one of the most boring subjects to come before Parliament. The speeches that we have heard this morning have eloquently given the lie to that suggestion. I remember arriving in the House several years ago and being advised by an older colleague that, if I wanted to be taken seriously by the House, I ought to try to become an expert in something. My hon. Friend certainly is a good exemplar of an expert in something: medical research and the regulation thereof. He has an air of expertise and the House always listens to him carefully and with great respect, sometimes quaking as it does so.

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">Before I try to respond to many of the important points raised, I want to set out the Government&#039;s position on the issue of regulation in general and on the necessary regulation of medical and clinical research in particular. The Government are at the forefront of the drive to improve the European Union regulatory environment, which is a key issue for the current UK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presidency. Better regulation plays a key role in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improving UK and EU competitiveness. The Government&#039;s better regulation agenda involves scrutinising all current legislation for unnecessary bureaucratic burdens and introducing simplification and deregulation, as envisaged by the Hampton review and the Better Regulation Task Force reports.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para112"><a name="stpa_113">We are also ensuring that the right stakeholders are appropriately engaged with emerging policy proposals and that our position on key EU measures is best designed to meet UK objectives, including the Lisbon and regulatory reform goals. All regulatory and enforcement proposals will be challenged. I thought that, at one point, my hon. Friend sounded like an Old Testament canonical prophet from Ecclesiastes. He was looking for a quotation, and I thought that this might be the one he was looking for, but I changed my mind: &quot;A time to regulate and a time not to regulate.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para113"><a name="stpa_114">Of course, many fear that better regulation is an excuse to deregulate. Let me say this clearly and without hesitation: it is not so. Carefully drawn-up regulation improves the health and quality of people&#039;s lives throughout Europe. It guarantees the rights and safety of employees, protects consumers and conserves the environment. Legislation also underpins the markets and can create new business opportunities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para114"><a name="stpa_115">I was struck by the remarks of the hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salisbury, who spoke specifically about the need for regulation, the need to look at the effects on business and the fact that this is a matter not simply of science but of important business. That remark was echoed by the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). Let us be clear: better regulation does not mean sacrificing high standards. However, it must be proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted. The DTI works to maintain the best possible business environment for bioscience companies. It is crucial that society and the Government clearly understand the issues and set the regulatory framework within which the industry can innovate, be competitive and develop effectively.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para115"><a name="stpa_116">That means influencing many complex and technical EU directives and regulations, and working with our European partners to ensure that those directives and regulations are based on sound science and that the requirements are measurable and enforceable. The UK has the largest biotechnology industry in the EU and is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regarded as a pace setter in competitiveness in that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sector. The DTI hosted a UK EU presidency biotechnology conference in October this year, which was attended by delegates from almost all member states. A session on regulation considered the way in which the EU clinical trials directive had been implemented by member states and what lessons could be learned for the implementation of future directives. The October conference came up with proposals to be discussed as part of the mid-term review of the EU strategy for life sciences and biotechnology.

<p>
<a name="51109h01_para116"><a name="stpa_117">Hon. Members spoke about the gold-plating of regulations. It is essential that, in working with our EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partners, we ensure that there is a level playing field throughout the Union and that gold-plating is not going on. That can best be done by carrying out the proper impact assessments and the correct consultation procedures at an early stage, so that we get things right in the first place and roll them out accordingly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para117"><a name="stpa_118">The hon. Member for Salisbury spoke of Government interference in science and, in particular, of prioritisation. I have to confess that I found his comments about what he saw as the centralised approach of this country and the US approach strange. However, he went on to acknowledge, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North, that this country enjoys a research capacity, particularly in human fertility and stem cell research, that far exceeds that of the United States, precisely because of the political interference there. Although the Office of Science and Technology sets the overall strategic objectives and priorities for the science budget in the UK, research councils are independent bodies and prioritise their particular areas. Of course, they are delivering plans that are developed in line with Government strategy, but, on the whole, our system has worked well and stands up against that of the United States.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para118"><a name="stpa_119">If the UK is to take full advantage of the opportunities for creating wealth and improving the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality of life offered by scientific discovery and technological development, it is crucial that we develop new approaches to bring scientists and the public together in a constructive dialogue to explore emerging issues. We need to build on the already widespread positive attitudes to science in the UK to ensure that the public, the broad science community and policy makers feel comfortable in handling issues raised by science and technology and that they feel a joint sense of purpose in ensuring that the full benefits of science and technology are realised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para119"><a name="stpa_120">The UK is among the world leaders in both industry and academic medical research. The Government have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistently shown that we have big ambitions for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical research to maintain the UK strengths in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and development. However, we will not succeed if we do not meet or exceed international regulatory standards for good clinical practice and public expectations of safety, security and privacy. This country&#039;s future in medical research depends on making the best use of highly talented people and the unique potential of the NHS as a platform for superb quality clinical research to bring benefits to patients.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para120"><a name="stpa_121">We must have high standards and businesslike systems to support doctors, researchers and the industry to allow them to do their jobs properly. We cannot forget the vital part that patients play in medical research by making available their bodies, samples and medical records, which are the basis of all research. If patients have no confidence in medical research, they will simply not volunteer. That is why in the past five years we have overhauled the regulation and management of medical research, clinical trials, human tissue and mental capacity research, and the process will continue as science develops into new areas such as nanotechnology and stem cells.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para121"><a name="stpa_122">The Government recognise that the changes are a big challenge for everyone. It is in all our interests that the UK takes the lead and sets an example to others in developing a sensible, robust, risk-based approach to regulation. That goes with our reputation for leadership in this area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para122"><a name="stpa_123">Many changes derive from European measures to harmonise markets. In principle, they should make life more predictable for industry and academics alike. However, it is uncomfortable to adjust to new procedures. Transition brings uncertainty if there is long debate among regulators about the details and, of course, no one welcomes the extra cost of complying with new inspection and quality systems. The regulation of pharmaceutical clinical trials is an example.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para123"><a name="stpa_124">The EU issued a directive in 2001, which followed years of effort by the industry to agree on common standards for trials in Europe, the USA and Japan. The principles behind the directive seemed to be well understood and not so different from a regime we have operated under since the Medicines Act 1968. The European Parliament extended the standard protections to academic trials and early phase trials, from which the UK had previously been exempt, but the directive allowed three years for the Commission to work out the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subsidiary guidance, and for member states to implement the proposals. Therefore, why are we continuing to hear concerns?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para124"><a name="stpa_125">Member states and the Commission took a long time debating the details. The Commission&#039;s subsidiary directive on good clinical practice came out after the&nbsp;deadline for member states to implement the parent directive. A number of member states have yet to implement it. We are far from achieving harmonisation across Europe and there are lessons for future legislation. Finally, the EU seemed to take inspection and monitoring standards that were right for new medicines and apply them to other trials with different risk profiles. Why is that important? It is not just because it is a nuisance for researchers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para125"><a name="stpa_126">There is some good news from the experience of regulating clinical trials. The UK took a leading role in arguing for a more flexible, risk-based approach. Officials worked with the Medical Research Council to explore and to respond to researchers&#039; concerns. The EU is now preparing more appropriate guidelines for academic trials and the UK is pressing it to draw lessons from all this. That is important, because there is more harmonising legislation on the way, affecting research on children&#039;s medicines, tissue-engineered products, and the use of so-called physical agents such as devices for imaging.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51109h01_spnew3"><b> Dr. Gibson </b> : Is it the Minister&#039;s understanding that in Europe the precautionary principle is operated much more vehemently than in this country? That can lead to an inhibitory situation.

<p>
<a name="51109h01_para126"><a name="stpa_127">This Government rightly give a high priority to protecting individuals who volunteer to take part in clinical research. We make no secret of the fact that we want to ensure that properly conducted and approved research can go ahead with the minimum of delay and with the maximum respect for the patient&#039;s rights and privacy. We all acknowledge that, if the process is disproportionate, there are costs beyond making research expensive. One cost is delayed development of better, safer treatments; another is less evidence about existing treatments, when the public expect more reliable advice on safety and effectiveness.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para127"><a name="stpa_128">Those dilemmas are not new. They are at the heart of every debate about medical research. With each change in the law, it is the job of Government and Parliament to take great care not to add complexity when what we want is robust systems that protect people from risk across the whole of medical research.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para128"><a name="stpa_129">The overwhelming majority of doctors and researchers place the patient at the centre of all decisions about clinical research. There are well understood checks and balances in the system of research ethics committees, hospital and NHS governance systems and, ultimately, the research funders such as the Medical Research Council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para129"><a name="stpa_130">Unfortunately, there are occasional researchers who seek to circumvent the controls and, as has been mentioned, they receive most publicity in the press. That tarnishes the rest of the research community. Sometimes, as with the recent Human Tissue Act 2004, those events highlight flaws in the legal system, which has been overtaken by progress in research. This Government have taken decisive action to prevent unacceptable practice, but at the same time they have listened to patients and researchers about how to strike the correct balance. We will go on listening.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para130"><a name="stpa_131">It is a credit to hon. Members on both sides of the House that the Human Tissue Act enjoyed the broad support of all parties in its final form.

The Act will help to protect the rights and expectations of patients and their families, while allowing vital medical research to flourish. On Second Reading of the Human Tissue Bill, my hon.

<a name="51109h01_para131"><a name="stpa_132">The Department of Health and the NHS have issued consolidated guidance on research governance in the NHS, and research governance is now one of the core NHS standards. In the past, researchers have had difficulty in obtaining ethical review of proposals for NHS research, but a national system of ethical review is now in place and it is backed by a managed booking system and a common electronic application form. As a result, the time scale for obtaining ethical review has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 96WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
been dramatically reduced. Following the report of a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review of NHS ethics set up earlier this year by Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warner, we can look to further improvements in the ethical review process as we progress to a smaller number of larger, better-trained research ethics committees.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para132"><a name="stpa_133">The Government have also driven initiatives to aid researchers in obtaining approval for research by NHS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trusts. In the summer, the Department of Health consulted on a new strategy for research in the NHS. The proposals include a number of bureaucracy-busting measures: national advice structures to provide reliable advice on regulatory measures; better local support for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;researchers through national networks; much more joint working and standardisation in research governance procedures; and better use of IT to streamline information flows.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para133"><a name="stpa_134">Those measures will have a parallel effect to those introduced for ethical review and standards of decision making, and the time scales for clearance by NHS trusts will improve dramatically. To secure the clinical research potential offered by the NHS, the Government announced in 2004 the establishment of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration, with a commitment of a &#163;100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million increase in NHS research and development funding by 2008.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h01_para134"><a name="stpa_135">The UKCRC brings together the major stakeholders that influence clinical research in the UK, particularly in the NHS. The ultimate goal underpinning the initiative is to create a clinical research environment that will benefit patients and the public by improving national health, increasing national wealth and enriching world knowledge.

Any changes to the 1990 Act as a result of the consultation would require primary legislation and therefore provide Parliament with an opportunity to consider these important matters. My hon. Friend raised the issue of the regulation of embryonic stem cell research, and he has done a sterling job of keeping the Government alert to the prospects and pitfalls of such research&#151;for example, he led a debate on it in March this year.

<a name="51109h01_para138"><a name="stpa_139">I am grateful that my hon. Friend pointed to the need for more investment in translational research to move stem cells from the laboratory to the clinic. I am delighted to record his foresight. Shortly afterwards, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget speech made similar points when he established the UK stem cell initiative, a high-level review, chaired by the former director of research and development at the Department of Health, Sir John Pattison, who is charged with developing a vision and strategy for UK stem cell research over the next decade. The initiative is due to report back to the Government shortly. We eagerly await its report and recommendations on the future of that area of medical research in the UK.

<a name="time_4">
<a name="51109h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51109h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Tom Harris  (Glasgow, South)</b>  (Lab): It is a privilege to have won the opportunity to speak on this issue, and I am delighted that so many colleagues from all parties are present. This is clearly the most important debate of the day, although I suspect that for most members of the public it might be esoteric, dry and technical. However, I hope that all Members will agree that it is an important issue for the body politic of Scotland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para0"><a name="stpa_140">There can be no doubt that since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999, it has delivered for the people of Scotland. The blueprint that was painstakingly drawn up by the Scottish Constitutional Convention, and which was enacted by this Government in 1997, was the result of years of well thought-out planning and deliberation. That blueprint will, I hope, be the basis of devolution for the next 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para1"><a name="stpa_141">As I believe that devolution must be an event rather&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a process, I am opposed in principle to root-and-branch reforms of the Scotland Act 1998. However, we must be able to amend the Act where necessary, so that we can make small technical changes. We have already done so on one occasion, by accepting that Scottish parliamentary constituencies should remain unaltered when the Westminster seats were reorganised in the run-up to the 2005 general election.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para2"><a name="stpa_142">I believe that another technical, but extremely important, change will soon have to be made to the Act. I draw Members&#039; attention to the White Paper &quot;Better Governance for Wales&quot;, a document which, despite its title, is extremely relevant to the situation in Scotland. In that document, the Secretary of State for Wales writes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;The Government proposes to change the provisions currently in the Government of Wales Act to prevent individuals from simultaneously being candidates in constituency elections and being eligible for election from party lists.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para3"><a name="stpa_143">The reasons for that change are given in the subsequent paragraph:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;The outcome of the Assembly election in the Clwyd West constituency in 2003 illustrates the problem the Government is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeking to address. Five candidates stood for election in that constituency, four of whom ultimately became Assembly Members (one as the successful constituency candidate, and three more as additional members elected from their respective parties&#039; regional lists). In the Government&#039;s view, for losing candidates to be able to become Assembly Members regardless of their constituency election results both devalues the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to vote in constituency elections. We therefore propose that a simple amendment should be made to the provisions currently in section 5 of the Government of Wales Act to prevent this situation occurring in the future.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para4"><a name="stpa_144">I look forward to voting for that, and I encourage every Member to do so.
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51109h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ian Davidson  (Glasgow, South-West)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Does my hon. Friend agree that there are other anomalies that ought to be addressed? In particular, is he aware of the situation in Orkney? The number of votes that the winning candidate there received would not have had him placed first, second or even third if he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had stood in East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow. Indeed, he would not have been fourth. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 99WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
With the number of votes he won in Orkney, he would have been fifth in the East Kilbride constituency. That is clearly an absurd situation. Do we not need to have constituencies of equal size, so that votes are of equal value?
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51109h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : I am always extremely grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s helpful interventions. However, I disagree with him on this matter. Given the geographical nature of Scotland, we must accept that some constituencies will have smaller electorates than others, such as those in Glasgow.
</p>






<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51109h02_spnew3"><b> John Barrett  (Edinburgh, West)</b>  (LD): Another anomaly is to do with those parties that decide not to fight constituency seats, and which only campaign on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the list. That throws up a problem. The list was set up in the first place to deal with under-representation or over-representation in respect of constituencies&#151;particularly for parties such as the Green party, which does not fight constituency seats. Will the hon. Gentleman address that issue?
</p>






<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51109h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Harris: </b>  The hon. Gentleman is correct, but I go back to what I said at the beginning of my contribution: we have to respect the terms of the Scottish Constitutional Convention report. That made it clear that the d&#039;Hondt system would be used to calculate the number of additional members. It did not make reference to any obligation on the parties to stand in both lists. I agree that the issue should be addressed, but that is not the purpose of this debate. However, I know that some Labour Members are equally incensed about the situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para5"><a name="stpa_145">The question has to be asked: if it is good enough for Wales, why is it not good enough for Scotland? The problems caused by list MSPs&#151;or assisted places scheme MSPs, as perhaps we should call them&#151;are absolutely identical to those caused by list Assembly Members in Wales. I am extremely grateful to Leanne Wood, a Plaid Cymru list AM, who has written a memo entitled &quot;What should be the role of a regional AM?&quot;. It perfectly illustrates the problem that we face in Scotland and Wales. Ms Wood writes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Each regional AM has an office budget and a staff budget of some considerable size. Consideration should be given to the location of their office&#151;where would it be best for the region? Are there any target seats&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. within the region?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para6"><a name="stpa_146">She goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;We need to be thinking much more creatively as to how we better use staff budgets for furthering the aims of the party.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para7"><a name="stpa_147">She finishes off with a refreshing burst of honesty for a nationalist:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;Regional AMs are in a unique position. They are paid to work full-time in politics and have considerable budgets at their disposal. They need not be constrained by constituency casework and events, and can be more choosy about their engagements, only attending events which further the party&#039;s cause. This can be achieved by following one simple golden rule: On receipt of every invitation, ask &#039;How can my attendance at this event further the aims of Plaid Cymru?&#039; If the answer is &#039;very little&#039; or &#039;not at all&#039;, then a pro forma letter of decline should be in order.&quot;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51109h02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : I do not know whether you noticed what the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishart) said to that, Mr. Benton. No one has ever doubted the level of cynicism to which the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales will stoop, but it is awfully convenient to have it in black and white.
</p>






<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51109h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. David Marshall  (Glasgow, East)</b>  (Lab): What my hon. Friend has just said outlines the exact situation in Glasgow. There, the nine and a bit first-past-the-post MSPs represent only their own constituency, yet the seven additional list Members&#151;none of whom could win a first-past-the-post seat&#151;go around sticking their noses into every constituency in the city, claiming to represent the whole city. They raise not only devolved matters, but reserved matters that have absolutely nothing to do with them. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is high time that UK Government Departments told MSPs to mind their own business and to refer reserved matters to MPs?
</p>






<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51109h02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend says, but as he will know, the problem is not so much list MSPs claiming to represent every seat in their region; it is regional MSPs sometimes claiming to represent one specific seat in the region.
</p>






<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51109h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Frank Doran  (Aberdeen, North)</b>  (Lab): I have experience of that in my constituency. In the north-east of Scotland, we elect list MSPs for the whole of the north-east of Scotland region, which covers Aberdeen, Dundee, the whole of the former Grampian region and part of Tayside. In 1999, Richard Lochhead, now a list MSP, fought in my constituency&#151;Aberdeen Central, as it then was&#151;and was soundly defeated by the electorate, and yet he became a MSP. I find that difficult to understand, and I know that my constituents do, too. Notwithstanding the fact that he lost and was then elected, he spent the next four years campaigning in my constituency, holding surgeries, dealing with local issues&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51109h02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Joe Benton  </b> (in the Chair): Order. That is a rather lengthy intervention.
</p>






<p><a name="st_17"><a name="51109h02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. The Government agree with him; they have pledged to do something about that particular problem in Wales.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para8"><a name="stpa_148">Ironically, one of the sternest critics of the additional member system as it currently operates is the former Liberal Democrat MSP and MP, and the first Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, Sir David Steel. He said on 18 August 2003 that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;the system as operated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has led to a confusing and expensive proliferation of &#039;parliamentary&#039; offices throughout the country. In at least one town there are four&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they have become a thinly disguised subsidy from the taxpayer for the local party machines&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In my view they are a serious waste of public money&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para9"><a name="stpa_149">It is not often that I agree with Sir David Steel. In the same lecture, he recalled that the most distasteful and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irritating part of his job as Presiding Officer was dealing with complaints against assisted places scheme Members. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;I could not understand at first why we had such problems, until it dawned on me that what some were determined to do was misuse their position to run a permanent four-year campaign as candidate in a particular constituency.&quot;</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para10"><a name="stpa_150">That was exactly the point made by my hon. Friend the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran). Sir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;In most parliaments you do not have Members sitting in the same chamber or in committees who are going to be election opponents, and it does not make for a good working atmosphere.&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>






<p><a name="st_18"><a name="51109h02_spnew12"><b> David Mundell  (Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale)</b>  (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his arguments would have more credibility if the current Minister for Education and Young People, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Peacock, had not stood in the Moray constituency in the highlands and islands? Labour Members who serve on the Scottish Parliament&#039;s corporate body and in most senior offices in the Parliament sought to deal with such issues, but they have not done so. Surely the resolution to the list situation is a job description for list Members, which currently does not exist. As a result, list Members are either carrying out a range of matters, which the hon. Gentleman has described, or doing very little indeed.
</p>






<p><a name="st_19"><a name="51109h02_spnew13"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : The hon. Gentleman was a list MSP for the Conservative party, although I am sure that that has played no part in his thinking on the issue. If he had used those four years as an opportunity to organise matters in the seat that he now represents in the House, that would have added strength to my argument. I wish to point out that, although Peter Peacock stood in the Moray seat, such a proposal would affect all parties equally. I do not believe that any party should have candidates in the list and in first-past-the-post seats. Even if that does not give an advantage to my party in a particular seat, in principle it is a worthwhile move.
</p>






<p><a name="st_20"><a name="51109h02_spnew14"><b> Mr. Davidson </b> : The hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) was at least campaigning on behalf of his party consistently. What should be done in respect of Brian Monteith, who was elected on the list as a Conservative, but who then resigned and now presumably represents no one at all. Surely, it is anomalous to have someone elected on a party list, but who then remains as self-employed. Such measures should be precluded from the rules of the system.
</p>






<p><a name="st_21"><a name="51109h02_spnew15"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : My hon. Friend makes a valid point.
</p>






<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51109h02_spnew16"><b> Pete Wishart </b> : We have already heard that there are manifest deficiencies in the additional Member system, and I doubt whether anyone here would defend it. I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman said that he was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interested only in a technical amendment. It would serve no real purpose. It would not deal with some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deficiencies. Does he not agree that the people who are best qualified to make such decisions about the membership of the Scottish Parliament are the Members of the Scottish Parliament themselves, not hostile, antagonistic Members of Parliament who are based down here?
</p>






<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51109h02_spnew17"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : I hope that, when referring to hostile, antagonistic Members of Parliament, the hon. Gentleman was not referring to me.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 102WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Gentleman is in favour of elected bodies choosing their own electoral systems, perhaps he will explain why his party and my party voted to impose a single transferable vote system on local councils in Scotland, which did not want it.
</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51109h02_spnew18"><b> Jo Swinson  (East Dunbartonshire)</b>  (LD): Some of the difficulties with the current system of election to the Scottish Parliament have been described eloquently by the hon.

It is to elect for the Scottish Parliament through a single transferable vote in constituencies that maintain the constituency link, while ensuring a degree of proportionality.

</p>






<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51109h02_spnew19"><b> Mr. Harris </b> : I saw that point coming from so far off that I passed it in Millbank this morning. I have to disappoint hon. Members of all parties by saying that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not want a single transferable vote system for the Scottish Parliament. We cannot justifiably go back to a first-past-the-post system in the Scottish Parliament. We must honour the terms of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, otherwise we are saying that the great work that it has done over the years meant nothing&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If hon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para11"><a name="stpa_151">There are many examples of poaching. My constituency includes part of the Glasgow, Govan Scottish parliamentary seat and in 1999 and 2003 the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scottish National party&#039;s deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was defeated by Labour&#039;s Gordon Jackson, but in 1999 and 2003 she became an MSP. That is a basic democratic problem. When someone stands for election and is defeated, one would assume that that person would not become a member of that body. When people have made a choice, surely that choice should be respected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para14"><a name="stpa_154">Whenever Mr. Brown has stood in Rutherglen, he has been thrashed by the Labour candidate, but after each defeat at the hands of the voters he claims to represent, he has used taxpayers&#039; money to campaign against the incumbent MSP, a colleague in the Scottish Parliament. There are other examples. Bruce McFee in West Renfrewshire is another SNP loser who, after being soundly rejected in 2003, continues to use taxpayers&#039; money to campaign not in his region, but in that seat. The arguments are many and unanswerable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para15"><a name="stpa_155">First, it is undemocratic to allow candidates who have been rejected by voters in a constituency subsequently to be elected anyway. Secondly, it is not justifiable for assisted places scheme MSPs to use office expenses, paid for by the taxpayer, to pursue a four-year-election campaign by targeting a particular seat in a region. Thirdly, the existing system acts as an incentive for such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behaviour with MSPs sitting side by side while plotting to unseat one another at the next election. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disgraceful behaviour of poachers such as Nicola&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sturgeon, Robert Brown and Bruce McFee has brought the whole system into disrepute and it is up to the House to remedy the situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para16"><a name="stpa_156">The answer is simple and the path has been mapped out for us by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales. A simple amendment must be made to the Scotland Act 1998. Candidates must choose whether to stand on a party&#039;s list or to fight a first-past-the-post constituency. They should not have their cake and eat it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para17"><a name="stpa_157">There is a difference between first-past-the-post MSPs and list MSPs. The former represent constituents and the latter represent their party. It is not for this House to decide what their duties are or what their office costs may be, but surely there is an argument that list MSPs do not deserve or need office costs because they do not need an office.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para18"><a name="stpa_158">I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a number of questions. First, does he agree that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales is right to promise to legislate to prevent candidates from standing in both lists and seats? Given the identical nature of the problems created by list AMs and list MSPs, surely it is inconsistent, to say the least, for the same Government to legislate to fix the problem in Wales but not in Scotland. Will a similar amendment be made to the Scotland Act 1998?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para19"><a name="stpa_159">I expect that my hon. Friend will tell the House that we must await the outcome of the Arbuthnott inquiry, which was set up my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. I accept that. The commission was set up to look at the various electoral systems inScotland and will conclude at the beginning of next year. Nevertheless, decisions on such matters of policy cannot

<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 104WH</b>

<p>
<a name="51109h02_para23"><a name="stpa_163">First, I shall say something about the process that led us to the current position on examining boundary differences and voting systems in Scotland. On Second Reading of what was then the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Bill in February 2004, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland announced that he would set up a commission on boundary differences and voting systems. He took forward a commitment given by his predecessor, Helen Liddell, when the decision was taken to retain the number of MSPs at 129 and not to reduce them proportionately with the revised constituencies for Scottish seats at Westminster.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para24"><a name="stpa_164">However, in fairness, an additional factor was on the scene by the time that my right hon. Friend made his announcement last year.

<a name="51109h02_para26"><a name="stpa_166">I will come to those points, but am going to make the point about the Arbuthnott commission report, because it is central to much of the debate that we have gone around in the past 23 minutes.

<a name="51109h02_para27"><a name="stpa_167">The commission under Sir John Arbuthnott was appointed last year with the specific remit to look at the different sets of boundaries that we have in Scotland, as between parliamentary constituencies, for Holyrood and Westminster, local government and other relevant public agencies. The commission&#039;s remit extends to reviewing the voting system for elections to the Scottish Parliament. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, we must face the fact that by 2007 in Scotland we will have

</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para28"><a name="stpa_168">It is a serious commission, carrying forward a serious piece of work on our behalf. It is composed of extremely high-calibre individuals who have made outstanding contributions to public life in Scotland over many years. They are going about the task that we gave them with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exemplary thoroughness and integrity. They have held public meetings throughout the country&#151;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Galashiels, Stornoway and Edinburgh&#151;and have consulted MPs, MSPs, political parties and a range of representative organisations concerned with voting or boundary issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para29"><a name="stpa_169">Throughout the process, the commission has kept the public informed via its website. It published a series of reports and issued papers outlining some of its findings and the representations that have been made to it. Given all that, and the fact that we expect the report within a matter of weeks, it would be wrong of me to pre-empt the findings.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para30"><a name="stpa_170">The commission started work in July 2004 with a timetable to report to the Secretary of State and the First Minister by the end of this year or the beginning of next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year. I dare say that today&#039;s debate will be drawn to its attention as it reaches the concluding stages of its deliberations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para31"><a name="stpa_171">I turn now to some of the specific points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South and others. He began by saying that he was opposed to fundamental root-and-branch reform of the Scotland 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 106WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Act 1998. The Government also oppose such reform, and it is not on the agenda. He asked specifically about the situation in Wales and whether I agreed with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales. Of course, I agree with my right hon. Friend, whose statement clearly was made in the context of the Government of Wales Bill and the recommendations of the Richard commission. We should learn the lesson from my right hon. Friend, who waited until the Richard commission reported, examined its findings, consulted on those findings and then brought a statement to Parliament on how he planned to proceed. That is the way to go about such matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para32"><a name="stpa_172">The Arbuthnott commission is doing a different task, as we have asymmetric devolution in this country, but, on the issue mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South, it is fundamentally similar. It is doing the work that we have tasked it to do. It is doing it in a serious, mature way, and we owe it the right to bring its report forward. Obviously, there will be other debates such as this one. At that stage, we can decide how best to further the recommendations and go about timetabling them, which is the second point made by my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para33"><a name="stpa_173">It is not a question&#151;I have heard this said&#151;of hiding behind the Arbuthnott commission. These are serious matters. We are discussing fundamental issues such as how we have elections in Scotland, how we have elections to the Scottish Parliament and how the Parliament is brought together. It is important that we try, as far as possible, to deal with them on a consensual basis, as the Scottish Constitutional Convention did. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that the convention was snubbed by some parties, but it followed a proper process. Post-Arbuthnott report, I hope that we will achieve a similar consensus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para34"><a name="stpa_174">I am aware of the concerns raised by my hon. Friends&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Members for Glasgow, North-West (John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robertson), for Glasgow, South and for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran) and others about interference of MSPs on the list. I appreciate that that is an issue, and that it was raised in the Scottish Parliament. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South mentioned the case of Bruce McFee. However, what that MSP did was even worse than what my hon. Friend outlined. The Scottish National party&#039;s western Scotland regional office was in my constituency for four years. When the SNP was drubbed in the elections in Inverclyde in 2003, overnight it closed its office, which had served my constituents, and moved it 17 miles along the road to Paisley because it thought that its electoral prospects were better there. The cynicism with which the SNP has treated my constituents simply knows no bounds.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h02_para35"><a name="stpa_175">This has been an interesting and customarily lively debate. When Sir John Arbuthnott reports, as it will in due course, we will have an opportunity to revisit many of these issues. However, when we do, the debate will be informed by what I expect will be a high-calibre report. We will be able to revisit these issues in the context of that report.

<a name="time_7">
<a name="51109h03_time0"><h5>2.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_35"><a name="51109h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stephen Crabb  (Preseli Pembrokeshire)</b>  (Con): I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am grateful for the opportunity to open this debate on milk prices and the dairy industry. I am extremely encouraged by the turnout for the debate, considering that so many other important things are happening in the House today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para0"><a name="stpa_176">The fact that this is the first debate for which I have applied and secured since being elected six months ago reflects the seriousness with which I view the challenges facing dairy farmers and the importance of maintaining a healthy domestic dairy industry. I appreciate that this is a complex subject that has generated a huge amount of comment and analysis in recent years, not least the excellent report from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee published last year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para1"><a name="stpa_177">There are many different angles to the issue, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not attempt to cover all bases. I shall not, for example, mention the impact of common agricultural policy reform on the dairy sector, or bovine tuberculosis, which is having such a harmful effect on dairy farmers in my constituency I will not mention rising energy input costs or even the huge amount of regulation that is hampering so many farmers in the sector. I hope that contributions from other hon. Members will plug the gaps in my speech.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para2"><a name="stpa_178">My starting point is a simple one; it is the belief that Britain&#151;Wales&#151;needs a vibrant, healthy dairy farming sector, but that many dairy farmers are currently demoralised and pessimistic about the future and have little faith that the market for their product is working fairly and transparently. Many dairy farmers are producing milk at a loss, with production costs of around 20p a litre set against the farm gate price of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around 18p a litre. It sounds rather like a GCSE maths question: &quot;Work out how big the loss is, given any level of milk production.&quot; It is not complex.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para3"><a name="stpa_179">Here we are in the middle of autumn and with the escalation in costs of producing winter milk, many of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dairy farmers to whom I have spoken in recent days are very gloomy. That farmers were even able to countenance the action that some of them took last week in withholding product from processors is indicative of the frustration and anger in the community. Speaking to local dairy farmers, I do not get much sense of optimism or enthusiasm for the sector in which they do business.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para4"><a name="stpa_180">I spent part of my recess attending agricultural shows in my constituency and talking informally to numerous farmers. I could find reasons to be optimistic about beef and arable, and indeed we have had good news in recent weeks about the beef market and the ending of the over-30-month scheme. I pay tribute to the Minister and his colleagues for their efforts in that regard. However, in discussions with my dairy farming friends and representatives of the Pembrokeshire branches of the Farmers Union of Wales and the National Farmers Union, I heard nothing to suggest that the dairy sector is in anything other than a depressed state. The message and feedback that I have received is one of unalloyed pessimism, which is very worrying.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para5"><a name="stpa_181">Pembrokeshire lies in the heart of the famous west Wales dairy belt where, thanks to our wonderful rainfall and topography, we have been a major producer of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 108WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Britain&#039;s milk for centuries. If dairy is to have any future in the UK, it should be in a place such as Pembrokeshire. Seen from the air, Pembrokeshire is a beautiful patchwork of family-run farms, holding together around 90 small, rural village and town communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para6"><a name="stpa_182">The changes that we are seeing in the dairy sector lead me to believe that the nature of some of those communities is under threat. There is no question that farmers are exiting the dairy sector, and farming altogether, at an alarming rate. Farms are being vacated, which is having a serious knock-on effect on the viability and sustainability of our local services and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communities that use them. We know that there has been a drop of more than 30 per cent. in the number of dairy farmers in Wales in the last decade; we have also seen the closure of numerous village schools, post offices and shops during the same period. It is no flight of the imagination to suggest that the two phenomena are closely linked.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para7"><a name="stpa_183">Some dairy farmers are leaving the country altogether. I know of two young farming families in my constituency who have left in the last year to pursue their businesses overseas, one in France and one in Canada. I understand that they are not the only examples from my county. They have not given up on the industry that they love; they have given up any prospect of carrying out their business profitably in the UK, which is very sad.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para8"><a name="stpa_184">I do not regard this situation with anything like the cool neutrality of the former permanent secretary to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department, who told a conference in 2003:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">&quot;Government has no particular view on how much milk the UK should produce or on how many producers or companies there should be. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it does not have views on the shape of the industry.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para9"><a name="stpa_185">I take the view that a diverse supply base is a good thing. I believe that, while the trend towards larger farms cannot be reversed, family-run farm enterprises are a good thing and that the wider rural economy in a place such as west Wales relies on a large and successful network of producers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para10"><a name="stpa_186">No one is arguing that change must not happen, least of all the farmers to whom I have spoken. Indeed, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vision for the Dairy Industry&quot; document published recently by the NFU illustrates that; it is forward looking and realistic about the changes facing the sector. However, it is my contention that some of the trends in dairy are being accelerated by imbalances in the supply chain caused by unequal power relationships and a lack of trust and transparency. The problem is one of a fundamental imbalance in the supply chain where farmers, who are the primary producers, are right at the end of the supply chain and the return that they get for their toil is widely regarded as unfair.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para11"><a name="stpa_187">Let me state from the outset that I do not accept the simple narrative that supermarkets are the cause of all the woes that face dairy farmers, and they should not be seen as pantomime villains. My understanding is that the picture is a lot more complex than that. Supermarket chains are rational decision makers, whose duty is first&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and foremost to create value successfully for shareholders, which they do by creating and recreating value propositions for their customers day in and day out. Farmers understand that supermarkets are here to stay. Supermarket chains are the largest customer for British agriculture and some of the younger farmers 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 109WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have spoken to, in particular, are remarkably upbeat about the need to work closely with the major retail chains. Only yesterday, I was speaking to one young dairy farmer in my constituency who is closely involved with the group Future Farmers of Wales. She stated clearly that if she has any sort of future in the industry, it would only come about by working successfully with the major retail chains.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para12"><a name="stpa_188">That brings me to the efficiency and transparency of the supply chain linking the farmer to the supermarket checkout. I do not believe that the market is working well; a high degree of mistrust, suspicion and confusion characterises the sector. There is no question but that the rise of supermarkets has altered the playing field on which farmers compete. We know from the Milk Development Council report in September that evidence suggests that farmers&#039; returns on milk have fallen at a much greater rate than those of their EU counterparts, but that retailers&#039; margins have been increasing. Dr. Nick Fenwick of the Farmers Union of Wales describes it like this:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">&quot;There is now overwhelming evidence to suggest that the dominance of supermarkets over supply chains represents a wholly new type of market place that is not compatible with traditional notions of free competition, and the economics of &#039;supply and demand&#039;.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para13"><a name="stpa_189">As a Member with a passionate belief in the benefits of free competition, I have to take such a charge very seriously indeed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para14"><a name="stpa_190">The first specific point to which I would like the Minister to respond concerns the extent to which he feels that the current supermarket code of practice is working well. In what ways could it be reformed or changed to ensure that the market functions well and for the benefit of the primary producer? Does the Minister agree that the code should apply to the entire supply chain, thus addressing the relationship between farmers, suppliers and supermarkets, as opposed to those between supplier and supermarket? Last year&#039;s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report concluded that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">&quot;there remains a fundamental imbalance of negotiating strength between supermarkets and most of their suppliers. The code appears to have been ineffective in redressing this imbalance, at least in respect of the dairy supply chain.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para15"><a name="stpa_191">I welcome the Minister&#039;s thoughts on that statement, one year on from the publication of the report.
</p>






<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51109h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien  (Eddisbury)</b>  (Con): My hon. Friend articulates very well indeed the severe problems that a lot of us share in our constituencies. These matters are crucial to the rural economy, not only in relation to its diversity but to the vital strategic business of producing dairy raw materials. Has he noted, as I have from talking to farmers in my constituency, that the receipt for farmers for their commoditised product at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the farm gate is probably about 18p, while the supermarkets have increasing returns? If we analysed the whole value chain from the farmer through to the shopper, about 18p in that value chain is unaccounted for.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para16"><a name="stpa_192">I do not know whether my hon. Friend has carried out any further investigations. If not, does he hope that the Minister is able to account for that 18p because it cannot be accounted for in distribution costs, or in any attempt to suggest that there is a regulated distribution market? If that 18p were available, it would be better shared 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 110WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
among farmers at the farm gate rather than used solely to increase returns for the supermarkets under their code of practice.
</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51109h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Crabb </b> : My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The evidence submitted to the Select Committee last year highlighted the confusion that I mentioned when examining the sector, and the confusion and lack of transparency in the supply chain. I echo the comments of my hon. Friend and I invite the Minister to comment on the missing 18p per litre.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para17"><a name="stpa_193">What are the Government doing to ensure that fair play is maintained in respect of consumers and suppliers? If the Office of Fair Trading sees its role as firmly in dealing with consumers, who is protecting the interests of suppliers? I invite the Minister to comment on the concept of a buyer&#039;s charter proposed by the NFU, which seeks to ensure that trading terms between suppliers and retailers are not abused.
</p>






<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51109h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b>  (Lab): Rightly, the hon. Gentleman has mentioned the buyer&#039;s charter. I wonder whether he has signed my early-day motion, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;urge other MPs to sign, which supports the NFU&#039;s stance on the buyer&#039;s charter.
</p>






<p><a name="st_39"><a name="51109h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Crabb </b> : Absolutely.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para18"><a name="stpa_194">I would welcome a response from the Minister on the question of what role he feels that he and his Department can play in restoring confidence to the sector and, specifically, in bringing farmers much closer to processors and retailers. It is a widely held view that farmers need to get closer to the end customer and to be much more directly involved in value-added processing, which means a greater degree of partnership working and vertical integration down the supply chain.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para19"><a name="stpa_195">On partnership working, I was encouraged to learn of two examples of retailers seeking to work constructively with primary producers to ensure that a fairer return reaches the farmer&#039;s pocket. In so doing, they are guaranteeing their own supply base. I am told that Marks and Spencer has established long-term price agreements with a network of organic dairy farmers to supply milk to its in-store caf&#233;s. That agreement provides added security for the farmers, who have a more stable environment in which to make their investment decisions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para20"><a name="stpa_196">More significant in terms of volume is the partnership involving Asda, Arla and its base of dairy farmers. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that the purpose of the partnership was to ensure a much greater level of transparency in the supply chain and to build trust and consensus with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processor and the producers. That involved Asda&#039;s agricultural manager sitting down in the homes of many of the individual farmers involved in the partnership. That kind of close involvement obviously builds trust and lays a good foundation, but it still does not fundamentally alter the price scenario for liquid milk.
</p>






<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51109h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. James Gray  (North Wiltshire)</b>  (Con): Although I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entirely agree with my hon. Friend that vertical integration is a good thing overall and probably the way forward for the industry, does he not agree that there is a significant risk that companies such as Asda and some of the other very large retailers and processors may 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 111WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
bring unreasonable conditions to bear on smaller dairy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farmers in particular, so that only the large, professional, industrial-type dairy farmers will survive because the small farmers&#151;the kind that we represent in many of our constituencies&#151;will be unable to compete?
</p>






<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51109h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Crabb </b> : My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. I have not been able to find out the extent to which the farmers who are involved in that kind of partnership represent the kind of farmers that we both have in our constituencies; those who run small, family farms.
</p>






<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51109h03_spnew7"><b> Albert Owen  (Ynys M&#244;n)</b>  (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman think that it is important that when supermarkets such as Asda apply for planning permission, the planning authority considers the local conditions and the effects that he says supermarkets have on pushing the price down in local areas? Should there not be greater input from local farming unions in the planning process so that local sourcing can be considered as a way of helping farmers, particularly those who run family farms?
</p>






<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51109h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Crabb </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I have to confess that I am unsure of the extent to which the detailed planning guidance that affects decisions that local authorities make can incorporate that kind of thinking about local sourcing, but I have been talking to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local supermarkets in my constituency and asking specifically how many local lines of produce they stock, whether they have targets for Welsh produce and whether they are on course to meet them.
</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51109h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner  (Isle of Wight)</b>  (Con): May I assist my hon. Friend on that matter by describing the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reaction of the Isle of Wight council&#039;s planners to the suggestion that local sourcing should be a condition of an extension to Tesco at Westridge in my constituency? The planners believe that that cannot be done, but the members are determined that it should be done and are determined to push it through and try it. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that other planners up and down the country will be persuaded by their members to try it.
</p>






<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51109h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Crabb </b> : My hon. Friend makes a good point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para21"><a name="stpa_197">Without doubt, there is a need for greater rationalisation and consolidation in the processing section of the supply chain. Many farmers feel that that would be one route towards equalising some of the power relationships in the chain, especially if there were much greater farmer-owned processing. However, in that context, we could run into problems with the Office of Fair Trading. It is a view in the farming community that the OFT would seek to call in any further mergers between large UK dairy companies for fear that that would give them a monopolistic position in the domestic market.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para22"><a name="stpa_198">Many farmers regarded the OFT&#039;s decision to investigate the proposed acquisition of 15 per cent. of shares in Robert Wiseman by First Milk as absurd. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to ask the Minister why the OFT felt that it was necessary to refer to the Competition Commission the proposed sale of Scottish Milk Dairies, which held only

&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 112WH</b>

2 per cent. of the Scottish liquid milk market, to Robert&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiseman. To quote one renowned dairy producer, who I spoke to this morning:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;it sends out completely the wrong signal to the industry when the OFT is crawling all over initiatives like this&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para23"><a name="stpa_199">I invite the Minister to respond to that.
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51109h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. O&#039;Brien </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for generously giving way a second time. I am holding a raft of e-mails from dairy farmer constituents who are incensed about the Scottish Milk Dairies and Robert Wiseman Dairies decision and recommendation. The Minister has an opportunity today to demonstrate that it is within the Government&#039;s power to have a beneficial effect on dairy producers in our constituencies. I had something to do with the 1999 Eddisbury by-election, as did my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). That was the time when the former Secretary of State&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot remember his constituency, but it was somewhere in the north-east&#151;reversed the Competition Commission&#039;s recommendation and did not allow vertical integration from producers. That has had a continuing and dire effect on the value-added chain to benefit farmers at the farm gate. The Minister has it within his gift to reverse that and we are urging him to do so.
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51109h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Crabb </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. We look forward to the Minister&#039;s comments on it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para24"><a name="stpa_200">What steps is the Minister taking actively to encourage the growth and development of farmer-controlled co-operatives such as Milk Link? Farmers are not looking to politicians to determine the milk price. Those I speak to consider themselves to be business people and simply want the market to work in a way that guarantees fair outcomes.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51109h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Lindsay Hoyle  (Chorley)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) on raising this matter because we would not otherwise be having this debate today. It is an important debate because the subject seems to be a forgotten one. Farmers seem to be bottom of the pile when recognition of them should be at the top of the pile. Without doubt, farmers&#151;dairy farmers and beef producers through to sugar producers&#151;are under the cosh from day one.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para26"><a name="stpa_202">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on raising the subject and the way in which he articulated every problem and issue along the way. My only slight disagreement&#151;this is my view and opinions change&#151;is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 113WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that ending the 30-month scheme will not do anything for beef production at this stage. We must try to keep it until we can get the beef price at a sustainable level for beef farming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para27"><a name="stpa_203">The main subject is milk prices and the price that is paid at the farm gate to farmers who work endless hours. MPs may complain about the hours that we work, but they are nothing compared to those worked by farmers. They work seven days a week with their families and they toil to try to ensure that we can be proud of our countryside and, more importantly, that milk is delivered to homes and supermarkets. I shall return to that villain.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para28"><a name="stpa_204">An unacceptable price is being paid to dairy farmers. The 2003 study said that milk production costs were about 18.36p per litre and we now know from the NFU&#039;s latest paper that they are just over 20p per litre. As was said earlier, one does not need to be a great mathematician to know that farmers cannot stand such losses. Governments come and go, and seem to have their own ideas about farming. One minute we persuade farmers to undertake more intensive farming because that is where the future lies. Then we say that perhaps we should not have large, intensive production but should slow it down. Farmers must keep trying to change the way in which dairy production takes place. Then we come to the big problem. Yes, they can produce quality milk in this country that is second to none, but they need a fair, firm price delivered to the gate. The price is not fair at the moment. The problem is monopolies. No matter how many times we try to break them, it does not help the person who we are representing today, the farmer. Whatever action we take, the price will not be fair.
</p>






<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51109h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Gray </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not just a matter of the differential between the 20p that it costs the farmers to produce the milk and the 17p that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are receiving, but capital investment? A constituent, Mr. John Tuck, wrote to me to say that his milk parlour is 31 years old. His youngest tractor is 16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years old. How on earth is he supposed to replace that equipment, when he is losing 3p per litre on his milk?
</p>






<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51109h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Hoyle </b> : I was trying to make that point. Farmers are expected to invest in a certain way. They are then told, &quot;Sorry, we have not got it right. We want you to change to this way.&quot; How can we expect people to invest? How can we expect to change the way in which farmers are viewed, without their receiving the real price? The hon. Gentleman is correct.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para29"><a name="stpa_205">My constituent, Rick Massey, is a big dairy farmer. He has worked hard to make a living for him and his family. He is a tenant farmer. He and the rest of the Brindle farmers have always been up against it. One minute Arla wants to be fair to the farmers; the next minute, it is cutting prices. Both sides sign up to an agreement to say that the price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is fair, only to find out that the dairies want to renegotiate the deal within 12 months. That is unacceptable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para30"><a name="stpa_206">We have had the same experience with supermarkets. They continually work in such a way. The great passport of a penny is not acceptable. The matter has been touched on already. Supermarkets must be fair. They 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 114WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
can make a difference to farming in this country. The answer to the future of farming is for the supermarkets to pay a fair farm gate price to ensure that farming stays in this country for ever and a day. That can happen because of their monopoly. They dictate and they can make or break a farmer. The time has now come for less talk and more action from the supermarkets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para31"><a name="stpa_207">Let them sign up to a voluntary buyer&#039;s charter. They are shying away from matters. A buyer&#039;s charter would be a step in the right direction. We and the supermarkets must be serious. People do not realise what is going on when they pay the price in the supermarket. They think that someone is making a lot of money; they might think&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it is the farmer. Well, we all know that it is not the farmer who is making the profit, but the supermarkets and the processors. Excuse the pun, but they are creaming off all the capital. When it comes to price, let us have not a fair playing field, but a fair dairy field.
</p>






<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51109h03_spnew18"><b> Albert Owen </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree with farmers in my constituency who welcome the OFT holding a review into the dominance of the major supermarkets? He referred to a buyer&#039;s charter. Does he also agree that the Minister should be thinking about his Department working with the Department of Trade and Industry to construct a proper regulatory framework? Farmers are asking for that. They have no confidence in the OFT, or in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="51109h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Hoyle </b> : I cannot disagree with my hon. Friend. He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is correct. Let us have commitment from the supermarkets under a voluntary charter. The Office of Fair Trading must be seen to be doing its job. We have received report after report from the supermarkets, but they always shy away from the real problem, which is their monopoly position. We should be taking on the directors of the supermarkets because, without doubt, the moment that their collar was felt, we might see a fair price.
</p>






<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51109h03_spnew20"><b> Daniel Kawczynski  (Shrewsbury and Atcham)</b>  (Con): It is encouraging to hear a Labour MP speaking with such passion about agriculture. Does he agree that it is important to have a Secretary of State in the Cabinet who is involved solely in agriculture, so that she or he could act as a champion to lobby the supermarkets? I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questioned the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at the DEFRA Select Committee the other day. I referred to her as the Secretary of State for Agriculture, for which she admonished me, to the cheers of Labour MPs. She said, &quot;I am not the Secretary of State for Agriculture. My Department is DEFRA.&quot;

the shows, seeing the farmers, and beginning to talk to people. I am pleased that that is happening, but we must of course firm up the position on the future of farming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para33"><a name="stpa_209">Legislation has been mentioned, and that is necessary. There is also a need for the input of a Government, and of the Departments that have been mentioned. The Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, along with the National Farmers Union&#151;and even Farmers For Action&#151;have all got voices that must be heard. We must all stand together and say to the supermarkets, &quot;We need you to be fair.&quot; That is the commitment that is needed. Perhaps we ought not to be using legislation; perhaps we ought to be allowing common sense to prevail, by telling the supermarkets that if they really do want a future in this country, they must recognise this point. That is important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para34"><a name="stpa_210">It is also important to touch on the subject of young farmers and the future of farming. There is no future for young farmers, because of the high cost of buying or renting a farm. The prices are unfair, and that puts people off; they ask, &quot;Why do it?&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para35"><a name="stpa_211">If anybody picks up and reads the <i>Farmers Guardian</i> these days, they will know that farms from the south of England to Scotland are up for sale for one reason; people have had enough. They might not be walking away from farming altogether&#151;they might be going to Nigeria or other parts of Africa, or to France, or to Canada&#151;but our farmers are saying, &quot;Enough is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough,&quot; and they are going elsewhere in the world to try to enjoy what they enjoy most, which is farming.
</p>






<p><a name="st_58"><a name="51109h03_spnew23"><b> Annette Brooke  (Mid-Dorset and North Poole)</b>  (LD): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although the consumer might benefit to some extent from lower supermarket prices, the loss of our dairy farming would create great disbenefits for the consumer, because there would be lack of controls on quality, in addition to us losing our farmland? Tough action and tough speaking are needed now; there is no alternative. We have had a real wake-up call, and I hope that we have got it in time.
</p>






<p><a name="st_59"><a name="51109h03_spnew24"><b> Mr. Hoyle </b> : I cannot disagree. In fact, I totally agree, except on one point. I do not think that people who shop at supermarkets are getting the best deal. I do not believe that any of the gains that are being made by screwing the farmer into the ground is being passed on to them; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence shows that that is not what happens. The profits are creamed off for shareholders. Companies such as Tesco and Asda hold up their balance sheet; that comes first, and it does so at the expense of farming. That is unacceptable, because it is not sustainable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para36"><a name="stpa_212">We must also talk about the Government in this respect. They have a major role to play. We must get people around the table, and get them to recognise that there is a future in farming only if a fair price is paid for what farmers produce.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para37"><a name="stpa_213">Another big issue for farmers is that they want to be farmers. They did not want to be form-fillers, but, unfortunately, that is what they have become. More and more of their time is spent form-filling. I understand that there is a need for forms. I understand the problems caused by foot and mouth and so forth, and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 116WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acknowledge the difficulties that arise from such events, so I recognise that forms can be important, but there is an issue to do with the number of forms. They are repetitive. Often, a single form could cover a lot of the relevant issues, and if that form were shared between different Departments, that could further reduce the burden on farming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para38"><a name="stpa_214">That is what farmers would like to happen. Let them do what they do best; let them get out into the fields and get on with farming. They did not take up farming to do so much form-filling. However, I recognise that this problem is not entirely to do with DEFRA; forms come from all Departments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para39"><a name="stpa_215">The amount of paperwork is crucial for the future of farming. We ought to be saying that one form will fit all, if the information is shared. That can be done. We need to take a serious look at this matter, because it is important. I am sure that, like me, all Members regularly meet the farmers in their constituencies; when we do, the one thing we can be sure that they will say is, &quot;Have you seen these forms that I now have to fill in?&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para40"><a name="stpa_216">It is a tragic shame that dairy farmers with new-born calves have no market for those calves. There is no future for calves. They are having to shoot the calves; they are having to be put down. That is a tragedy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para41"><a name="stpa_217">There are a number of major problems that we must deal with. All Members present are united on one thing; farmers must get a fair deal. Let us talk to the people who matter. That is not just the Government, but the supermarkets, which can do more for the future of farming than any of us here by giving that fair price.

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="51109h03_spnew25"><b> Mark Williams  (Ceredigion)</b>  (LD): Like others, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) for securing the debate. If there is one message that must come from it, it is that there is a united front, as has been said by the hon. Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorley (Mr. Hoyle). I join him and other hon. Members in drawing the Minister&#039;s attention to the huge gulf between retail milk prices and farmers&#039; production costs. Many of us receive that message in the farmyard and at the marts when we talk to farmers in our constituencies. We have also heard about the disastrous effect that that has had, and is having, on dairy farming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para42"><a name="stpa_218">The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire was right to draw attention to the much more far-reaching implications of the collapse of the dairy sector for local schools and services, and for the wider rural community. I share a constituency border with him. All the concerns in Preseli Pembrokeshire that he expressed are replicated in my constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para43"><a name="stpa_219">Historically, a third of the total farm output of Wales was generated by the dairy sector. Yet, by the end of 2004, 60 per cent. of Welsh dairy farmers were failing to cover their production costs, and dairy farmers in Wales have been exiting the industry at a rate of three a week, a frightening statistic. In Ceredigion, some 1,300 jobs have been lost in the agriculture, forestry and farming sector since 1998. The number of holdings and the average herd sizes have fallen dramatically. We cannot overstate the feeling of the farming community. In the same week as Tesco&#039;s profits topped &#163;1 billion, nearly two thirds of farmers could not cover their production costs. There is real despondency and anxiety about the future of their farms.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51109h03_spnew26"><b> Mr. Philip Dunne  (Ludlow)</b>  (Con): I want to reinforce the point that the hon. Gentleman is making so well about the strategic nature of the industry. For the public health reasons that have been mentioned, there is concern that if farmers leave the dairy industry in the way he has described&#151;it is also happening in my constituency&#151;this country will, at a certain point, lose the capacity to produce milk. That is not too far off. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;urge the Minister to take that message away from this debate.
</p>






<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51109h03_spnew27"><b> Mark Williams </b> : I thank the hon. Gentleman; I can only concur with those comments. This is a UK-wide problem, although constituency interests are obviously dear to our hearts.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para44"><a name="stpa_220">A combination of factors has brought us to this situation. The legacy of the break-up of the milk marketing boards has left the large retailers and their suppliers in an increasingly powerful position in the supply chain. That has been compounded by significant rises in farm prices since the 1990s, motor fuel prices increasing by 22 per cent. last year, feed prices increasing by between 9 and 20 per cent. and the price of fertilisers rising by 30 per cent. in two years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para45"><a name="stpa_221">Again like the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire, I will not be tempted to discuss CAP reform, but that issue has had a profound effect on dairy farmers. When questioned on the issue, Ministers have stated that market forces should be allowed to operate. It would seem that farmers are still losing out in what is an increasingly favourable market for some dairy products.
</p>






<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51109h03_spnew28"><b> Mr. Michael Moore  (Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk)</b>  (LD): My hon. Friend talks about the picture in Wales. In Scotland, we have lost 500 diary farms in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;past five or six years, and thousands over the past 20 years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para46"><a name="stpa_222">Market forces have been mentioned. Surely for as long as the big supermarkets are allowed to unleash their forces on the market there will be only one set of winners. Is it not about time that the Office of Fair Trading was given a proper remit to regulate this market for everybody?
</p>






<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51109h03_spnew29"><b> Mark Williams </b> : My hon. Friend pre-empts me slightly. Of course that is the case. Free markets with protection for the vulnerable must surely be the course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para47"><a name="stpa_223">The Rural Payments Agency figures have shown that milk production is about 233 million litres behind quota. The economics of supply and demand would suggest that farm gate prices should therefore be rising, yet they remain low&#151;that is the problem. I will now discuss possible solutions, and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s comments on them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para48"><a name="stpa_224">As was articulated well by the hon. Members for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#039;Brien) and for Preseli Pembrokeshire, the National Farmers Union is concerned at the decision made by the Office of Fair Trading to refer the proposed merger of two Scottish milk processing companies to the Competition Commission. The NFU thinks that further rationalisation in the processing industry is essential if the UK is to compete effectively at EU and international level. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s views on the principles of rationalisation. Does he agree with the NFU that it should be encouraged? If so, what can he do to aid that process?

<p>
<a name="51109h03_para49"><a name="stpa_225">Farmers have told me that suppliers often cite increasing fuel prices and transport distances as a reason for reducing the price that they will pay for milk. Does the Minister agree that we should have a renewed push&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to process milk as locally as possible? The closure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of local creameries is a key factor in driving down farm gate milk costs. The Government, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales should address that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para50"><a name="stpa_226">Action on those points would be welcome, but that would only begin to address the main issue. I return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore): the Government must do something to tackle the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overwhelming power of the supermarkets. The voluntary supermarket code of practice applies only to the relationship between farmers and their suppliers, and people have no confidence whatever in that system. The code should apply to the whole supply chain. That would acknowledge that the behaviour of supermarkets impacts directly on farm gate prices; the figures that we are hearing today prove the facts.
</p>






<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51109h03_spnew30"><b> Mr. Alan Reid  (Argyll and Bute)</b>  (LD): My hon. Friend makes important points about the unfairness in the marketplace. Does he agree that one of the problems with the supermarket code of practice is that, if suppliers complain, it has to become a matter of public record? Naturally, some suppliers are anxious about that, in case they are then victimised by the supermarkets. Does he agree that we need an independent watchdog to help reintroduce transparency and trust into the industry? Such a watchdog could be proactive and need not rely on suppliers to make a public complaint, with all the risks that that involves.
</p>






<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51109h03_spnew31"><b> Mark Williams </b> : My hon. Friend is right. In a survey in the February 2004 OFT report on the supermarkets code of practice, 73 per cent. of respondents reported a fear of complaining about the conduct of suppliers. Three years after it was introduced in 2001, not a single farmer had used the code, fearing lack of anonymity and loss of business.
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="51109h03_spnew32"><b> Mr. Jeremy Browne  (Taunton)</b>  (LD): Does my hon. Friend accept that farmers and agricultural producers are not looking for special favours? They do not want to be permanently reliant on subsidies, and that is not the route we should seek to take. What they want is a fair market&#151;I am in favour of free market economics&#151;but one can only have such a market if there are no abusive or restrictive practices and if there are enough players in the supply chain to mean that there is genuine competition. That way, the price of milk will find a natural level, which means that farming can be sustainable without being reliant on subsidy. The problem is not that the Government necessarily need to give more largesse&#151;

<a name="51109h03_para53"><a name="stpa_229">North-east Nottinghamshire is not noted for its dairy or beef farmers. During the past 50 years, we have moved quickly from a mixed agricultural society to a limited one of almost completely arable farmers. Unlike the rich pastures of Preseli, where I spend many of my holidays, the whole area in between the power stations that proliferate up in Nottinghamshire is taking on much more the mien of the county of Cambridgeshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para54"><a name="stpa_230">Our farming is getting much less interesting, demanding and diverse, and the farming communities, and their mixture, are suffering. Several Members present have already made the point that the vibrancy of the agricultural community depends not only on profit margins, but on variety and on there being a fair deal for those to whom they sell their produce.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para55"><a name="stpa_231">Time is limited, so I shall not bang on more than I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normally do, but I should like briefly to consider one case study in my constituency. A little under a year ago when this problem started to generate heat in the east midlands and in north-east Nottinghamshire, I was asked to visit several of the diminishing number of dairy farms in my area. Most of them were absolutely model farms. They understood the necessity to make milk production as efficient as possible, and the diversity was impressive. Every single one of them had thought about the environment; many had tried to diversify so that

He and his wife worked more than a 60-hour week, and they had had to pay off the man who worked part-time essentially, as far as they were concerned, to fill in the forms about which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we heard from the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle). Their workload was increasing and their profit margin decreasing by the day. I do not need to tell the Minister that on 1 October the price of milk fell by another 0.3p, making life even more difficult for the characters whom I have just described. That is a relatively large milk producer on my patch; there are others in more difficult circumstances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para57"><a name="stpa_233">Although electricity, diesel, contracting, oil-based fertiliser and all other costs that the farmer must absorb continue to rise, there is nowhere for the farmer to go. I know that the Minister understands. With my limited grasp of mathematics, I should have thought that the rules of supply and demand suggest that as supply diminishes, so prices should rise. That is not the case. Although prices may be rising, they certainly are not doing so at the farm gate. The losers in this deal are the farmers who are trying to put in those 60-hour weeks not only to produce the goods that we want, but to maintain the farms, the diversity and the rural aspect.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para58"><a name="stpa_234">Those points have been made already. However, the dairy farmers pointed out to me that it is not easy to change from dairy farming, unlike other forms of farming. It takes about four years to go from conception to producing a milkable animal, if that is the right technical term, and such a business cannot just be turned round or changed overnight. Already, we have heard that if we are not careful, given where competition is going, we will end up with large farms, and the sort of small herds that I have been discussing will completely disappear. I do not want that, and it is clear that nobody in this Chamber&#151;no matter what their political stripe&#151;wants that either.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para59"><a name="stpa_235">I iterate the points already made. Will the Minister please allow us, and therefore our farmers, to know what the Office of Fair Trading is going to do about this? How will a supermarket code of practice be made to work, both in theory and&#151;to use the same word again&#151;in practice? What can the buyers charter be made to do for the farmer, rather than the processor? Lastly, how can farmer-controlled co-operatives be encouraged by the Government, not just in theory, but in fact?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para60"><a name="stpa_236">The time for talking about this subject is long past. The Minister understands that, unless the supermarkets and other market factors are gripped and controlled, we shall lose our dairy production capacity completely, and I, for one, will be extremely sorry and many of my constituents will be extremely poor.

From the dairy farming point of view, the issues are about not just the price of milk, but BSE and the lack of export opportunities. The fact that dairy farmers cannot send their calves to the best market also impinges on the profitability of dairy farms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para61"><a name="stpa_237">However, the price of milk is obviously a key issue. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am surprised to see the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight) in his place; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have thought that the Minister for Competitiveness would have responded to this debate. In a sense, this issue is not about farming, but competition. Farming is all right: people produce milk&#151;there is no problem with that. The key issues are selling it and the state of the market.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para62"><a name="stpa_238">I shall be very quick. We have to make up our minds about a point of principle and of policy. The question is about whether we want a fair market or a free market for milk. I do not think that we can have a free and a fair market; we will find that the free market is not fair&#151;it does not reflect the effort and investment that goes in from farming families&#151;and that the fair market is not free.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para63"><a name="stpa_239">This country, and in some ways the Government, have benefited very much from food prices having been kept down. Inflation in this country has been kept very low, and we congratulate the Government on that, but across the economy the prices charged by some service industries seem to have gone up fairly substantially&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certainly think that when I pay my accountant or solicitor. To some extent, manufacturing has also seen price hikes. Food prices, however, have been kept very low indeed. Supermarkets do not compete on quality or variety&#151;all of them have those&#151;but on price. It is hard to explain to a farmer that supermarkets make more money by charging less than anybody else, but that is what they do because they want market share.
</p>






<p><a name="st_72"><a name="51109h03_spnew37"><b> Mr. Gray </b> : The hon. Gentleman seems to be making a different point from that of his colleagues. A moment ago, we were saying that, given that milk was sold at 54p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a litre at supermarkets, somebody somewhere was making a fat profit. The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that the supermarkets are competing with each other and keeping the price unreasonably low, and that that is why farmers are so badly paid. In that case, presumably he is proposing that supermarket milk prices should go up.
</p>






<p><a name="st_73"><a name="51109h03_spnew38"><b> Mr. Williams </b> : If the hon. Gentleman hangs on a minute, I shall come on to what I am and what I am not proposing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para64"><a name="stpa_240">That is my analysis of the market. In classical economic terms, a market&#151;a free market, which is acting properly and in the interest of all who participate&#151;must have many buyers and many sellers. Everybody must have a shared knowledge of that market&#151;the amount, the demand, the amount provided and the manner provided. That is obviously not the case in this country. Tesco and other supermarkets have a huge proportion of buying clout. That point has been well made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para65"><a name="stpa_241">One of the questions that I would like to ask the Minister is about the OFT&#151;I am not quite sure whether it is the Office of Fair Trading or the office of free

trading. The OFT is meant to be at arm&#039;s length from the Government, but there must be some indication as to when it should or should not intervene. The time is well past for intervening in the food chain market. Examples have been given, and we could put out a lot. What are the instructions, the guidance, for the Office of Fair Trading?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para66"><a name="stpa_242">I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker), who leads for us on these matters, will put forward the case for a fair trade inspector. That is important. In Wales, few farmers sell directly to the supermarkets. They sell through intermediaries, whether the dairies, the slaughterhouses or the meat-processing plants. Often the happy supermarket&#151;I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot remember which hon. Member mentioned this&#151;will go and sit in the farmer&#039;s kitchen and chat, moaning and groaning about the margins and that sort of thing, when the dairy is driving down the price.
</p>






<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51109h03_spnew39"><b> Mr. David Jones  (Clwyd, West)</b>  (Con): The hon. Gentleman mentioned that farmers in Wales sell primarily to dairies. Does he not share my concern at the increasing number of dairy closures, including Longslow dairy in my constituency only last month? Farmers are left with additional transport costs, reducing their profitability.
</p>






<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51109h03_spnew40"><b> Mr. Williams </b> : I agree. The problem of consolidating the industry stands as a problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para67"><a name="stpa_243">I will close. The Minister needs to address the competition issues. No Government should leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country lacking in food. British dairy farmers cannot produce at the price at the moment and, in the end, they will not produce.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para68"><a name="stpa_244">The Minister has connections with Kettering. He will know the area well, but he may not be aware that in north and east Northamptonshire the number of dairy herds has fallen from 42 to just 13 since 1986. Several more are on the brink of closure, taking the number of dairy farms down to single figures. At the current rate, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not be surprised if dairy farming ceased to exist in the Kettering constituency during my parliamentary career, should that last for more than one term.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para69"><a name="stpa_245">Local dairy farmers tell me that the process of closure has accelerated in the last five years. Dairy farming requires substantial investment, not only in financial terms but also in time. Dairy farming consumes far more of a farmer&#039;s time than crop production, because of milking and animal-welfare issues. The request that local dairy farmers asked me to make is that the Government look seriously at the transparency of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supermarket price of milk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para70"><a name="stpa_246">With another hat on, I have the privilege of sitting on the all-party parliamentary small shops group. We are considering the state of the retail sector. Evidence given shows that a supermarket having an 8 per cent. share of the retail market starts to distort competitive pressures. Tesco has a 30 per cent. share of the grocery market and

<br>&nbsp;<br>
a dominant share of the milk market. As my hon. Friends said, the farmer gets only 16p to 20p per litre, but the supermarket sells milk at 54p per litre. The Government urgently need to examine the difference between the two prices.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para71"><a name="stpa_247">Of course, there is an Office of Fair Trading. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) made an extremely good point that the Government need to send a signal to the OFT and the Competition Commission that all is not well, not only in the retail industry but in the supply chain, particularly in respect of dairy farming. On behalf of all the dairy farmers and related rural communities in the Kettering constituency, I urge the Government to take the issue extremely seriously. I do not want to be the Member of Parliament for a constituency that no longer has any dairy farms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para73"><a name="stpa_249">I would like to use my time to draw Members&#039; attention to the effect on some processors. I refer specifically to a farmer-run co-op in my constituency&#151;the South Caernarfon Creameries, or Hufenfa De Arfon. It is a unique enterprise, with members as far south as Aberystwyth and as far east as Denbigh. It produces an excellent range of products, including organic products and milk from cows that are fed on non-GM feed&#151;it is labelled as such, which is the good practice that we hope for from other producers. The creamery produces a cheese called Monterey Jack, which is based on an American recipe, and exports it to America. The people who run the co-op are enterprising. The prices that it pays its owners&#151;it is farmer owned&#151;are always in the higher echelons, and it does everything that it should, yet it is under pressure because of the current situation, which, unfortunately, is a case of the bad driving out the good.

A Minister from Cardiff has told us who is holding the smoking gun. I do not need to go into that argument, as the Milk Development Council&#039;s report is clear enough.

The debate has been attended by a large number of Members from all parties&#151;more from the Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties, it has to be said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para76"><a name="stpa_252">The debate is also significant for the fact that hon. Members who have spoken have shown unanimity about the seriousness of the problem, the role of the supermarkets and the urgent desire to do something to ensure that the British dairy industry continues in existence. I am sure that the Minister will have taken those points on board and I look forward to hearing his contribution shortly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para77"><a name="stpa_253">This is a serious issue. It is extraordinary that this country has an almost unique combination of skills, structure, climate and geography to provide a secure and financially sound dairy industry, yet farmers are leaving the industry week after week, as we have heard, from all parts of the country, be it Wales, Scotland, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;south-west or indeed my constituency of Lewes. Undoubtedly one of the reasons is the operation of the market. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) is right to draw attention to the importance of the competition process, which is at the root of our debate this afternoon.
</p>






<p><a name="st_81"><a name="51109h03_spnew46"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner </b> : The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that geography is a significant factor. Would he be surprised to know that school milk, which is subsidised and sold in my constituency, is sold at 18p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a one-third-of-a-pint carton? It is brought from Chadwell Heath in Essex to the Isle of Wight; yet it is possible to buy milk at 30p a pint from suppliers on the Isle of Wight. For some reason, even the Government&#039;s subsidised scheme for milk creates far more food miles and far more expensive milk.

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51109h03_spnew47"><b> Norman Baker </b> : It does indeed. If I were to be distracted down a different road, the same could be said of the fruit scheme in schools. Huge numbers of pears and apples are imported into the country, when it would be better if they were supplied by our own suppliers, for environmental reasons as well as to support the British farming industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para78"><a name="stpa_254">I want to draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the answer to a parliamentary question that I put, which spells out the relationship between the price that farmers have received for milk in recent years and the price at which the supermarkets are selling it to consumers. In 1995 the average price paid at the farm gate across England and Wales was 24.94p a litre. By 2004 that had dropped to 18.46p a litre. We also heard of all the extra costs&#151;genuine and significant costs&#151;that are falling on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farming industry, whether it is for fertilisers or the infrastructure. When suppliers have lost about 25 per cent. of their price over that period of time, it is impossible for them to continue indefinitely, if over the same time the supermarket price has stayed roughly the same and the supermarket profit has increased from 1.3p a litre to 13p.
</p>






<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51109h03_spnew48"><b> David T.C. Davies  (Monmouth)</b>  (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the significant costs that have been borne by many dairy farmers is that resulting from TB and its spread in certain areas? Does he agree that the Government need to take action over that and to see how it is being caused, which in many cases is by badgers?
</p>






<p><a name="st_84"><a name="51109h03_spnew49"><b> Norman Baker </b> : I agree that TB is a serious issue, particularly in the south-west, but also in Sussex in my constituency. The hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that the Lib Dems recently published a proposal to deal with the problem, which included dealing with the badger issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para79"><a name="stpa_255">The relationship of farm gate prices to retail prices is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absurd, and shows what the NFU correctly calls a dysfunctional supply chain. The supermarkets are making increased profits, while the process to compete for supermarket tenders is driving down prices to farmers. As a result, the dairy industry is threatened and we will end up sucking in more and more imports. That is in the interests of no one, except those who are abroad. It is a clear market failure. The market is not delivering the level playing field that we have a right to expect. That is why so many of us are so angry at the OFT&#039;s failure to take action on this matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para80"><a name="stpa_256">My hon. Friend suggested that it was the office of free trading rather than the Office of Fair Trading. I might suggest that it is the office of fixed trading, fixed in the sense that it does not move and also that it seems to be beneficial to supermarkets and not to those supplying milk. I understand why we have got there, but it is not satisfactory simply to leave the matter with the OFT, which is not only not helping with a clearly malfunctioning market in which it ought to intervene, but is making matters worse, as we have heard, in respect of the referral of the proposed acquisition of Scottish Milk Dairies Ltd. by Robert Wiseman Dairies plc to the Competition Commission, despite the fact that the business represents a mere 2 per cent. of

Gentleman agree that the real problem that the OFT has, and that the Government can influence, is that it should not keep on looking at the producer definition as the short circuit and the easy way out for defining a market, which is the much harder process of defining where the sales took place? That is how we could help get to the supermarkets rather than always to the farm producers.
</p>






<p><a name="st_86"><a name="51109h03_spnew51"><b> Norman Baker </b> : I have some sympathy with that point. The OFT also seems to fail to recognise that we are now in the European market.

<a name="51109h03_para81"><a name="stpa_257">The Minister who is present is from DEFRA. He doubtless has some sympathy with the plight of farmers; I have heard him on previous occasions express such a view. What influence does he have with his colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry, who should be the ones taking action on this matter? How can he take that message back? What will he ask them to do? What is DEFRA&#039;s position on those issues, which the DTI, the OFT and the Competition Commission ought to investigate more fully? They do not seem to be investigating them fully at the moment.

</p>

<a name="51109h03_para82"><a name="stpa_258">As has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams), there is an urgent need for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fair trade inspector or a food trade inspector in the OFT. It is clearly not satisfactory to rely on the code of practice, which has simply delivered nothing. Nobody will complain if they feel that they will be victimised or will lose business as a consequence, and we cannot expect them to do so. There has to be a genuine mechanism to allow farmers to make what they believe to be genuine complaints, to have such complaints properly investigated and to feel secure that they will not lose out as a consequence. Clearly, they do not have that confidence at the moment, but they want to make complaints.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para83"><a name="stpa_259">The absence of complaints made does not mean that people do not want to complain. There are plenty of complaints to make. I am sure that other hon. Members present will have met local farmers, as I have; I joined a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great many from the south-east outside the Arla processing plant in my constituency, which is at Sheffield park, near Chailey. Farmers have plenty of complaints, many of which are entirely justified, and they are very angry. Some farmers are now being driven to pouring their milk down the drain to try to draw attention to this serious issue. Plenty of complaints could be made. The fact that they are not being made through the code of practice suggest that it is flawed. That has to be changed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para84"><a name="stpa_260">We need an intermediary, such as a food trade inspector, who could analyse the complaints and drive some sense into the OFT. Will the Minister support that sort of mechanism to allow the regulation of the market to be properly addressed in a way that has not taken place so far? His colleague in the Lords and the DEFRA team have expressed some sympathy with this issue. Will

the Minister tell me what he is going to do by way of an inquiry into the power of the supermarkets, which is generally of concern not only to us in this House and to the farming industry, but to consumers, who are writing to me in increasing numbers? What will he do to ensure that the whole issue of supermarket power is addressed? A complex monopoly of four big chains now controls a huge amount of the food market and distorts it as a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequence. That must be addressed as a general issue and I do not see it being addressed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para85"><a name="stpa_261">Farmers are going out of business every week. In Wales alone, 32 per cent. of the farmers have left the diary industry in the past 10 years. There are now only 15,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales, according to the National Farmers Union. This is a serious matter and I hope that, given today&#039;s high attendance and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong views expressed by Members of all parties, the Minister will accept that we now need action from his Department and, most of all, from the DTI and the OFT.

<a name="51109h03_para87"><a name="stpa_263">The reason for that is partly a historical problem, caused by the old Milk Marketing Board, and the incentives given to farmers to produce a commodity&#151;liquid milk&#151;which they were told would then be taken away.

However, the problem is that during that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period our competitors in Ireland and on the continent&#151;in particular France&#151;were forging ahead with farmers&#039; co-operatives, and were focusing on added value.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para88"><a name="stpa_264">We must differentiate between milk, which is a commodity, and products that the consumer wants to buy. We have become efficient producers of a commodity, but our farmers are detached from the end market. That problem is compounded by a strong and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 128WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
well organised retail sector, which has driven prices down, so that farmers are being driven out of business. The solution is to add value. We must get our farmers near to the end consumer; they must get into brands and finished products that consumers want to buy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para89"><a name="stpa_265">Let me offer a couple of examples from my constituency, which, along with that of my constituency neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#039;Brien), is part of the largest milk field in western Europe. Processing is about four times more efficient in France than it is here. We produce 11 per cent. of the EU&#039;s milk, but only 4 per cent. of its cheese. France produces 18 per cent. of the EU&#039;s milk, and 22.5 per cent. of the cheese. We are suffering from a ghastly hangover going back to the years of the MMB, when we did not invest in efficient processing plant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para90"><a name="stpa_266">However, there are exceptions. M&#252;ller, a private German company, has, from zero to 12 years, gone from producing nothing to producing nearly 2 billion pots of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yoghurt in a state-of-the-art, world-class plant near&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market Drayton in my constituency. I talked to Mr. Robert Cope of Adderley yesterday; he is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the size of his herd of cows from 300 to 600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to supply M&#252;ller. Another nearby family business is going in the opposite direction. Justin Beckett has stopped milking cows, and has gone into specialised cheese production. He is supplying the multiples and all the supermarkets, and he is buying from a large number of small processors. He wants fat in his milk, 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. fat, so he is encouraging the use of Jersey and Shorthorn cows. That is just the sort of thing that my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray) was touching on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para91"><a name="stpa_267">There are solutions to this problem; they are to add value, to get near the customer, and to use the supermarkets. When I went to see Herr M&#252;ller in Germany, he said he could never have grown his business at the speed that he has done without the extraordinary efficiency of the UK distribution sector. We need to get products into that sector.
</p>






<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51109h03_spnew55"><b> Albert Owen </b> : I apologise for leaving the debate. I had to take an important telephone call. The hon. Gentleman should not make party political points about attendance, and the high attendance by Members of all parties who represent Welsh constituencies is to be applauded. He talked about added value. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire mentioned, the problem in that regard is that the margins are so small that nobody can invest and diversify in the way that is being outlined. The options for farmers to do that are limited. It helps when they get opportunities from larger companies, but it is impossible for small family farms to reinvest in the new machinery that is needed to make the added-value products.
</p>






<p><a name="st_91"><a name="51109h03_spnew56"><b> Mr. Paterson </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right. The Government make it difficult to get into that. However, I cited the example of a small, family business which has prospered by adding value and getting near the consumer. The hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) talked about the supermarkets. The problem in that respect is that the Chancellor will do nothing about them, because, as the hon. Member for Brecon and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 129WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) said, taking action will create inflation, and the Chancellor will not want supermarket prices to go up.
</p>






<p><a name="st_92"><a name="51109h03_spnew57"><b> Mr. Hoyle </b> : Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para92"><a name="stpa_268">In respect of liquid milk, we can add value by way of a variety of additions, such as omega 3 fish oil. We could also have vending machines in schools, as my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) said. There are new probiotic products, too. Treating milk as a commodity is a complete loser; we have to get into adding value, because the situation will get worse. Polish production has increased by 11 per cent. this year, pushing EU production up by 1 per cent. Poland is coming along with western efficiency, and Hungary will follow. We must add value and get near the consumer, and the Government have to get out of the industry&#039;s hair in terms of farm regulation, putting up new units&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and factory regulation. Leon Downey fought a wonderful battle down in Pembrokeshire, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire, to stop being put out of business by Government regulations.
</p>

<p><a name="st_95"><a name="51109h03_spnew60"><b> Mr. Paterson </b> : I do apologise, but I have only a short time left.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para93"><a name="stpa_269">There are further problems with regulations on, for instance, farm shops&#151;they are another way of getting near the consumer&#151;and getting planning for retail outlets. There was an interesting case this week in which the European Commission ruled on feta. I would like the Government&#039;s line on that. The Government must stand up for the ability to make named cheeses in other geographical areas. Take our area; the majority of Cheshire cheese used to be made in Shropshire. It would be a real problem if there were pressure from the Commission on named cheese.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para94"><a name="stpa_270">The Government could do a lot more on cross-compliance. EU directives such as the nitrate vulnerable zones directive and the water framework directive all mean costs on top of the other rising costs that hon. Members present have mentioned, one of which was fuel. There is a lot that the Government could do to make life easier for those who need to branch out and expand. I agree that it is extremely difficult to get into those added-value activities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para95"><a name="stpa_271">Above all is the issue of the OFT. It was an absolute disgrace that the right hon. Member for North Tyneside (Mr. Byers)&#151;the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&#151;overruled and went against the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. At the time, Milk Marque had 38 per cent. of the domestic market, and Arla was allowed in with 98 per cent. of its market. It is ludicrous to treat the markets that we are talking about as little, isolated national markets; they are not. The case last week, in which Robert Wiseman Dairies was not allowed to buy a business that had only 2 per cent. of the Scottish liquid milk market, was ludicrous.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para96"><a name="stpa_272">I was talking to a very successful executive of a big milk co-op this morning. He said, &quot;You can&#039;t breathe without the risk of OFT intervention.&quot; All Members in

<br>&nbsp;<br>
this Chamber have talked about that. We have to allow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;larger groupings, and we need larger farmers&#039; co-operatives, processors and distributors. With them, we will get research into the products that I mentioned, efficiencies of production to get us up to continental levels and, above all, the clout to stand up to the supermarkets.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para97"><a name="stpa_273">I simply do not understand the extraordinary, narrow definition that the OFT seems to put on the market in the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury is right; the OFT looks only at supply. It does not look at sales&#151;I do not think that it has a way of getting at them. We have a massive problem here. We are talking about a product that is not just European&#151;I have mentioned Poland, and huge imports come from Ireland, too&#151;but global. Milk powder can come from New Zealand or the west coast of America. It is absolutely incorrect that the OFT and Government direction should be allowed to interfere in such a prejudiced manner with the suppliers of milk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para98"><a name="stpa_274">Also, as numerous hon. Members have said, the OFT is not attacking the problem of the buyers. Those buyers are in an extraordinarily privileged position, because there is an oversupply of a commodity and a small number of buyers, who have massive power. If there is time, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would like the Minister to give the Government&#039;s position on that, and to say what the Government are going to do about it, because there is unanimity on the issue across this Chamber.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para99"><a name="stpa_275">Quotas have collapsed in value. We are under quota&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this country, but there are massive payments of super-levies in Italy. What is the Government&#039;s line on sale of quota across borders? On by-products, it is frankly disgusting that black-and-white calves are being shot the moment that they are born. At a rough calculation, if we achieved the same price for black-and-white bull calves that one can get in France this afternoon, that would add &#163;100 million to dairy farmers&#039; incomes. What will the Government do about that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para100"><a name="stpa_276">Finally, I come to TB. I do not have time to go through the 600-plus parliamentary questions that I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have tabled on TB. This disease is out of control; it is an epidemic, according to one of the replies that I received. Its not being cured will cost this country &#163;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion over the next 10 years. When will the Government take action?

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="51109h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Jim Knight) </b> : I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welcome the debate. It has been useful and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) for raising the issue, which is important to my constituency of South Dorset. We probably would not have a railway line if it were not for the need back in the days of Thomas Hardy to have a way in which to get the milk from Dorset to London to serve the market. When I was on holiday earlier in the year, I visited the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency and enjoyed the perilous pursuit of coasteering with my family. I might not repeat that activity, but it might have been a less perilous occupation than answering today&#039;s debate.

</p>


<p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
heard the frustration and sometimes anger that has been expressed on behalf of dairy farmers in my constituency. I must qualify my statement by saying that I firmly believe that there is a bright future for a modern, profitable and efficient United Kingdom dairy sector in the long term. We have a climatic advantage, a flexible milk quota regime, some first-rate producers and processors, and affluent customers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para102"><a name="stpa_278">Our farm size, efficiency and costs of production relative to our European partners are good. We are further ahead in preparing for the lower prices and trade liberalisation than most other European Union countries. We heard about value-added production from the hon.

We can have a successful dairy sector in the UK and we are in a good position to ensure that we do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para103"><a name="stpa_279">That said, I am not complacent. I appreciate that the short to mid-term is challenging for the sector. It is clear that the problems facing the dairy industry are complex and that there is no simple solution to them. The Government&#039;s response has been to obtain more transparency and clarity in respect of such issues by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establishing the dairy supply chain forum, chaired by my noble Friend Lord Bach, so that we can play our part in helping industry to help itself. I wholeheartedly agree with what the hon. Member for North Shropshire said about value-added production. We are aware of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problems in the UK dairy industry. We export low-value commodity products and we import high-value products. The industry needs to move away from that. The forum is funding a major study into barriers to innovation.

However, it is the little things that depress the farmers at present. Devon has the largest permanent milk quota in the country. In my constituency, we are 30 vets short in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state veterinary service. TB testing is now grinding to a halt because private vets are withdrawing and there are no private vets available to carry out the testing. It is that sort of thing that tells dairy farmers that the Government are not interested, and long-term bright visions of jam tomorrow are not going to sustain an industry that is dying now.

<p><a name="st_104"><a name="51109h03_spnew68"><b> Jim Knight </b> : I want to dwell on the points that are crucial to the matter, such as those relating to supermarkets and so on, but the Department is very focused on the issue of bovine TB.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para105"><a name="stpa_281">The forum has brought together all sectors of the dairy industry to find collaborative solutions to common problems. The forum has played a pivotal role by providing a framework for constructive debate and giving leadership for the dairy sector through this challenging time; I have referred to some of the things that it has commissioned. In response to the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone), it is certainly building more transparency. There is still further to go to properly identify the 18p per litre that the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#039;Brien) talked about, but the forum is doing some very important work in that area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para106"><a name="stpa_282">We recognise that farm gate prices, although broadly similar this year to last and higher than they have been recently, are too low for many to be able to sustain their businesses. In response to the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire, I am concerned about the number of farmers leaving the industry. There was a report by Professor Coleman on the changes in dairy farming in England and Wales since 2002&#150;03, which suggests that there might have been a more significant downturn in production than previously projected as a result. Although milk production is low this year, it is too early to tell whether there is a definite trend, but we are watching that carefully and we are concerned about it. UK production at the moment is roughly at the same level as it was in 1998&#150;99.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h03_para107"><a name="stpa_283">We also recognise that costs have increased for all in the supply chain, putting a squeeze on profitability for some. However, in terms of profitability, farm gate prices are only one part of the story. Producers have to play their part too by reducing costs and becoming more efficient. As the NFU has noted in its impressive document, &quot;A Vision for the Dairy Industry&quot;, profit comes from a combination of cutting costs and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 133WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
achieving a fair return from the market. The 25 per cent. of farmers with the lowest production costs were producing milk for, on average, 12p per litre less than the 25 per cent. with the highest costs. That difference is not sustainable. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen), that is one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons why it is very difficult for us to introduce a regulator. How can a fair price be set when there is such a difference in cost?

I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate, having been on an Inter-Parliamentary Union visit there in September. It was a well organised visit and there was a good deal of unanimity of views across all three parties represented. Had it not been for the important debate in the House, the hon. Members for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) and for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and others would have been here to add their views and I hope that my comments will represent their views as well as mine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para0"><a name="stpa_286">It was interesting to be there with both countries having elections next year. I want to put on the record that, having not been to central America previously, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found them attractive and welcoming countries. Costa Rica seems to be particularly well organised and developed environmentally&#151;that is close to my heart&#151;with huge reliance on hydropower, which was pleasing to see. Its National Biodiversity Institute&#151;INBio&#151;promotes and safeguards the country&#039;s unique environment. I am pleased that it has had some British funding to help it to do so. Nicaragua is an extremely attractive country and wears its heart on its sleeve. Both countries are preparing for elections next year; Costa Rica in February 2006 and Nicaragua in November 2006.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para1"><a name="stpa_287">In Costa Rica the front runner is the former president and Nobel peace prize winner, Oscar Arias. It was an interesting time to be there because two former presidents are under house arrest awaiting charges for alleged corruption during their time in office. What is interesting is that there is obviously an issue of possible corruption, but the country seems to be able to deal with that and is not frightened of taking forward issues relating to high-profile individuals. That is welcome.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para2"><a name="stpa_288">Costa Rica has a diversified economy and a good stable regime for investment, although it would be welcome if it ratified the Central America Free Trade Agreement sooner rather than later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para3"><a name="stpa_289">In this debate I want to discuss what we are doing to maximise UK influence in those countries, to help Costa Rica and Nicaragua as countries, and to ensure that we engage with them productively for our own country. Having spent some time there and having done some reading, I have discovered that relations between our countries have always been good and that is useful. However, it is clear that our resources over there are stretched, to say the least.

She was refreshingly unstuffy compared with some in the Foreign Office&#151;I am not referring to the Minister&#151;and the more ambassadors we have like her, the better. She does a great deal to enhance Britain&#039;s reputation in those countries.

and 13 people who are native to Costa Rica or Nicaragua. We have now got to the stage at which the engine is running so slowly that it is in danger of stalling. A little more investment from the UK would repay itself many times over in terms of the benefits to the UK that would flow from it. The people I met in Costa Rica felt a good deal of good will towards the UK. Many have been here, some have studied here and they are very well disposed towards us. Frankly, we are not maximising our opportunity to put across our values, nor are we maximising trade opportunities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para6"><a name="stpa_292">UK Trade and Investment operating in Costa Rica has now been downgraded to a response service only. We met the UK Trade and Investment people. They were quite clearly capable of actively going out there, identifying markets for UK businesses and securing them with little difficulty, given the stable nature of Costa Rica and the fact that the country is growing successfully and is well disposed towards the UK. However, only a response service is in operation and I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand that that was almost withdrawn and was saved at the last minute only after a huge fuss was kicked up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para7"><a name="stpa_293">Why are we neglecting trade opportunities in the country? The Minister will probably say that there is a finite budget for these matters, priorities have to be allocated as the new countries enter the European Union, and we have had had to reconsider our role across the globe. I understand all that. However, has a cost-benefit analysis been carried out to find out whether, if we had more personnel there&#151;whether from the Foreign Office or UK Trade and Investment&#151;they might pay for themselves in terms of the money that we would recoup from their presence?

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para8"><a name="stpa_294">We met business people from UK companies in Costa Rica. The Minister will know that many UK companies operate there. Frankly, some of us were embarrassed by the lack of support that we appear to be giving to those companies, which want to expand, to the benefit of both Costa Rica and Britain. There is no British Council presence in the country any more. There have been two annual Chevening scholarships, but there was some suggestion that they might be withdrawn. Perhaps the Minister can confirm whether that is the case. In general, we are underperforming. Investment would more than repay itself. Thanks to the ambassador and her staff, who are excellent, we are punching above our weight, but there is only so much that can be done with the resources available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para9"><a name="stpa_295">When we went on to visit Nicaragua, the story was similar. The visit was interesting. There are elections coming up and there is a real possibility that Daniel Ortega, whom we met, will return. It was an interesting experience meeting him. We learned that one has to interrupt him in order to get a word in. He sort of expected that. If we did not interrupt him, he carried on indefinitely, like some throwback to the 1970s. He is very much influencing what is going on. There is a difficult constitutional situation, as the Minister will doubtless be aware. There is some sort of unusual pact&#151;I would not quite say devil&#039;s pact&#151;between the Sandinistas and the supporters of former President Alem&#225;n, who, of course, has been charged with money laundering and embezzlement. The situation is far from stable at present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para10"><a name="stpa_296">The power of the Executive has also been increasingly curtailed by the legislative branch in a way that is not entirely helpful in the sense that there now appears to be an unfortunate degree of political involvement in, for example, the nomination of Supreme Court judges and the members of the electoral tribunal. However, we might not be in a position to exert as much influence as we would like, given the paucity of our resources in the sense that, from our point of view, Nicaragua is now essentially administered from Costa Rica.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para11"><a name="stpa_297">I should say that the Department for International Development is clearly doing some good work in Nicaragua. We went to see a couple of the projects that it has been supporting, including the association for people living with AIDS. DFID is doing some good, cutting-edge stuff there, but I am concerned that, to some degree, it is operating as a kind of surrogate embassy and almost undertaking Foreign Office functions because of the lack of an embassy in the country. Again, sadly the position that we saw was, to some degree, one of retrenchment and withdrawal from the country on the part of the UK, rather than of taking the opportunities that exist to boost the UK&#039;s position.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para12"><a name="stpa_298">It is also important from the EU perspective that the EU&#039;s voice is heard. The American voice is certainly heard in Nicaragua, and the louder the US voice, the less its influence. America may wish to reflect on how it undertakes its foreign policy. I am sure that the Minister will not comment on that observation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para13"><a name="stpa_299">DFID&#039;s programmes undoubtedly seek to improve the economic opportunities for poor people and strengthen the effect of planning and policy making. The programmes go some way towards doing that. I welcome the fact that the UK cancelled its multilateral debt with Nicaragua in 2004. It is a welcome and sensible move, which has gone down well in that country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para14"><a name="stpa_300">We have good trade opportunities. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, Shell, Securicor and Land Rover are well established in the country, but they do not get the support that they ought to from the Government as an entity. The issue is more for the Department of Trade and Industry than the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but it is relevant to the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para15"><a name="stpa_301">We have historical ties to the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua as a consequence of British landings in the 17th and 18th centuries. There is a large English-speaking population who still feel close ties to this country. We met some of them, and they had attractive and warm personalities. We all wanted to return from that country in order to help. I know that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton has organised a meeting with the Minister at DFID, and we are grateful for that and we shall attend on a cross-party basis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para16"><a name="stpa_302">What is happening on the Atlantic coast is sad. There is little investment stretching from Managua to the Atlantic coast. There is no road to the town of Bluefields, which has a population of 60,000. The road stops some way west of the town. When we raised that with the people from the Atlantic coast, their view was that the horse always set off from Managua and always died half way across the field, never quite reaching Bluefields nor the eastern seaboard. It is a pity for Nicaragua that it cannot or has not developed the Atlantic coast. Its geographical position is useful in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 138WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
terms of trade, with openings to the Pacific and the Atlantic. It seems that the Atlantic coast is entirely ignored.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para17"><a name="stpa_303">I raised the question of funding via a written question to DFID. It is clear that DFID takes an interest in how the funds are allocated, although it seems to be adopting a funding policy in common with other countries&#039; general programmes. Although that may make some sense, it has lessened the ability to determine how the money is spent. There is an issue about how well our money is being spent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para18"><a name="stpa_304">It is true that there are budget headings in the Nicaraguan Government account to show that money is being spent on the Atlantic coast. However, the Atlantic coast people to whom we spoke said that it is simply not spent. The money stays in the budget or is redirected. We cannot unfortunately rely on the budget heads and the published accounts from the Government to see what is happening. We must do something else to ensure that money is spent in those areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para19"><a name="stpa_305">DFID&#039;s spending ought to be dependent on a proven assurance that money is spent on those areas of the country that need it most. The Atlantic coast is one of those. It is to the benefit of Nicaragua to have the money spent in that area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para20"><a name="stpa_306">My other point is about the San Juan river dispute, which was of concern to both countries when we were in Nicaragua. It is an unfortunate dispute about who can do what on the river. Everyone accepts that the river belongs to Nicaragua, which possesses sovereignty over it, and everyone accepts also that Costa Rica has rights of passage on the river. That curious debate has reached epic proportions about whether Costa Rican police carrying arms can operate on the river. Costa Rica does not even have an army; it spends its money on the health service, education and other matters. I do not say that we should adopt that policy ourselves, but money spent on health and education is probably more warmly welcomed by the population than that spent on some of our overseas jaunts. However, I digress.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para21"><a name="stpa_307">I am concerned that the stability of both countries should not end up compromised by what appears to be a very small dispute, and that valuable resources that ought to be spent on improving the lot of the population at large should not be spent on military matters. If the Government could help in any way&#151;perhaps they can, having been involved historically in the region&#151;that would be very welcome.

<p><a name="st_116"><a name="51109h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander) </b> : I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) for securing this debate. His contribution is eloquent testimony to the importance of Inter-Parliamentary Union groups visiting and seeing for themselves the kind of initiatives that he was able to describe in such detail following his recent trip to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. I also place on record my personal gratitude for his generous words about Ambassador Georgina Butler, whom he described as &quot;unstuffy&quot;. I shall ensure that his kind and generous remarks are relayed directly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para22"><a name="stpa_308">The hon. Gentleman made comments about Daniel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ortega&#039;s style of conducting meetings; propriety and diplomatic convention oblige me to resist 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 139WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
commenting on that. Suffice it to say that my own limited experience of diplomacy&#151;first as Minister for Trade and then as Minister for Europe&#151;convinces me that Mr. Ortega is not alone in approaching meetings in that style. I have faced similar challenges on how to ensure that the British Government&#039;s point of view is communicated in various meetings during the past couple of years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para23"><a name="stpa_309">The hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions about Foreign and Commonwealth Office policy towards Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and I shall direct myself to some of those concerns. The background was set out in the December 2003 White Paper &quot;UK International Priorities: a Strategy for the FCO&quot;. That set out the Government&#039;s international priorities for the next 10 years and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s strategy for delivering them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para24"><a name="stpa_310">It was clear that we needed to evaluate our network of overseas representation to respond to inevitably changing priorities. We have, in the past seven years or so, opened 28 new posts, including major new missions in Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and Pyongyang. Twenty-six posts have been closed over the same period, and Managua in Nicaragua is one of those. None of those decisions has been taken lightly, but it is essential that we align our resources to our overall priorities and have the ability to respond to change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para25"><a name="stpa_311">I assure the House and the hon. Gentleman that we are not&#151;categorically not&#151;abandoning countries. As he knows, and recognised before our deliberations today, our ambassador to Costa Rica is now also accredited to Nicaragua and is responsible for taking forward the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s strategic priorities for both those countries. The Department for International Development&#039;s central America office is in Managua, as was acknowledged in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s contribution. The head of the Department for International Development office, whom I know the hon. Gentleman met on his visit, is also accredited to the British embassy in Costa Rica. We also have an excellent honorary consul in Managua.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para26"><a name="stpa_312">A key priority for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in both Costa Rica and Nicaragua is to promote the rule of law and sustainable development, underpinned by democracy, good governance and human rights. We continue to seek opportunities to develop our cultural relations with the region, including through the Chevening programme. The hon. Gentleman said that he had heard rumours that the Chevening programme would be withdrawn from Nicaragua and Costa Rica; I assure him that that is not the case. Two of the presidential and one of the vice-presidential candidates in the forthcoming election in Costa Rica are former Chevening scholars. By any measure, that shows the importance of the Chevening scholars programme and its effectiveness in identifying those who will be figures of influence in Costa Rica and the region in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para27"><a name="stpa_313">The Department for International Development&#039;s work in Latin America is based on a regional approach to help the multilateral agencies. The hon. Gentleman raised that point in talking about the effectiveness and efficacy of using our money as part of a multilateral effort, rather than the Department for International 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 140WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Development determining priorities in isolation. That is notably the case in relation to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. The general policy context in which such individual decisions are made has received detailed Government consideration and is based on a judgment that, in many circumstances, pooling money across multilateral agencies is a more effective means of securing value for money and effectiveness of output than when each international development agency from a range of different countries chooses to set up its own mechanisms and deploy its resources unilaterally. In addition, the Department for International Development provides bilateral assistance to Latin America through United Kingdom non-governmental organisations. DFID maintains a bilateral programme of support for Nicaragua, the only remaining low-income country in the region other than Haiti, and has increased its annual budget for Nicaragua from &#163;3.7 million to &#163;4 million for 2006&#150;07.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para28"><a name="stpa_314">This is the first year that DFID will provide budget support to Nicaragua. Given our concerns about the party polarisation of central state powers and the fact that donor support to the Government&#039;s fight against corruption is hampered by political control of state powers, including the judiciary, the audit authority and the electoral circumstances, DFID Ministers decided, this year, to provide budget support direct to local municipal governments. DFID is also providing &#163;1.5&nbsp;million of additional technical assistance over three years to help strengthen the transparent auditing of municipal institutions. I hope that that commitment to transparency in audit goes some way to addressing the concerns about the public accounts.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para29"><a name="stpa_315">DFID, the FCO and the Ministry of Defence have worked closely on emergency preparedness action in the region. As a result, HMS Cumberland stood ready to provide humanitarian relief in the wake of hurricane Beta, which hit the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on 30 October. President Bolanos of Nicaragua and the United Nations were grateful to the Government for this offer. I understand that HMS Cumberland went on to seize two tonnes of cocaine in international waters about 100 miles off Nicaragua, for which we should all feel rightly proud.


</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para30"><a name="stpa_316">The hon. Gentleman also raised specific concerns about the Atlantic coast region of Nicaragua. Since taking over responsibility for Nicaragua, the ambassador in San Jose has paid four visits to the Atlantic coast region and has made a point of raising a number of the concerns with the Nicaraguan authorities in Managua, reinforcing the message of the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas), who visited that region in March 2004. DFID&#039;s work to improve the auditing mechanisms of Nicaragua&#039;s central and local government expenditure should enable it to identify better in future the extent to which the national budget has benefited the Atlantic coast. DFID is also funding a countrywide programme to help local government and NGOs to provide basic care for people living with HIV/AIDS, again including those on the Atlantic coast. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s generous acknowledgment of the work that DFID is doing in that regard.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 141WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para31"><a name="stpa_317">DFID has also been supporting the United Nations Development Programme&#039;s 2005 national census in the coastal region. The census now covers a wider area and takes better account of local ethnic sensitivities. It has also helped the Government to identify more clearly the areas of poverty on that coast, it has increased their awareness of communities not previously registered and it has highlighted weaknesses in the electoral register in the coastal region.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para32"><a name="stpa_318">Two weeks ago, with the assistance of <i>La Prensa</i>, the biggest Nicaraguan daily newspaper, the embassy launched a book of short stories about life on the Atlantic coast, written by children from Bluefields and Pearl Lagoon. It is hoped that this initiative will help raise awareness of the region and boost pride and self-esteem in the community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para33"><a name="stpa_319">The hon. Gentleman also touched on and expressed concern about the level of our commercial resources in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. UK Trade and Investment offers support both to companies in the UK trading internationally and to overseas companies seeking to locate in the UK. As some hon. Members will be aware, UKTI&#039;s 2004 spending review settlement included a &#163;20&nbsp;million cost reduction in its global overseas network. Following that decision, a fundamental review of the network was carried out to identify and prioritise business needs. Although it can no longer offer the full range of market services in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, UKTI is focusing its commercial resources on responding to the needs of UK businesses. The level of commercial staffing at the British embassy in Costa Rica reflects this demand, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will continue to monitor it carefully.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para34"><a name="stpa_320">The hon. Gentleman also referred to the internal political situation in Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
</p>






<p><a name="st_117"><a name="51109h04_spnew1"><b> Norman Baker </b> : I, for one, very much regret the cuts that have been made, because I believe they are self-defeating. Does the Minister agree that it would be sensible to have a cost-benefit analysis carried out to discover whether any increase in posts in these countries, and perhaps more widely, might pay for itself in terms of benefit to the British economy?
</p>






<p><a name="st_118"><a name="51109h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alexander </b> : I assure the hon. Gentleman that, as part of the spending review process, careful consideration was given to the relative return, on the basis of the commitment of resource to UKTI, and to a need for UKTI to be a customer-led organisation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para35"><a name="stpa_321">An important dialogue is not simply a dialogue with the country post where historically, on the basis of legacy, there has been representation, but a candid and clear conversation with organisations such as the CBI as to where they wish resources to be deployed. Frankly, given the changing nature of the international business environment, a measure of the effectiveness of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 142WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
UKTI, albeit inevitably involving difficult decisions, is that periodically there are reviews of the relative resource allocations. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, within UKTI and in UKTI&#039;s discussions with the Treasury, careful consideration is given to the impact that UKTI staff in post can have both in securing inward investment into the United Kingdom and in promoting British exports within those markets. We will keep that matter under review, not just in terms of our own judgments in these situations, but also by careful and sustained dialogue with organisations such as the CBI.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para36"><a name="stpa_322">In the time available, let me return to the internal political situation in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. President Pacheco is committed to the fight against corruption and is working to reduce poverty in Costa Rica. We support Costa Rica&#039;s commitment to arms control and non-proliferation. We will work with the Costa Rican Government and other supportive countries in the region to establish an arms trade treaty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para37"><a name="stpa_323">We encourage the Costa Rican Government to continue its proactive environmental policies, protection of biodiversity and the innovative ways of combating and even reversing deforestation within its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borders. The provision of over 90 per cent. of Costa Rica&#039;s energy needs from renewable, often hydroelectric, sources, as the hon. Gentleman identified, is also admirable. I hope that there will be opportunities for other countries to learn from the experience garnered from the initiatives being taken within Costa Rica.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para38"><a name="stpa_324">We hope to continue to enjoy the good relationship that the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to acknowledge with whatever Government the people of Costa Rica choose next year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para39"><a name="stpa_325">In Nicaragua, political stability is a prerequisite for the economic development and greater social cohesion needed to combat the poverty and inequality that have afflicted that country for too long. We welcome the recent developments that have helped reduce tension between the executive and legislative branches of government in Nicaragua, and also the progress on financial and other reforms, which are essential to unlock the IMF programme and release funds from international donors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h04_para40"><a name="stpa_326">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s resources are inevitably stretched in many areas. He generously recognised that reality at the outset of his remarks. We cannot, therefore, answer every demand placed upon us. The Government need to be ready to shift resources where they best meet our international priorities. I hope that, on the basis of my remarks, the hon. Gentleman is convinced that the important process of prioritisation categorically does not mean the abandonment of central America or any individual country therein. Careful prioritisation and hard decisions are required. On that basis we continue to make policy.

<a name="51109h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Regeneration (North Staffordshire)</h3>

<a name="time_19">
<a name="51109h05_time0"><h5>4.28 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_119"><a name="51109h05_spnew0"><b> Paul Farrelly  (Newcastle-under-Lyme)</b>  (Lab): I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister&#151;he is a friend&#151;for taking the time to come, listen and respond to the short debate about regeneration in north Staffordshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para0"><a name="stpa_327">Despite the title, I do not want to be parochial. I hope that the issues raised have relevance elsewhere. The reason for requesting the debate now is that the next phase of the revision process of the regional spatial strategy by the West Midlands regional assembly was launched on Monday.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para1"><a name="stpa_328">One would be forgiven for nodding off at this point, because most people have no idea that regional assemblies exist, let alone do anything. The tiny few in my area who have even heard of the assembly think of it as yet another committee, inconveniently situated in Birmingham and remote in more senses than one. That overlooks one point of great significance, namely the assembly&#039;s role in producing the regional development plan and in holding the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, to account for our region&#039;s economic development strategy. These documents are crucial. If we do not influence them, in planning terms they can simply override every policy that we strive to produce locally, as the Minister well knows.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para2"><a name="stpa_329">The regional development agencies were set up in 1999. I became an MP not long afterwards, in 2001. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my area, it is fair to say that regeneration has proceeded in fits and starts, and&#151;more often than not&#151;false starts. The history of regeneration in north Staffordshire can be told through the sheaves of consultants&#039; reports that are stacked in our offices. We have certainly been good at regenerating the consultancy industry although, sadly, none of that is indigenous to north Staffordshire. As my borough&#039;s latest draft development plan points out politely, north Staffordshire has seen many strategies come and go over the past several years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para3"><a name="stpa_330">The difference now is that, because of the Government&#039;s commitment, we finally have serious money to spend in north Staffordshire. Our regeneration zone is up and running, and the housing market renewal pathfinder is already starting to make a real difference to the future of our area. Two very good people have been recruited to drive the process forward locally&#151;Aktar Choudhury, the director of the regeneration zone, and Hardial Boghul, the head of Renew, the housing market pathfinder. Our job as Members of Parliament is not only to support them and to make sure that the money is spent, but to make sure that public money is well spent for the future of north Staffordshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para4"><a name="stpa_331">My area has been hit hard by the triple whammy of massive job losses in the coal, steel and pottery industries. It has cried out for investment to create jobs. Above all, however, to break out of the vicious circle of low aspirations, poor educational achievement, low skills and low pay, we require people with a vision, imagination and a commitment to bring in a mix of jobs and skills to our area. Sadly, during the summer, after what seemed ages of privately urging officials to consider the quality of jobs as well as quantity, I had to criticise publicly the direction that much of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Nov 2005 : Column 144WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
economic regeneration has taken to date. If the Minister were to drive through Stoke-on-Trent and my constituency, Newcastle-under-Lyme, one thing might strike him most of all: the proliferation of huge warehouses and massive distribution sheds in garish green and grey. They have certainly brought many jobs to the area, but many of them are low-skilled, low-paid, picking and packing, humping and heaving so-called logistics jobs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para5"><a name="stpa_332">Of course, we have had great successes, one of which is the development of Keele university science park in Newcastle-under-Lyme. I hope that, together with English Partnerships, the development at Silverdale colliery, the last mine to close in our area, will be another. So it is certainly not all doom and gloom, and I want to set the right tone. My criticism is that north Staffordshire is becoming dominated by sheds and warehouses. The failure of imagination simply replicates the same old formula of targeting distribution companies. Public money is used to prepare the sites and therefore subsidises what many people consider to be a blight.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para6"><a name="stpa_333">In a nutshell, my criticism is of the approach to regeneration by regional and county agencies. All too often, that seems to be a box-ticking exercise, which involves the number of jobs that are created, the number of hectares of brownfield land that are regenerated, the number of unsophisticated targets that are met and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of crude outputs that are fulfilled, never mind the quality. I stress that it is not my intention to criticise individuals. Everyone in regeneration in my area works extremely hard. However, if we are not careful, the system can lead to lowest common denominator outcomes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para7"><a name="stpa_334">I might be accused fairly of being the loudest, but I am certainly not the only person in north Staffordshire to voice such concerns. During the summer, the planning committee in Newcastle-under-Lyme also decided to say, &quot;Enough is enough&quot;. It turned down the latest warehouse to be foisted on the borough, which was another 280,000 sq ft monstrosity. For the committee, it was a shed too far. Elsewhere at Trentham lakes in Stoke-on-Trent, the site of another former colliery, InStaffs (UK) Ltd., the county&#039;s inward investment agency, and the North Staffordshire chamber of commerce joined MPs and councillors to voice concerns over yet another 400,000 sq ft warehouse. All that is happening on precious, developable land&#151;a scarce resource and one that will rapidly run out.

<p>
<a name="51109h05_para8"><a name="stpa_335">This year, the regeneration zone commissioned a new integrated economic development strategy for the north Staffordshire conurbation. It explicitly recognised such concerns and stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;There is a need to move beyond the low density, low value nature of current logistics operations if the economy in North Staffordshire is to develop.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para9"><a name="stpa_336">That work was funded, through the regeneration zone, by the regional development agency and Renew. It has been adopted by Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stoke-on-Trent and the other local partners. Yet, it is not being followed through in practice, as plans proceed for shed after shed after shed at Trentham lakes in Stoke and at Chatterley valley to the north of my constituency, in particular. It seems that we are being used&#151;in the words of a highly respected figure at the North Staffordshire chamber of commerce&#151;as a &quot;dumping ground&quot; for distribution in the west midlands.

<a name="51109h05_para10"><a name="stpa_337">With regard to the shed that we refused in Newcastle, Staffordshire county council is the public sector partner. At Chatterley valley, it is the county again and Advantage West Midlands. At Trentham lakes, it is AWM and English Partnerships who are pursuing separate coalfields projects outwith the regeneration zone programme. There we have it: the regeneration zone sets the strategy, the regional development agency funds it, then all the outside agencies simply ignore it. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the Minister agrees that that is hardly joined-up thinking; it certainly is not joined-up regeneration. I shall certainly raise these issues at a meeting with English Partnerships. I have already done so with AWM.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para11"><a name="stpa_338">This is where the regional spatial strategy comes in. In the last plan, which was adopted in June last year, north Staffordshire is cited as a possible site for a regional logistics site. People scratch their heads and think, &quot;Yet more of these sheds.&quot; I stress, however, the word used was &quot;possible&quot;. Now, with the revision, we have the chance to stand our ground. That process, which was launched on Monday, seeks among other things to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;re-examine regional and sub-regional employment land needs and requirements&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para12"><a name="stpa_339">We have until 31 December to give our views. I understand that local authorities in north Staffordshire have already told consultants who are preparing a logistics survey that we do not wish to be singled out for a regional logistics site, thank you very much.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para13"><a name="stpa_340">The response from our RDA has hardly been sympathetic. In a recent letter to me, it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;Advantage West Midlands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. does believe it is necessary to adhere to the aspirations of the sub-region, but also to align that with the regional strategy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para14"><a name="stpa_341">It goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;The Regional Spatial Strategy for the West Midlands is still being progressed but current work suggests that North Staffs will be identified as a Regional Logistics location&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para15"><a name="stpa_342">All that is before the consultation has even started. One can hear the hackles being raised. As so often with our RDA, we simply do not know, locally, whether we are dealing with friend or foe.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para16"><a name="stpa_343">Will the Minister join me in calling for joined-up thinking? Is it not time that the regional strategy was updated to align with the local strategies that the RDA paid a small fortune to produce? Will the Minister ensure, through the Government office for the west

midlands, that meaningful consultation will take place on the revision of the spatial strategy, and that voices throughout the region will be listened to, not just a few decision makers based in Birmingham?

<p>
<a name="51109h05_para17"><a name="stpa_344">Before I conclude, I shall raise another often-neglected issue that is key to regeneration, be it economic or social: the importance of good design. I have the privilege of being the patron of Urban Vision North Staffordshire, the architecture and urban design centre that grew, three years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago, out of a small group of committed people&#039;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determination that our area and the core of Stoke-on-Trent should enjoy a renaissance like that in cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. The project was generously supported from the start by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and, crucially, has also been funded by our regeneration zone.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para18"><a name="stpa_345">Urban Vision is charged with promoting good urban design in our area and has established a design review panel that advises on major planning applications, which is chaired by an architect of national renown. It is adding to regeneration capacity by acting as a source of expertise, which is often sadly lacking these days in local authorities. We are often criticised by our RDA for our lack of capacity on the ground.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51109h05_para19"><a name="stpa_346">The story, or even struggle, of Urban Vision, is an example in microcosm of how difficult organisations find it to deal with the regeneration process. On 23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December 2003, Advantage West Midlands offered Urban Vision funding through the regeneration zone for three years, for which we were, of course, very grateful. Sadly, it was 11 months later, on 11 November 2004, that AWM finally delivered the signed contract, which allowed money to be drawn down to pay Urban Vision&#039;s staff. That slowness off the blocks meant that all of the money for 2003&#150;04&#151;
