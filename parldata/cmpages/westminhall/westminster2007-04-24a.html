 I am very pleased to have secured this debate. The category &#147;community media&#148; includes community television, radio and internet and is an area of growing interest across the country. It is not yet as well known as it should be, but my view is that it will soon have an impact far beyond its current recognition. I feel privileged to present not only my views but those of the 147 MPs who have signed early-day motion 922, which calls for additional and secure funding for community media and for space to be reserved for community media on the digital spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000011">Community media organisations include community radio, television, the internet, informing, communicating and enabling technologies and digital media projects throughout the UK, and they represent the complexity and diversity of society. They are not-for-profit organisations run by local people, mostly volunteers, with a remit to unlock the enthusiasm and potential of individuals to create positive social change. They foster employability, especially among people facing disadvantage and social exclusion, and enhance the diversity of cultural and creative expression and personal self-confidence.</p>

 My hon. Friend has raised the important issue of minority communities and the need for diversity. Shalom FM is a Jewish radio station that has only ever been able to secure restricted service licences, having been turned down for a permanent licence. Hopefully, it will try again later this year, if and when Ofcom gets round to inviting further bids. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that all the significant minorities in London and elsewhere have their own dedicated radio station?</p>

 I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. The all-party community media group will be campaigning on those issues, and I am sure that the Minister, who has ears to hear, will act in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000014">As my hon. Friend has pointed out, community media are particularly effective in engaging and serving some of the most disadvantaged groups in our society. It provides a voice for many people who are disengaged and excluded from traditional media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000015">Community media projects are a key economic growth area in the creative industries sector.

television stations around the UK, and there are many more groups with aspirations to become truly local community radio and television providers.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="07042430000016"><a name="70424h0001.htm_spnew3"><a name="07042430000497"><b>David Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 My hon. Friend has referred to the licensing of 122 radio stations. Ofcom has had two licensing rounds&#151;one in 2004, and another in 2006, I believe. Does my hon. Friend agree that the licensing round has become a rather difficult hurdle race for many small, would-be community radio stations, which might be low-power AM stations or some other type of station at the moment? Would it not be simpler to focus on their ability to provide a service for a one-year period, and ensure that the cited community benefits are likely to be delivered? At the moment it is difficult for groups to make a successful application.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="07042430000017"><a name="70424h0001.htm_spnew4"><a name="07042430000498"><b>Ian Stewart:</b>
 I agree with my hon. Friend. In my area of Salford, we have been successful in gaining a licence this year. Even there, however, the process was costly. I am sure that the Minister will take that on board as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000018">The wider community media sector has more than 2,000 organisations, which use a variety of platforms for broadcasting, all with one aim&#151;to give a voice to local people. They provide training, volunteering and employment opportunities for people in the community in general and digital media literacy, media production skills and basic information and communications technology skills. They also act as a platform for arts innovation, for community debate, and for communication with local and national government, thereby increasing social cohesion and community involvement in the democratic process and in citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000019">The strength of community media lies in their participatory approach, whereby local people are involved in the operation of all aspects of the organisation. Community media projects have a track record of attracting large numbers of people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities as participants, volunteers and trainees. A good example of a community media project in action is Radio Regen, a community radio development charity based in Manchester, which has an average of 240 volunteers together with 1,000 beneficiaries, and which delivers accredited training to 200 people every year. I place on the record my thanks to Phil Korbel and Radio Regen for their help in running the community radio pilots in my city of Salford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000020">That initial work has now been built upon by the chair, Councillor Jim King, and his board of directors, who have gained a broadcasting licence and established Salford community radio, which will be up and running in the city in the near future. That could not have happened without the support of Salford city council, so I must thank the council, too, for its recognition that Salford community radio is part of the bright new future connected with the Salford MediaCity concept.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000021">Another example of success is the women&#146;s radio group in London, which typically works with more than 100 women a year, providing training for women from minority ethnic groups in disadvantaged communities in the development and production of radio programmes. The group has reported improved levels of engagement in learning for women of all ages, and it has improved skills in communication and media production and raised confidence levels.</p>

 If the hon. Gentleman will permit, I shall throw in an example from Essex, where John Brennan runs a community radio project for the elderly. He received, I think, either an OBE or an MBE for his services over many years, and he provides an excellent service. However, the service needs to be made available to a wider audience. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we must ensure that the sources of charitable funds continue to flow from the lottery and elsewhere, so that we can first establish and then extend the organisations that provide community radio to vulnerable groups, such as the elderly people? Community radio improves the quality of life of such people.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="07042430000023"><a name="70424h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="07042430000500"><b>Ian Stewart:</b>
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, and the thrust of my speech is about securing sustainable and adequate funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000024">Community media also aim to develop social capital by building social networks, facilitating understanding and promoting shared norms in communities that are sometimes divided. For example, Bradford community broadcasting has made a major contribution in developing a sense of belonging and community cohesion for all groups in the city, particularly since the riots in 2001.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000025">From the outside, people consider that community media organisations are just about broadcasting, but that is not necessarily the case. According to Cape Town&#146;s Zain Ibrahim, a world-renowned ambassador for community media:</p>
<a name="70424h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="07042430000458"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Community media is ten per cent. media and ninety per cent. community&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000026">The 90 per cent. is all about engaging and empowering local people, encouraging volunteering and giving an outlet for people&#146;s aspirations through voice, local engagement and providing innovative training and employment opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000027">The sector has an effective and experienced umbrella body, which is affiliated to the more generic national voluntary sector organisations. The Community Media Association is the recognised representative body for the community media sector in the UK, and it promotes access to the media for people and communities. It aims to enable people to establish and develop community-based media&#151;community radio, television, internet and mobile media&#151;for empowerment, cultural expression, information and entertainment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000028">With full-time community radio stations on air since 2002, along with the many other community media projects, there is now a considerable body of evidence about the benefits that the sector brings to the UK. In summary, it benefits the individual with skills and well-being, the community through effective information dissemination and community pride, and mainstream agencies by greatly boosting the impact of their engagement with the public. In more detail, individuals gain through the acquisition of media literacy and production skills, which are a vital element in decreasing the digital divide as they become more central to everyday life with the rise and rise of personal user-generated content.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000029">Community media provide more than that, however. They deliver community benefit, assisting people to work together and to become more actively involved with one another. Participants in community media gain a raft of transferable workplace skills, such as  <br>

creativity, problem solving, team working, production skills, self-presentation, social and communication skills, and of course computer skills. It is no surprise that basic literacy and numeracy are also boosted through involvement in community media. Under that heading, there is one thing that perhaps matters most of all in terms of moving people on in a positive manner&#151;the injection or fostering of self-esteem.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is being extremely generous in taking interventions and is making an important speech. Does he agree that there is yet another way in which community radio can assist not only minority groups in the community, but the wider community? It can engender political engagement, which we need to do as a Parliament and as a country, by running campaigns such as &#147;Knives or lives&#148; and getting people involved in politics and campaigning in their local area in a way that matters and that makes a difference.</p>

 I agree, but it is also important to identify that before the engagement that the hon. Gentleman talks about, community media can help to improve political understanding, so that the engagement is based on better understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000032">Fostering self-esteem is so important. It is the simple matter of someone getting that glow of pride when they know that their programme has made it to air. Indeed, many organisations in the sector know that the foundation of their success is summed up by the phrase, &#147;That&#146;s me on air, that is.&#148; We hear that throughout the country from our constituents who were involved in the pilots in the past and who are now involved in the stations that are being established.</p>

 My hon. Friend has been most generous in taking interventions. Would he commend the objectives of radio stations such as Takeover Radio in the city of Leicester near my constituency, whose focus is on young people in every sense? Its successes certainly include the two points raised in the debate&#151;political engagement and self-esteem.</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="07042430000034"><a name="70424h0001.htm_spnew10"><a name="07042430000504"><b>Ian Stewart:</b>
 I acknowledge that. Those issues are fundamental to the development of community media as a vehicle for our constituents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000035">The community benefits from community media partly because community media reach the parts that other media cannot. Their use of peer-to-peer communication means that the audience see or hear someone like them&#151;someone who looks like them and, it is hoped, shares their concerns. That prevents the awful barrier between the media elite and the rest of us, an effect amplified when local accents and non-English mother tongues are used.</p>

 My hon. Friend has made an important point about non-English mother tongues. In that context, may I raise London Greek Radio? It broadcasts sometimes in English and sometimes in Greek, which not only means that those who do not speak English can understand what is going on, but helps to maintain tradition and culture for the second and third generations, who may not otherwise be able to maintain the language. For a Greek speaker such as myself, it helps me to keep my ear in.</p>

 As a bilingual Scot, I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s point. That point, made on behalf of the Greek community, can be made on behalf of every other ethnic community throughout the country, and it is not only a matter of those ethnic groups benefiting from community media. As has been pointed out, those of us who come from different ethnic groups also benefit. That is very important and leads me to my next point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000038">The community also benefits because in most cases community media do not follow a mainstream bad news agenda. People are as likely to hear about a parent and toddler group as they are about the latest drugs bust or antisocial behaviour order breach on a local estate. That helps to erode unbalanced, negative media images of an area and so boost community pride.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000039">Mainstream agencies benefit through partnership with community media because all of a sudden they are working with a trusted intermediary and not as a bunch of faceless bureaucrats. Community media are increasingly used as the face of community engagement by local councils, primary care trusts, police forces and social housing providers, which is my personal key area of interest in Salford. The fact that those projects are repeated throughout the country is testimony to their obvious effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000040">Let us not forget that those multiple impacts are not simply about doing the right thing; they are about the well-being of our citizens and the economic performance of UK plc. Let us take as an example the social exclusion of young people, an area in which community media are a proven success. The recent report from the Prince&#146;s Trust, &#147;The Cost of Exclusion&#148;, states that that phenomenon costs the nation &#163;10 million a day in lost productivity and &#163;1 billion a year in costs associated with crime&#151;do not tell me that I sound like my right hon.

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000041">I shall now deal with the work of mainstream agencies in order to assess the impact of community media on the Government&#146;s own public service agreement targets, the means by which the success of all Departments is measured. Astoundingly, there is hardly a Department whose PSA outcomes are not or could not be boosted by the use of community media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000042">Let us take one reported example. Disaffected pupils at Cedar Mount high school in east Manchester, in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman), took part in a brief community radio project organised by the local charity Radio Regen. The result? All six boys&#146; attendance shot up, as did their grades, thus meeting the Department for Education and Skills target of raising grades and improving school attendance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000043">I do not have time to give examples for the following PSA targets, but all of them are being tackled by community media: for the Department of Health, health promotion, tackling health inequalities and growing public and patient involvement; for the Department of Communities and Local Government, tackling social exclusion and delivering neighbourhood renewal; for the Home Office, reassuring the public, reducing fear of crime and building confidence in the criminal justice system; for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, helping to educate the public to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackling rural decline; for  <br>

the Department of Trade and Industry, boosting enterprise in disadvantaged communities; for the Department for Work and Pensions, increasing the employment rate; and, for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, increasing the number of people who participate in arts activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000044">I could go on, but the point that I am making is clear. Let us consider, for example, the local PSA for Manchester. Community radio in that city is directly working on eight of its 13 PSA targets. There are, however, tangible threats to the further growth and development of the community media sector. The first may be deemed technical. Community media are well able intellectually to keep pace with the rapidly changing technological world. Indeed, many organisations already work across different media, not solely through traditional broadcasting platforms. However, access for community media projects to valuable spectrum is under threat.</p>
<a name="07042430000455">
<p>On the television front, I understand that the Government&#146;s preferred view is that any spectrum released following digital switchover should be auctioned on a technologically neutral, free market basis. Such an approach would absolutely preclude community media and other citizen-based interests from accessing this valuable public resource. Without proper safeguards, it will strangle the development of local television at birth. Such safeguards include, for example, reserving spectrum for public and citizen uses and requiring spectrum bidders to ensure that there is a percentage of free access for community media projects&#151;the so-called must-carry provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="70424h0001.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000045">The Minister is on record as saying that such issues are a matter for Ofcom, as the regulator, and not for the Government, but Ofcom makes recommendations to the Government only on the use of the digital dividend. It will therefore be for the Government to choose whether to have another free-for-all spectrum sale. Although such a step might bring much needed moneys to the Treasury, it must adequately ensure that public benefit is preserved.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and promise that this will be my last intervention. One threat to community radio is radio piracy. In London, about 40 pirate radio stations are on FM at any one time, blocking many community stations. Will my hon. Friend discuss that at some stage? Does he agree that the problem will have to be addressed if we are to promote community radio effectively?</p>

 I will not be covering that aspect in my contribution, but Ofcom is coming to the next meeting of the all-party group on community media, and the issue is on the agenda. I am sure that my hon. Friend will be happy to attend that meeting and make a contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para0"><a name="07042430000053">Despite the barriers faced by the sector, however, I stress that the solutions are available and achievable. They lie in bandwidth, recognition and funding. I propose that the DCMS and Ofcom put community media on a par with that other public service broadcaster, the BBC, and follow the line of the must-carry provision as the media hurtle onward from analogue to digital transmission. Auctions, market forces and light-touch regulation simply will not do when the interests of the millions of beneficiaries of community media are under consideration. There can be a digital dividend for community media, if bandwidth is reserved for community media groups. We should not be dependent on the whims of media corporations or slithers of frequency that are deemed not to be commercially viable. Community media is too economically and culturally valuable simply to be left to feed off scraps from the media table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000054">The same formula applies equally to television and radio. Ofcom&#146;s recent digital dividend review appears to have a free market imperative, which could kill off most community media if followed through. The all-party group is pleased that Ofcom has agreed to come to its next meeting on 15 May, when we will be able to discuss this and other matters. Ofcom is being rather more cautious in its proposals for radio, which were contained in last week&#146;s report, &#147;The Future of Radio&#148;, but, again, we must seek reassurance that the 122 community  <br>

media stations licensed so far&#151;the number is rising&#151;will not be snuffed out in the rush to regulate with a light touch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000055">Community media is a curious beast&#151;it is both media and community. The media part is the one that is instantly recognisable, like the tip of an iceberg, but most would say that the community impacts are far more significant. As part of the media, it is only right that community media should be under the watchful and able eye of the DCMS, and I congratulate the Department on its excellent work with the sector thus far. However, the DCMS is the smallest of all Departments, and as well as having a small budget, it has the small matter of the Olympics to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000056">As I have mentioned, the impact of community media is felt across the work of all domestic Departments, but they do not seem to recognise its value. Anecdotal evidence suggests that community media are like a ball that is for ever passed around Whitehall, and there is a marked reluctance in some quarters to take a share of the responsibility for this valuable national asset. I therefore recommend launching a programme of interdepartmental education on community media with some degree of urgency. I also recommend establishing a departmental, cross-cutting committee, led by a DCMS Minister, with the Prime Minister&#146;s authority to implement its policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000057">The last solution, funding, might sound obvious. Funding affects the vast majority of organisations in the voluntary sector, but the relative newness of the community media sector and the recognition factor combine to form a particular barrier. I applaud the fact that there is a community radio fund, but the fact that it is 12 times less than the reported and no doubt well-deserved annual fee of Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles is not the resounding vote of confidence that the sector so richly deserves.</p>
<a name="07042430000456">
<p>I am asking not for subsidy for community media, but for it to get the resources that it needs&#151;if necessary on a cross-departmental, pooled basis&#151;from the range of mainstream agencies for which it delivers services. For example, the Home Office could release a sum for community media to boost community understanding of the criminal justice system. Similarly, the Department for Education and Skills could provide funds for a national scheme to engage non-attending pupils, while the Department for Communities and Local Government could release a sum for projects aimed at neighbourhood renewal. I am pleading not for handouts, but for a heads-up for an extraordinary investment opportunity&#151;for an investment in the quality of life and prosperity of some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country.</p>

 Community broadcasting is often seen as a poor relation in the world of television and radio, but it is one area of communications of which we should all be more aware and which we should encourage to grow.

watching, or who will read the report of our proceedings, know that their parliamentarians are aware of this important dimension of the media, which is thriving in many communities up and down the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000059">I should like to go into some detail about what is happening in one such community&#151;South Queensferry&#151;in my constituency. Before I do, however, I should like to put on the record the background to the issue, which resulted in my own awareness of the importance of community involvement in radio and television production.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000060">Some years ago I was fortunate enough to attend Telford college in the constituency of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)&#151;although at that time it was in my constituency&#151;to study radio and video production. After that I spent two summers at Cornell university in New York state, developing that work. The lessons that I learned then have stuck with me to this day, in two different ways. First, I saw how even in the developing world, where access to conventional media was very restricted, people could change their lives and tackle the problems of the community in a way that would provide hope to many who had given up, whether that was through dealing with social problems or alcoholism, educating people to improve their health, or tackling political injustices. Secondly, I experienced at first hand how, with access to community broadcasting and the skills that facilitate good production values, important messages could be spread to the wider community and to those with the power to make decisions affecting the lives of those involved. Real change could result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000061">I was involved through such work with the homeless, and a shelter that was set for closure because of lack of funding. When the people in the shelter were asked what they would do if they were given the tools to enable them to communicate with the authorities and others who knew nothing of the homeless, they agreed that they wanted to tell those in power how important the shelter was to the many young people who would otherwise end up on the street, where they would be at risk of violence or worse, where girls would be more likely to move into prostitution, and where there was the attraction of dealing in drugs to make money. Their story was told and the shelter stayed open, and that was possibly the best example I have ever seen of involvement in community radio and television.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000062">Nearer to my home in my constituency, much is going on in Queensferry. South Queensferry in Edinburgh, West is home to two local community broadcast services: Jubilee FM Radio and Jubilee FM Television. Jubilee FM Radio was established in 2001 and currently has a bid with Ofcom to operate a full-time service in North Queensferry and South Queensferry and in nearby towns and villages. Jubilee FM Radio was launched initially to promote and celebrate the Ferry Fair festival, the oldest continuing civic gala in the UK. The station was an instant hit and has grown in popularity over the years. It has become a fixed part of the community and has a strong brand for entertainment and information. When it is not broadcasting, the station delivers live commentary and entertainment at a range of events in the town. It is now in its sixth year and has developed a partnership with the community high school in South Queensferry. It is a unique development and was the idea of one of the sixth-year students, Scott Findlater. He had been  <br>

one of the volunteer presenters on Jubilee FM the previous summer and suggested that it would be great to have radio at school. A week later the head teacher, Robert Birch, and the station manager, Charles Fletcher, met and began the process of bringing the community radio station into the high school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000063">If Jubilee FM Radio is awarded a full community licence by Ofcom&#151;something I fully support&#151;it will, I believe, become the first radio station in the UK to broadcast full-time on FM from a school. To put it another way, Queensferry high school will become the first school in Britain to have its own FM radio station broadcasting to its local community. The school has been awarded school of ambition status, and hosting the community radio station is a key element of that programme. Having the station at the school offers students the opportunity to learn first-hand how to make programmes. They will have workshops in presenting, producing, recording, editing and technical skills, and they will have the opportunity to go on air and present and produce their own programmes, once they have been trained. Jubilee FM and Queensferry high school are making a major investment in the students&#146; media skills and education, and the community radio station gets direct access to a sea of talented youngsters, who have already shown that they are willing and ready to learn how to make radio. Having the community radio station at the high school will also offer opportunities to senior students to use radio production as part of their subject work. Instead of writing an essay in English, they could submit a documentary; or they could record a series of interviews with people in the community to create an oral history programme and submit that as part of their course work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000064">Queensferry high school is also the home to Jubilee FM TV, which was established in December last year. Students who worked on the radio in the summer were given training in television production skills: how to use a camera and then edit pictures. That project has created a series of news, documentary and entertainment programmes posted online at the Jubilee FM TV website. In January, on new year&#146;s day, Jubilee FM TV did a live worldwide broadcast of the annual Loony Dook, when people&#151;including Margaret Smith, the Member of the Scottish Parliament for Edinburgh West&#151;waded into the River Forth to raise large sums of money for charity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000065">Jubilee FM TV&#151;community television for Queensferry&#151;offers groups and bodies in the community an opportunity to upload videos of their activities for the rest of the community to access freely. Like community radio, community television needs money to operate, and there frankly is not enough money set aside by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, or Government generally, to help fund local broadcasting. Local broadcasting is a vital link in the community&#151;arguably more now than before, as local and regional radio and television stations are merging into large unitary bodies. There is less requirement on the ITV companies to provide local news and programmes, and some local radio stations have cut their commitment to and output of locally generated news and information. That means that people are more and more reliant on community broadcasting for their local news and information. Services such as Jubilee FM in Queensferry have a key role to play in the community and should be able to rely on more support from Government than they currently get.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000066">A number of possible funding sources must be considered, including looking again at the dispersal of the television licence fee. At the moment, all the income generated from the licence fee goes to the BBC, but is not community broadcasting a public service? I believe that it performs a vital public service. It is not only the BBC that engages in public service broadcasting. Community radio in particular needs serious financial support to help it survive, let alone develop. The BBC is experimenting with a series of localised services. Might it not be better, instead of extending the BBC&#146;s reach into more localised services, to consider channelling the money needed to deliver those services into community radio stations? It is also worthwhile to seek to divert some funding out of the Ofcom digital dividend into the community broadcasters; but I would not rule out top-slicing some of the licence fee as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000067">Ofcom manages the community radio fund&#151;an opportunity for stations that have community radio licences to apply for some financial support to help to pay for positions on the station such as the station manager, a fundraiser or a technician. The DCMS has confirmed that the total community radio fund for the year 2006-07 will be &#163;830,000. The average station grant in 2005-06 was about &#163;23,000 and the average grant in the last round was about &#163;15,000. Community radio stations are generally staffed by volunteers, with a handful of paid positions. They try to generate an income from advertising, programme sponsorship and grants from local government and the lottery. It is a hand-to-mouth existence for many of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000068">Additionally, broadcasting legislation has put a fundraising restriction on community radio stations by insisting that they can only generate 50 per cent. of their income from advertising and sponsorship. The other 50 per cent. must come from grants and donations. That is a restrictive practice which means that community stations could be turning advertisers away, because they have reached their 50 per cent. sales income threshold. I understand that the ruling is intended to help protect some of the heritage stations from other services that might eat into their advertising market, but perhaps the 50 per cent. barrier is unrealistic and should be adjusted to help those stations generate more sales income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000069">One new community licence holder, in the Shetland Islands, has written to Ofcom to seek a change in its status to a full service commercial licence because it is confident that it can raise 100 per cent. funding through sales of programmes and advertising spots; it is equally convinced that it cannot raise 50 per cent. of its income through grants and the lottery. If it is successful in its bid for a change in status, it could set a precedent that other community stations would be ready to follow. Services such as Jubilee FM Radio and TV in Queensferry open a unique window on a community. They help to give access to debate and exchange of views on local and national issues that are not found anywhere else in the media world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000070">Community stations also serve a further purpose&#151;training the broadcasters of the future. Stations such as Jubilee FM train all their volunteers in production, presentation and diction. People who have had the break there are turning up on the doorstep of radio and television stations ready trained. No one knows their  <br>

community better than the people who live and work in it; and it is usually such people who deliver community broadcasting.

 I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) for securing the debate and therefore allowing us to spend some time on an issue that resonates through many communities and constituencies in different parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000072">In my constituency and, I am sure, those of many hon. Members, there is a growing interest in local community media of all sorts. Community radio has been mentioned and I shall discuss community television in some detail, but there are also community websites and a whole range of community newspapers, news sheets and outlets of all types. They reflect the explosion of local community life up and down the country and, perhaps, show that at a time when big media corporations dominate much of the media, people want to see other coverage and news, and want the opportunity to debate local issues in a forum that they feel is part of their lives and community and over which they have some say and influence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000073">In my constituency, we have a local community radio station, Leith FM, which was recently awarded a full-time community radio licence. It has operated for several years on an occasional basis and has played an important role in the local community. Like the community radio station that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) discussed, Leith FM was initially concentrated very much around a festival&#151;the successful Leith festival&#151;and the community radio station developed out of that. There are now plans to involve a wide range of organisations in the community with the station, which is expected to start regular broadcasts shortly. It will provide a range of programmes to cater for all sections of the community, and I am sure that it will proceed from its current, strong foundation to a wider audience within the communities of Leith and north Edinburgh, where its programmes should also be received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000074">The hon. Gentleman has told us that the experiences at Leith FM might be replicated in his constituency, and my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles described very well how they have been replicated up and down the country. As he said, such experiences should be encouraged and made a reality for communities throughout the country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) made clear in his interventions, community media should reflect the diversity of communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000075">Although that welcome flourishing of life in our communities happens spontaneously in many ways, it also needs to be encouraged. It needs the right regulatory framework to allow further development, as it is an important aspect of community life. Some key decisions to be taken in the very near future will either do a lot to encourage the development of community media, or, if the wrong decisions are taken, will undermine the  <br>

flourishing of community media and set back its development in this country. I therefore take this opportunity to encourage the Minister and the Government to take the right decisions and encourage community media in the way that hon. Members have suggested in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000076">My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West spoke mainly about community radio, which I shall say something about later if there is time. I want to talk about community TV, which still has not really taken off in this country. Yes, we have a few community TV outlets of various types in different parts of the country, but compared with many other European countries the UK cannot be said to have anything like a vibrant local TV structure. However, there is no reason why that should not change. Indeed, if it were to change, that would reflect the wishes of communities up and down the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000077">There is some evidence about the likely demand for community and local TV if it were more widely available, and that evidence clearly indicates that the public want it. Some 18 years ago, in 1989, an independent survey carried out in Edinburgh found that 93 per cent. of respondents were interested in watching a locally made programme about one of their interests; 92 per cent. of respondents were interested in watching local news on a local television channel; 80 per cent of respondents were interested in watching local current affairs on a local television channel; and respondents were similarly interested in local arts and cultural activities, local festivals and local sport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000078">Some 15 years later, a similar study carried out in south Wales for Merthyr TV suggested that there was a similar level of interest in local programming that offered news and local documentaries, local music and local sports projects and the like. Research has been carried out not only by groups with an interest in local and community TV; Ofcom has also produced research that came to similar conclusions. I understand that research was conducted for Ofcom last May which asked respondents to rate the importance of a series of statements when assessing the importance for UK society of new digital services. Respondents agreed, most frequently, that local news and information should be available on TV&#151;I emphasise &#147;on TV&#148;&#151;at home; local news and information about their local area should be available from at least one media source; and that programmes about community, local people and events should be available on TV at home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="70424h0002.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000079">So, when the public are asked about what they want to see on TV, they consistently tell us that they want local and community TV to be offered as part of a range of TV services. However, the reality is that in most parts of the UK, broadcasting regulation has resulted in local TV being excluded primarily for the benefit of existing TV suppliers, particularly big media corporations in both the private and public sectors. That needs to change, and we have the opportunity to change it with the digital dividend and the ending of spectrum scarcity. We can make that range of community TV services available to the public. It is therefore important that the Government take the right decisions to allow that range of services to be offered to the public and to local communities.</p>

study into how local TV could be provided as an outcome of the digital dividend. Decisions will be taken very soon about how the local TV element can be provided as part of that review. There is an ongoing debate about how far that greater facility for local and community TV should be provided through the digital terrestrial spectrum, and how far it should be left to the satellite channels or provided through broadband. I argue strongly that if we are to take full advantage of this opportunity and if we are to meet the public interest in local and community TV, it is essential that the digital terrestrial spectrum provides genuine community TV as one of its elements. By genuine community TV, I mean community TV in which the community has direct involvement and ownership. Certainly, the simple auctioning off of local TV channels in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles suggested might be the outcome, would not provide the boost for community and local TV that the public want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000081">The opportunity exists for the Government to make the right decisions, as section 244 of the Communications Act 2003 allows the Secretary of State to make provision for genuine local and community TV. I urge the Minister to take advantage of that section, either today or when the decisions are made, and ensure that a genuine community TV network is established throughout the UK. I want him to ensure that local TV can be a public service broadcaster, as set out in statute. Either that section should be implemented or, if required, amendments should be made to the primary legislation. Making community TV possible requires a level of funding that enables it to offer the kind of services that meet the needs of the community. Ofcom has discussed the fact that funding could be provided through a public service publisher facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000082">To sum up, I hope that the digital dividend review will mean that a digital TV channel is available for a local community TV station in each area and that such local TV channels are required to be genuinely community-based. They should carry local news and community information, and provide a forum for local arts, culture and sporting events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000083">I want to spend a little time discussing two other issues relating to community media, the first of which is the development of community radio. My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles rightly set out how it is sometimes difficult for local community radio stations to get themselves established. The funding that is available is welcome, but there is a need for a longer term perspective. Using examples from Shetland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West pointed out that there should be more flexibility, and I would endorse that view. My experience of, and contact with, local community radio demonstrates the need for more flexibility in how set-up support is made available to community radio stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000084">The example of the funding from the Welsh Assembly Government, which I have mentioned, should be followed both at UK level and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Again, my hon. Friend has rightly pointed out that there are a number of opportunities for Government and public sector agencies to use community media outlets in a cost-effective way to provide information about important issues in the community. Such outlets can deliver that information well. Community radio and TV are means not just of establishing local media but of strengthening local communities. In so doing,  <br>

they help us to tackle some of the divisions in society and to get the best out of a rich fabric of community life that exists in most parts of our country. We are now at a crossroads, because some of the decisions that will be taken could determine the future of community media for many decades, and it is important that we get them right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000085">I want briefly to comment on a specific issue relating to the subject matter of this debate which has been raised on a number of occasions in the House. There is concern about how the allocation of spectrum could have serious effects on the programme making and special events sector. Some hon. Members present have spoken of the concern elsewhere that the auctioning of the spectrum could have a serious effect on thousands of small businesses and community events that make use of radio microphones. Hon. Members raised the matter in an Adjournment debate in the House a couple of weeks ago.</p>

 Order. This is a debate about community radio and television, and its funding; it is not a debate about the radio spectrum.</p>

 Indeed. I would not want to stray from the subject of the debate, but this matter relates to it, because the way the spectrum is allocated for community media has a bearing on the allocation of spectrum for radio microphones. The decisions that we must take in the entire area must take account of the needs of the communities in both the wider and local senses; many people&#146;s operations rely on that particular section of the spectrum too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000088">I hope that either today or in future the Minister will assure us that the decisions to be taken will support community media, allow them to flourish and allow the already welcome steps that have been taken in many communities in our country to be replicated elsewhere in the UK. That will give a boost, not just to the media, but to our local communities. I am grateful for having had the opportunity to raise these issues in this debate.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) on securing the debate and on providing an excellent guide to, and summary of, all the issues. He was ably supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz). In particular, my hon. Friend was able to cite examples drawn from professional experience, as he worked in the sector before he was elected as a Member of Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000090">The principles behind community media are well known and have been ably described by the three hon. Members who have spoken. They can most succinctly be summarised as follows: allowing local news and activities to be broadcast in the local area; fostering community identity; empowering local communities; and assisting in training local people. Community media are not new, in the sense that the principles are not new.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000091">My first experience of community media came when I was a student at York university from 1975 to 1978.  <br>

The university was one of the first to have its own radio station. A number of the people who voluntarily gave a lot of their time working on it as students went on to have professional careers in the media, and that experience has been mirrored across the country. When I taught in Buxton, in the High Peak area of Derbyshire, a number of my students voluntarily gave a lot of their time to working on hospital radio in Buxton, at least one of whom went on to work in a full-time career in commercial radio. Those students initially worked at Peak FM in Chesterfield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000092">I have had nearly 30 years&#146; experience of Chesterfield hospital radio, which has come both from visiting members of my family who are patients and from people whom I know in the constituency. Student radio and hospital radio are examples of community media that have been around for quite a long time on a small-scale, voluntary basis. There is now the potential for a considerable expansion of community media.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000093">Legislation was passed in 2004 allowing community radio stations to be licensed provided that they could fulfil social gain obligations and that a maximum of 50 per cent. of their financing came from advertising and sponsorship. Since then, community radio has been the fastest growing sector of the UK broadcast industry, but the financial problems and uncertainties over licence renewals are causing problems. Of the 122 full-time community radio stations that have been licensed since 2004, just 60 have managed to commence broadcasting. That is because of some of the problems that have been outlined.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000094">The licensing and regulation of community radio causes considerable problems. Community radio is intended to be clearly distinct from both commercial radio and the BBC, and it has been established as providing social gain on a not-for-profit basis. Meeting those licensing conditions requires a specific lengthy process, and four different targets need to be hit in order to gain the licence. Currently, community radio stations must deliver on those four criteria, which make up an overall social gain and community benefit criteria. Ofcom has suggested that meeting those four separate distinctive licensing criteria might be too onerous and that one way forward might be to have a review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000095">The four separate criteria could be relaxed and merged into an overall social gain benefit, which could be the threshold in respect of getting a licence. That might be a way of cutting out the unnecessarily complicated regulation that is causing problems at the moment. Most community radio stations, happily, meet some of the present criteria, such as providing social gain in the community, training, opportunities in the community, increased local skills and employability, and so on. Ofcom&#146;s suggestion of cutting the selection criteria to the applicant&#146;s ability to establish and maintain its proposed service and to the overall community benefit is the way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000096">Renewal of licences is also a problem, because community radio licences are issued for a shorter duration than those for commercial radio&#151;five years for community radio, rather than 12 years for commercial stations. Such a short period of licensing causes problems in raising funding, obtaining sponsorship and putting in all the work to get a community radio station off the ground with the knowledge that the licence could be lost within a short space of time, because it operates on a short, five-year cycle. A longer licensing period&#151;perhaps  <br>

in line with commercial radio&#151;would remove one of the bureaucratic obstacles that prevent the rapid development of community radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000097">We have heard about funding from the three hon. Members who have spoken, and it is inevitably a problem. The funding structures demanded for community radio stations may prevent more stations from being established and prevent those that have been given licences from taking to the air. The majority of community radio stations may not generate more than 50 per cent. of funding from advertising and sponsorship, and a minority has been prevented from generating any income from advertising and sponsorship due to the presence of nearby small commercial radio stations. That is designed to protect the small local commercial stations in a competitive and limited advertising market, but it could be seen as an unfair restriction on community radio, given that many commercial stations are not local, but are owned by large media groups and provide a rather more limited level of local service provision than their name implies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000098">Additionally, community radio stations are not allowed to receive more than 50 per cent. of their funding from a single source so as to maintain editorial independence, which is obviously a worthwhile aim. However, that restriction may prevent some stations from finding sufficient funding, so they cannot get on air. Ofcom has suggested that restrictions could be weakened, but that some limit on single-source funding should remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000099">The other major funding sources open to community radio stations, as we have heard from the hon. Members who have spoken, are those to which everyone else is applying, such as the national lottery and charitable grant distributors. However, a number of problems are encountered when applying for grants, apart from application procedures being bureaucratic and expensive. As more community radio stations are granted licences, more and more of them are chasing the same limited pot of money, which must restrict the growth of community radio unless something is done about the pot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000100">Lottery grants are under severe threat over the next five years with the Olympics smash-and-grab raid to pay for the trebling, at least, of the cost of the Olympics due to incompetent costing. That will hit many community groups, sporting activities and much community media over the next five years, with the average constituency losing an average of &#163;1 million of funding for such activities in the area. Community radio and TV, as newcomers to the scene, will inevitably lose out even more as a result of the Olympics smash-and-grab raid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000101">The time scale for obtaining funding is too tight. Only two years are given from the granting of the licence to going on air, and many of those who have been granted licences have found that that is not long enough, given the problems of financing. Ofcom has suggested that one way of helping to get round that might be for volunteer time to be costed up in hours and counted towards the funding contribution. That might be one way round some of the problems related to raising funding, qualifying and the amount that can be raised from advertising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000102">Ofcom has made a number of suggestions that are worthy of consideration to ease some of the problems. The community radio fund receives the limited sum of &#163;500,000 per annum, which is only a fraction of what one well-paid commercial or BBC DJ receives, and the  <br>

more community radio stations that try to become established, the less they can get from that limited pot. The average award last year was just under &#163;24,000, but if the number of community radio stations is doubled or trebled, those awards will inevitably become smaller as time goes by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000103">Hon. Members have given examples from their areas and I shall give one from Chesterfield and North-East Derbyshire, where Trust FM is trying to become established. Trust FM was granted a licence in 2006 and was due to go on air in 2007, but it is having severe problems because of the funding issues that we have discussed. It is a professional organisation: I have mentioned my experience as a recipient of hospital radio at Chesterfield Royal hospital, and from 1984 to 1996 Ivan Spenceley, who is the leading instigator behind Trust FM, helped to run and worked with that hospital radio station, which became so popular that it led to a 28-broadcast trial in 1996. That was an extension of hospital radio to the whole community of Chesterfield and north Derbyshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000104">The team that is trying to get Trust FM running is very experienced, but it is hitting problems. It got through the licensing barrier, but at the moment it cannot raise the funds to meet the initial start-up costs. It is confident that it can obtain advertising revenue and that it would be able to sell cheaper advertising to parts of the community that cannot afford current commercial rates, but getting funding to get off the ground is proving difficult, even for a highly professional, experienced and well-organised group such as Trust FM. For example, it has already been turned down twice for funding from the Big Lottery Fund and, as I have said, the situation will only get worse over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000105">Community TV is much less developed than community radio, and it has been a missing element in public service broadcasting in the UK for some time. There has been a debate about it since 1984, and it was first licensed in 1997. Currently, there are 17 analogue local community services broadcasting in the UK, but only two are not-for-profit community TV stations, the other 15 being commercial local stations. Getting community TV off the ground is proving to be even harder than getting community radio off the ground, despite the fact that all the same benefits are offered by community TV as by community radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000106">One particular problem, which is not such an issue for community radio, is spectrum. There is currently poor picture quality because of spectrum allocation, and uncertainty with the forthcoming sale of digital spectrum as to what will happen and what will be available for community TV. If there is a straightforward sale of spectrum, clearly community TV will simply not be able to get in on the act or bid for sections of the spectrum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000107">Another possibility is to use broadband, and one good example of that is Southwark.TV. However, although that approach would be useful in many urban areas, it would exclude more isolated, rural and far-flung areas from day one. What will happen to the digital spectrum and whether community TV will be able to access it are major problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para25"><a name="07042430000108">There has been a proliferation of TV channels, and of quiz and shopping channels, all of which are of low quality. There have been two or three recent scandals about quiz programmes, which have been a rip-off involving conning consumers who telephone into thinking  <br>

that they can win prizes when the results have been decided in advance. The Government must look again at how some of the spectrum could be more usefully allocated to community TV.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para26"><a name="07042430000109">Community media offer an immensely valuable community resource and have huge potential, which has barely been tapped. They can reinvigorate and empower communities, offer training in modern technology at grass-roots level and get people involved in local politics, local community activities and local affairs. The benefits are endless, but the problems of licensing, funding and spectrum for community TV are impeding community radio and strangling community TV at birth. The Government must act to remove those obstacles, and I look forward to the Minister telling us exactly what the Government&#146;s plans are to deal with those issues.</p>

First, I endorse everything that the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes) said. He made some excellent points with which I wholly concur, and he reflected the fact that all Members regard community radio and television as good things, and that they seek to ensure that such media have the best playing field on which to flourish. I endorse also his comments about lottery funding, because a great many of our community radio and television stations rely on it, and the Conservatives are concerned about the continued cuts to lottery funding, about the need to reduce the amount of bureaucracy required to get an application up and running, and about the length of the licence for community radio and television stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="70424h0003.htm_para28"><a name="07042430000112">At the end of his remarks, the hon. Gentleman talked briefly about the internet. The debate about the meaning of community media, radio and television is fast-moving, and of course local people want to consume local media. They have done so for many years through local newspapers, but now the internet is changing the landscape. If my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell) were present, he would tell us that he runs a community television station called ClactonTV. One could argue that YouTube is a community television station, and that 18 Doughty Street is a community television station catering for a particular countrywide community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para0"><a name="07042430000115">One could argue also that Tory Radio is a community national radio station, catering for a particular community. I accept the point that the hon. Member for Chesterfield made about broadband television and radio not necessarily being the answer to a community&#146;s needs, not least because of the limited broadband spectrum. Last week, an important report was published by the Broadband Stakeholder Group. It pointed out the need to continue to expand bandwidth in this country, and it highlighted social exclusion, whereby many people&#151;particularly those who would benefit from community radio and television&#151;do not have access to the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000116">Before I go in to bat for community radio and television, I shall make what could be construed as constructively critical remarks. It is important for community radio and television to shout about their benefits. In my part of the world, I am lucky enough to have a community television station, SIX TV, but I confess that have no idea how to receive it at home, I have never watched it and I have appeared on it only once in my two years as a Member of Parliament. I suspect that it is not widely known among the community that it seeks to serve. Although I also accept that community television and radio operate on strictly limited budgets, I believe that it would be good if their benefits were more widely known. It would be interesting to know the type of partnerships that community radio and television seek to forge with the organisations that can provide them with publicity, such as local authorities, community groups and hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000117">The hon. Member for Eccles was quite right to say that when one refers to a community media organisation, there is a balance to strike between media on the one hand and community on the other. I wholly endorse his remarks about the fantastic opportunities that such organisations provide to the local community, particularly the training and focus that they provide to many groups. Those benefits were highlighted in the excellent report, &#147;The Community Radio Sector: Looking to the Future&#148;, from the Minister&#146;s Department. I thoroughly endorse the report, especially its six key conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000118">The point that I really want to get across is that this country lags behind the rest of Europe, mainly because of the high level of regulation that still surrounds community radio and television. In Holland, Spain and Germany the sector is thriving, and if one goes anywhere in the United States one is likely to have an opportunity to listen to a local community radio station. In this country, however, the sector remains heavily regulated, and anything that we can do to lower the regulatory barrier has to be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000119">Ofcom recognised that point in its recent consultation document, &#147;The Future of Radio&#148;. Community radio stations are governed by the same public purpose tests as the BBC, and to a lesser extent, the commercial broadcasters. They undergo the test of providing &#147;social gain&#148; with specific requirements to reach people &#147;currently under-served by radio&#148;, and the test of</p>
<a name="70424h0004.htm_brev0"><a name="07042430000461"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;enhancing the understanding of the target community and strengthen links within it.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000120">Ofcom proposes that such purpose tests should be reconsidered, and I agree that they should. To be dynamic, businesses of every kind need to operate in a low regulatory environment, and community radio should not be any different.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000121">I should also like to remove a host of statutory criteria that require Ofcom to consider such factors as  <br>

the extent to which the new stations would broaden choice and cater for the interests of the community, and the access that they would provide to that target audience. There is further scope for deregulation, which would allow businesses to own multiple community licences and make stations more viable as costs fall. Funding should also be reviewed, and I await Ofcom&#146;s recommended limit on the funding that a station can receive from a non-commercial source.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000122">The hon. Members for Chesterfield and for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) commented on community television&#146;s difficulties due to spectrum constraints. Until digital switchover is completed, there will be space for only six channels to operate, and despite the hope that more than 30 local television stations would operate, the nature of analogue broadcasting means that conventional TV aerials can pick up only a limited chunk of spectrum. In the overwhelming majority of places, the spectrum is taken up by the five terrestrial television stations, so even if local stations receive licences and broadcast on the available spectrum, it is impossible to pick up that output without specialist equipment. The time frame during which licences were first issued also caused difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000123">Community TV is, however, set to change radically during the next few years, and the switch to digital will present a huge challenge, so I await with great interest the outcome of the digital dividend review consultation. It is clear that there are advantages and drawbacks both to the interleaved option, which the Community Media Association favours, and to the add/drop method, which my local television station SIX TV favours. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith said that there is a range of completing claims to the vacated spectrum, and I accept that there is potential for market failure if national operators are allowed to block-buy locally auctioned channels. I do not want locally auctioned channels to be block-bought and turned into gaming or shopping channels; there must be a system to ensure that local television continues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000124">We are all anxious to hear the Minister&#146;s views on this fast developing sector. The challenges that lie ahead are presented by the rapid growth of the internet and by the need for community radio and television stations to raise their profiles. However, hon. Members can work to solve the challenges presented by the level of bureaucracy and by the opportunity to free up spectrum as digital switchover approaches.</p>

Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) both on securing this debate and on putting forward a robust and elegant case for community radio and television. The work that he and the all-party community media group have done on the issue has been extremely important not only in challenging the Government, but in helping to formulate better policy for now and the future. I am sure that he will keep up his trenchant challenges to the Government and the Opposition, as they try responsibly to get to grips with the challenges and opportunities that community radio and television pose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000126">I should put it on the record that I have some experience of community radio, having in the early 1990s been chairman of a student radio station, the precursor to community radio. I therefore have experience not only of trying to put together a radio station, but of fundraising. I should point out, with some care, that it is sometimes all too easy for those who look at community radio stations, but who do not have the experience of running one, to think that what is needed is just for the Government or the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to make the money available through some facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000127">We had no such money available in the 1990s, but we managed to find it from a number of sources, and there are many sources out there. Hon. Members would be wise to urge those running community radio stations in their constituencies to look to trusts and charities, for example, many of which are expressly able to make grants within their terms of reference. However, that requires long-term planning, an essential ingredient of delivering any public service, which will otherwise simply be short-termism. The real benefits delivered by community radio for social inclusion and cohesion are long term as well as short term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000128">The past few years have seen a period of unprecedented change in the provision of community media in the UK. At the forefront of that has been the growth of community radio, springing from the statutory provision of the Communications Act 2003. Ofcom, the independent regulator, has to date awarded 122 community radio licences. That figure is set to grow even further over the coming months, in the second round of licence applications. To date, some 60 stations have commenced broadcasting. Community radio stations now serve a wide cross-section of the country. Ofcom has stated that its aim is, in principle, to license stations in the communities that want them; indeed, it restated that in its recent report, &#147;The Future of Radio&#148;. That extensive growth is a major achievement and should not be underestimated in any shape or form. It has happened in a short space of time and surely reaffirms the desire for the so-called third tier of radio broadcasting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000129">Community radio stations are much more than broadcasters, however. They are already showing the impact that they can have on the communities that they serve, as my hon. Friend so eloquently pointed out. Indeed, at the Community Media Association festival last year, we launched the DCMS&#146;s independent review of the community radio sector. That review assessed the progress of community radio to date, examining social gain in particular. I always enjoy sparring with the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey) on these occasions, even though I feel that he is the Gyles Brandreth of his generation of the Conservative party, although he is more than simply entertainment value. However, I should point out to him and other hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes), that social gain is a particularly important element of community radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000130">Social gain distinguishes community radio from some of the commercial options. I understand and recognise, in part, the claims that the hon. Member for Wantage made for the need to deregulate and simplify the process, which Ofcom has also recognised. However, it would be a great shame to lose social gain as an important dimension for those radio stations, because that is what really distinguishes them from commercial radio per se.  <br>

Social gain makes community radio essentially different, and that distinction should be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000131">The review by Ofcom highlighted a number of areas where important work needs to be done, as did our own review, in which we looked at social gain. Our review looked at training and the value of the skills that it can produce for people in local areas. In many cases, training leads to people developing a career in paid radio. Volunteering in community radio stations is important and was highlighted in our report, too. As my hon. Friend and other hon. Members pointed out, volunteering also contributes to building social cohesion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000132">The Government established a framework for community radio. We were clear that we wanted services that were distinct from the existing radio market. Community radio stations should complement, not compete with, commercial stations. We want to ensure that community radio stations are a voice for the community that is relatively free of commercial pressures. It was for those reasons that the Community Radio Order 2004 included restrictions on the percentage of a station&#146;s revenue that could come from advertising. Ofcom has examined that issue in its report, and we shall give careful consideration to its proposals. Again, however, what essentially matters is maintaining the distinction between community radio and commercial radio. The existing distinctions are there to preserve the characteristics of community radio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000133">My Department has asked Ofcom to conduct a review of the existing community radio licensing framework. That review will consider the restrictions in the Community Radio Order 2004 and the extent, if any, to which they should be retained or removed. I am sure that Ofcom will want to note not only the comments that I have made, but those of all hon. Members in this debate, in conducting its work. The Government have been clear from the outset that it was never the intention to create a new tier of commercially funded radio, and that must remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000134">Over the past four years, my Department has made &#163;500,000 available to the community radio sector.

The intention of the fund is to support stations&#146; core costs, such as the salaries of station managers and  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000135">I am conscious of the time that I have at my disposal. I am happy to write to hon. Members on the specific points that they have raised about community radio, but in the three minutes that are left I should like to turn to commercial television. The next great transformation in the media will undoubtedly be the development of community television and community services of that kind. One of the most important points, of which hon. Members should be aware, is that the technology is changing very fast. In considering the allocation of the spectrum for community television in the years to come, hon. Members should remember that there might be more ways to deliver community television than simply by looking at the current use of the spectrum, and Ofcom is aware of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000136">Hon. Members have referred to the difficulties with broadband coverage in some rural areas, but we should remember how broadband has changed and that 10 years ago it was not there at all. Broadband is available in most areas now, and I suspect that in 10 years this debate will sound somewhat historic rather than contemporary. We should exercise a degree of caution in discussing the issue, because we tend to look through the prism of our interpretation of technology now, rather than where it will be in a few years&#146; time. None the less, the important point that my hon. Friend made is absolutely well taken by me. I reassure him that the safeguards that he seeks are already there, even in Ofcom&#146;s digital dividend review. Indeed, Ofcom has gone further than that. For example, it has looked at packages of the spectrum that could be available within the existing use of the technology and has identified more than 40 packages that might be made available and that could be suitable for use by local television.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000137">However, my hon. Friend should accept my reassurance that the points that he has made about the development of community radio and television are absolutely taken by the Government. We are firmly committed to the development of community radio and television. We shall seek to use the offices of government to encourage proposals for the future. We remain wedded to the technology-neutral sale of the spectrum. However, I reassure him that that will not preclude the use of the spectrum in the future for community television and that we shall look at ways of making that possible.</p>

<a name="time_6"><a name="70424h0004.htm_time1"><a name="07042430000479"><h5 align="left">11 am</h5>
<p><a name="st_26"><a name="07042430000138"><a name="70424h0004.htm_spnew0"><a name="07042430000520"><b>Danny Alexander (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey) (LD):</b>
 I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the rural post office network today. As the House will know, the future of rural post offices is vital to rural communities the length and breadth of the United Kingdom&#151;not least in the highlands and islands, where my constituency is. I was fortunate enough to secure a debate on a similar subject in January last year. During that debate, the Minister&#146;s predecessor described rural post offices as &#147;inefficient physical structures&#148;. I am pleased to say that this Minister uses more sympathetic language and makes an effort to listen to the concerns put to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000139">Since that last debate, we have learned about the Government&#146;s plans to close 2,500 post offices across the United Kingdom; the axe is expected to fall mainly in rural areas. The proposals have not been greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm in the rural communities that I represent. Put simply, post offices are an essential part of the social and economic fabric of the communities that they serve. They are crucial, too, to the sustainability of those communities. Even the post office that serves only a few dozen people a week during its limited opening hours provides an essential service and often makes the difference, for example, as to whether an elderly person can continue to live in that community. The impact of such post offices on issues of poverty and social exclusion&#151;issues that concern this Government&#151;is enormously significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000140">Distances between post offices in the highlands and islands can be enormous; often a sea or a loch are in the way. If one post office closed, it could be next to impossible to access the nearest neighbouring post office, not to mention the environmental impact of the extra miles that Ministers clearly expect people affected by closures to drive if they are to get to that next post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000141">It is worth bearing in mind a few facts about the importance of rural post offices. There are nearly 8,000 of them and they help to secure other local businesses. A shop is attached to 75 per cent. of rural post offices, for example. Post offices are frequently the only places in their communities in which local residents, visitors and tourists can access cash, an important resource. Although 60 per cent. of villages have a post office, only 4 per cent. have a bank. I am delighted to welcome the fact that the Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, has recently opened a new branch in Aviemore in my constituency, but many villages in many of the constituencies represented by hon. Members in the Chamber today still do not have banks, and post offices are the only places where people can access financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para25"><a name="07042430000142">The importance of small businesses in rural areas has been highlighted by a number of organisations, including the Commission for Rural Communities. Furthermore, the increasing number of people who work from home in rural communities rely on their post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para26"><a name="07042430000143">The Government have held a consultation on their plans. If the sample of responses that has been passed to me is any guide, the vast majority of responses to that consultation will have been overwhelmingly negative.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend share the scepticism of many about the consultation process? Many of those directly delivering services in our post offices were neither directly consulted by the Department of Trade and Industry nor, originally, sent the consultation document so that their views could be ascertained. They are the people on the front line who have something to contribute, but they were not directly canvassed for their opinions.</p>

 My hon. Friend has expressed an important concern. Although many hon. Members will themselves have passed the consultation documents on to local postmasters, one would have thought that directly consulting those affected was a Government responsibility.</p>

Although taking a little more time to consider their response to the consultation may well be wise, there seems to be more than a whiff of politics about the length of the delay.

 I have presented several petitions to Parliament about the closure of post offices in my constituency, but the Government have not taken the opportunity to respond to them. Effectively, therefore, they have snubbed my constituents and their petitions. Many thousands of my constituents are as deeply concerned as the hon. Gentleman has indicated.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point helps to illustrate a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Government, and I hope to illustrate it further.</p>

If he did, we would be delighted, but one suspects that the response will not be forthcoming. However, will he at least say whether his views have changed as a result of reading the responses, or should the closure plan be regarded as a done deal and the consultation be seen as little more than window dressing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para29"><a name="07042430000150">Some important questions need to be answered about the Government&#146;s proposals. The excellent Trade and Industry Committee report characterised the figure of 2,500 as &#147;suspiciously round&#148; and wondered whether it stemmed from a proper analysis of the number of post offices needed</p>
<a name="70424h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="07042430000462"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;or simply represents the maximum number of closures that would be funded from the resources of HM Treasury.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="70424h0004.htm_para30"><a name="07042430000151">That is a good question, and one that I hope the Minister will be able to answer today. If the Government are really intent on putting the Post Office on to a more sustainable footing, we would expect the figure for the proposed closures to be the result of exhaustive analysis, not of simply trying to find a number that would give the Treasury the savings that it was looking for and also avoid the higher numbers in the extreme closure programme forecast by some in advance of the Government announcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para0"><a name="07042430000152">I have questions for the Minister about how the Government intend their proposed criteria to be implemented by Post Office Ltd in rural areas. The proposed rural area criteria state that 95 per cent. of the  <br>

total rural population should be within three miles of a post office. The phrase &#147;total rural population&#148; is worrying because it implies that some regions could see swingeing cuts. We already know that the 38 remote postcodes that now do not meet the criteria of 95 per cent. of the population within six miles will be exempt from further closures. That is good news, and I welcome it. However, it has inevitably created real worries among people in neighbouring remote communities, who fear that their post offices may be taken away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000153">For example, as I am sure the Minister knows, the post office in Fort Augustus at the southern end of Loch Ness is one of the best used in the highlands, serving large numbers of tourists as well as local people and businesses. It is successful and essential to the community. However, the neighbouring villages of Invergarry and Invermoriston are within exempt postcodes, so people in Fort Augustus are inevitably worried. I have also received strong representations in similar circumstances from the Kirkhill community about their post office.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may recall that during the last Opposition day debate that we had on post offices, I raised the problem of access criteria. The problem is that they are an average. Furthermore, we do not know what definition is being applied to rural areas&#151;do they include suburban areas as well? If the criteria are an average and suburban areas are included, we may well find that the access criteria go down to 80-something per cent. rather than 90-something per cent. That would mean that constituencies such as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s and mine&#151;mine is not quite as remote as his, but it is very rural&#151;could suffer more post office closures than otherwise.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I add that the words &#147;rural&#148; and &#147;remote&#148; were not defined in the Government&#146;s consultation, so it is impossible to understand exactly what is meant. The Minister may wish to elucidate or clarify that point in his response. I hope that he will be able to; if not, the uncertainty to which the hon. Gentleman referred will certainly continue. Although the Minister cannot necessarily be expected to comment on the fate of individual post offices, can he at least offer some reassurance to people in remote postcode areas where there is only one post office, such as Fort Augustus? Presumably, it would be wrong to close the sole outlet in such an area.</p>

 As far as I am aware, efforts are being made to recruit replacements. One of the problems with recruiting replacements for a number of post offices is the uncertainty about the Government&#146;s plans, not only about funding, but about the provision of other Government services. That makes it harder than it should be to recruit replacements in such communities where post offices are necessary. If the funding and the services are not there to enable the post offices to move forward, it seems that we might be going back to where we started, with the rural post offices allowed to wither away, but with 2,500 less post offices than we started with.</p>

For example, Nairn, in my constituency, has three post offices: one on the High street, one on Harbour street and one in Tradespark. Each is well supported and provides an essential and highly valued service to the distinct community that it serves. However, when the ministerial slide rule is applied it seems that places such as Nairn may&#151;we await the response&#151;be left with fewer offices.

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="07042430000169"><a name="70424h0005.htm_spnew10"><a name="07042430000536"><b>Danny Alexander:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a tremendously important point. The footfall generated by a post office on a high street or in a section of shops in a small town is crucially important not only to the post office. The beneficial effect&#151;the glow that comes out of the post office&#151;spreads more widely than the post office and other businesses that might be located within it, to neighbouring shops and other businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000170">In relation to the Crown post offices, there is also a feeling of a loss of accountability. There is no comeback for the community if the business in which the post office is located closes down or chooses to relocate. That is exactly what happened in Balloch, in my constituency, when Somerfield closed its store. Many months later, the residents of Balloch are still waiting to have their post office restored. What guarantee can the Minister give that the new franchise arrangements will not go the same way? Does he want to see such franchise arrangements extended elsewhere?</p>

 The Crown post office, or the directly managed service, in Dumfries went to a Spar shop. In recent weeks, we had significant problems&#151;I shall put it no other way. Great efforts were made to find someone else to take over the business and that happened, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that at the time of the changeover Post Office Ltd gave a clear commitment that, irrespective of what happened, if the owner of the shop decided that they could no longer run the business, an alternative would be found. Post Office Ltd has come good on that, even after a fortnight&#146;s delay.</p>

commitment that he has described from the Post Office to ensure continuity of service is important, but I am afraid that that is not something that they have been able to secure in Balloch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000173">We have to ask ourselves why post offices are in such difficulty. Ministers will say that demographic and technological changes are largely to blame, but some new technology&#151;eBay, for example&#151;benefits post offices. Of course, post offices have to adapt to the changes, but the Government should help. Instead, they have been taking business away. The Minister might wish to quote with approval the briefing from the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters for this debate, but he should be careful. It states that</p>
<a name="70424h0005.htm_brev0"><a name="07042430000463"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;we regard this programme as unfortunately necessary...in view of the scale of withdrawal of government business from the network in recent years and the consequent viability of some sub post offices.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000174">In other words, Ministers have taken away with one hand and are now using that as an excuse to take away with the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000175">The loss of the television licence has caused real damage to post offices. We cannot blame the BBC alone for that; a responsible Government would have stepped in to prevent such a damaging change. Restoring the ability of post offices to sell TV licences would, to my mind, be a welcome step in the right direction. One of the major advantages that post offices have is their ability to reach the parts that other financial providers simply cannot or will not reach. Post offices have the capacity to be the engine room of financial inclusion, enabling groups who are often excluded, such as the elderly, the disabled and those without their own transport, to access financial services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000176">I had hoped that that would be part of the Government&#146;s vision of financial inclusion, but in the recent financial inclusion report, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury confirmed the Treasury&#146;s blind spot where post offices were concerned. A dismissive reference to the Post Office card account and a Panglossian reference to the post office closure programme were all that could be managed in a lengthy report. That is very worrying, particularly when the new contract for POCA is considered. POCA should be seen as a step towards financial inclusion, not a barrier to it. For example, additional features could be added to make it more useful to those who want them and want to stay with the Post Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000177">In his reply, will the Minister update us on his thinking on the matter? I welcome the fact that the new contract for the POCA is proceeding. When will it be awarded? I regard it as essential that it goes to the Post Office. Without it, many post offices will lose vital footfall, and the pattern whereby the loss of Government&#146;s business sounds post offices&#146; death knell will continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000178">When the new replacement POCA is introduced, it must be made as easy as possible for new and existing customers to access, without any of the hurdles created when the Post Office card account was first introduced. The Government should also be working hard to persuade banks to allow access to their accounts over the counter at post offices. Installing free automated teller machines is certainly helpful, but enabling bank customers to carry out transactions on their account at any post office is what is really needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000179">Fundamentally, this debate is about the importance of providing Post Office and postal services on an equal  <br>

basis to every citizen, no matter how rural or remote their community might be. That is a principle in which Liberal Democrats believe firmly and in which we are prepared to invest, but there are warning signs that others wish to erode it. The proposed closures in rural areas are one such sign. Another is Royal Mail&#146;s application to charge a premium on business mail to the highlands and islands. To many, that seems to be the thin end of the wedge for Royal Mail to undermine the universal service obligation that results in letters and parcel services being charged at the same price across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000180">If the subject matter of this debate is crucial, so is its timing. There are 10 days to go until the local Scottish parliamentary and Welsh Assembly elections. Labour party leaflets circulating in my constituency suggest that the Minister&#146;s party colleagues, unlike him, are unwilling to accept responsibility for addressing the decline in rural post offices. I am sure that in 10 days&#146; time, many people will use their vote to remind his colleagues of that responsibility.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) on securing this debate. It is an important issue, and the timing is quite good as well.</p>

I recall that in the small village of Ganllwyd in my constituency, an elderly lady ran a post office from her own home. She gave the Post Office 12 months&#146; notice that she was giving it up, and a local garage proprietor, who also owned a bakery and a shop, bid for the franchise. He was rejected summarily for not being a fit person to take over. In those days&#151;there was a huge turnover of about &#163;2 million&#151;he was denied the opportunity. I rang the person concerned at the Post Office, and we had such an argument that she went on the sick for a week afterwards, but the Post Office reconsidered and my constituent took over. That post office has been very successful.</p>

We in north Wales have the unenviable task of watching Labour Members of Parliament run around campaigning to keep post offices going&#151;in fact, that was the main issue in a recent by-election in south Wales&#151;when they voted for the closure programme. I do not know how cynical people can get, but I know that our constituents are considerably more intelligent than new Labour thinks they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000184">We all know how important it is to maintain the network. I will not repeat what has been said by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, who put the case eloquently and well, or what was said in the interventions that he took. I live in a small village outside the town of Bala that has one shop. The postmaster there tells me that he is actively thinking of giving up, because work has been consistently taken away from him and he has been denied any opportunity to expand. When he applied for grants, the problems that he encountered were such that in the end  <br>

he just gave up. He is becoming more and more disheartened, and we in the locality are becoming more and more concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000185">If he were to close, that would be the end of our village shop. Effectively, the next post office is five miles away by bus&#151;if the bus is available and at a certain expense. I am thinking of elderly people. We in this Chamber have reasonable earnings and can afford to travel back and forth as we wish, but sadly many people in rural areas rely on bus services that are not up to scratch.</p>

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="07042430000186"><a name="70424h0005.htm_spnew14"><a name="07042430000540"><b>Mr. Cash:</b>
 It is somewhat ironic that reducing post office facilities in rural areas is likely to lead to an increase in car use. If people in small villages, particularly the elderly and infirm, can get to their post office on foot, taking away that post office will increase car use.</p>

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="07042430000187"><a name="70424h0005.htm_spnew15"><a name="07042430000541"><b>Mr. Llwyd:</b>
 The point is well made and is absolutely right. Mention was made earlier of the Government&#146;s own figures on service in rural areas&#151;that 95 per cent. of the total rural population will have access to a post office within three miles. I do not know where those figures come from. In parts of my constituency, the nearest post office is already 10 to 15 miles away, even before the closure programme. I have mentioned the distance of five miles, which is a relatively benign example, but others in my constituency must travel 10, 15 or 20 miles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000188">I do not know how the figures are worked out, but I know that three or four definitions of &#147;rural&#148; are being used in various Departments. I should like to know what the definition is, and whether, when discussing total population, second homes are taken into account. Are those figures factored in as well? I know that urban areas will also suffer from the changes, but I cannot recognise the figures or relate them to anything that I understand about the rural network in north and mid-Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000189">There is some hope, because we have been told that the card account will have a successor. We are all celebrating that announcement, albeit guardedly, but at the beginning we thought that the card account would be here to stay. When we looked at the small print&#151;these are typical new Labour tactics&#151;we found closure in 2010. As my dentist tells me frequently, new Labour announces that it is going to chop off both our legs, and when it chops off one, we celebrate because it is not as bad as we all thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000190">The Government can do much more. Banking facilities have been referred to, and there is no reason why a full suite of banking facilities should not be available in our post offices. In Wales, we have taken a rather different view of things. We allow some post offices 100 per cent. rate relief, because we acknowledge that they are extremely important to the fabric of rural communities. Let us not forget that very often the post office is a social centre as well. It is a place where people meet. If Mrs. Jones does not turn up for her newspaper two days running, people begin to think, &#147;Is she all right?&#148; It is an important social gathering place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="70424h0005.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000191">The notion was proposed some time ago that post offices could become a one-stop shop for Government information&#151;local government, central Government and the Assembly, as far as I am concerned. I think that that could be done, and that some form of payment should be made for delivering that service.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a great opportunity in our village post offices for payment of council tax, rent and parking fines and, particularly in rural areas, for the administration of agricultural movement? The bureaucracies associated with that could be administered in our post offices as well.</p>

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="07042430000193"><a name="70424h0006.htm_spnew1"><a name="07042430000543"><b>Mr. Llwyd:</b>
 I absolutely agree. There is a need for some creative thinking, and for considering rural issues quite apart from other issues, because they are clearly distinct. There have already been references to distances between post offices and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para0"><a name="07042430000194">I should declare an interest. My sister, who is a successful business woman, has opened a sub-post office in a village called Eglwysbach in north Wales. She is marketing local produce&#151;yoghurts, cheeses, meats and so on&#151;and I am pleased to say that she is doing very well. She was at one time a bank manager. She went on the induction course for post office workers and spent a week being advised how to do accounts, which was not difficult for her, although the Post Office way of doing accounts is quite different from everybody else&#146;s, but I shall not go into that now. She says that what she receives from Post Office business does not meet even half of the salary that her assistant is paid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000195">Let us consider the reality of that situation. My sister has opened a dynamic little business, but that may not be possible for everyone. There is a nice centre of population around her business, but other people might not have that potential. We need to think creatively and to consider the rural context all the time. The comments of the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) about what we could use our rural post office network for were well made. As I have said, I, for one, rely on my village shop, as do many other people.</p>

 On the theme of being creative about what services could be provided in post offices, does the hon. Gentleman agree that if most post offices had a PC or a laptop with access to broadband a huge range of different services such as Government services, online banking and e-mail could be accessed? Does he agree that we should have not access criteria for the closure of post offices, but access criteria for Government services in post offices?</p>

 I absolutely agree. Given that we are discussing a necessary and very important service in rural communities, we should be thinking about giving some financial assistance, not from now until kingdom come but to get people on their feet and moving, while we consider various financial packages&#151;the banking and so on. That could easily be done. It is simply a matter of political will and a bit of creative thinking, as the hon. Gentleman has just said.</p>

Suffice it to say that it is crucial to prevent any further closures in the network. I despair when I think how many offices have been lost in north and mid-Wales in the past couple of years. Indeed, since 1998, there have been 331 closures in north and rural Wales, which is a huge number.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000199">I shall end with a point about Crown offices. The Bangor Crown office will be taken over by WH Smith. We heard in an earlier exchange of a fortunate example of one franchise coming to an end and another then  <br>

taking it over. Fine, that is good, but the problem is that large companies are rather fickle about the services that they deliver. If the bottom line&#151;what they get back&#151;is not good enough, that will be an end of it. Will the Minister say whether there is a minimum period for which a franchise must operate? If, for example, WH Smith decided that it wanted to give up the franchise, is there a minimum period for which it would have to operate it? Is there a minimum period for notifying the Department, and what steps would WH Smith have to take for the franchise to be taken over by someone else? What input do the Government have in that? An added problem is that the Crown offices are the hub of the wheel. If the hub is wonky, the whole wheel falls apart.</p>

I urge the Government to think creatively&#151;they have quite a good record on e-commerce and so on. They should use their record and experience with e-commerce and give post offices the opportunity to expand and to flourish, which is the way forward. The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has referred to broadband, which is the way forward, and that proposal could be done. Indeed, eBay has been mentioned, and it could assist as well.</p>

Likewise, other contracts have been lost by the Post Office because people are undercutting it. In general, it is PayPoint that is doing that.</p>

 I believe that I said twice that the BBC made a sensible commercial decision. It was made under conditions of doubt and uncertainty, and a vicious circle of downward decline in the post office network caused by the brutal withdrawal of the benefits transactions income. I would like a virtuous circle. I would like many more services to go through the network. I entirely agree with the comments of earlier speakers about other Government services that could be put through post offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000213">Let me give a classic example. A furious constituent from Market Drayton rang me the other day. He had been clocked for not paying the congestion charge. He knew nothing about it, as he had not been to London in a car for years, and he was very upset. That small example shows that if information on services such as the congestion charge was available across the post office network, which it could be, such charges could be paid. Other services offered by post offices seem to be positively Soviet and stone age&#151;for example, pensioners can only withdraw their winter fuel payments in one lump sum and cannot have an account at the post office  <br>

accumulating interest, which seems to be similar to 1917 Soviet economic thinking. There are many areas where the Government, with imagination, could develop more economic activity, particularly in relation to banking. Why do HSBC, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group not offer any access to their current accounts at post offices? What is happening to make the Link service universally accessible in post offices? Those basic banking facilities could be part of the network and would bring in income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000214">I consider the network to provide opportunity. A couple of months ago, I went to a brilliant new post office in Maesbury where the post office takes up 0.46 per cent. of the space of a brand new post office, which is probably about a third of the desk that you are sitting at, Mr. Chope. However, it generates 25 per cent. of the turnover. It is a brilliant place that has a shop, an off-licence, a bed and breakfast, canoeing and drying-out facilities. However, it also has internet facilities and a place to show a film and is exactly the sort of go-ahead, positive post office that we should be encouraging. In contrast, when the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last made a statement in the House about this issue he looked miserable and as if the last place that he wanted to be was in the Commons answering questions from ghastly Members of Parliament like myself. Instead of being hounded about the post office, he wanted to get back to Edinburgh. Much as I like the Minister, the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), I think that he would also prefer to be somewhere else this morning. There is no enthusiasm on the part of the Government at all about what they could do to make the post office network more positive.</p>

the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) on this debate. I promise the <i>Hansard</i> reporters that there will not be too many place names that will be a struggle to spell, as there have been quite a few already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000220">I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the concerns of sub-postmasters in Cornwall and other isolated rural areas about the potential impact of further post office closures. My perspective is taken from the work that I have done on the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is a private Member&#146;s Bill currently going through Parliament and has been introduced by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd). I will also use the perspective that I have from being on the Liberal Democrats&#146; Treasury team. I will discuss the impact that post offices could potentially have on local economies and on widening financial inclusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000221">I emphasise the almost unquantifiable social value of post offices in many rural communities. I am reminded of the time when I went to Tehidy post office, which is one of my local post offices. There was no particular reason for my visit; I was simply running an errand. The person in front of me in the post office was a gentleman who was probably in his late 70s or early 80s and had not left his house for a year. On being well enough to leave his house for the first time, the highlight of his day was going to the post office and catching up with the local sub-postmaster and the many friends that he knew he would meet there. The importance of such social interaction cannot be underestimated&#151;particularly in Cornwall, where demographics show that we have an older isolated population. People live in villages where there is often no access to rural transport and they cannot physically get to where other services may be provided. Often such people cannot drive a car themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000222">As my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has mentioned, the post office network should be used as a key tool for widening financial inclusion. The Post Office card account is an important area where that could be expanded. Like my hon. Friend, I was incredibly disappointed to see the Treasury&#146;s latest report on financial inclusion, which describes the Post Office card account as a barrier to financial inclusion. That was concerning because it should be recognised that many people who cannot access a post office will be even less likely to be able to access a bank. For such people, the Post Office card account should be regarded as a first step.</p>

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="07042430000223"><a name="70424h0006.htm_spnew11"><a name="07042430000553"><b>Mr. Russell Brown:</b>
 Is the hon. Lady aware that, at any given time, out of 25 per cent. of Post Office card accounts, which is about 1 million accounts, the total of those accounts is around &#163;600 million to &#163;700 million? The Post Office would dearly love to move people from Post Office card accounts on to other accounts that it operates, in the hope that people would receive interest on those balances.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="07042430000224"><a name="70424h0006.htm_spnew12"><a name="07042430000554"><b>Julia Goldsworthy:</b>
 That is a key issue, which needs to be looked at. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that Post Office card accounts should not be viewed as a barrier to inclusion, but as a starting point. It should also be recognised that, for many people, accessing a bank can be difficult, which is the key way described by the Treasury to enter into financial inclusion. Some people may not feel able to access a bank account on the internet and will depend  <br>

on accessing a service locally. Often the main service that they are able to access is the local post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000225">I will briefly mention the importance of post offices for local rural economies. Cornwall has more micro-businesses per head of the population than any other part of the country. Particularly in rural areas, accessing a post office is critical for people&#146;s access to cash and to services. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey mentioned new business developments such as eBay, which has resulted in a massive upsurge in the use of post offices. Cornwall is a recipient of European funding through objective 1, which deals with peripherality by broadening access to services and providing broadband. However, unless the Government arm also provides support, that good work will be undermined. It is a frustrating situation because there is potential, but the Government do not recognise that or see the Post Office as a vehicle for providing such services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000226">The Treasury is happy to send every post office a summary of the pre-Budget report. I was stunned when I went into Penryn post office and found a summary of the pre-Budget report, which would realistically be of interest to very few people. The Treasury sent it to every single post office and asked it to be displayed. The Treasury clearly recognises that post offices are a useful source of information, but is not prepared to offer the financial support to ensure that services are viable. Services are being withdrawn and the Government are not thinking laterally about what other services could be provided. We have heard that benefit payments have been taken away from post offices and things such as the pension credit application form make it incredibly difficult for credit to be paid into anything other than a bank account. On passport offices, Redruth, which is a town in my constituency, is fortunate to be one of two places in Cornwall that has passport interviewing centres. However, it will be impossible for people in the more isolated parts of Cornwall to get there. Why have the Government not realised that rural post offices are the ideal place and have the skills to deliver that service?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000227">Such an approach from the Government also has an impact on commercial services. South West Water no longer allows people to pay their bills at post offices and we have heard about TV licences. The providers of those services have followed the Government&#146;s lead in providing an incredibly broad definition of what constitutes access. On PayPoint, I was in a place called Stithians on a travelling surgery and I spoke to a lady who was irritated that she could no longer pay for her TV licence through her post office. She had been told that her nearest PayPoint was only three miles away in another village called Lanner. However, the fact that there were no direct public transport links between where she was living and the place where the PayPoint would be delivered was never taken into account. I am concerned that the Government are taking a similar approach to that and when they talk about distances from a local post office, they have not looked in the round at how someone would physically cover those distances. Very often, the roads on which people have to travel have no such thing as a pavement, and there are no public transport links. That has been my experience of the closures that have actually happened so far in my constituency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000228">The fundamental problem is that the people who are best placed to recognise the value of the services that local post offices could and do provide are those in the  <br>

local communities, but the decision-making process and the funding stream are a million miles away from those people. Perhaps the Government could therefore consider devolving responsibility and possibly also funds, so that local authorities and communities can take the decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="70424h0006.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000229">As has been said, certainty is needed, together with a positive approach, because at the moment the climate of uncertainty is undermining confidence in sub-postmasters even more. A post office in one of my local towns has just closed, and a replacement sub-postmaster could not be found because the axe was known to be hanging over people&#146;s heads. Why would it be commercially rational for anyone to think of taking such a role at present? I hope that the Minister will therefore reassure us that the response to the consultation will be speedy, so that the damaging climate of uncertainty will not be perpetuated.</p>

 I am grateful to you for calling me, Mr. Chope. I had thought that perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) would be first, but in any event we have agreed that we shall allow each other time, so I shall be brief.</p>

Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) on securing a timely debate, and I commiserate with the Minister in his position, because he is a very pleasant Minister. I am not sure which was the lesser of two evils&#151;being here to debate post offices or being upstairs in a Committee Room debating the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill, which I understand from my colleagues has also encountered some problems. Nevertheless we are delighted to see the Minister and we are sorry that he has to deal with the problem before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000232">There should be a much more positive outlook on post offices; we should be looking to open rather than close them, and we should be considering how many post offices can be kept open. There is not necessarily any need to rely on Government subsidy; Government good will can do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000233">There are 36 potential closures in my own area of Gloucestershire, according to the Gloucestershire rural community council, and if all of them proceeded, there would be a devastating effect on the economic and social life of the local rural communities. As has been said by a number of right hon. and hon. Members, the more remote an area, the more important is the glue that a village post office provides in binding together the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000234">I want to quiz the Minister on the access criteria, because those criteria are worrying. As I intimated when I intervened on the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, it seems to me that the Government are using averages. The 95 per cent. average for rural areas is deeply worrying, because if the definition of rural areas includes suburban areas, that could mean that the more remote rural areas will have little effect on the average, so that the Government will be able to use the average as a pretext for closing more post offices in the remote rural areas than would otherwise be the case. Will the Minister give some reassurance on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000235">Will the Minister also give some clarification on the Post Office card account? I have had complaints from my constituents similar to those made by the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) about withdrawing money from such accounts. People with several hundred pounds in such accounts have been told that it is almost impossible to take out some of the money without closing the account; they either have to take out the whole amount or close the account, whereas they should be able take out only part of the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000236">I am delighted for the people who will receive a retirement package, but I caution the Minister about the thoughts that he expressed in his earlier intervention. There is going to be difficulty in recruiting postmasters or postmistresses in many remote rural areas after people have been offered such a package, particularly in the current environment, in which the Government are making access to Government services more difficult and there is a reduction in subsidies. There are high property prices in remote rural areas such as my own. If someone receives a retirement package and manages to obtain planning permission for a change of use of the post office to residential use, it will be difficult to find other potential sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000237">I plead with the Minister to use more lateral thinking, which has been mentioned so many times in the debate. On the theme of positive thinking, a broadband IT point in every post office would give access to a huge range of Government services and would enable a wide range of forms to be printed out. Education could even be undertaken remotely&#151;all sorts of things could be done if people started to do some lateral thinking. The problem is of deep concern in rural areas, many of which have very few services already. Many villages in my constituency have either no buses at all or one bus service a week, and post office closures will mean more car use, more pollution and more miserable lives, particularly for the elderly and the socially disadvantaged. As has been said, we want to increase economic and social inclusion by keeping post offices open.</p>

 I endorse the comments of all Back Benchers who have spoken so far. Rural post offices provide an intangible benefit&#151;they are the heart of many villages and are as important to local communities as the village hall. It is essential that we adopt a positive view on maintaining them and keeping them open, and I agree with what was said by my hon. Friends the Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), because they and I have practical experience of seeing elderly people in rural areas who are being deprived of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000239">Positive approaches such as leaflet distribution could encourage people to find out about ways in which local post offices could be used for parking fines, or TV licences, which I think could be reintroduced as a service. Benefit payments, agricultural payments, marketing of local produce, Google use, small-scale library services, e-commerce, eBay use and other internet and broadband use are other possibilities, together with access to PCs and laptops, planning papers, card accounts and Government information services.</p>

which is not that they are a battleground at the moment, though they certainly are in the rural areas, but because they are the heart of rural communities. They give the disabled and the infirm a point of social contact, so other people are aware if they are ill. They are a means of communication and are the heartbeat of the local community, where village and rural life can come together.

Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) put her finger on the point when she said that it is uncertainty that is killing the enthusiasm of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses to continue with their businesses. Indeed, over the past two decades, post offices have been closing at a rate of more than 300 a year. Under the previous, Conservative Government, 3,500 local post offices closed, and under Labour, another 4,000 have closed, hitting communities throughout the country. Between 2000 and 2006, nearly 1,200 rural post offices closed.</p>

In Pontneddfechan, the post office is used to provide a police presence, so that people in a very remote community can make contact with the police. That gives the post office added income. In Hundred House, a local postmaster goes to the village hall to carry out that function. In the constituency of my hon.

office services to be provided without a cost, but wherever that cost is incurred, it should be incurred in the most efficient and effective way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000247">The Government&#146;s consultation was difficult to respond to. It was a rather dry document, and responding to it required an understanding of the Post Office business that most post office users would not have had. Indeed, a month before the close of the consultation, only two responses had been received from the whole of Wales. Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses were not contacted directly. They may have been contacted electronically, but certainly when I went round the post offices in my constituency, I found that a number of the postmasters were not aware that the consultation was taking place. My hon. Friends the Members for Ceredigion and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) met Wales Office Ministers and encouraged them to intervene with the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that postmasters were aware of what was going on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000248">That was important because we had only just emerged from the urban reinvention programme for urban post offices, which led to a large number of closures. In my constituency, with about 55 post offices, only three were defined as urban, yet as a result of that process we saw the closure of the only one that we really wanted to keep open and we managed to keep open the two that could have closed at a push, whose business could have been dealt with by the main post office in the town.</p>

it, and about TV licences and car licences. The postmaster in Ystradgynlais, where there is just a post office and no other business involved in it, tells me that the number of car licences that he issues has decreased by 30 per cent. Particularly in rural areas, the presence of a post office is essential for the continuation and survival of the village shop, the village garage and all the other facilities that are so important in rural areas.</p>

Is that three miles as the crow flies or does it refer to the length of road that one needs to use to get to a post office? As my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said, if there is a mountain or loch in-between, someone may have to travel round that physical feature to get to the post office.</p>

My colleague, Kirsty Williams, the Assembly Member for my area, recently went to Llanbister, where a cash machine has opened in the post office, so there are ways in which both the Government and the Post Office can work to get good facilities for people living in what are often disadvantaged and low-income areas. Often they do not have a car or access to public transport to get them to a post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="70424h0007.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000257">I say to the Minister that I hope that closures will not be driven by the postmasters and postmistresses who are looking towards retirement. If there are to be closures, it is essential that they take place on the basis of the network and the need to serve the people, rather than of the individual needs of postmasters and postmistresses.</p>

As we know, however, it has now overseen the largest annual closures of sub-post offices around the country, and 4,000 have closed since it came to power. If we take into account the 2,500 or more that will close as a result of the current process, the Government will have been responsible for closing one third of the post office network. As we know, Adam Crozier, the chief executive, has said that he can meet his legal obligations with a network of just 4,000 post offices&#151;he is not saying that that is what he wants, but that is what he needs to meet his legal obligations. Against that backdrop, the outlook is very depressing, and 39 per cent. of sub-postmasters say that they now see no future whatever for their  <br>

business&#151;in urban areas, that figure rises to more than 50 per cent. The fact is that under this Government post offices have closed at three times the rate they did under the previous Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000270">In their proposals for the future of the post office network, the Government set out plans for their new access criteria, which, as we have heard, sound impressive. They include ensuring that 99 per cent. of the population lives within one mile of a post office and that 95 per cent. of people in rural areas live within three miles of one. However, those distances are measured as the crow flies. Although they take account of some major geological and geographical factors, they generally do not take account of the roads, many of which, as we have heard, are very windy in rural areas, where it will often be much more than three miles to the nearest post office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000271">The Government&#146;s pledge is essentially meaningless, because the Prime Minister&#146;s performance and innovation unit has said that it would be possible for the Post Office to close two thirds of its rural outlets while still ensuring that 99 per cent. of people in rural areas live within three miles of a post office. What will the criterion for closure be? Will it be just the volume of business? Will it be the distance to the nearest post office? Will it be the areas to which people say they want to retire? If closures are carried out on the basis of distance, not only the most marginal post offices, but successful local ones could be forced to close. There is profound concern about how the whole process will go forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000272">We also fully recognise that the post office network faces particular challenges. Only about 1,500 rural post offices are making money, and the rest require subsidies. We have heard that about 1,000 rural post offices have fewer than 50 customers a week. The Government have told us that the annual subsidy of about &#163;160 million will remain, but since they said that, they have admitted that they are not guaranteeing that level of subsidy and that it is the maximum level. The subsidy could therefore be significantly reduced as soon as the Government have got the coming set of elections behind them. Originally, the subsidy was intended to support rural post offices, but it must now be spread more thinly across the entire network. Is the volume of subsidy for each post office therefore likely to decline? And what consequences would that have for the support available to local post offices?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000273">We have heard much about Government business being taken away from the post office network&#151;the figure for last year alone was &#163;168 million. In some areas, however, the position is being made even more difficult. If I go online to renew my car tax, those involved can check automatically on their computer whether my insurance is up to date and the car has an MOT certificate. If I go to a post office, staff will not have a computer link to enable them to establish those facts. The ground is therefore being tipped against the Post Office, and things are being made even more difficult for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000274">When the Government announced that they would phase out the post office card account, we and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats called on them to replace it, and we are pleased that they have decided to offer a new card. However, the process will be subject to commercial tender, and it is possible that PayPoint, with about 18,000 outlets, will choose to bid. If the Post Office loses out, that will be an absolute hammer blow for it.  <br>

At the moment, people must physically go into the post office to enter their PIN number, but if they end up going to a different store to use PayPoint, they will not use some of the money that they take out in post offices and not bring those post offices additional business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000275">The Post Office is unable to invest at the same level as PayPoint, which has outstanding levels of technology in that respect. One issue that the Minister must address is what he will do about the structure of the Post Office and Royal Mail to allow them to compete. The Post Office and Royal Mail more generally are being starved of investment, because Royal Mail does not have access under its current structure to the funds that it needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000276">There are wider issues of ownership. Submissions have been made, and Royal Mail has put forward its views on a future structure. However, the Government&#146;s delays and dithering mean that they might undermine this vital institution still further. The Post Office has excellent management, particularly in Adam Crozier and Allan Leighton, who are doing an outstanding job. However, there is a risk that they will simply pull up stumps and walk away if the Government do not decide how to resolve the issue of the Post Office&#146;s long-term structure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000277">What is missing from the Government&#146;s strategy is a vision of what the Post Office could be doing, how it could play an even more vibrant part in our local communities and how we could bring more business to it&#151;an issue touched on by many of those who have spoken. The Post Office should have the freedom to offer additional services and to work with other carriers. Many more local government services should be operated through its network and much more should be done to bring in new business. The Government are overlooking the non-economic aspects of the Post Office, and they have failed to understand the importance of post offices as a hub in the local community. They have overlooked the non-financial benefits, such as when post office staff identify that things are going wrong and that somebody has not been in to collect their pension. The greatest disappointment is that the Minister has been in his job for almost a year, but there is no new thinking. We have had no answers to our questions and no statement in response to the consultation document.</p>
<a name="07042430000457">
<p>The Post Office still faces an uncertain future and continuing decline, and the Minister is doing nothing to prevent that. When the history of the Government is written, their abject failure to stop the decline of the Post Office network when they had the opportunity to do so will be one of the clearest reasons for their losing the trust of the British people.</p>

After a transfer from the direct management of Post Office Ltd, staff at franchise offices receive the same training as employees of Post Office Ltd. All the evidence from mystery shopper visits and feedback groups suggests high customer satisfaction. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) was among hon. Members who asked about the length of the contracts with WH Smith. The contract guarantees that a branch will operate for a minimum period of seven years. In the extremely unlikely event that WH Smith did not want to renew the contract when the initial period expired, Post Office Ltd would act to ensure that the main post office services were retained.</p>

and to expand its services. The vast majority of sub-post offices are individual small businesses. They have the licence to expand services, although there are one or two restrictions, such as using PayPoint to serve contracts that they already have with other suppliers; that is obviously a bit of a contradiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000291">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) asked about the consultation. More than 2,500 hard copies of the consultation document were issued by the Department, including to Postwatch and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. The consultation document was also available electronically through the Department of Trade and Industry and Directgov websites, and was downloaded 3,700 times; so more than 6,000 took the opportunity. As to remarks about sub-postmasters not knowing that the consultation was going on, I do not for a second challenge them, but with the national publicity and the campaigns being run by virtually every regional newspaper in the country, and some nationals, one or two of which actually mentioned me, I find it hard to accept that sub-postmasters do not know what is happening to their services&#151;especially when the national federation is so centrally involved.</p>

The proposed criteria were designed to balance the Government&#146;s desire to preserve a national network with the need to put Post Office Ltd on a more sustainable footing. They were developed in a way that would offer as much protection as possible to vulnerable communities most in need of Post Office services. Clearly, we accept that there is no &#147;one size fits all&#148; approach and that there are geographical obstacles to be overcome. When we deal with the consultation with Post Office Ltd we shall be able to address some of the points that have been raised.</p>

Much has been made, rightly, of the valuable social role played by post offices. Not only do we accept that, but we are putting our money where our mouth is, by supporting them to the tune of &#163;1.7 billion between now and 2011. In May we shall be presenting our response to the thousands of submissions that we have had following our announcement on 14 December. However, it makes no sense to suggest that we should remove the choice of how services can be accessed, and force people to use post offices. Last year, for example, more than 5 million people renewed their car tax disc online. That was 4 million more than the previous year.</p>

 Thank you for those comments, Sir Nicholas. I have indeed had approaches from two Labour Members, and I think that some of my colleagues may also wish to speak, but they should let you know if that is the case. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000299">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue, although, unfortunately, addressing Ministers on it is all too familiar. I have faced successive Ministers&#151;both Labour and Conservative&#151;in a large number of Adjournment debates over the years. Indeed, back in 1988 and 1989, I warned the then Conservative Government&#146;s Ministers and MPs that privatisation would lead to unbearably high bills in the south-west, not least because the cutting off of the public and European Union funds that were needed to clean up beaches would leave the region to foot an unreasonable proportion of the national cost of those programmes. I was ignored, but when rates did rocket, I heard Conservatives claim that they had not seen it coming. That was probably the most decisive single issue that led to the loss of Conservative seats in our part of the country, so perhaps they should have listened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para25"><a name="07042430000300">When I faced Labour Ministers on this issue in the past, I met them with a degree of sympathy about the difficulties of tackling that messy legacy. It was not Labour&#146;s fault that the Conservatives radically underestimated the cost of cleaning up Britain&#146;s beaches and left only a &#163;1.5 billion so-called green dowry from the much larger proceeds of privatisation for what turned out to be a &#163;6 billion job. They left bill payers to cover the difference, and used the receipts to cut taxes for the very wealthy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="70424h0008.htm_para26"><a name="07042430000301">It is harder to excuse the fact that 10 years into the Labour Administration we are here again because the surface of the problem has not even been scratched, let alone the problem resolved. This is the fifth Liberal Democrat-initiated debate since Labour has been in government, and debates have also been initiated by Labour Members who made much the same case. I welcome the fact that they have been raising this issue.</p>

For low-income families and the disabled, who may use quite high levels of water, especially those families with children, as the hon. Lady said, having a meter might not be a better option; but unmetered bills can average a staggering &#163;650. Also, many people do not have the option of having a meter. A couple of surgeries ago, I was approached by an elderly pensioner who was told by South West Water that it was not possible to fit a meter. He therefore has to pay the full &#163;650.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000311">By 2009-10, the average bill in the south-west will cost about &#163;700 in today&#146;s money, and the average working household will be paying twice the national average on water and sewerage.</p>

 I want to follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy). At our last meeting with Ministers from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Minister promised that he would help to lead a joint meeting with the Treasury, because co-operation from both Departments is needed to tackle this issue. A couple of weeks ago, at Treasury questions, the Economic Secretary rejected that idea. Will my hon. Friend continue to press the Minister to ensure that that cross-departmental meeting goes ahead for all the reasons that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton outlined?</p>

 I will, and I believe that specific issues could be tabled for discussion at that meeting, for which it would be useful to have both Ministers present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000314">It is worth making a few comparisons, because the Minister may not realise how high are the bills that we pay. Many Ministers pay charges in the capital and have earnings much higher than the average earnings in our part of the country. The average bill in London was just &#163;275 this year. That is a difference of &#163;208, which means that the average bill in the south-west is 75 per cent. higher than in the capital&#151;nearly 150 per cent. with unmetered bills.</p>

 I shall seek clarification from the Minister on that, and I shall come to that point shortly. DEFRA accepts that those changes will add to bills, but I do not think that its figures are very reliable. Rather than helping to reduce bills, the plans regarding private sewers will increase them. DEFRA estimates that the increase will be anything from &#163;3 to &#163;11, but the industry believes that it will be much higher. My  <br>

experience from dealing with large numbers of constituents who face problems with this issue tells me that costs are likely to be extremely high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000317">I do not believe that the figures take into account the fact that those sewers are likely to be extremely dilapidated and will therefore require very high levels of capital infrastructure costs, and not just maintenance costs. Typically, in our part of the world, many of the estates were not officially adopted when they were built precisely because their sewerage systems were not of an adequate quality and were often made of pitch fibre. They are currently collapsing and often need replacing. Whilst that is a huge issue for the residents of those estates, simply deciding to bung the problem on to South West Water bills without an adequate calculation of the likely increase in bills could leave us saddled with a repetition of the mistakes that the Conservatives made in the late 1980s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000318">In my last debate on this, in 2005, I got the distinct feeling that the Minister who responded saw bills as a south-west problem and a south-west responsibility, but the entire country benefits from our coastline. In 2003, Cornwall alone received 5 million UK tourist visitors and there were 25 million tourist nights. Those figures do not include the 2 million overseas visitors. Our part of the coastline is part of the bedrock of Britain&#146;s tourist industry and is a national asset, but just 3 per cent. of the national population is bearing the cost of cleaning up to a third of the national beaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000319">At the heart of the debate, more than the question of who should pay for what and who benefits from what, is the fact that the people who are paying for all this are the poorest in the UK. It is a mistake of the Minister&#146;s Conservative predecessors, but surely a concern of the Labour party, that people on such low incomes, in such high levels of poverty, are paying such big bills without any help from the benefit system in the way in which it would help them out with housing or council tax costs.</p>

 My hon. Friend would agree that when South West Water was set up&#151;this applies to many other such companies&#151;a risk-free money extortion system was created for those receiving dividends as shareholders of the company. They could predict the dividends that they would accrue at the end of the year, and the comparison should be made with the poverty of the people who have to pay the bills. This situation will continue and will perennially be a problem unless a Government intervene and provide better regulation to give customers a better deal.</p>

Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) secured an Adjournment debate in the main Chamber on 14 November 2005, when she was told that the Government&#146;s approach was to &#147;tackle low incomes generally.&#148; Water bills in the region have continued to rise while we have been tackling serious poverty, particularly in Cornwall, where wages are among the bottom 2 per cent. nationally, and while the gap between Cornish incomes and national incomes has widened since 1997.</p>

poverty, but will he consider the fact that the average water bill of &#163;483 eats up 7 per cent. of the disposable income of a single pensioner who is in receipt of pension credit? Measures have been designed to tackle the problem, but they have not addressed the scale of the problem of water bills. A national income tax rate of 7 per cent. for water bills would cause an explosion of anger, but that is what many people on low incomes in the south-west face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000324">Given the time constraints, I want to shift my focus to solutions. I have consistently called for action to remove the disproportionate and unfair burden of unaffordable bills from households in the south-west. This is not just a matter of high profits, so even the toughest regulation would not provide a solution. In the financial year 2005-06, South West Water&#146;s return on capital employed&#151;the equivalent of the interest rate that the company could get by banking the money in a financial institution&#151;was 4.8 per cent. That is a slight reduction on the year before, and the figure is the lowest of any water company in England and Wales. The company also has the lowest costs of borrowing, so while there might be room for manoeuvre at the margin, we are not talking about a solution to the high bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000325">The high rates reflect the genuinely high costs of the clean-up, especially the capital costs of the &#147;clean sweep&#148; scheme. In addition, the company now has to pay the costs of the capital invested. We need a mechanism for redistributing the environmental costs more fairly across the country. As the Conservatives faced loss of office, we reached a point when the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), took a proposal to Cabinet for such a funding increase, but it was turned down by his Cabinet colleagues. There is no indication that Labour has changed the view in any way, but I would like to know what the Minister&#146;s position is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000326">Labour has put in place exactly such a mechanism in relation to bills in Northern Ireland&#151;it has capped the level of those bills&#151;and that is funded by UK taxpayers. It is hard to see why the Government take one view on Northern Ireland but another one on the south-west. They have also introduced a similar mechanism for electricity bill payers in northern Scotland, who would have otherwise faced disproportionately high bills. I do not believe that such help breaks any rule that the Government have seen through; it is more likely that they simply see helping out the south-west as being too expensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000327">I do not want to concentrate on what I believe the Government will continue to reject, much as my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I will continue to campaign. I want to examine other options. There is the possibility of extending the benefits system at some level to try to help those on low incomes. The Government should re-examine that because bills have continued to soar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000328">In addition to lasting solutions such as that, action could be taken on second home owners. Second homes have been switching to using meters, because as they are unoccupied for much of the year, their bills are much lower than average. Yet holiday-home owners are perhaps the greatest beneficiaries of the beach clean-up programme for which they are now avoiding paying. Every second home that switches to using a meter, and cuts its bills in the process, increases bills for everyone else, because South West Water still has to raise the same sums overall.

58,000 households&#151;are to be found in the south-west. Taking them up to the average levels of payment would not cut overall bills significantly, but doing so could at least create a fund to help with the benefits system and to help those on low incomes to pay those bills.</p>

Customers identified as struggling to pay their bills&#151;those who are not paying or who have contacted the company to say that they cannot pay&#151;are actively contacted. The bailiffs are not simply sent in, nor do warning letters simply come through. The company now actively contacts people to offer advice on their billing and to see whether they could go on to a lower rate or benefit from a water meter. Practical help in installing low-water-use devices is available; the company will pay for people to get things such as low-water-use cistern devices and water-saving shower heads. The company will help people to move to a more comfortable debt repayment scheme and offer a new start on their water bills, rather than having the bailiffs press them for money that they simply do not have.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000332">That is a solution for a tiny number. It is no long-term solution, because people&#146;s bills continue to be high even after much of that action. The Consumer Council for Water, South West Water and DEFRA are examining whether, short of some of the big scale, long-term solution that I would press for, we can at least find systems that reduce the bill for ordinary families and pensioners in the south-west by changing the tariff regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000333">I am thinking of the so-called rising block, whereby people would pay an affordable amount for an amount of water that would allow their household to operate on a reasonable basis through the year and would provide essentials, such as washing and toilet functions. The cost would be relatively low, and as people start to use more water, for example for watering the garden, running a swimming pool and so on, they would start to pay higher rates. That is the so-called rising block tariff and I understand that the Minister may have DEFRA&#146;s research on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000334">I call for Ministers to give an open door to such a scheme being trialled in the south-west, although I do so with caveats. The first is that the Government would have to share information on household numbers, because we know that larger households with a lot of children need to use greater amounts of water, thus a rising block tariff could hit larger families hard were it done on a simple per-property basis. The second is that the needs of some disabled people who have relatively high levels of water use arising out of their disabilities would have to be recognised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000335">Finally, we would need to examine the second home issue seriously, because such properties already benefit from the installation of meters and use water for only part of the year. A rising block tariff could give them an even bigger discount as a result, so the systems should apply specifically to occupied households. A consideration of the numbers in full-time residence at a household would catch that particular issue.</p>

She raised with the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell the issue of private sewerage, and I give her the assurance that she sought that the matter is at the forefront of Ministers&#146; thinking. The Government have decided in principle to transfer private sewers to the company. We shall consult on the route and timing of that transfer, and take full account of the cost to customers when we do so. Ofwat provided a model of the impact on bills of the decision on private sewerage. That produced a range of different impacts for each company, and that will be clarified and improved as we develop the approach for adopting private sewers.</p>

each customer to pay for the costs incurred by their water company. Identifying the problems does not necessarily mean that there are easy solutions, and so far none of the ideas has been a complete solution in the interests of customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para25"><a name="07042430000343">The hon. Gentleman&#146;s party has put forward a number of ideas for reducing the burden on South West Water&#146;s customers. They have often involved shifting the burden to national taxpayers or water customers in other parts of the country. I wonder how many &#147;Focus&#148; leaflets are being put out in London stating that people in Twickenham should pay more to help out the people of Truro and St. Austell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para26"><a name="07042430000344">Like other companies, water companies must meet their costs, including the costs of running services and of meeting drinking water and environmental standards. Ultimately, all those costs are paid by their customers. Ofwat sets an upper limit on customer prices, but there is a strong and visible link between what the company spends and what customers fund through their bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para27"><a name="07042430000345">I am not convinced that it would be right to break that link. There is a considerable risk that any national fund to support water companies&#146; costs from customers throughout the country would weaken the connection between the water company and the customer. There is a question whether companies would pay as much heed to their customers if customers throughout the country met the cost of their plans. There would be a lack of accountability and a weakening of the incentive to individual companies to keep their costs as low as possible. Any such solutions would run counter to the present legislative and regulatory framework. I also doubt that customers in other regions, each with their own problems and costs, would agree that they should shoulder the impact of any redistribution of South West Water&#146;s costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para28"><a name="07042430000346">The hon. Gentleman brought up the particular point about redistributing the environmental costs throughout the country. Since privatisation, every sewerage company in England has had to meet the same list of legal requirements for sewage treatment, but those legal requirements vary in different parts of the country. The basic requirement everywhere is for secondary treatment of sewage, and there are more stringent standards on top of that in designated sensitive areas. Those areas include designated bathing water, as the hon. Gentleman said, as well as many fresh water sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="70424h0009.htm_para29"><a name="07042430000347">What is necessary to deliver those standards has varied widely and depended on the sewerage company&#146;s starting point at privatisation&#151;what sewerage network and treatment plants they had to start with. The cost of improvements to meet the required standards also depended on the size of the work, and in the south-west the scattered population has resulted in smaller treatment works, many of which do not offer the same economies of scale that other regions are able to enjoy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para0"><a name="07042430000348">There is an essential truth in the suggestion that sewage treatment is inherently more expensive in the south-west, although the requirements are the same. That is the historic picture of costs, but although the principle of meeting the same standards will hold, customers of water companies will continue to face issues and costs particular to their regions. For example, the customers of Thames Water will, over the next few years, have to meet the costs of further improvements to water quality in the Thames tideway&#151;a necessary but  <br>

 The hon. Gentleman left me very short of time, and I want to respond to some of the specific points that he raised, so I shall press on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000351">Another reason why the Government are sceptical about the idea of the customers of one water company subsidising those of another is that such a subsidy would be very difficult to target. The overall effect would be that low-income customers in other water company areas would subsidise all customers, including owners of second homes in the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000352">I would like to speak positively about what can be done about water bills. The true water affordability problem is for those who are least able to pay. That is particularly serious in areas with high water charges and low incomes, and it is worst of all in the south-west. That is the problem that we must look at, and it would not be addressed by blanket subsidies to all customers, including the well-off in the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000353">The Government acknowledge that there is an issue with water affordability, particularly for those with the lowest incomes. We have already taken action, through legislation, when there might be a risk to household health. We have legislated to stop household water disconnection because of inability to pay. We have also set up protection for vulnerable groups on meters who might otherwise cut back on water that they could not afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000354">In 2004, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, a cross-Government steering group reviewed the way low-income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. A wide range of stakeholders were involved in discussions with the steering group, and the Government published their report on the review in 2005. Since then, the Government have been working with Ofwat, water companies and the Consumer Council for Water to take forward the recommendations in that report. They include measures, which I am sure hon. Members are aware of, to look into alternative tariff and charging options, and a pilot study in the south-west. I would like to talk briefly about the progress of that work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000355">The first strand is to look at the scope for redistributing the burden among customers of a company through tariffs and charges. The Government reviewed methods of water charging and tariffs in 1997-98, which resulted in the Water Industry Act 1999, including protection against disconnection and the free meter option. We are currently working with water companies to develop a model to look at the distribution effect of tariffs, particularly the winners and losers that would be created among households. The model is looking at the effects of a wide range of measured and unmeasured tariffs. One tariff that the group is looking at is the rising block tariff, offering a free or cheap basic amount of water to a household, with higher charges above that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000356">We have set up a working level group to look at the results of that work, and to advise on how lower income groups might be affected by any change to the current charging system. The members include representatives from the Treasury, Ofwat, the Consumer Council for Water and water companies. The group is considering how tariffs might distribute the total burden of a company&#146;s  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000357">There has been discussion about whether second home owners pay a fair share of costs. The Government recognise that there are issues about the balance between fixed costs of the network and costs that vary according to how much water is used. Ofwat regulate that balance when it approves company charge schemes. I certainly agree that second homes should pay a fair share, and we are willing to look at any proposals to improve fairness on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000358">The other strand of work from the report is the south-west affordability assistance pilot study.

 The pilot study in the south-west is attacking the affordability issue on two fronts: helping households to make savings on their water bills, and increasing their income through benefits checks. The average household toilet uses about 30 per cent. of a property&#146;s water supply, and the relatively cheap installation of a toilet hippo will reduce toilet water usage by one third. Estimates based on expertise with similar energy-related schemes suggest that benefits entitlement checks can increase incomes by up to &#163;25 a week. The hon.

 The streets of the west end of London&#151;in particular, Soho and Covent Garden&#151;have become a dangerous free-for-all. I worry that it is a matter of when, rather than if, a serious accident&#151;perhaps even a fatality&#151;occurs involving one of the unlicensed rickshaws or pedicabs that have proliferated so strikingly on London&#146;s thoroughfares. That situation is not acceptable in a 21st-century global marketplace such as London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000369">Two facts clearly illustrate the situation with regard to unmotorised cycles for hire&#151;pedicabs&#151;in London. First, the pedicab industry still operates without almost any enforceable external controls over licensing, registration or traffic management. Secondly, pedicab numbers are rising very quickly indeed. The latest estimates are that within the city of Westminster alone, their numbers have risen by some 50 per cent. in the past six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000370">The issue is not confined to the west end of London, and I appreciate that there are an increasing number of pedicabs in places such as Brighton. Within London, the issue is not confined to my constituency, and I suspect that my neighbours in Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North and in Holborn and St. Pancras have similar concerns, albeit on a different scale from mine. Tonight, it is estimated that some 500 pedicabs will be out on the streets of Westminster touting for business. Naturally, the situation will become ever more acute as spring turns into summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000371">It is important to realise that many people and groups are completely opposed to pedicabs operating on our streets in any form&#151;I shall represent their views, although I do not agree with them entirely, because I believe that pedicabs make for some of the colour of the life that we live in London&#151;and that other people want pedicabs licensed as quickly as possible. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, for example, which represents about 7,000 drivers in the capital, has always been strongly opposed to pedicabs. The association claims that its opposition does not stem from a fear of competition, because pedicab rides are typically very short journeys that would otherwise be taken on foot or by bus rather than by cab. Rather, its concern stems from pedicab riders&#146; daily infringement of traffic and parking regulations, and from seeing the real danger that pedicab passengers and riders face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000372">Even with a licensing regime, the LTDA claims that there is an urgent necessity&#151;recognised by all parties, including the Government&#151;for parking and traffic regulations to be applied to pedicabs, as they are to other licensed vehicles. The provisions to achieve that purpose were included in the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Bill, but the Government blocked them in Committee in November 2005. The LTDA has since repeatedly urged the Government to bring forward the necessary legislation as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000373">On the other hand, the London Pedicab Operators Association has brought some 200 riders into its organisation, which although a welcome development, still represents a minority of operators. The LPOA encourages higher safety standards for pedicabs, but the pedicabs that passengers climb into tonight are likely to  <br>

be dangerously unsafe in several ways. First, without background checks, it is perfectly feasible for criminals to operate pedicabs, which is entirely unacceptable in the operation of black cabs, for example. At least one rape has been committed by a pedicab operator, and further anecdotal evidence suggests that riders include illegal immigrants, foreign students, who ignore the terms under which they are allowed into the country by working longer hours than authorised, and others who under any sensible licensing regime would be considered unsuitable for such work and daily contact with the public. We do not tolerate such risks for licensed cab drivers or bus drivers, and we should not tolerate it for this new mode of transport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000374">Although the taxi drivers do not agree with me, I think that the pedicabs are here to stay. In a way, it is a mode of transport that looks to the past: all who have travelled to India and China will have seen rickshaws and pedicabs. There is a certain convenience that comes with a pedicab, and it adds to the colour and gaiety of city life here in London. They are here to stay, and we must consider the manner of their regulation. The Minister and I have discussed the issue privately, and she knows that I am instinctively wary of ever more legislation and regulation. Quite rightly, the Department believes that registration should be a last resort, but I suspect that the proliferation of pedicabs means that on road and personal safety grounds, we must give the issue much more urgent consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000375">Secondly, the pedicab does not have any safety requirements whatever, presenting a major risk to passengers and other road users. Again, such a situation simply would not be tolerated for any other mode of transport. Thirdly, without adequate powers to enforce traffic regulations, pedicabs are able to flout parking and wider traffic rules. Tonight, if one were to go from Regent street, where the pedicabs parked outside Hamleys block the bus lane, to Cambridge circus or to any west end theatre, one would see that we must urgently enforce traffic regulations on the grounds of safety and because of the duty of local authorities to manage the transport network properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000376">In an operation lasting just six months in the Charing Cross area, Westminster city council&#146;s community protection team warned 124 pedicab operators for obstruction of the highway. Nine operators were subsequently arrested, and of those, seven were successfully prosecuted for wilful obstruction. The other two failed to appear in court. The highest fine paid so far has been a rather derisory &#163;75 with &#163;35 costs. The London Pedicab Operators Association claims to have an insurance policy that costs &#163;275 per pedicab per annum, but I do not know whether it covers serious injury to drivers, passengers, or indeed pedestrians who are caught up in any accidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000377">The Charing Cross initiative was a small-scale operation over a limited period, and because of the current dearth of legislation, it did not cover the full range of traffic offences that affect my constituency day and night. Due to the complete absence of a registration regime, it is impossible to verify how many offences pedicab riders have committed. That represents a truly dangerous gap in our knowledge. The anecdotal evidence that I have heard from people who spend their evenings in theatreland, or who are local residents of Soho or Covent Garden, suggests that the study has revealed only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000379">I hope that the Government will use their influence to ensure that any licensing regime requires operators to undergo a full check before being allowed to work, just as with any other operator of public transport, and ensures that riders have a good working knowledge of the area in which they operate and that they are physically fit. Any regime should also ensure that vehicles are fit for purpose and not in imminent danger of toppling over, which is the case with so many older pedicabs, that fares are standardised and that operators face the same penalties as other road users in the event of their contravening traffic regulations. However, if we are genuinely serious about protecting road users and pedestrians, we urgently need to give local authorities statutory powers to enforce traffic and parking rules against contraventions by pedicabs, in accordance with any licensing regime. It has become abundantly clear over recent months that the only truly feasible way of achieving that would be to introduce primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000380">Westminster city council&#146;s parking attendants have no means by which to issue penalty charge notices to pedicabs, despite the fact that any recent visitor to the west end cannot have failed to notice the pedicabs blocking roads, junctions and bus lanes, undermining emergency access to streets and pavements as a result, and generally making an already challenging transport network that much more difficult for pedestrians and other road users. I am sure that the Minister would be happy to come to the west end&#151;unlike the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who was perhaps not terribly inclined to go down to the west country&#151;and see for herself what Westminster city council is doing on the ground to ensure that the unlicensed hazard of pedicabs is kept to an absolute minimum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000381">I hope the Minister will do two things in responding to this debate, both of which would make a huge difference to residents, businesses, visitors and, importantly, tourists, who will be flooding into central London in the weeks and months ahead as summer arrives. I should like her to undertake that she will do everything that she can to ensure that a licensing regime is introduced for pedicabs as soon as possible. I should also like her to impress upon TFL the importance of its current work to introduce a licensing regime and to include the detail that passengers and other road users are currently subject to far too many risks every night.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000382">Furthermore, I would be grateful if the Minister were to undertake that the Government will introduce primary legislation that will allow local authorities to use their traffic enforcement powers against pedicabs, just as they do against other vehicles. The Department for Transport has previously assured us that primary legislation already exists to bring pedicabs into line with other  <br>

vehicles in law. However, the search for that legislation has proved fruitless and local authorities&#146; hands have remained tied.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000383">In the past, the Department for Transport has suggested that once the licensing regime was in place, local authorities could issue traffic management orders to enforce the rules on pedicabs. That is not really a workable solution, because a TMO to ban pedicabs from using the pavement, for example, would mean Westminster city council being obliged to erect large signs all over the city of Westminster, as it is required to do when enforcing such a TMO. That would lead to a bureaucratic nightmare and would not be a solution to the problem of pedicabs, given the relatively small locality in which it exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para25"><a name="07042430000384">It would not be overstating the case to say that we are not far off experiencing our first fatality involving pedicabs. I hope that the Department for Transport will bear that in mind as it prepares any new legislation. With the Olympics approaching, we cannot allow this dangerous situation to continue. We cannot seek to manage London&#146;s transport network with so little knowledge about the vehicles on our roads, not least because of the problems with gridlock.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para26"><a name="07042430000385">Let me summarise the situation as it is. Westminster city council wants to improve the experience of going out in the west end. That is understandable and in all our interests, given the importance of tourism as a major driver of imports and central London&#146;s role in that regard, which cannot be overstated. Safe transport is a major part of that offer. London&#146;s increasing numbers of unlicensed pedicabs represent a threat to the safety of passengers and the reputation of London. It is extremely difficult for traffic authorities in London to enforce parking and moving vehicle traffic rules against contraventions by pedicabs, given the current lack of any registration and licensing regime, and the absence of powers to allow highways authorities to issue fines to drivers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para27"><a name="07042430000386">TFL intends to introduce a full licensing regime for pedicabs following its consultation process, and I welcome that co-operation going forward. However, new legislative provisions are needed to allow the current enforcement regimes for parking and moving traffic contraventions to include pedicabs, too. Those provisions will be required to enable the proper regulation of pedicabs as they conduct their business, and to ensure that they are subject to the same safety regulations that apply to other road users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70424h0010.htm_para28"><a name="07042430000387">Amendments were tabled to the Road Safety Act 2006 during its passage in the previous Session, and supported my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Scott). They were resisted by the Department for Transport, on the grounds that alternative legislative routes might be available. Similar objections were made to my amendments to the Greater London Authority Bill. However, I hope that the Minister will find the opportunity in the very near future to improve the safety of pedicabs, and therefore to enhance and protect the reputation of the west end as a showcase for London.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) on securing this debate on an issue of concern to many people who are interested in transport  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="24 Apr 2007">

<notus-date day="24" month="4" year="2007" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><b>24 Apr 2007 : Column 259WH</b><br>
safety, and in the very essence of our capital city, in which we have much pride, and its development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para0"><a name="07042430000389">Let me begin by saying that the Government believe that pedicabs have a role to play in transport provision, provided that they are properly regulated and managed. In that respect, I was glad to meet my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck) and the hon. Gentleman, as well as interested parties, to discuss how we can sensibly accept that point and move forward. A number of people, including the hon. Gentleman and me, welcome pedicabs as an addition to the diversity of city life, particularly in our tourist areas, but I also know only too well that not everybody takes that view. For example, as the hon. Gentleman said, many taxi drivers would prefer pedicabs to be banned from London&#146;s streets altogether.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000390">The issue, as I see it, has always been about how to achieve proper regulation in the public interest and how to ensure safety. The issue specific to London is that there is currently no system of pedicab regulation in the capital. A proper system of regulation in London is both necessary and desirable. On that basis, I very much welcome the steps being taken by Transport for London, as the taxi licensing authority in London, to put in place measures to bring pedicabs into its existing taxi licensing regime. That is essentially a matter for TFL to take forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000391">Once achieved, licensing will provide a means of exercising comprehensive but appropriate control over pedicabs in London. That will include dealing with important questions to do with safety and standards, about which the hon. Gentleman is rightly concerned. Licensing will also involve defining areas of operation, as well as the vetting, listing and identification of pedicabs, their operators and their riders, and of course the use of Criminal Records Bureau checks. Licensing will deal with the enforcement of those standards and rules, to ensure that the services offered are reliable and safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000392">The hon. Gentleman referred to what he described as the Government blocking the inclusion of relevant provisions in the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Bill, in 2005. I assure the Chamber that that was not the case. Those provisions were removed by the Committee considering that private Bill after taking account of the views expressed to them, including those of pedicab operators and the taxi trade. Our view was that the weak registration system that the provisions proposed for pedicabs was an inadequate response to the safety and regulatory concerns about pedicabs, and that only a full, enforceable licensing system of the sort that TFL now proposes would provide the right answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000393">Last year, TFL carried out a public consultation on its proposals. It set out in full how the organisation proposes to tackle all aspects of regulation. It is now for TFL to take the matter forward in light of responses to that consultation. In so doing, I am sure that it will take full account of the views of pedicab operators and others on the principle and details of its proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000394">I understand that TFL is now working on the necessary amendments to the London cab order to facilitate the licensing of pedicabs. It is seeking the right balance between regulation and control, and the particular needs and circumstances of the pedicab industry. I also understand that TFL is in the process of securing the necessary  <br>

clarification from the courts. That would reverse a previous decision that prevented pedicabs from being classified as taxis for the purposes of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000395">Securing that clarification is one of the main reasons why the introduction of licensing has taken more time than all sides would have hoped. The matter remains before the courts, and the hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot speculate on the likely outcome of the court&#146;s deliberations, although I can say that TFL, having considered all aspects of the issue, remains confident of a successful outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000396">It is important to make early progress, but it is also important to get the detail of the new licensing arrangements right. On that basis, I welcome TFL&#146;s proposal to initiate discussions with the representatives of the pedicab trade about the trade&#146;s proposal for a voluntary licensing scheme, ahead of the resolution of the remaining legal issues. TFL is hopeful that a voluntary scheme, if that proves possible, could become the basis for the enforceable licensing scheme that it is trying to achieve. The Government share TFL&#146;s hopes and ambitions in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000397">I recognise that without a satisfactory enforcement regime, licensing will not help local authorities achieve suitable regulation in the public interest and ensure protection. The regulations to enforce the Traffic Management Act 2004 will enable enforcement action to be taken against any vehicle that contravenes local traffic regulation orders about parking, bus lanes and issues such as banned turns, pedestrian zones and one-way streets. I do not share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that further primary legislation is required. It is incumbent on us all not to seek extra legislation unless it is required. As soon as a robust licensing system is in place and keeper information is available, local authorities can take action against pedicabs that break those traffic management orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000398">I listened closely to the hon. Gentleman. He raised the question of pedicabs parking on the pavement. Once again, I do not believe that primary legislation is the way forward. To be effective, decisions about what vehicles should have the right to park and where can only, in practice, be taken by local authorities. That is why they have been given the power to make traffic management orders. Instead of attempting to introduce unnecessary primary legislation, local authorities should use the powers that they have been given, and that they wanted, to ban the inappropriate parking of pedicabs on the pavement so that there is no illegal parking to cause difficulty for pedicab passengers and the general public.</p>

<p><a name="st_104"><a name="07042430000399"><a name="70424h0011.htm_spnew0"><a name="07042430000598"><b>Mr. Mark Field:</b>
 Our concern about traffic management orders is that allowing one local authority to have particular rules and another to have different ones&#151;or, indeed, none at all&#151;often means that the problem is simply displaced. It could also lead to a very confused system among adjacent local authorities. Obviously, I am considering the London context, but the same could apply beyond the boundaries of the capital. The local authorities concerned feel that although having the discretion to make traffic management orders provides a potential opportunity, it is relatively unworkable. Relying simply on it rather than on the primary legislation route could be a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>

 Clearly, local solutions are necessary to meet local conditions, and such decisions should be made at the local level. Although I take the point about adjacent local authorities, particularly in respect of London, there is nothing to stop local authorities from co-operating on such issues; indeed, I would encourage them to do so. However, they might be the first to complain if we took away local decision making and put it elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000401">The hon. Gentleman expressed concern that a ban introduced by a traffic management order would have to be indicated by traffic signs on the street. Restrictions should be clearly signed for all concerned. One of the most frequent concerns expressed by road users is that traffic signs are not clear about what restrictions are in place, so restrictions are broken inadvertently. Information should always be widely available in the appropriate form, through traffic signs or other means, so that everybody can abide by them. We are seeking to prevent the problem, rather than cure it afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para11"><a name="07042430000402">As I have stressed, our objective is to support TFL and the London boroughs so that they are in a position to ensure safety and secure the proper regulation of pedicabs in the public interest.

We will continue to work closely with TFL and its partners to find a satisfactory outcome.</p>

 Good afternoon, Sir Nicholas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000404">The timing of this debate could not be more appropriate and I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of generation in its broadest sense from the River Severn. I deliberately did not call the debate &#147;The Severn Barrage&#148; or &#147;Fifteen things you didn&#146;t know about tidal lagoons&#148;. The idea behind the debate is that there seems to be an overwhelming case for making far more use of the River Severn&#146;s tidal power and I urge the Government to take a lead on the idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000405">The timing of the debate is significant for two reasons; the Minister will be familiar with one, but not the other. The Minister knows that an energy White Paper is due imminently. I hope that the ink on it is not quite dry and that my representations even at this late stage will encourage him to ensure that a serious, publicly funded appraisal of the options, benefits and costs of different forms of power generation from the Severn becomes an important feature of that document. That is one of the principal reasons why I have sought this debate now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000406">The second reason, of which the Minister may not be aware, why the timing of this debate is particularly appropriate is that I have just extensively consulted my constituents. I e-mailed several thousand of them to ask their views on whether they support in principle a Severn barrage. I posed it in that way not because I have a closed mind on the issue&#151;I do not, as will become apparent&#151;but because if I had simply asked whether we should get more power from the Severn, I was in danger of getting results such as those of newspaper phone-in polls, in which 100 per cent. answer yes and no one answers no. I did not think that that would be very helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000407">I specifically asked whether my constituents supported a Severn barrage in principle. In their ever-creative manner, they responded yes but added in their comments that they did not mean a barrage, but something slightly different. I had to interpret the results carefully. However, I received more than 1,500 replies&#151;unique answers&#151;from my constituents. The majority were in favour of the principle. I should explain that I asked the question as neutrally as a politician ever can. I provided internet links to the arguments in favour and against. For example, my initial question contained links to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds site, the World Wild Fund for Nature and so on. Those who wished to do so had the opportunity to read both sides of the argument before coming to their judgment, and a majority of six to one in my constituency supported the principle of a barrage although, as I say, the nuanced replies were slightly more complex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000408">What was interesting was the variety of people who supported the principle. Constituents who are pro-nuclear thought that a barrage or a tidal power scheme was a good thing just as much as those who are anti-nuclear. We have the interesting position of being a constituency with a coast along the Severn and a nuclear power station, so there is a lot of local interest in energy matters. As I say, being pro-tidal power from the Severn does not mean that people are in any particular faction on wider aspects of the energy debate. There appeared to be a broad spectrum of local opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000409">I have consulted my constituents on other issues, and the issue of tidal power from the Severn saw perhaps the biggest spontaneous write-in response that I have ever had. We all know that when we do surveys and so on one or two people might spontaneously fill in a blank box with an idea, but when person after person says, &#147;Never mind that, what about tidal power from the Severn?&#148; one starts to realise what a groundswell of support there is for the idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para18"><a name="07042430000410">I am sure that the Minister will be familiar with the context, but I shall set it out for the record. We are talking about an estuary with the second largest tidal range in the country. Many of my constituents who, although I have reached the grand old age of 41, still regard me as a bit wet behind the ears tell me that such issues have been talked about for a very long time. Even as recently as the 1970s, the dear old Central Electricity Generating Board undertook a study. At that time, the argument was that because oil was cheap, we did not need power from the Severn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para19"><a name="07042430000411">In 1981, the Severn barrage committee considered a range of locations. One thing that one starts to discover is that there is no such thing as &#147;the Severn barrage&#148;; it could go in various locations. Interestingly, the committee recommended a barrage location that would not necessarily generate the maximum power. There are some interesting trade-offs between full-blown all-singing, all-dancing schemes way down the estuary that block the entire thing off, go for miles and generate huge amounts of power but probably have the maximum environmental knock-on, and a few lagoons and bays that will cause limited environmental damage but might have less potential for generating power. Part of my point in urging a fast and substantive cost-benefit analysis is that there are so many trade-offs. We can maximise the power potential, but might thereby do more environmental harm than we are willing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para20"><a name="07042430000412">The important thing is to come at the issue not doctrinally but independently, almost pragmatically. We should start with a blank sheet of paper&#151;although the sheet is not blank, because it has been gone over many times before&#151;and not commit ourselves in advance to a particular answer. The technology is evolving and the energy market is changing all the time, and we need someone to take a hard, up-to-date look.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para21"><a name="07042430000413">The biggest substantive study seems to be the one undertaken at the end of the 1980s by groups including the Severn tidal power group, which came up with the idea of a 10-mile barrage stretching from Lavernock point near Cardiff to Brean down near Weston-super-Mare. To give an idea of the scale, that barrage was envisaged to provide electricity equivalent to 5 per cent. of the UK&#146;s entire electricity needs. It was costed in those days at &#163;8 billion&#151;we might double that number; on Olympic budgeting we might triple it. It is a familiar technology, which has been in operation at La Rance in France for 40 years, albeit on a much smaller scale. It could take eight to 10 years to construct, but could last more than a century. The technology is familiar, albeit on a larger scale than has been envisaged before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para22"><a name="07042430000414">At that time, the idea was shelved again; there seems to be almost a tidal flow to the idea. High interest rates were an issue. Since then, energy costs from other sources have risen, as has the desire for renewables and concerns about CO2 emissions. We are in a different  <br>

world. It is worth mentioning that the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, when considering different scenarios to reduce UK greenhouse gases by 2050, included some form of Severn tidal power in three of its four principal scenarios. This is a mainstream idea whose time has come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para23"><a name="07042430000415">Last year, in its energy review, the Minister&#146;s Department said:</p>
<a name="70424h0011.htm_brev0"><a name="07042430000471"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tidal impoundment schemes&#151;such as barrages and lagoons&#151;and tidal current technologies have the potential to make a significant contribution to carbon reductions.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para24"><a name="07042430000416">When do we move from potential to actual? Part of the thrust of the debate is to get a steer from the Minister. Obviously I do not want him to break the embargo on his White Paper&#151;well, I do. However, people say to me, &#147;We&#146;ve heard it all before. It has been talked about for 30 or 40 years. This is more talk, more hot air&#151;or whatever. When are we going to get more action?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para25"><a name="07042430000417">I do not want to talk only about barrages, although they are obviously the subject that grabs the headlines. On the face of it, a barrage-type scheme has a number of attractions. Clearly, tidal power through a barrage is tremendously predictable. We know the times and scale of the tides and we know when electricity can be generated and when not. Compared with some other forms of renewable energy, it is far more predictable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para26"><a name="07042430000418">I have mentioned the substantial scale of what could be achieved and the saving of millions of tonnes of CO2 every year, which has to be welcome. Such tidal power is clearly a secure domestic source of power and in a changing and troubled world many of us would sleep better at night&#151;even those of us who live near the River Severn&#151;if we knew that we were not quite so dependent on imported sources of power. It is clearly a clean source of power, as there is no issue of long-term waste disposal. One interesting idea to arise from the responses from my constituents was the suggestion that a barrage could be used as part of the transport infrastructure. It has been suggested that there could be a rail route across it. Some of my more pessimistic constituents have noted that the Severn bridge, which is in my constituency, is rusting. They feel that sooner or later it will rust away and we might need another route across. I hope that we will act sooner than that, but the potential to use a barrage as part of the transport infrastructure is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para27"><a name="07042430000419">Flood protection will be a growing concern to coastal constituencies, and there is potential for that. The next idea is double-edged, for reasons that I will come back to, but the construction of a barrage has huge potential consequences for tourism, water sports and so on. We can see why such an idea is attractive to people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para28"><a name="07042430000420">The big reservation that people have is about what such a move would do to the environment in a special place. The Severn estuary has many environmental designations already, with more under consideration. National and international laws and obligations would, rightly, be central to any appraisal. That is why, as someone who is interested in the issue but does not claim to be an expert, I do not know whether the environmental costs would outweigh the potential benefits of the schemes. I want to see the work that has been done looked at through modern eyes, in the way in which we now consider the marine and coastal environments. That has moved on greatly since the last comparable study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para29"><a name="07042430000421">There are concerns. I know that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who represents Slimbridge, is hostile to the barrage idea because he is concerned about the mud flats further up the estuary. Something on this scale cannot be done without a big impact on the ecosystem. There are arguments on both sides. Some people say that if there is less tidal flow, less sediment is disturbed, which means that the water becomes clearer, more sunlight gets through to the river bed, more life grows on the river bed and so there is more plant life, more fish life and more birds. I would not have thought of that, but that argument has been put to me. The RSPB has made an interesting observation on that point in its briefing:</p>
<a name="70424h0011.htm_brev1"><a name="07042430000472"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A greater abundance of more common species is not a substitute for the loss of scarcer species as well as a rare habitat that is an important resource for migrating wildlife.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para30"><a name="07042430000422">Those are difficult things to weigh up if a scheme would make an area more habitable for some sorts of wildlife, but damage a habitat for others, and if there are not many similar habitats elsewhere. How do we weigh such things up? It is clear that we need to get down to specifics. Since the matter was last fully appraised, the arguments about the birds have changed. Patterns of migration have changed, as have the birds in the estuary. This is a moving feast and that is why we need up-to-date analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para31"><a name="07042430000423">The view is, interestingly, that the cost of an appraisal such as that which I am talking about, and the cost of getting it through the planning system is probably difficult for the private sector to bear, which comes back to the question of the Government&#146;s role. The construction and operation costs are commercially viable, certainly according to the Severn tidal power group. In other words, nobody is saying that the Government should build a barrage or other tidal scheme, but they probably must act as co-ordinator. The Welsh Assembly Government will clearly have a key interest and role in the matter; the Welsh Secretary (Mr. Hain) is a great advocate himself. An awful lot of co-ordination will have to occur. Somebody will have to take the lead, and I see the Minister, whose innate leadership skills are called on, to be the person who steps into the breach. I look forward to seeing him step into that mantle, if one can step into a mantle, in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="70424h0011.htm_para32"><a name="07042430000424">I mentioned development. Clearly, there will be lots of jobs&#151;somebody who replied to my e-mail survey said, &#147;It&#146;ll be like the south coast, only cheaper,&#148; although I do not know about that&#151;but development could easily be inappropriate as well. The estuary is an environmentally sensitive area. We do not necessarily want a raft of development alongside it. A balance must be struck. Also, development will obviously have an effect on shipping. It will depend on where in the estuary the barrage is built, but if it is below Bristol and other ports, that must be considered.</p>

Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth support different forms of tidal power, and I urge the Minister to ensure that they are properly appraised. I have seen Friends of the Earth appraisals that say that tidal lagoons are a better bet than a barrage, but the construction companies that might build the barrage say that their schemes are much better than lagoons, which will not make any power.

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para1"><a name="07042430000426">The principal alternative appears to be man-made tidal lagoons that fill and empty through turbines on the ebb and flow of the tide. Each one might have a smaller power potential, but they do less environmental damage. It is suggested that when the Oldbury power station in my constituency is decommissioned, that coastal site might be used for such a scheme. I gather that Tidal Electric, which holds the patent on tidal lagoons, is already considering options for doing that sort of thing in Swansea bay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para2"><a name="07042430000427">One of my constituents said to me, &#147;Look, the problem is that we need base-load power generation, and tidal power is not base-load power generation.&#148; One of the interesting things about lagoons is that to some extent, they can be used to time shift&#151;to shift the point at which the tides flow in order to change the time when electricity is generated, although the tide can be held back only for a certain length of time. People have also suggested underwater marine current turbines, which would not have to be an alternative&#151;for example, the turbines could be combined with a barrage. It does not have to be either/or.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para3"><a name="07042430000428">Where do we go next? The Sustainable Development Commission is considering UK tidal resources, including Severn tidal power, and is due to report in mid-2007. But what I fear is another report saying, &#147;Wouldn&#146;t it be interesting?&#148; and &#147;This is an idea worth further investigation&#148;&#151;the classic academic &#147;We need more research&#148;. When will somebody bite the bullet, drive the matter forward and try to resolve it once and for all? We need an appraisal that considers the different options&#151;barrages, lagoons and underwater turbines in different locations&#151;and the economic and environmental costs and benefits of each.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para4"><a name="07042430000429">There is considerable cross-party support. I mentioned the Welsh Secretary; I attended a briefing recently by the Severn tidal power group at which a Welsh Labour MP was in favour, and which was hosted by a Conservative MP. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) and I have been promoting it, as has Bristol city council, and hon. Members from the area are interested in the scheme. It is not a party political issue, but one that many of us with an interest in the Severn estuary want to see furthered. The role of the Government and this Minister in particular is to be a driving force. Instead of letting it drift, let us have some real power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para5"><a name="07042430000432">I did know about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s survey, because I monitor him carefully. I do not always use satellite technology at the moment, but that will come. However, I did not realise that so many had responded to the survey. Hopefully, they were not paying &#163;1.50 a call; I am sure that his ethics preclude that. His findings were interesting. I had better not talk about rising tides of support, because he has out-punned everyone in this debate and I shall not try to follow him. I shall set the context, however. I know that the hon. Gentleman is aware of it, but I shall do so for the record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para6"><a name="07042430000433">The energy challenges that we face were described recently in the energy review and will continue to be the main policy drivers for the energy White Paper, which will be published in May. From the start, our objective has been a better position to tackle the two major long-term challenges for UK energy policy. The first and foremost is climate change. Global carbon emissions are continuing to grow. In addressing climate change, we face arguably the biggest challenge to human civilisation&#151;for once the speaker does not exaggerate in saying that. Secondly, we need to ensure a secure supply of clean and affordable energy, not least because, as the hon. Gentleman indicated, we now need to think of Britain&#146;s energy security and not just of energy supply. He made that point himself in his own way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para7"><a name="07042430000434">The energy review published last year set out a wide-ranging strategy for delivering our energy goals, a strategy to which low-carbon technological innovation and expansion of renewable energy are central. Since 2002, about &#163;500 million has been committed to help develop low-carbon technologies. Building on that, the Government will increase funding substantially for low-carbon energy research and development through the new Energy Technologies Institute. That public-private sector joint venture will have up to &#163;1 billion in funding over 10 years. We have also created a new environmental transformation fund to help support renewables and other technologies through demonstration stage and beyond.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para8"><a name="07042430000435">Our main support mechanism for achieving the necessary expansion of renewables is the renewables obligation, which the Government introduced in 2002. Under the RO, renewable generation has more than doubled, with the UK joining the small band of countries to have installed 2 GW of wind energy. We want to ensure that that increase continues, and we will publish our proposals to strengthen the renewals obligation further with the energy White Paper next month.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para9"><a name="07042430000436">I turn to tidal power in the Severn estuary, which I know is of great interest to both Welsh and English Members of this House. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for enabling us to debate the issue, albeit briefly. It may be useful for those not well acquainted with the subject to understand that there are differences between tidal barrages and the emerging tidal stream technologies being developed under the Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s technology programme. Put simply, tidal barrages are similar to the hydroelectric dams with which we are all familiar&#151;it says here. Some of us are more familiar than others. I have certainly seen them in operation in Scotland, but I am still searching in Croydon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para10"><a name="07042430000437">Fundamentally, tidal barrages work by impounding a body of water which is then released through turbines  <br>

to produce electricity. A variation is the technology known as tidal lagoons, which can be attached to the shoreline or located fully offshore but work on similar principles. Tidal stream technology, on the other hand, exploits the energy in relatively high-speed sea currents. Such devices extract energy from water flow&#151;rather like a windmill, but under water. It is with the help of support provided under the DTI&#146;s technology programme that the UK is now well positioned as a world leader in the development of this new technology.</p>

 I would like to take this opportunity to support the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) for a speedy reappraisal of tidal power in the Severn estuary. I apologise to you, Sir Nicholas, for arriving a little late for the debate.</p>

 I agree with the broad thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. In distinguishing the different forms of marine technology, I was not suggesting an alternative to a Severn barrage. I was simply giving another example showing that, given that we are an island, there are different ways of exploiting the power of the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para12"><a name="07042430000441">We already have a good understanding of tidal power. The UK has spent considerable sums in the past&#151;some &#163;20 million in all&#151;evaluating the potential for generating electricity from tidal barrages. The UK tidal programme ran from 1978 to its completion in 1994, and was the most comprehensive ever undertaken anywhere in the world. Several schemes were studied under the programme, the largest being a Severn barrage which would have a capacity of 8,600 MW and an output of 17 TW hours a year, providing some 5 per cent. of current UK demand from a renewable source and saving some 7 million tonnes of CO2 a year over its 120-year projected lifetime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para13"><a name="07042430000442">A Severn barrage would be one of the largest civil engineering projects in the world, and by far the largest single renewable energy generation scheme in the UK. It would involve building a 10-mile long barrage between the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel just downstream of a line between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare, and enclosing some 140 miles of coastline. I do not have time to go into great detail, but a project on that scale clearly would be complex. It would have numerous advantages and disadvantages which we would need to appraise and discuss.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para14"><a name="07042430000443">At the current estimate of &#163;15 billion, the barrage would be expensive, and it could take as long as 12 years to build and commission once a decision was made to proceed. However, as well as providing 5 per cent. of our electricity, it could bring additional benefits such as a reduction in the likelihood of increased flood damage in the Severn region, and an estimated 35,000 jobs at the peak of construction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para15"><a name="07042430000444">A barrage would have to comply with a wide range of environmental legislation, as the hon. Member for Northavon implied. The Severn estuary is of national, European and international nature conservation  <br>

significance, and has been afforded the corresponding levels of legal protection. It is designated as a Ramsar site and is a special protection area under the EU habitats directive. The estuary comprises a series of sites of special scientific interest and is in the process of being designated as a special area of conservation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para16"><a name="07042430000445">The scale of environmental changes that would be introduced by a barrage would be very large, and, with the loss of some 65 per cent. of the inter-tidal areas, there is no doubt that it would have a major impact on Severn estuary ecosystems. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point that we could argue to and fro. There are ecological benefits as well as disbenefits, and that is part of the complexity of and interest in the subject.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="70424h0012.htm_para17"><a name="07042430000446">The energy review recognised the potential benefits of tidal power schemes but also the environmental concerns that a Severn barrage would raise. We therefore committed to a major &#163;400,000 study, which is under way. It is being led by the Sustainable Development Commission, which is working with the DTI, the Welsh Assembly Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the South West of England Regional Development Agency.</p>

of the public position on the acceptability of any Severn barrage development. The SDC is undertaking a major stakeholder engagement and public consultation exercise&#151;perhaps it could draw on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s experience&#151;which includes a national survey and several regional public and stakeholder workshops. A final report by the commission setting out its position and advice to the Government on tidal power is expected in July. It will serve to inform any future considerations.</p>

It is a significant exercise involving the key players&#151;agencies in England and Wales&#151;and, with the public consultation element, will result in an important report. I hear what he is saying about just getting on with it, and his volunteering me to head forward, with his help, with my bucket and spade. However, given the complexity and the fact that it has been quite some time since the last proper study, it is not unreasonable that we examine the issue carefully, and that the Government consider the commission&#146;s report carefully.</p>

Of course, he will appreciate that I cannot comment on the detail of the forthcoming energy White Paper, but I can assure him and colleagues that tidal power, including that in the Severn, will be covered in the forthcoming White Paper.</p>
