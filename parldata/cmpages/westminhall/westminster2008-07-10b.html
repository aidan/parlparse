 The members of my Committee are pleased to have the opportunity to debate our report. Although many things have happened in the fairly long period since we began our inquiry and published the report, we feel strongly that the role of the British Government in Afghanistan is crucial to that region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08071089000008">I shall open the debate by summarising in a couple of sentences what is needed if we are to secure a future for Afghanistan. The country needs improved security, a crackdown on corruption and a strong human rights culture, especially in relation to women. The international community is helping, and should be striving to help, the Government of Afghanistan to achieve those three key things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08071089000009">I will not delay right hon. and hon. Members by summarising the report: they can read it for themselves, and probably have done so already. When Committee members visited Afghanistan last October, we took the opportunity to try to get as broad a view of the country as we could. For that reason, not only did we spend time in Kabul and the surrounding Shamali plain, but we divided, with half going to Helmand and the other half, including me, going to Balkh province in the north and to Mazar-e-Sharif. When we came together, we had a complementary idea of a diverse country, with a great variety of things happening in different parts of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08071089000010">I say at the outset, perhaps for the benefit of opinion and the media in this country, that Afghanistan should not be confused with Iraq: the reasons why we are there, what are doing there, and the purposes and circumstances by which we came to be there are fundamentally different.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way so early in his speech. I commend him on his report. Many hon. Members have had an opportunity to visit both Afghanistan and Iraq. On analysis, there is a clear concern that the pace of reconstruction and development under the fragile umbrella of security was not apparent in Iraq and is not apparent in Afghanistan, for exactly the same reason. There are therefore lessons for each country to be learned from the other.</p>

 I accept that there may be lessons to be learned on reconstruction, but my point is that often the two engagements are conflated in the British press as though they were similar in context, and they simply are not. That important point needs to be made. Whatever people&#146;s views are on Iraq and Afghanistan, the situations  <br>

in those countries should be treated as two completely separate engagements, rather than two sides of the same one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para5"><a name="08071089000013">There is evidence of strong support among the Afghan people for the international community&#146;s engagement within their country. Indeed, we were repeatedly told that, if anything, people were concerned that we would not stay, or would not stay for long enough. That we should not be there was not a message that we heard to any significant extent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08071089000014">Nobody should underestimate either the challenges, which are huge, or the uncertainty of the outcome; our report makes that absolutely clear. More than 100 British service personnel have died engaging with insurgents in Helmand. It is perhaps understandable that that has become a strong focus of the United Kingdom media, and rightly so. It is, however, encouraging to note the comment of Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, last month:</p>
<a name="80710h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08071089000232"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Make no mistake, the Taliban influence is waning, and through British blood, determination and grit, a window of opportunity has been opened.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08071089000015">Windows open and close, but an opportunity has been created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08071089000016">It is important to recognise that the aim of UK policy in Afghanistan is to assist the country to build up a viable and efficient state, and for public services to create a climate for development and poverty reduction. Although the number of competent administrators is limited&#151;one estimate that we heard when we were there was that there were as few as 200&#151;the education, health and rural development Ministries are markedly improving delivery of basic services. Six million children are in school, more than one third of them girls, a high proportion of the population have access to basic health services, and agricultural production has improved in some parts of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08071089000017">Part of the international community&#146;s work has been to train the Afghan national army, where there has been positive achievement. That was borne out in the successful NATO-supported action to recapture Musa Qala. On the other hand, training the police force so that local people can trust them is proving to be a challenge, and the general perception still seems to be that the administration of justice throughout Afghanistan is dire. There has been a shortage of police trainers. The Government, who have said that the number of UK policing experts in Afghanistan is rising, are providing support to the EU police mission to Afghanistan&#151;EUPOL Afghanistan&#151;and working with the US-led police training programme. Will the Minister tell us how many EUPOL trainers there are in Afghanistan, how many are UK police, and what progress has been made in increasing the number of female police officers?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08071089000018">Providing security, especially in the south of the country, is crucial to the future, and that makes the role of British forces key. It is important to remember that Afghanistan is a diverse country, which needs to develop national administration that is free from corruption and accessible by all, especially women. During our visit, it was disappointing how often we heard people say, &#147;We appreciate what the British are doing in Helmand; it is a pity that you are not engaged elsewhere in the country.&#148; In reality, the overwhelming majority of our aid and development budget is being delivered to the national Government to provide services throughout Afghanistan, yet the focus is on Helmand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08071089000019">On the role of women and their rights, the context is not the same as in any western country. Afghanistan is an intensely male-dominated society where women&#146;s rights have traditionally been limited. It is disappointing that since liberation and the establishment of democratic government, the country seems to be moving backwards. When the Government were created, there were four female Ministers and between eight and 12 female deputy Ministers. Today, there is only one female Minister, and three female deputy Ministers. Apart from the deputy health Minister, the others are all in the Ministry for Women&#146;s Affairs. In other words, women are being patronisingly compartmentalised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08071089000020">Yesterday, I met an Afghan journalist, Horia Musadeq, who gave me further cause for concern. Promises that a vacancy for a senior judge would be filled by a woman have not been kept and the post has now been filled by a man. The implementation of the justice action plan is not progressing, and the human rights component of the electoral commission is being diminished, leading to concerns that perpetrators of human rights abuses will continue to dominate the Parliament. Horia also told me that freedom of expression is being restricted by  the application of the new media law and the use of blasphemy laws.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08071089000021">I suggest that the international community should make it abundantly clear that the long-term commitment to Afghanistan depends on the country establishing international standards against corruption and upholding the rights of its citizens, especially its women. If Afghanistan is to survive and to develop as a viable state, it needs improved security, a crackdown on corruption and a strong human rights culture. Will the Minister tell us how the Department for International Development, in co-ordination with other bodies, will monitor and prioritise that, and specifically&#151;this was mentioned in the Government&#146;s response to our report&#151;how it will apply the gender equality action plan in Afghanistan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08071089000022">The other focus of interest whenever Afghanistan is discussed is inevitably poppy cultivation. Partly through a policy of substitution that has made 20 provinces poppy-free, and partly because of a market glut, overall production is expected to fall. It is interesting that rising prices for other crops&#151;notably wheat&#151;have also helped. Although it is not always understood, there is a direct correlation between poppy production and insecurity. Some people think that all we have to do is to destroy the poppy crop, but that debate has no resonance because the Afghan Government will not allow that and, frankly, I do not blame them, because it would destroy the soil&#146;s reproductive capacity. There is no point debating destruction of the poppy crop because that is not going to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08071089000023">It is more to the point to ask why farmers grow poppies. It is not the best crop for money, but the criminal elements who buy it come to the farm gate with cash and take the crop away, which eliminates the need to travel off the farm and thus the risk of bribery and ambush on the way to market and intimidation by criminal elements. If farmers were provided with security in the form of protection from intimidation and with access to the market at reasonable cost and safety, other crops would become more attractive.</p>

 Those paragraphs demonstrate that targeting poppy farmers is the wrong approach, and that it is necessary to target the perpetrators of the traffic. It is encouraging that the new Pakistani Government have indicated that they intend to take strong action in the frontier territories to tackle the Taliban and other criminal elements. One must remember that the border is huge and infamous. It is not internationally recognised&#151;only the UK and Pakistan do so&#151;and has a notorious reputation in world and specifically British history.

 We received a little information in passing on that, but we did not go to that end of the country, nor did we take specific evidence. Clearly, there is a lot of traffic across the border between western Afghanistan and Iran. There was evidence that the behaviour of the Iranian Government could have a positive or a negative effect, and at different times it had had both those effects.</p>

 I endorse the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point: our strong impression was that although there had been incidents on the Iranian side, stability in the relationship with Iran is crucial, and the wrong sort of activities on the other side or directed towards Iran could set up a chain of events in Afghanistan that would be far from helpful.</p>

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="08071089000031"><a name="80710h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="08071089000261"><b>Malcolm Bruce:</b>
 Yes. The relationship between the Governments and people of Iran and Afghanistan, and the traffic that crosses the border, are complicated. The Iranian Government do not want a lot of drugs imported into their society, so to some extent they take strong action against it, which is helpful. However, they want a relationship with those whom they consider to be their kith and kin over the border. At other times they are a little less engaging. One can tell that when they are doing the right thing in that context, the problem is diminished, and when they are not, the problem is not diminished. That is another dimension to the international problem of how to deal with Iran, although that it not the subject of this debate.</p>

just one country, and that is where the constitutional model has gone wrong. Does he agree that where things have gone well in the east, it relates to Iran being the only country to invest in a railway line going to Herat? That will allow the east of Afghanistan to start trading. It is trade and investment that will replace poppies.</p>

 Of course, I accept that entirely. Although we did not go to Herat, we had many reports of how successful that area was. Certainly, those of us who visited Mazar-e-Sharif saw some pretty lively economic activity. That is important, but at the end of the day, if Afghanistan is given security, good roads, a decent education system and so on, it will have the capacity to create a successful economy. However, there are a lot of presumptive buts and ifs attached to that, which is precisely why the focus of this debate is how we create the climate for it to happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08071089000036">I shall now go to the next stage and move from the subject of poppy growing to that of the agricultural support that the Committee thought was necessary. We have recently had a wider debate about agriculture and the extent to which the world community has taken its eye off the ball in supporting agriculture as part of the development strategy throughout the world. We should not suddenly come rushing back to agriculture because it is fashionable in this year of high prices; we need to deal with the matter in a way that is coherent and has been thought through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08071089000037">Let me give a practical example. We visited a village in Balkh where the community had been persuaded by old-fashioned methods&#151;namely, threats&#151;to stop cultivating poppy. The villager had therefore started to grow water melons, of which they had no previous experience. I have no expertise in relation to water melons, but I understand that the problem is that they are prone to attack from a particular kind of flea. When the villagers&#146; water melons suffered such an attack, they could not find anyone to advise them on how to deal with the problem. As a result, they did not say they would be better off with poppy; what they said was, &#147;We&#146;ve got a crop from which we&#146;re not deriving much of an income.&#148; They also said, &#147;Thank you for the support you&#146;ve given us in providing a clean water supply for the humans in the village, but we don&#146;t have enough water for our animals, which are dying.&#148; The people need irrigation to feed animals and for proper extension services to be provided by the Afghan authorities&#151;perhaps with our support and expertise&#151;to enable farmers to switch to other produce. We also need to ensure that people know how to manage and deal with those alternatives, as it will enable farmers not only to come out of poppy growing, but to find a long-term future from alternative sources.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman&#146;s excellent speech and the point that is dealt with in some detail in his Committee&#146;s report, which has been the subject of a number of interventions, leads me as a matter of courtesy to say to the Minister that it would be extremely helpful if he set  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 July 2008">

out for hon. Members in the clearest possible terms what the Government&#146;s counter-narcotics strategy is in Afghanistan. We are spending a lot of money on this important work, so it would be extremely helpful if he told hon. Members from the Committee and other hon. Members precisely how that strategy is determined and what it aims to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="08071089000039"><a name="80710h0001.htm_spnew14"><a name="08071089000267"><b>Malcolm Bruce:</b>
 I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I have a question about the agriculture strategy that relates to his point. The Government have committed &#163;345 million to development in Afghanistan in the 2008-11 spending review. Will the Minister indicate, either now or in writing, how much of that resource will go into horticulture, livestock, agriculture and rural development, and in what form? That is part of our recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08071089000040">It is fair to say that there are vested interests in the UK in terms of agricultural research, academia and other areas and that, of course, the people involved with that have an agenda; however, it is not one that is not legitimate. Such people say that they have underutilised expertise that they feel could help. We obviously want to build up the capacity of the Afghan Government, not import capacity from outside, but I believe that we can work alongside Afghans and train them to improve the quality of their extension services.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman will find that there is a parliamentary question in my name asking for a breakdown of DFID&#146;s funds. It is important to remember that our Committee is the International Development Committee and not the Foreign Affairs Committee. I make that point because it is important that we focus on poverty reduction in Afghanistan and make sure that the funds&#151;certainly those from DFID&#151;go into poverty reduction in Afghanistan and do not trickle into other areas. Of course security is important, but if we lose that funding focus, we will not crack the problem of poverty eradication.</p>

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for making that pertinent, timely and extraordinarily important point, which reinforces again the distinction between Afghanistan and Iraq. Iraq is not a poor country, whereas Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world. We should be engaged in helping to reduce that poverty. The truth is that if Iraq were a stable non-threatening country, we would not be there, other than as a trading partner or whatever. That is a fundamental and radical difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80710h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08071089000043">The right hon. Gentleman is right to make that point and to make it clear to other hon. Members here who are not members of our Committee that our focus is fundamentally on development. However, as in so many cases, it is impossible to avoid the security, defence and foreign affairs dimensions to these matters. I will come to that point at the end of my speech. We completely understand that there are other complex reasons for our being in Afghanistan, but we should never lose sight of our development priority. It is right to ensure that development money is not diverted to other purposes that might be legitimate, but for which development money has not been provided. It is easy to be misunderstood, and people often misrepresent what is happening and suggest a rather confused idea of what the British Government are doing in Afghanistan.</p>

At the time, we were concerned&#151;we have mentioned this in the report&#151;that the plane was available only for the short term and was likely to be withdrawn.

We know that it is expensive, but the reality is that without the plane, those staff would essentially be confined to operating in Kabul and Helmand, and they would not be able to reach the rest of the country, especially given that many of them are on a short-term rotation for security reasons. Will the Minister say whether a decision has been taken and, if so, what decision has been made on the future of the plane or making a similar arrangement?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08071089000045">I reinforce the point that nobody should underestimate the challenges and difficulties of operating in the post-conflict environment of today&#146;s Afghanistan; our Committee certainly does not. Conversely, however, nobody should underestimate the cost of failure. Afghanistan is the fulcrum of an immensely unstable part of the world. It is the source of the world&#146;s drug traffic and the hub of the world&#146;s terrorist training network. A stable, developing Afghanistan has positive implications for its neighbourhood; a failed Afghanistan would hugely destabilise what is potentially the most volatile region in the world. Anybody who suggests that Afghanistan is a far-away place of which we know little and that we should not be there fundamentally fails to understand why it is central to our national interest now, as it has been in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08071089000046">Afghanistan is also a point of concern and focus because of the plight of its people, who have been battered to hell from all kinds of sources and from every different direction. Understandably, they are doubtful and frustrated at not knowing what their future might be. Time and again, we were told that because of their experience, the people of Afghanistan fundamentally do not trust anybody; they simply do not believe that anybody will stay long enough or be consistent. That is why Ministers and others in the international community repeatedly say, &#147;This is a commitment for a generation. We will be there be 20 or 30 years.&#148; That is not some sort of bold, post-imperialist statement; it is a real attempt to reassure the people of Afghanistan that we understand that building up a viable state is not something that will be achieved in the short term and that we are there to work with them to deliver that.</p>

 I intend to talk only about DFID&#146;s reconstruction work in Helmand. I start by commending to the Minister&#151;who I hope is better prepared for this debate than he was yesterday upstairs&#151;the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Holloway), who recently made an excellent speech in this Chamber on the situation in Afghanistan and the work of DFID and the Army. The key to our success, as I hope the Minister understands, is consent, and consent can be gained only if the people whom we are trying to help believe not only that we are in it for the long haul but that we are delivering on what we said we would do and on what was set out in a number of high-sounding declarations about how things would work in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08071089000049">DFID has deployed many very good people to Afghanistan. I acknowledge that many of them are courageous and are doing a very good job, but DFID is not geared to operations in a fundamentally hostile environment. It is not a place with which DFID people are familiar. They do not do danger. They are not trained to do it. Their ethos is not for it; in fact, their ethos is wholly alien to the soldiers alongside whom they are serving, broadly speaking, in Helmand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08071089000050">In my view, DFID needs to second the budget that it has laid aside for reconstruction in Helmand to the British Royal Engineers or to other people who will come in and do the reconstruction. The truth is that the British Army, taking serious casualties, will continue to take down the Taliban wherever and whenever it can and will continue to try to spread security on very dangerous operations, often without the helicopters that it needs to do that. When those personnel go out, they need to be able to hold the ground and stay there and bring in behind them people who can immediately set about reconstruction and thus deny the territory to the Taliban. If we do not fix this, all those soldiers will have died in vain, because those personnel can go on doing their best to control the military situation, but they cannot do the reconstruction. Unless DFID gets the reconstruction aid together in Helmand, we will see the failure of this operation. It will go on, because it is a very long-term operation, as the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) rightly said in his excellent report. We are in this for the long haul, and we know it.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman raises a significant and interesting question&#151;the relationship between troops trying to maintain security and the reconstruction. DFID does operate in situations of danger all over Africa and elsewhere. Our troops might not be there, but some DFID staff operate in the most difficult circumstances in the world. I went, as a Minister, to Bosnia after peace had been declared, and the Royal Engineers were asking me whether we could get DFID to come in to help with the reconstruction of the water and electricity infrastructure, engineering plants and the rest of it. Has the hon. Gentleman had conversations with the Royal Engineers about how that interface might work? Are they asking  <br>

 The sentiment that the right hon. Gentleman heard expressed in Bosnia among sappers would not be expressed in Helmand. It is a totally different theatre of operations and a totally different scale of danger. In Helmand&#151;one of the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, theatre of operations in the world&#151;people will not find DFID digging wells. They will find the military taking the ground and then begging the sappers to come in to dig the wells to get things going immediately.</p>

 Perhaps I can answer the question. In Musa Qala, people have been calling and waiting for a mosque to be built. The locals have asked DFID. This is a question of winning over hearts and minds, but it has never happened. Guess who is building that mosque now? It is not DFID but the Royal Engineers. The international security assistance force&#151;ISAF&#151;is taking over. There is mission creep. Nothing is happening, and our boys are exposed. They realise that they have to win over hearts and minds. They have to get on with the reconstruction and development. There is one non-governmental organisation working for DFID in Helmand province. I agree totally with my hon. Friend that DFID does not do danger. It has tackled poverty. We need to reconstruct our whole focus and how we work in dangerous areas across the globe.</p>

 I repeat that, unless we get this right, we will not see a successful conclusion to the operations in Helmand.

 I, too, was one of the party from the Select Committee that visited Afghanistan last year and I endorse what the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said in introducing the report. My comments will be based partly on what was said by the witnesses who appeared before the Committee, but also on the evidence of my own eyes&#151;I was one of those who went to Helmand. There is a health warning about that, because when we go somewhere, particularly a place as insecure as Afghanistan, we get only a snapshot. I suspect that that applies to all of us. To think that we get more than that and that when we come back we are experts is not right. We are not; we get a snapshot. However, we do see some things, and certainly I saw some things while I was there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para7"><a name="08071089000062">I will in a while express a slightly different view from that of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) on the roles of DFID and the military, but the first thing to do is to endorse what the right hon. Member for Gordon, the Chair of the Committee, said about the importance of our being in Afghanistan. I was opposed to the war in Iraq; that is on the record. Afghanistan is a different situation. There are real issues about how we co-ordinate our efforts, both as the UK and with partners. There are issues about the relationship between development and military action. Those things have to be assessed on an ongoing basis, but I did not get the impression while I was there&#151;I do not think that colleagues on the Committee did either&#151;that anyone was saying that it was feasible to get out or that people wanted us to get out. That was true of people whose main job it was to combat poverty, those who were doing something about poppy cultivation and those who were involved in the important gender work that the Chairman of the Committee mentioned. It was also true of those involved in development, those trying to create a functioning state that is responsive to the needs of its citizens and certainly those involved in military activities. It is therefore important that we say clearly on the record that it is right that we are in Afghanistan, and that means that we will be there for the long term.</p>

I saw real strength in the approach of virtually all the British personnel operating in Afghanistan, whether they were based in Helmand or Kabul. There was a sensitivity to the local situation, and those involved looked for what worked, which is not something that one finds among all the foreign countries present in Afghanistan. By and large, British personnel had a really sensitive approach to counter-narcotics and rejected the simplistic focus on eradication that comes from some other quarters. Although the guns and soldiers are a constant reminder that danger is ever present, the military and the development people whom we met understood that the development effort and the military  <br>

effort must go hand in hand&#151;it is not a case of one or the other. Neither of those efforts will be successful unless those involved win the hearts and minds of local people, and I think that that was understood by everybody we came across who was involved in the British effort. I am not sure that it is always understood by some of the other countries operating in Afghanistan, but I will not go into that, given the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08071089000064">I want to endorse something that the Chairman of the Committee said about our staff in Afghanistan. If they are to do their job effectively, we need to be sensitive to the conditions in which they operate and the stresses and strains of working in a highly insecure and dangerous environment. However, that takes us in two directions. On the one, people will need a regular break, but on the other, there is an issue about building expertise and experience in the country, and that can sometimes take us in the other direction. I am not sure whether we have got that entirely right yet, and we need to think about it.</p>

 If I may say so, the expression &#147;DFID people do not do danger&#148; is not something that should linger in the air for too long, because it is unfair and unreasonable. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that all DFID staff in Afghanistan volunteered to go there because they were so committed to being part of the reconstruction project? They know that there are risks, and we had the security training, even around Kabul, to prove it.</p>

 I completely agree. Although the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) said that he was not criticising particular DFID staff, and I am sure that he meant what he said, he needs to understand that his words will be heard. Blanket statements such as &#147;DFID people do not do danger&#148; are not only empirically wrong but devalue the dangerous job that DFID staff are doing in Afghanistan. They are in danger right now, and we should understand that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80710h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08071089000067">On security, there has been great progress on building capacity in the Afghan military. The Chairman of the Committee also rightly mentioned the police, and the sections about the police are an important part of our report. We certainly came away with the impression that, unless we make a concerted and successful effort to build a police force, we will not meet some of the development and other objectives that are so important to Afghanistan. The EU police mission in Afghanistan is a great initiative, but it is short of resources, and that raises another issue. When British troops or other ISAF troops are in Afghanistan, that is where they are posted&#151;that is where the battalion or the regiment is. Individual police officers, however, are often seconded from their day jobs, so to speak, to spend time in Afghanistan. We must put some effort into building the Afghan police force and we need a more systematic way internationally of ensuring not only that sufficient numbers of international police officers are available but that their day jobs back home are fully covered so that they can do their work in Afghanistan. When my hon. Friend the Minister  winds up, I hope that he will address the question, which we raised in our report, of how many UK police officers there are in Afghanistan and how we can increase the number.</p>

I have not been to Afghanistan since autumn 2007, so I accept that my knowledge is not completely up to date. However, I did not pick up at all from the troops operating in Helmand the kind of messages that we have heard today. What I did pick up from them, however, was the clear message&#151;this is mentioned in the report&#151;that we need to do three things in Helmand: clear, hold and build. The troops understood that doing those three things required different kinds of expertise. Clearing and holding is a military operation, and there is no way round that. However, the impression that we got from the military, as well as from DFID staff and, indeed, from Afghans themselves&#151;let us remember that they have some kind of say in this&#151;was that we need a partnership if we are to do the building because that requires a combination of different kinds of expertise.</p>

I agree that co-ordination issues need to be addressed, but I must tell the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex that DFID does not go round digging wells as he suggested they do. Indeed, it should not be digging wells anywhere; the people who should be doing that are the Afghans themselves, and our job is to ensure that they have the security and the wherewithal to do so. If there are co-ordination problems, that is what we need to address. Suggesting that everything will be sorted out if things can just be handed over to the Army does not connect with anything that I saw. That is no reflection at all on the troops we saw, who had a really rounded view of what was going on and an understanding of the need to work across departments.</p>

We should be there, whether or not we have a strategic interest and a military purpose. However, we do have a strategic interest: 2001 showed us the dangers of a history of neglecting Afghanistan and its needs. It is rather sad that, having learned the lesson in 2001, we immediately forgot it and rushed off to Iraq to distract ourselves from continuing to understand that the needs of Afghanistan are deep and long and require a major commitment, not a short-term fix.</p>

A briefing from the all-party group on the Royal Air Force pointed out that, for the Taliban, injuring but not killing one&#146;s opponent is intended to make life even more difficult for the military operation, tying it down with even more work to evacuate and support casualties and bringing suffering to families at home. The move from a tactic of straightforward engagement to insurgency is seen by the military as a sign of achievement, but it also means that great resolve is required. Therefore, there is a duty on us all to ensure that resources and information about what is being achieved are supplied to our people.</p>

However, as has already been explained in the debate, the police are a totally different story. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield made the point, I think, that countries have standing armies and, if they are not at war somewhere, those armies, while they go through training cycles, are available to be deployed for security missions; countries also have standing police forces, but they are always engaged in day-to-day operations, rather than just training. There is not a body of police who are spare and can be moved to a zone of instability to bring training and justice. Therefore, the international community probably needs to build up a resource of police trainers. Those should be the best police, to take the message about how to engage in policing. So much of what we are trying to achieve in Afghanistan cannot be enforced unless the police can deal with corruption and the drugs trade, and work for the stability that we are trying to bring to the country. We need a way to bring that justice into our development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08071089000078">One of the most frustrating things, for anyone involved in development, concerns the desire to know that the money that is put in is used effectively. The US puts in six times the amount of development money that the UK does, but it achieves only twice the impact on the ground. It would be good to hear from the Minister about our dialogue with the US Government on trying to improve their aid effectiveness. That resource could achieve so much more for the people of Afghanistan in the long run and for the stability of the region. Donor co-ordination is crucial to securing that aid effectiveness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para2"><a name="08071089000079">I welcome the Minister&#146;s news about the opening of the maternity unit in Lashkar Gah. Perhaps that was a case in which we saw on-the-hoof aid co-ordination, because the UK capital grant went to building the accommodation block for the midwife training unit, on the understanding that the US would fund the training; but nothing was in writing and the US then said it did not have the money for the training. However, because the block is there, the US money has now been secured and the training is going ahead. I welcome that positive development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08071089000080">I want to reinforce what the Committee Chairman said about poppy cultivation. There are no quick-fix, simple solutions. The issues are security and alternative livelihoods. The message also needs to come across that the poppy is not the easiest of crops. It is highly labour-intensive and would not necessarily be the crop of choice in a free environment. I do not think that many people realise that something else that emerged during our visit: how much damage poppy cultivation does to the local community. The children who help to harvest the crop develop an addiction just from handling the poppies. There are local addiction problems that need to be tackled as part of our investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08071089000081">I also want to reinforce the issue of the status of women. Failing to engage the women of Afghanistan means denying half the resource of the country to its development and its future. We saw many positive things in that context. We visited the microfinance initiative in Kabul and saw women entrepreneurs. Women got the microfinance loans, because they could be trusted to repay them. The men were far too unreliable a business investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08071089000088">On the ground, that was the practical experience. Many business women starting up small businesses and bringing development to the economy of Afghanistan were refugees coming back from Pakistan and re-establishing life in their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08071089000089">The need to develop local governance also needs to be emphasised. Afghanistan is a big country and cannot be managed from the centre with a one-size-fits-all solution. The community development councils are an important start, but I worry that they may not be built on without a lot of will and pressure behind the relevant development.</p>

During our visit, we heard about the country&#146;s resources, which include the second largest reserves of copper in the world. What training and guidance are being given to the Government of Afghanistan to ensure that they get the best benefit from their mineral resources and do not end up being exploited when those resources are developed? What advice and development will be given on negotiating contracts and ensuring that they are effective?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08071089000091">A perennial problem is helicopter infrastructure&#151;the lack of helicopter support to our military&#151;and it cannot be over-emphasised how much the deployment of helicopters could assist in development. Helicopters are required for development transport as well as military transport. I stress the need for a dedicated plane to be used at the behest of the civilian operation. Not only is that useful for getting experts on to the ground when and where they are needed, efficiently and effectively; it also enables people to be brought to conferences from the regions of Afghanistan and to have an input to development conferences and development decision making.</p>

I would be grateful to the Minister if he highlighted how the overlap of deployment is developing. The Government say in response to paragraph 45 of our report that there is more effective joint operation on the ground between civil and military authorities.

community, it was decided that a school was the right thing to build, whereas those involved in the development thought that that was probably not the right thing to do at the time, as the resources needed to make use of the school would not be available and could not be co-ordinated. That is an extremely important point. Whether we need military people to deal with hostility on the ground or to do some of the physical work, we still need the expertise in and experience of how development works best that have been built up around the world. Only effective development will bring the rewards of long-term stability and security. Three months ago, the Minister told us that the school in Sangin would be staffed within three months. It is three months since that reply, and it would be interesting to hear whether the school has been staffed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08071089000094">On our visit to the hospital in Lashkar Gah, we heard that immunisation and health support crosses into Taliban areas. In our report, we say that more should be done to boost the provision of health care, as crossing borders and providing support, without recognising who is in charge militarily, can create greater good will with the public&#151;the local community that we are trying to win around. In response to paragraph 64, the Government say that they are looking to improve the effectiveness of health delivery. Will the Minister come back to us on that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08071089000095">I reinforce what was said when we started. The message that we must get across to the public, through the UK press and broadcasters, is that Iraq and Afghanistan are different stories. British troops are losing their lives in both countries, but the political reasons for being there are very different. The need for us to be there, too, is very different. Afghanistan will be a success only if we make it a long-term commitment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08071089000096">We have seen the price of neglect in the past. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield said, we see snapshots on our visits of the life and work of the Department. I remember many pictures from that visit. I remember the spirit of the small business women, many of them refugees, who were developing their businesses with microfinance. I remember the courage of the woman MP whom we met who had lived through the Taliban regime and was now a Member of Parliament in her own country. She had not returned to the country as a refugee but had lived there throughout the Taliban regime and knew exactly what harm had happened to her country. I remember the farmer whose clean well water I was able to drink safely thanks to DFID investment in Lashkar Gah.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08071089000097">The message is that, whenever possible, we should put our resources through the trust fund managed by the World Bank, so that we can build up the capacity of the people of Afghan to deliver their own needs. That is an effective and positive way of doing it, but it means that we sometimes need to reinforce the message of what we are doing. We received feedback on our visit that people did not realise that British money was behind those projects. People had heard that we were spending money, but they wanted to know what it was being used for. We are achieving so much through integration with the Afghan Government, but we are not necessarily receiving the recognition that we are helping to make some things possible. It is important to ensure that people understand why we are there and that we are playing a major part.</p>

Above all, however, was the enthusiasm of the young girls to be seen on the cover of our report. They were sitting in their classroom, and we saw them sharing their work and showing their enthusiasm for their work. Untapping the potential for the future of Afghanistan gives a positive message about why we need to be there. It reinforces the dedication of the UK civilian and military personnel, who have made possible so much. However, there is much more to do. With our support and good will, so much can be achieved.</p>

 As chair of the all-party group on Afghanistan, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08071089000100">I welcome the report of the International Development Committee, which was published in February. I am particularly pleased that it presents a well balanced and evidence-based assessment of current DFID activity in Afghanistan. I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), the Committee Chairman, who introduced the report in an excellent speech. Indeed, his speech and the Committee&#146;s report fully recognise the important work that Britain is doing on reconstruction and development, yet they also drew attention to the challenges of delivering ongoing development in an area of conflict. The country needs help at almost every level&#151;with its infrastructure, houses, hospitals, jobs, state institutions, police force and civil society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08071089000101">I am pleased that the report supports the three main objectives of DFID&#146;s programme: to build effective state institutions; to improve economic management, and the effectiveness of aid to Afghanistan; and to improve the livelihoods of rural people. Those are the major challenges. I also pleased that the Committee supported 80 per cent. of the DFID budget going through the Afghan Government. That happens mainly via the Afghan reconstruction trust fund, which is administered by the World Bank. In passing, it is worth noting that the trust fund&#146;s accounts are audited by an external agency, PricewaterhouseCoopers. That helps us to assess the effectiveness of our aid, which is not always possible for other money going to Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08071089000102">In that context, the allocation of additional funds for development and stabilisation assistance announced by the Prime Minister in December are particularly welcome. The additional &#163;450 million between 2009 and 2012 breaks down into about &#163;115 million for each financial year, with another &#163;105 million for the new interdepartmental stabilisation aid fund. That is really important, given the context of our debate and the thoughtful contributions of hon. Members&#151;with the one exception of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames). I shall return to that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08071089000103">The additional funds include &#163;30 million for the new Afghanistan investment climate facility, which aims not to tackle climate change but to assist business development in Afghanistan. There is also further support for the reconstruction trust fund, and stronger support for provincial and local government. A number of hon. Members alluded to the fact that we need to build up not only the central Government of Afghanistan, but local councils and governors&#146; offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08071089000104">There are new programmes to support civil service reforms, including a new national justice programme, and an additional &#163;10 million for microfinance initiatives has been provided. That money is extremely important to women, particularly those who have been widowed, to enable them to start businesses and support their families. Most important, there is additional money for horticulture and livestock, and agricultural development in Helmand itself. Again, I pay tribute to the Committee for noting the work that still needs to be done on rural development, in particular the assistance still needed in Helmand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para21"><a name="08071089000105">We should also note that &#163;55 million was given last August to help to pay the salaries of Afghan teachers, doctors and nurses, and that an additional &#163;3 million was given to help tackle the growing food shortages. Those things are really important. We know why tackling the food shortages is important, but the money for teachers, doctors and nurses is critical, because it helps to build the legitimacy of the Afghan state. It is important that such amounts have been made available for teachers and doctors, but they need to keep up with the growth in wages in the private sector in Afghanistan so that there is a good capacity of teaching staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08071089000106">It is important that we note that such measures are being taken, but we should also ask whether they are effective. As has already been said, reconstruction in Afghanistan is happening at different rates in different provinces. Five million children are in school in the country, but more needs to be done, especially in rural areas. Access to basic health care has risen, from 9 to 82 per cent., and the proportion of women who receive antenatal care has increased from 5 to 30 per cent. MPs visiting Helmand have spoken of improved opportunities and growth in the number of jobs, although they recognise that a huge amount of development needs to take place. It is not a uniform picture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08071089000107">Having made it clear that progress is being made at different rates around the country, I should like to turn briefly to Helmand, with the caveat, which we must all remember, that Helmand is not Afghanistan, and we should therefore treat the two differently. Last month, I welcomed the chairman, deputy chairman and two female members of the Helmand provincial council to Parliament. What they told the all-party group is instructive to us all. They made it clear that they wanted enhanced health care, more education, better road systems, the opportunity to grow vegetables and other staple crops, and factories to be constructed, by which they meant factories in their population centres. The councillors&#146; comments were insightful and informative, and I could not help thinking how fortunate Afghanistan is to have such committed and articulate local politicians. The women, even if they were reticent at first, were incredibly articulate and forthcoming about women&#146;s needs in that country. It was clear that they knew exactly what to deliver for local politicians and how to go about it, if only they were given half a chance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para24"><a name="08071089000108">The members of the provincial council had a clear understanding of their development needs and how, with international help, development could be delivered. They told me that it would be impossible to achieve the sort of Helmand that they wanted in future without international aid. They asked us a number of times to give a commitment that Britain and other international donors were there for the long term. Obviously, we  <br>

could not speak for other countries, but we did our best to reassure them that we felt that in this country there was cross-party consensus in favour of staying for the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para25"><a name="08071089000109">The councillors were honest about the lack of development of state institutions. Nevertheless, they were able to point out that progress was being made with local government, the governor&#146;s office, their council, and the training of Afghan nationals for the police and army. Of course, they acknowledged that there was a long way to go, but they did not give a negative presentation; rather, they said that steady progress was being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para26"><a name="08071089000110">It was clear from their visit and other evidence that channelling aid to construct a state is essential, and that a new generation of Afghan politicians who want progress and who understand democratic systems of government are emerging. They also emphasised that the provincial reconstruction team in Helmand was engaging with the local council and community development councils at a more local level to determine priorities, which I know from my own experience in Afghanistan. Those things were at an early stage, which is acknowledged by almost everyone, but the fact that the discussions on how money was going to be spent locally were taking place at all is worth mentioning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="80710h0003.htm_para27"><a name="08071089000111">On a previous visit to Afghanistan I met the DFID team in Kabul and their representative on the PRT in Helmand. I can only pay tribute to how they were working with local agencies and fledgling Government structures to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans, so I could not disagree more with the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. Indeed, I listened to his speech with a growing sense of alarm and unease, because I have heard the same from other Members, including the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood), who might wish to correct me when he speaks. I can see a narrative developing that says that DFID is not delivering in Afghanistan and that only the Army can deliver aid to the country. I am not sure that we have evidence to support that argument.</p>

 I tried carefully to differentiate Helmand and the rest of Afghanistan and acknowledged the marvellous work that DFID is doing in the latter. Both the Government response and the Committee&#146;s report specifically refer to the UK effort in Helmand. In their response, the Government</p>

together to deliver aid in Afghanistan and, indeed, elsewhere. CIMIC says that it is listening to local communities to find what they and the military can do to help each other. It wants aid to be delivered through a partnership approach. We should pay attention to that. CIMIC uses non-governmental organisations when that is appropriate, and although not many international NGOs operate in Helmand, some Afghan NGOs operate there, which we should not forget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para1"><a name="08071089000116">Delivering 80 per cent. of aid through the Government of Afghanistan has attracted some criticism. Someone said earlier that usually the criticism is that even if the money is directed through the Government, too much of it ends up being delivered by the military, which NGOs do not want. There is a balance to be struck, and we have probably got it about right. The CIMIC teams and the military, working through the PRTs and local councils, are delivering quick-impact projects and helping to reconstruct everything from electricity power stations to roads. It is not that the work is not happening, but it must be undertaken through the proper structures&#151;in particular, structures that recognise the important voice that the Afghan people should have in setting priorities and building their country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para2"><a name="08071089000117">In terms of aid effectiveness, we could consider a greater role for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. I do not think that the United Nations has been mentioned in this debate. When I last spoke to the representative who co-ordinates UNAMA&#146;s work in Afghanistan, the representative was concerned that UNAMA was not operating in Helmand, as it probably should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para3"><a name="08071089000118">The Committee&#146;s report and the Government response deal effectively with the thorny issue of lack of aid co-ordination. Sometimes that is what the problem boils down to. It is getting better, although we need to consider what UNAMA could do, but there are two major obstacles. The first is the lack of a high-level joint UN-NATO-EU co-ordinator. We can only lament the fact that no one was put into that role earlier this year, and I am keen to hear from the Minister what is being done to encourage the Afghan Government to get on with making an appointment to that post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08071089000119">The second obstacle is the operation of USAID, which is another bone of contention between me and the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. I do not deny that things are delivered through USAID, but almost everyone whom one speaks to in Afghanistan says that aid delivery would be much more effective if only the US would work with everyone else.</p>

 To reinforce that, and for the House&#146;s benefit, I should highlight how important it is to engage with local communities in delivering aid. We drove in Lashkar Gah, where the British were building an extension to the road. When we discussed it, the locals said, &#147;Please don&#146;t copy the Americans and use cobbles. All our vegetables are destroyed on the way to market, and none of our animals can use the road.&#148; They built six miles of lovely road for the people, but it is useless to the local community.</p>

 We allude to that in the report. Our analysis was that a high proportion of US aid is spent in Washington DC rather than in Kabul or Helmand. That is part of the problem. The US Government&#146;s refusal to participate in the trust fund administered by the World Bank means that the Afghan Government do not have control over the funds that they need to provide development to the people they want to provide it for. The point of putting the photograph we did on the front of the report is that it depicts something that cannot happen in Helmand, because the girls would be massacred by the Taliban. They need protection to go to a state-run school in safety.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. I hope that DFID has renewed its efforts, as outlined in the Government&#146;s response, to encourage the US and other donors to channel a greater proportion of funding through the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund, as parallel structures do not help to develop Afghan capacity. We could all give lots of examples of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08071089000124">Some in the UK have been making loud noises recently about the need to channel more aid through military structures. I hope that we will hear those sentiments with great caution. We should pay tribute in this debate to the armed forces, which are seeking through great sacrifice to create a more secure and stable Afghanistan, but we should also say that surely their role is to create secure and stable conditions within which development can take place rather than to take on an additional development role themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08071089000125">For long-term development of Afghanistan, it is essential that a properly functioning state and its institutions are created, have legitimacy and develop effective economic management. To achieve that, the Government must take control of reconstruction aid and how it is prioritised and developed in conjunction with the international community, local government and local people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08071089000126">We must remember that developing a state from scratch is not easy. Of course there will be setbacks&#151;development is not guaranteed to be linear&#151;but we must not allow our impatience to dictate a course of action that will distract us from long-term goals, particularly those set by the people of Afghanistan. Eventually, Afghanistan will have to govern itself. It will have to use its army and police to good effect, build a tax base and use the money efficiently to benefit its whole population. International security forces may be able to help to deliver infrastructure gains, but that must be seen by Afghans as a process controlled by the Afghan Government, not by those outside the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08071089000127">I could talk for ever about Afghanistan and what it needs. Suffice it to say that I think that the report is excellent. It points to the successes without papering over the remaining challenges. I am also pleased that the report mentioned some of the complexities, including the difficult issue of poppy cultivation. When I was in Afghanistan and since then, I have met a number of people who have said again and again that there are no straightforward answers. We will eradicate poppy cultivation through long-term investment in Afghanistan&#146;s businesses and alternative livelihoods, and that is not likely to happen overnight. The solution is also linked to winning the battle of hearts and minds, which I think we are well on our way to doing.</p>

 I pay tribute to the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) for her contribution to this important debate. She is the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on Afghanistan, an important group. I agree with a lot of what she said, particularly about the importance of microfinance projects, but I must say that if she did not like the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), she might take issue with mine too. I do not think that it is right that our involvement in Afghanistan, which has now lasted longer than the second world war, should have continued so long. Something is going wrong when what is happening there has lasted longer than the second world war.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para10"><a name="08071089000130">What my hon. Friend was stressing was that as long as our boys are exposed at the top of the hill because not enough action is happening at the bottom, they will continue to get killed. We need to ask what can be done to rectify that situation. That was the genesis of my hon. Friend&#146;s contribution, and that is why we pose the basic question whether DFID is the right vehicle for reconstruction and development in places such as Helmand, not in the rest of Afghanistan.</p>

 Not now; I want to make some progress. The hon. Lady made an important distinction, which has been echoed elsewhere. Afghanistan and Helmand are two completely separate scenarios and need to be treated as such because of the security differences. I pay tribute to the right hon.

 Absolutely, but the old Department of Trade and Industry exports system had a Committee created to scrutinise the whole issue, so should not that sort of arrangement be adopted, rather than Departments taking their own slice of the spectrum? That means, as we have just heard, that the right hon. Gentleman can speak only about the section for which he is responsible, and that can be a little confusing. That is the point that I am trying to stress.</p>

What is the objective, how will it be measured and at what point do we say that we have succeeded or failed? Those yardsticks are missing, and where we are trying to go can be blurred as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para13"><a name="08071089000137">Year after year, we send more troops, but we have to ask ourselves, six years after the initial invasion, is life any better for the average Afghan? I am afraid that optimism is being replaced by pessimism in certain areas of Afghanistan, not because of the military but because of the failure to reconstruct during the small window of opportunity after the military went in to win hearts and minds and because not enough progress is being made while the military is holding the peace.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman made an analogy with the length of the second world war, but Britain and the US did not decide half way through that war to stop, go somewhere else and come back later. Surely, the big mistake in Afghanistan and the reason why we missed many windows of opportunity was the mad distraction of going into Iraq. That divided our resources, and we took our eye off the ball and missed the central point that unless there is follow-through, al-Qaeda will be back.</p>

 I would like to make some progress, because many of the comments that other hon. Members want to make will be similar to mine. I will give way to the hon. Member for City of Durham later because I shall be particularly interested in her feedback as we progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para14"><a name="08071089000142">We should first understand that the Afghan Government are not the great organisation that we would like them to be: a western-type, constitutional structure that can influence every single region. They are wafer thin. President Karzai&#146;s influence is limited to Kabul, as those hon. Members who visited Afghanistan will have realised. He is often called the Mayor of Kabul because his influence in some areas is so thin. The Ministries are led by enthusiastic individuals, many of them returned exiles, but they are wafer thin. We expect them suddenly to provide results, but that will not happen without important outside influence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para15"><a name="08071089000143">The other most important point to stress about Afghanistan is that it cannot really be called a country. It is a patchwork quilt of individual alliances, allegiances and religions that have only ever come together when someone else has gone in to try to take over. Once that is finished, they get back to doing what they do best, which is fighting among each other. It is only now, after a little bit of peace, that people have bought into the plan to make an Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para16"><a name="08071089000144">My biggest concern about the current constitution&#151; the blueprint&#151;is that it gives insufficient local autonomy to the provinces to develop at their own speed. When I visited Nangarhar province, I found that that was the case. The governor wanted some operational money to build three small dams&#151;not Hoover-sized dams&#151;to hold back the water to feed the crops during the summer months. Kabul denied him that funding because he was not allowed to spend any money himself, and that sort of error is frustrating the wish of many governors to develop their province at their own speed.

made it clear that civil war was very much a possibility in a couple of years because not enough progress was being made. Everyone is getting impatient, so weapons are cached and money is stored for when things fall apart, which would be a sad situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08071089000145">The international community is pivotal to the prevention of such a situation. We have heard that the USA has a different approach from that which has been adopted by DFID. It is absolutely right that there should be some sharing of experiences so that those differences are ruled out. More importantly, individuals following their own agendas, possibly with the influence of their host country, cause a colossal waste of money. I thought that the new UN co-ordinator in Afghanistan had an influence in that regard. I am saddened that Paddy Ashdown did not get the job, because he would have been fantastic for the post. Unfortunately, he was not corrupt enough, and if we are honest, that was the case. He was going to kick out people such as Wali Karzai, who is an adviser in Kandahar and the brother of President Karzai. He should really be given a job on an island somewhere, quite separate from Afghanistan, and have no influence in the new country that we are talking about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08071089000146">There is a fundamental lack of economic vision. Let us consider what Afghanistan does well. Thirty years ago it produced crops, dried fruits and agricultural products, and it was one of the greenest countries in the region. The Soviets came in and destroyed the agricultural and irrigation systems. Consequently, much of the area is now desert. Ninety-two per cent. of the water that comes out of the ground disappears out of the country and is not harnessed. Only 8 per cent. of the water supply in Afghanistan is harnessed, and that is where things are going wrong, because harnessing the water supply will suddenly provide life and allow locals to grow things. There is no top-scale vision to implement that, which is one of the fundamental flaws in the redevelopment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80710h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08071089000147">Also, if one has a widget and wants to get it to market, one needs the ability to get it from A to B. There are three main arterial routes in Afghanistan: one to the east, one to the west, which we talked about before and is now beginning to look like a railway line, and one to the south. Although those routes have improved somewhat, I am afraid that they have not improved a huge amount since 2001. Bringing in Swiss engineers to build a railway line to link up with Jalalabad, Islamabad and up to the trans-Siberian railway, and linking up a better road to the south with the ports in the Indian ocean would start to link Afghanistan to the international markets and the world. That has not happened, so the only market that works is the good old black market, and that is why local Mr. Afghan has decided to stick with what he knows best and continues to grow poppies. I believe that those two aspects are still missing from the vision. There is not enough time to talk about the issues surrounding the police, other than to say that the only way they can make money and supplement their poor incomes is by setting up road blocks.</p>

showing the locals that we mean business. If that is not done, the locals start to question what the point is. They turn around and conclude, &#147;Life was pretty much better under the old lot.&#148; They then start to work, support and be influenced by the Taliban, and we find ourselves in a struggle with the Taliban.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that he is putting forward a really negative picture of what is happening, even in Helmand, and that we have seen growing confidence over the past six months in the new governor&#146;s office and the ability of the provincial council to set its agenda, which includes economic development? Does he also accept that the Afghan people recognise the limitation of what has been done so far, but are not negative about the possibilities for the future, or even the present, to the extent that he suggests?</p>

 The hon. Lady makes an absolutely valid point. I could stand here and list an array of improvements that have taken place and congratulate ourselves on the work that Britain is doing, but the point is that lives are being lost. As long as lives are being lost, it is important to scrutinise what we are doing and ask ourselves whether we can do it better. Indeed, Hugh Powell, who is now the Foreign and Commonwealth Office main man in Helmand, is starting to knock heads together, co-ordinate activities and move things forward. My concern is that it is very late in the day for that.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend agree that everyone involved in these operations, from Brigadier Carlton-Smith down, understands that things in Helmand are not going as well as they should, and that the only way to make them go better is to make the military and civilians work together better? Until that is done, we will be faced with very serious consequences, and British soldiers will lose their lives almost daily.</p>

 I fully agree with my hon. Friend, who has spoken to many people not only in DFID but in the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We speak regularly with such people, and some are concerned that we are not as efficient as we could be. Hon. Members who have jumped up and criticised the speeches made so far by the Opposition should be aware that we do not wish to dismiss DFID and what it does. We are simply saying that aspects of its work perhaps need scrutiny, which is what we are asking for.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman misunderstood what we said. If I understood the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) correctly, he said that essentially the solution for Helmand is to give DFID&#146;s budget to the military, but it is not that simple. We need effective co-ordination, and of course we need greater scrutiny. That is why we went there.</p>

 This is where we come to the crux of the argument. Helmand is a dangerous place. According to a parliamentary answer, we are firing 10,000 rounds of ammunition every day, which either means that our military are having a good old heyday shooting their weapons, or that it is extremely dangerous. I suggest the latter. Furthermore, they are very exposed and now involved in the very reconstruction and development that we hoped DFID would engage in two to three years ago.</p>

Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) wants evidence for that, I suggest that he read the answer to parliamentary question 209680, which lists all the projects with which the Royal Engineers have been involved in Helmand province&#151;education, security and law, health, roads, building a mosque and so forth. The list goes on and on. When I asked DFID that same question, I was told that it was paying for just one NGO to operate there at the moment, because it is so dangerous. When I asked how much it cost to employ a DFID person in Afghanistan, I was told that it was &#163;250,000 a year. That is a colossal amount of money compared with the cost of a colonel from the Royal Engineers, who could be employed for &#163;50,000 and do a pretty similar job.</p>

Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex made the point that in some circumstances DFID does a fantastic job&#151;I was in Sierra Leone two weeks ago&#151;of investing money in the local system and ensuring that it trickles down to the front line. That is fantastic. However, in other circumstances, the infrastructure simply is not there for any of that money to reach the front line. It does not get from Kabul to Kandahar to Lashkar Gah, because the line is broken. A new form of expeditionary force, working under dangerous circumstances, might bridge the gap between war fighting, peacekeeping and nation building better than DFID. That would get the job done quicker, which would mean that our soldiers were less exposed. That is what we are talking about.</p>

Security, the rule of law and governance are the crucial aspects. Of course, schools and hospitals are important, but ask General Jones, General Craddock, General McNeill, or anyone else on the ground, and they will say, &#147;You secure the area first, then you get some of the locals to start making their own decisions.&#148; We did not do that in Afghanistan; we created a constitution that gave power to Kabul, ignoring the local jirgas and wise owls operating in the districts and councils. Only recently have we started to listen to them&#151;about four years late. That is the trouble: we have taken a long time to work out  that we will win over hearts and minds through local power bases.</p>

If I was to go to Bournemouth and say, &#147;Build me a nuclear power station,&#148; nobody could do it. This country has no experience of building nuclear power stations. All the expertise did a runner to Canada and America, because that was where such projects were continuing. We will need help from outside&#151;this is what the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is doing&#151;because we do not have the ability. The same applies in Afghanistan, which does not have the ability to build a railroad&#151;I do not think that it has ever built one.

$4,000 to get through all the checkpoints, and to pay the driver enough money to rent the vehicle and to get there. That is not the way to build a market or the way the infrastructure should work. Those are the details that need considering, and possibly the Royal Engineers can play an increased role.</p>

Musa Qala, which has been taken more times than Tobruk&#151;I think&#151;is now in our hands. It kept falling, because we never won over hearts and minds. People in that town want one thing: a mosque. They asked DFID to build it, but for whatever reason&#151;I am still investigating&#151;it could not provide the goods. The Royal Engineers are now building that mosque that the people want so much. If hon. Members doubt that, I have the parliamentary answers to prove it.

 I am glad that I got that right. It was created as a sort of spin-off of the FCO to make us better able to identify and scrutinise where aid was being spent.

 The right hon. Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) made a very good point about how successful DFID was in Bosnia. When I was Minister of State for the Armed Forces, at the height of the Bosnian campaign, it was too dangerous for development staff to be there. I remember a lance corporal who was given &#163;3,000 and told to build a school. He came back with &#163;1,000 change, having built a school with his section and got it up and running in four days. When it was safe, DFID came in and ran a marvellous reconstruction programme, which has put Bosnia back on its feet. Nobody is disputing the good work that DFID can do. However, sometimes, it is simply too treacherous, difficult and fundamentally dangerous for civilians with&#151;frankly&#151;a profoundly anti-military ethos to enter such an area and successfully do what we have to do if we are to stay on the ground.</p>

 My hon. Friend reminds me of Bosnia, where I served as a captain.

He turned up without his wellington boots, and we had to find him a pair so that he could come out on to the training ground with us&#151;but I do not want to digress. The important point is that after the war fighting, the first thing that I did, with 102 men, was to think about what I could do to keep those men busy and keep on the good side of the very people with whom we had had a bit of a fracas.

It was the military that did that, because I was able to punch in, form a perimeter and do something in the centre.

 That is where DFID&#146;s budget is going, across the whole of Afghanistan. It cannot put teachers into schools in Helmand because of the security situation, and security is what our military needs to provide. Of course, there is an issue of co-operation between civilians and the military, but the hon.

 The right hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. Mosques are what the locals want, and are what will prevent them from joining the Taliban. Understanding hearts and minds, and the needs of the individuals, is paramount. If the right hon. Gentleman does not understand that, and he says that DFID does not do that, somebody must do. If DFID is pouring money into the top and paying for teachers, that is fantastic and long may it continue, but what I am saying is that we are not resolving issues at the pithead where things are tough.

 The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) had a distinguished career in the Royal Green Jackets. I welcome the practical military experience that he brings to development work. He described for us the roads and the lack of access to markets. We should listen to that detail.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s speech. I welcome that. I do not want people to dismiss the military as though they were just gun toters holding the line. They think through such questions. At the same time, people in the military have to ask questions such as, &#147;What is DFID doing? What can it do best? How does it best deliver with its own particular skills, experiences and abilities?&#148;</p>

It was at the bottom of every indicator: economic, health, education and life expectancy. We forget how far back Afghanistan was. Afghanistan poses a three-cornered problem: the security, military and violent conflict problem; the development problem; and the problem of poppy cultivation, production and distribution. That third factor makes the situation in Afghanistan different from that in Sierra Leone and Iraq, which is why we need to focus on it.</p>

Member for Mid-Sussex was a Minister at the time. The Conservative Government seemed to be opposed to that and also to giving mosques charity relief like Christian churches. If we had started down that road 30 years ago, we might have a slightly different problem in Britain now. The mosques are about hearts and minds.

<a name="80710h0005.htm_brev1"><a name="08071089000237"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;they would be ready to stop poppy cultivation if access to alternative livelihoods was available.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80710h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08071089000182">In fact, the Select Committee was told that, if a farmer was told that 50 per cent. of his field was to be destroyed, he would simply plant 50 per cent. more poppy. In addition, it found that eradication in 2007 mainly destroyed marginal fields and that deals were often struck between village elders and eradication teams that always resulted in the poorest farmers being targeted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80710h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08071089000183">If we are to deal with poppy cultivation, we must adopt a new approach. We must tackle the issues and consider alternative livelihoods. In a sense, it is a micro-problem. What is the methodology of DFID and development thinkers that relates the eradication of the poppy with alternative livelihoods? Is it just words that are put together or is there really a strategy? The report says:</p>
<a name="80710h0005.htm_brev2"><a name="08071089000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A different approach is emerging which seeks to mainstream counter-narcotics into broader development policy. This involved moving away from small local projects and adjusting the focus of development programmes so that they take account of the impact of interventions in different sectors on opium poppy production. Thus alternative livelihoods would become a more integrated and holistic approach to rural livelihoods.&#148;</p>

protectionist policy, set by the US Government, and that protectionist policy blocks access to certain crops and seeds that the US Government see as being in competition with their own crops back home in America. In other words, there is a restriction on what seeds and crops the Afghans can grow, because of protectionist agricultural policies in America. That is why the Afghans cannot buy the seeds. If there is a restriction on alternative crops and seeds, yes, they will grow melons, because they cannot grow other more productive crops. That is part of the problem that needs addressing by the international community, because protectionist US agricultural policies, backed up by agribusiness, deny access to crops that would knock out the poppy but would also inevitably compete in a world marketplace.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="80710h0005.htm_para24"><a name="08071089000190">I would like to give another example that may be worth looking at. The other most difficult place in the world is probably Colombia, where of course all the cocaine comes from. The same issue applies: how do we deal with security and the cultivation of coca? I simply want to say to the Minister and through him to DFID that there are strategies for alternative livelihoods and those are whole-village strategies, as they call them in Colombia. They are run not by the Government or DFID, but usually by local communities or churches, as part of whole-region strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80710h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08071089000191">Those strategies relate to points made by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods). I think that she read out a letter or referred to the remarks of the visitors from Afghanistan who came here. They said that they wanted better health care, schools, roads and the ability to grow vegetables and to build carpet and rug factories in their country. That is exactly what was said in Colombia. Let us adopt an integrated village approach, so that we tackle all those problems in a co-ordinated way, and we might then have a vision of what a holistic, integrated alternative livelihood strategy might be. Simply saying, &#147;Can we plant one set of seeds that are different? And you are not allowed to plant the seeds that would really get you to the marketplace and make you money,&#148; is not a strategy. That is where the whole process seems to me to be falling down now. Can we make sense of that? In a sense, it is a question of the methodology of the development thinkers and activists. Can they think out a strategy that makes sense of that integrated holistic thinking? What are those alternative livelihoods?</p>

So that means, yes, providing economic development but also providing schools&#151;I agree with the right hon.

 I am almost tempted to say that I welcome the way in which the World Bank evokes the almost Pavlovian response that we are faffing around, as soon as it is mentioned, because it takes so long for things to happen. That applies not just to the World Bank, but the hon. Gentleman makes an important point: the time gap could cost lives and not just the lives of soldiers; it can cost the lives of the people in Afghanistan itself and the lives of the people in my constituency who are dying of heroin. So it is important that we shorten some of those distances and bring people together, to have more direct strategies. That is why I welcome to some extent the &#147;Bournemouth, East&#148; strategy&#151;if I can call it that&#151;because there is a practical intent of marching down the road and getting there, rather than discussing it for ever.

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08071089000204">The photograph on the front cover of the &#147;Reconstructing Afghanistan&#148; report is one of the most powerful I have ever seen. Unfortunately, it is not a photograph that I have seen in any of our national media, because of the confusion of Afghanistan and Iraq that still persists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para7"><a name="08071089000205">The particular reason why I wanted to speak today is that the past month has been particularly difficult for the garrison town of Colchester, which I represent, because eight soldiers from 16 Air Assault Brigade have lost their lives. About 3,000 soldiers based in my constituency are in Afghanistan. It is important in a debate such as this that the message goes out to the media and the people in this country that Afghanistan is not just a military exercise and that our soldiers, airmen, sailors, marines and all the people who, in varying ways, are serving in Afghanistan, particularly southern Afghanistan, know that they are valued and appreciated. For me, there is no difference between the various Brits, be they in uniform or working for DFID or for NGOs: they are all contributing to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08071089000206">Like the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods), who is the chairman of the all-party group on Afghanistan, I had the honour of meeting the chairman of the Helmand provincial council, the deputy chair and the two lady council members. Their message was one of appreciation: they really appreciate what Britain is doing to help to rebuild their province. They had come from Lashkar Gah, a place that I visited earlier this year with the armed forces parliamentary scheme. They had a message of hope. They asked us,  <br>

&#147;Please keep on helping us to rebuild our country, which has suffered 30 years of awful internal warfare.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08071089000207">I share the view that if Afghanistan drifts back to what it was as recently as 10 years ago, not only will the drug culture continue to export itself to the civilised world but terrorism will be exported around the world again. It is therefore in this country&#146;s interest that we build a settled, prosperous and peaceful Afghanistan. And yes, it will take a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08071089000208">In paying tribute to all the members of Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces, I disagree with recommendation 26 of the Committee&#146;s report, which states:</p>
<a name="80710h0006.htm_brev0"><a name="08071089000243"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We ask the Secretary of State to discuss with the Ministry of Defence the feasibility of extending UK military commanders&#146; tours of duty in Helmand to, say, one year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para11"><a name="08071089000209">The obvious continuation of that is that the tour of the brigade would also continue for a year, and I do not think that that is a reasonable option. I hope that when he sums up, the Minister will say, perhaps on behalf of his Ministry of Defence colleagues, that the Government will not pursue that recommendation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para12"><a name="08071089000210">I believe that it is in the interests of this country and of NATO that we succeed in Afghanistan. I end by repeating a point that I made at Prime Minister&#146;s questions last week, which was made then in a military context, but is made now in the context of reconstruction. The rest of the civilised world has to make a far bigger contribution to the work in Afghanistan, because the whole civilised world will benefit from a successful outcome in that country.</p>

 What a debate this has been. Like many right hon. and hon. Members, I have spent many an hour in Westminster Hall over the years, but few of them have been as worth while as the past two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08071089000212">Let me be the latest to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), to all the members of the Select Committee who are here this afternoon, and to others who have participated in the debate. The debate has neatly summarised all the questions that are being asked about our role in Afghanistan, but I notice that nobody is questioning the role; rather, they are asking how we could do it better. We have heard contributions from both ends of the optimistic-pessimistic spectrum, but it is important to note our shared political commitment to Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08071089000213">May I also pay tribute to the people who have lost their lives in Afghanistan, as the right hon. Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) did earlier? It is a sad feature of Prime Minister&#146;s questions that almost weekly we hear a roll call of those who have given their lives on our behalf and in the service of the people of Afghanistan, Iraq and many other places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08071089000214">Like others, I also pay tribute to the bravery of people working in the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the NGO sector. They leave the relative comfort of these islands to go far around the world to places of great uncertainty and great danger, however well prepared they are. I hope that we always protect them to the best of our ability. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude, and we must never forget what they do on our behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08071089000215">If we doubted the seriousness or difficulty of the security situation, the brutal attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul this week was a real reminder and a sign that the conflict is unusual. We are arguing today about development, but, frankly, too much of Afghanistan is still a war zone. That creates unique and difficult problems. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer many of the questions that have come up today and set out the vision that he and his fellow Ministers have for Britain&#146;s role there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para17"><a name="08071089000216">Like many others who have spoken this afternoon, I believe that failure would be catastrophic for the people of Afghanistan. As the right hon. Member for Leeds, West said, Afghanistan was the poorest country in the world 11 or 12 years ago. There has been a little bit of progress, but it is still in the rock-bottom section of all the world&#146;s indices and league tables in which countries do not want to feature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08071089000217">The situation matters to the people of Afghanistan, but it also matters to us in Britain. The right hon. Gentleman painted a vivid, stark picture of the perils of heroin on our streets. The fact that some 93 per cent. of the world&#146;s heroin can be traced back to Afghanistan is shocking, and it makes the conflict in Afghanistan relevant to every constituency in the land. Rural constituencies such as mine in south-east Scotland, where people might think that there is not a heroin problem, are affected by drugs as badly, relatively speaking, as many other constituencies. We all need to worry about drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08071089000218">Equally, we will have security issues to face if Afghanistan cannot be sorted, or if Pakistan and Afghanistan become a bigger problem. The whole region will become unstable. That takes us right back to the original argument made after 9/11: we need to be engaged&#151;this matters to us. It is not just about moral responsibilities or altruistic imperatives. It is about self-interest. The two themes coming together will make Afghanistan very important for a very long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para20"><a name="08071089000219">I shall keep my comments relatively brief because it is important that the Minister has an opportunity to respond. He has a huge number of questions to answer. I do not want to repeat too much of what has been said already, but I would like to emphasise some themes and ask a few more questions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08071089000220">Since the report and the Government response were published, other reports have flooded in. One from the World Bank struck me. It highlighted the fact that there has been little to show for the $1.6 billion of technical assistance that was offered and given to Afghanistan. There are real problems with the nature of the aid and types of assistance that we provide. The Agency Co-ordinating Body for Afghan Relief spoke about poor delivery and effectiveness of the aid that has been delivered. It was highly critical of the fact that so little of what had been promised had arrived.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para22"><a name="08071089000221">At a donor conference only a few weeks ago, a new series of pledges were made totalling $20 billion&#151;well short of what President Karzai asked for, but, none the less, a significant amount. I am sure that the Minister will wish to trumpet the United Kingdom&#146;s contribution. We should pay tribute to DFID and to the Government for their investment. What is not clear yet is the extent to which the pledges, whether from DFID or other  <br>

parts of the international community, are new. It would be helpful if the Minister took a little time to set out how all the different amounts fit in with each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para23"><a name="08071089000222">It is important that we focus on the effectiveness of our aid. In particular, we must look to our neighbours in the European Union. My hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) made an important point towards the end of his speech about military contributions, and I emphasise and echo his sentiments in that respect. Equally, however, it is important to co-ordinate with our partners in the EU the nature of the aid that we provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para24"><a name="08071089000223">I have just spent a week in Kosovo, which, obviously, is a tiny situation compared with what is happening in Afghanistan, but the scale of the problems arising from poor co-ordination and the mismanagement of aid is truly alarming. The report and the Committee were right to focus much of their efforts on that. Again, in the follow-through from the Paris conference, it would be helpful if the Minister explained what we are doing to tackle the basic machinery and ensure that our aid is delivered as effectively as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08071089000224">A few weeks ago, Lord Malloch-Brown provided a briefing to Members of both Houses of Parliament at the Foreign Office. Some Members who are here this afternoon were present. He spoke about changes to the complement of British military people in Afghanistan and about a matter that goes to the heart of what has become the burning question this afternoon: the interface, particularly in Helmand, between military and civilian operations. Again, it would be helpful to unpick some of the movements. I understood that there is to be a net increase of 250 Brits in Afghanistan, but that includes a mix of civilian and military personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08071089000225">It was interesting, for many of us who were at the briefing, to learn that there was to be a new civilian role running the military-civilian headquarters in Helmand, with an increase in the headquarters staff of 60. It was put to us&#151;it goes with the territory that some metaphor for a plug and socket-type arrangement always has to be created&#151;that that arrangement would try to tackle some of the problems that the Committee has recognised, which my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester mentioned, about how we deal with the handover between new military detachments and civilian contributions as people inevitably move back to the UK and others come out to Afghanistan. It would be helpful to understand when that is going to take place, how it is expected to work and whether it will answer many of the legitimate questions asked by the hon. Members for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) and for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08071089000226">On interdepartmental co-ordination, where the House of Commons has a major responsibility, we all need a bit of reassurance about how the three Departments are working. None of us question the motivations of the Ministers and civil servants, but it would be useful&#151;the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East suggested it&#151;if we had arrangements that allowed Ministers from different Departments to come before the House to be cross-examined on some of these matters. We used to have that type of facility in this Chamber. This is a perfect issue on which cross-departmental scrutiny and accountability could be brought into play. I hope that the Minister listens to that idea, regards it favourably and persuades his colleagues that it would be worth while doing here, because it matters that we have reassurance  <br>

and can see for ourselves how the Departments are working together and that they are working for the same aims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para28"><a name="08071089000227">This afternoon, right hon. and hon. Members have rightly focused on security and the difficult interface that it sometimes has with development. In anticipation of this debate, I gathered some staggering figures that I had checked. I am told that the United States military spends $100 million per day on Afghanistan. That contrasts with $7 million a day for all the international aid contributions. I do not dispute the $100 million figure, although I questioned its accuracy and was told that it comes from Congressional Library resources&#151;I would not question the House of Commons Library, so I will not question that source, either. Nor do I question that that sum is necessary. However, that is an eye-opener and a reminder of the scale of the military activity still required. Beyond the international security assistance force is Operation Enduring Freedom and war that still continues. However, there is a big discrepancy between those numbers and somewhere along the line we have to get the two more into balance with one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para29"><a name="08071089000228">I should briefly like to emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) and the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) about the role of women and the importance of ensuring that we support their development and provide them with the resources that they require. We must keep to the fore of our mind the importance of balanced development, as the Committee did by putting the photograph of the young women in school on the front of the report.</p>

 Does my hon. Friend not think that we need to reinforce this point? The information that I gave in my opening speech about the reduction of women&#146;s participation in the government of Afghanistan is disturbing because it gives the impression that women are effectively being shut out by the domestic Government.</p>

<p><a name="st_78"><a name="08071089000230"><a name="80710h0006.htm_spnew7"><a name="08071089000330"><b>Mr. Moore:</b>
 I agree. I hope that in their diplomatic initiatives and in every other way, the Minister and his colleagues will ensure that that point is emphasised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="80710h0006.htm_para30"><a name="08071089000231">The hon. Member for City of Durham mentioned the Afghan people wanting a normal life&#151;she was quoted by the right hon. Member for Leeds, West&#151;and all the different things that they want to get on with to be normal. We in this country also want the positive benefits that come from that normal life and that viable state. It is important that we ensure that our efforts in Britain are co-ordinated and effective, and that we deliver on that aim.</p>

 This has been a fascinating, worthwhile debate, as is usually the case when we discuss the reports of the International Development Committee.

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para0"><a name="08071095000002">First, I shall say a word or two about how the visit to Afghanistan that I have just completed affects my view  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="10 July 2008">

<notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>10 July 2008 : Column 526WH</b><br>
of the report. Secondly, I shall comment on where we are as regards development in Afghanistan today. Thirdly, and briefly, because the Minister already has a lot of other points to argue, I want to mention 10 aspects  of the report where the Committee has made recommendations, some of which have already been mentioned, and invite the Minister to give a view on those points. If the hon. Gentleman does not have time to respond to those points or if the answer eludes him, perhaps he will write to all Committee members, and those right hon. and hon. Members who have attended today, to give them the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para1"><a name="08071095000003">I cannot begin without paying tribute to the courage and professionalism of our armed forces in Afghanistan, from where I recently returned after a visit with the shadow Minister for International Development, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), who has served as an officer in Afghanistan. Every person I met, from the highest ranking to the lowest, is guided by an ethos of professionalism and a sense of purpose. The military clearly understands that the ultimate solution to the situation in Helmand and Afghanistan can only be political, not military. I remember standing by the memorial to the British dead at Camp Bastion. When I was there, not many days ago, there were 97 names etched on to the brass plaque, each commemorating a British soldier who had died in Afghanistan. Since then, 13 names have been added to that plaque, bringing the total to 110.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para2"><a name="08071095000004">We should also remember the many hundreds of Afghan troops who have been killed in the service of their country. I pay tribute to the British civilian staff in Afghanistan, including the dedicated and knowledgeable team at the DFID offices, who are working incredibly hard in unusual, testing conditions to try to ensure that real development gains are made. We are fortunate to have such an able team from the Foreign Office, led by the outstanding Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles. We should not forget the locally engaged Afghan staff, including translators and support workers, who work for the British Government. These people often run risks in doing their work and we in Britain have a duty to offer them the maximum possible protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para3"><a name="08071095000005">During my visit, I met representatives from the United States, all major European nations engaged there, the major donors, the United Nations and the World Bank. I also saw the impressive work done by many non-governmental organisations, including Mercy Corps, and Turquoise Mountain, under the guidance of Rory Stewart, who is doing such a good job in Kabul. I met President Karzai as well as senior members of his Government, including the Ministers responsible for education, finance and agriculture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para4"><a name="08071095000006">I visited the military hospital at Camp Bastion. Most of the patients I saw there were Afghan civilians, including children who had been injured in terrorist attacks. One man there was a mechanic who had been blinded when an improvised explosive device blew up outside his workshop. His bandaged face and the worried looks on the faces of his family who clustered by his bedside were a chilling reminder of the human toll of these indiscriminate attacks. I pay tribute to the doctors and staff at the hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para5"><a name="08071095000007">I flew to Lashkar Gah to meet the provincial reconstruction team in Helmand province. I met the  <br>

new governor of Helmand, Governor Mangal, who is rightly held in high regard, but who has already survived a number of assassination attempts. He has a key role to play there. We also met the directors of various line Ministries in Helmand. The picture they painted was not optimistic: it was reported that schools in many areas of Helmand are being shut down due to insecurity. We visited DFID-funded development projects around Lashkar Gah, the counter-narcotics police, and a rehabilitation centre for Afghan opium addicts. Back in Kabul, I met leading female Members of Parliament and NGOs working on women&#146;s empowerment issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08071095000008">It seems to me that the first question to answer today is the one posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood) in his eloquent speech about the mission in Afghanistan and the extent to which we are demonstrating that mission to our fellow citizens. The answer is that international troops are in Afghanistan not as occupiers, but at the request of the Afghan Government. We are there not because of any selfish desire to occupy the country, but in an attempt to allow it to stand on its own two feet as a stable, secure and prosperous nation. Those who claim that we are there as conquerors are either malicious or simply wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para7"><a name="08071095000009">That brings me to recommendation No. 2 of the Select Committee&#146;s report, which makes the point eloquently that DFID and all of us must do more to make the case for being in Afghanistan. I do not chastise the Government for failing to do that, but they must do more and explain the many other aspects of British activity to make the case in Britain for being in Afghanistan, because we will be there for many years. The Minister goes round the country, as I do, talking to communities, groups and schools. He will know from those visits that the reason for being in Afghanistan is not well understood. We must ensure that it is much better understood. No one should be in any doubt that this is a long-term commitment. I emphasise what the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said in his opening remarks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08071095000010">What is the audit of development, gain and failure in Afghanistan today? It seems to me that clear gains are being made. The number of children in school is clearly a significant gain: 5 million are enrolled, 1.5 million of them girls, signalling a complete transformation of the education and opportunities for children. Health care coverage in one form or another&#151;it is sometimes very basic&#151;now reaches 82 per cent. of the country. Training work with the Afghan military is successful and is going very well. We are assisting in building an Afghan army that can be effective in doing its proper job. The Ministry of Rural Affairs is making substantial gains, reaching out into many parts of Afghanistan and bringing development gain with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para9"><a name="08071095000011">The other side of the coin is equally challenging. First, pervasive insecurity throughout large parts of the country continues to undermine everything else. The national police force is a disaster area&#151;we were told that more than 50 per cent. of the police are drugs addicts. Very little progress has been made with the police. The Ministry of the Interior is another disaster area. There is widespread corruption and organised crime. We must face the fact that our efforts so far, which are no doubt worthy and well intended, have simply not been successful. The insecurity that I have  <br>

described is made worse by the food crisis, which is a global problem. The audit suggests that much has been gained, but there is a long way to go in many areas, which remain challenging and where no effective progress has been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08071095000012">I turn to the 10 points that I want to make to the Minister, some of which will pick up points that have been made during the debate. First, I want the Minister to be clear to the Committee about the nature of the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund. It is often said that Britain chooses to pour its money into the Afghan state with no form of audit, unlike other principal donor nations. That is simply not true, and the Select Committee was right to welcome the British focus on working through the Government of Afghanistan via the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund. My understanding is that the money that is disbursed by the World Bank from the trust fund is paid out only on receipt of accounts that are audited by an accredited international firm of accountants. Will he set the record straight today on that important point about the way that taxpayers&#146; money is being deployed and accounted for in Afghanistan?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08071095000013">My second point relates to recommendation No. 25, which covers burden sharing and caveats by other NATO countries. One of the strengths of the international mission in Afghanistan is the multinational nature of the forces deployed there, but other NATO countries are refusing to take up their share of the burden, and national caveats restrict the effectiveness of some of their forces. What recent discussions have the Government had with counterparts in other contributing nations to encourage the relaxation of such restrictions?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08071095000014">My third point relates to recommendation No. 23, which covers the position of Pakistan and neighbouring countries throughout the region. A complaint that I heard frequently in Afghanistan was that the coalition&#146;s diplomatic approach is insufficiently co-ordinated. What is the Minister doing to ensure a comprehensive, joined-up diplomatic approach that deals with all the key regional players? Too often, neighbouring countries in this region, which has been accurately described during the debate, are basically on the side of the coalition&#151;they do not want us to fail&#151;but do not strive over-zealously to ensure that we succeed. Will the Minister explain what the Government are doing to progress that agenda?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08071095000015">Fourthly, I have already touched on the police, but when I met the chief of the Helmand anti-drugs police, he explained that the majority of the regular Afghan police are allegedly addicted to various narcotics and are deeply corrupt. The Germans are in charge of police reform. What recent discussions has the Minister had with the relevant German authorities about improving performance?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08071095000016">My fifth point relates to staff turnover and, obviously, there are a number of different facets to this issue. The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) said that he does not want the terms and length of duty to be extended. The Minister will appreciate that in DFID and the military there is a powerful argument for trying to ensure that tours of duty are extended. Otherwise, people amass great expertise but then leave Afghanistan. The DFID staff I met in Kabul and Lashkar Gah were dedicated, talented and insightful, and clearly do a very good job in difficult conditions, but it is a problem, as it  <br>

is in the military, that as soon as a staff member has built up solid experience of life in the country, they move on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08071095000017">The Government response to the Select Committee&#146;s report rightly underlines DFID&#146;s duty of care to its staff and the need to ensure that they do not suffer from working in such stressful situations. However, will the Minister give more thought to ensuring that talented, effective and experienced staff who want to stay on in Afghanistan are able to do so?</p>

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="08071095000018"><a name="80710h0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="08071095000083"><b>Bob Russell:</b>
 Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether the logical conclusion is that if the brigade commander&#146;s term of deployment is extended to nine months, a year, 15 months or whatever, that should follow through to his entire brigade? If not, how can we have a brigade commander not commanding his brigade?</p>

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="08071095000019"><a name="80710h0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="08071095000084"><b>Mr. Mitchell:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman mentions one of a number of difficulties. The argument is not cut and dried, but I hope that he accepts that it is sub-optimal if senior commanders in the field leave after six or nine months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para16"><a name="08071095000020">By and large, the DFID staff I met in Afghanistan are young and often single, and it would be helpful if the Minister explained what he is doing to try to ensure that older married and more experienced staff, whose skills we need, are encouraged to deploy there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08071095000021">The Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee&#146;s report sets out the detailed security procedures in place for DFID staff. That is obviously right, because safety is paramount, but those constraints often make it difficult for staff to do their job. For example, following one of our meetings, a senior British police adviser trained in the use of firearms had to wait for many hours for a car to be available to take him, with security, the five-minute drive from his meeting to the provincial reconstruction team. What steps is the Minister taking to achieve a balance between security concerns and letting people do their job, so that common sense and flexibility prevail within the absolute requirement to do everything we can to keep people safe?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08071095000022">Sixthly, the subject of helicopters has already been raised. The lack of helicopters in Afghanistan imposes clear a limit on the manoeuvrability of British troops and other staff. The Government have pledged to increase capacity in that area. Can the Minister update us on the Government&#146;s efforts to get more helicopters in-theatre? I do not want to rely on my own limited and dated military experience, but it seems that the whole British effort in Helmand and Afghanistan was woefully short of helicopter support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08071095000023">Seventhly, the need for better aid co-ordination has been underlined. Many senior people from the international donor community whom I have met freely admit that the international aid effort is confused and poorly co-ordinated. Different donors do different things in their own areas, and often even do different things in the same Ministry. The Committee specifically mentioned that in the antecedence to recommendation 19. The whole job of getting a grip on that now falls to the new UN special representative. What recent discussions has the Minister had with him and what actions will he take to promote a joined-up international aid effort? The  <br>

Paris donor conference signed-off additional funding. Will the Minister state clearly that that money will be well spent?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08071095000024">In my intervention on the right hon. Member for Gordon, I mentioned drugs. As many hon. Members have said and as is set out in recommendation No. 35, opium poppy production is causally linked to security. The Committee makes it clear that it believes greater efforts on the part of the president and donors are essential to ensure that involvement in opium poppy production is stamped out at every level of government. I hope that the Minister will state exactly what the Government&#146;s anti-narcotics strategy is. What are the aims and benchmarks for success and what does he expect to have achieved this time next year, or in five years&#146; time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08071095000025">My penultimate point is that the Committee makes important recommendations on justice. The Government response sets out the sensible steps they are taking to strengthen the justice sector in Afghanistan. In my meetings with the anti-narcotics police chief in Lashkar Gah, it was explained that the judicial capacity in Afghanistan is incredibly weak and that only a tiny number of prosecutions are brought every year. Will the Minister confirm that improving that situation will be a priority? Huge importance should be attached to enabling the Afghan state to prosecute those who currently enjoy impunity in Afghanistan. The system of justice needs to be developed and beefed-up, so that justice is seen to be done.</p>

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="08071095000026"><a name="80710h0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="08071095000085"><b>Sir Robert Smith:</b>
 I intervene to reinforce the importance of trying to get some confidence in formal justice. There is a tendency to think that traditional justice will solve the problem and to fall back on that because of the failures of formal justice. However, there are concerns that traditional justice is in no way just.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a good point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para22"><a name="08071095000028">I wish to underline what the Committee said about microfinance and its importance, but in the last couple of minutes, I shall deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) about the distance he believes has opened up between the Ministry of Defence and the Army on the one hand, and DIFD on the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para23"><a name="08071095000029">That matter has sometimes been reported lucidly, and I specifically sought to address it during my recent visit to Afghanistan, as it is clearly enormously important. I have been advised that the development of the PRT structure, which is often criticised for being slightly colonial in nature, has brought together the military, the Foreign Office and DFID in a way that has transformed the situation my hon. Friend described as prevailing a year or so ago. I hope the Minister will comment on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08071095000030">My hon. Friend made two specific points and made a plea that the budget be handed over&#151;indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East argued that the budgets should be brought together. The whole structure has changed and the budgets are now brought together in the stabilisation unit. Through the stabilisation unit and the PRT, the thinking and the strategy have been brought together and that process is now working in Helmand. It would be a tragedy if the changes made  <br>

in the past year or so were not accepted by the Committee and other hon. Members. The new structure must be given a chance to work to see if it can remedy the difficulties that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex so accurately described. My contention to him is that the position is greatly improved, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08071095000031">My final point is this. My hon. Friend mentioned that he had spoken privately to the generals and other senior officers, who confirmed what he has said. I have spoken publicly and privately to those responsible for the strategy of DFID and the military in the PRT in Helmand and they have told me that the situation has been transformed from what he described and that much progress has been made in the past year. If that is not the case, it is the duty of the people to whom he has been speaking to speak out publicly and say so, because we are working on the basis that the problem that he described is being tackled and that effective progress has been made on it over the past year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para26"><a name="08071095000032">I hope that in its next report the Committee will continue to investigate and develop some of the arguments put in the report we are considering. It is clear that, in relation to this live conflict situation, serious questions have been raised about DFID, particularly by Conservative Members. Individuals are doing a good job within the inevitable and clear constraints, but there might be ways in which the DFID effort can be reconfigured in Afghanistan, so that it can operate more effectively in those difficult circumstances. I submit to the Chairman of the Committee that directly addressing that subject would be a good topic for a future report by his Committee.</p>

bombings in Kabul have claimed 41 lives. There have been seven bombings in Karachi and one in Islamabad. That is why I believe that the comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) that DFID does not &#147;do danger&#148; not only devalue the work of DFID, but insult the staff. Those comments have no doubt also contributed to demoralisation.

I am also grateful that the IDC accepts that the commitment in respect of development assistance is likely to last for at least a generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="80710h0007.htm_para31"><a name="08071095000038">As many hon. Members have suggested, we must recognise the scale of the challenge and admit that there is a very long way to go. Afghanistan is desperately poor&#151;the fifth poorest country in the world. Life expectancy is 43 years; the figure for adult literacy is only 28 per cent., and one in five children do not live to see their fifth birthday. However, we must acknowledge that some progress has been made. Eighty-two per cent. of the population now have access to basic health care&#151;nine times the 2002 figure. Last year, the legal economy grew by 13.5 per cent. When the Taliban fell in 2001, only 900,000 children were in school, all of them boys; now there are 6 million, one third of whom are girls.</p>

Last week, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development travelled to Helmand and saw at first hand the impact of military operations setting the conditions for stabilisation, reconstruction and development to begin. He talked of the need for</p>
<a name="80710h0008.htm_brev2"><a name="08071095000079"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a seamless match between the military effort and the civilian effort&#148;.</p>

The provincial reconstruction team is co-located with the military headquarters of the taskforce in Helmand. Of course, success depends not only on an increasingly effective civil-military effect, but on the involvement of the Afghan Government and the Helmand governor. We always need to remember that our aim is to help the Afghans to secure and govern Helmand and the wider country themselves, not to do it for them.</p>

Last week, the Secretary of State visited Garmsir&#151;a town taken back from Taliban insurgents in May. The market had reopened faster than many had expected, but the school was an empty shell and had not seen children or teachers in months. Only now is life reverting to normal. A doctor was trying to operate in a clinic stripped of all its equipment, and there are plans to refurbish the school. The challenge is, of course, huge.</p>

DFID has helped the Afghan Government to increase their tax revenues by $100 million each year since 2001, helping to reduce Afghanistan&#146;s dependence on overseas aid over the long term. In that way, the Afghans can pay for their own security forces&#151;something that many donors will not do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08071095000061">DFID is providing &#163;50 million to the national solidarity programme, which has established more than 20,000 elected community development councils across Afghanistan, with more than 36,000 local development projects under way or completed. That issue was raised by the hon. Members for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08071095000062">With regard to Pakistan and the federally administered tribal areas, we are encouraging Pakistan and Afghanistan to intensify their dialogue and to agree further measures to combat the Taliban and other insurgent groups that oppose Afghanistan&#146;s peaceful reconstruction. The UK is helping the Afghan Government to organise the next good neighbourly relations declaration meeting with Pakistan, which is due to take place in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08071095000063">We agree with the IDC on the need for improved donor co-ordination and aid effectiveness. The best way to achieve the Afghanistan national development strategy is by supporting Afghans to help themselves. That is why the UK channels 80 per cent. of its assistance through the Government of Afghanistan and why 90 per cent. of UK aid to Afghanistan is spent in Afghanistan.  <br>

That helps the local economy, and it helps sustainability, the growth of jobs and the improvement of skills in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08071095000064">I was asked about the USA. It has indicated that it will put more of its aid programme on-budget, including directly to two Afghan Ministries. I can provide further details in a written answer if the House wishes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08071095000065">The IDC rightly highlighted the importance of sub-national governance, and it welcomed DFID&#146;s support for the independent directorate of local governance&#151;or IDLG. The IDC praised the role of community development councils, created under the national solidarity programme, as a vehicle for empowering communities and involving women in decision making.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08071095000066">DFID is providing &#163;1.3 million for the IDLG this year and supporting municipal and community governance in Helmand, using CDCs. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) asked what we are doing to support local government. I hope that, at least in part, my response answers his question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para18"><a name="08071095000067">On counter-narcotics, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) asked what is meant by holistic and how the strategy works. It includes extending microfinance to rural areas, so that farmers can buy seeds. It is about restoring and improving irrigation and drainage systems, so that farmers get increased crop yields, and improving roads, so that farmers can get their crops to market. I would be happy for DFID and the Afghan drugs interdepartmental unit to write to my right hon. Friend in more detail than I have time for now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08071095000068">Corruption was one of the key themes raised by the right hon. Member for Gordon, the Chairman of the Select Committee. I agree with him and with the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield that corruption is a major concern in Afghanistan. Surveys suggest that Afghans perceive corruption as being widespread, particularly in the justice, police and security sectors. We are deeply concerned about narcotics-related corruption, and we are helping the Afghan Government to address the problem through building their rule-of-law and justice sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08071095000069">The Committee impressed on President Karzai the importance of dealing with the problem, but it does not mean that aid cannot be spent effectively and accountably through government systems. We are confident that UK funds are not being misused. Most of our assistance goes through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, which is managed by the World Bank and audited  <br>

by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The fund reimburses the Afghan Government upon proof of legitimate expenditure. I hope that I have clarified matters for the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08071095000070">I am glad to hear hon. Members pressing Her Majesty&#146;s Government to take greater action. The wider international community is pressing President Karzai and the Afghan Government to do just that&#151;a point that the Secretary of State reinforced during his meeting with the President just under a week ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08071095000071">The issue of women was one of the central themes raised by the right hon. Member for Gordon. The IDC recommended that the Afghan Government and donors should prioritise women&#146;s rights. We agree with the Committee that further analysis should be carried out, and we will address women&#146;s rights in our new country assistance plan. The right hon. Gentleman was right to say that it is a great disappointment that the number of women in government and in Parliament is decreasing. That is not helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08071095000072">Women are not there to represent women, although it is true to say that they understand women better than men. The truth is that we want a Parliament that reflects society, which means that it should be composed half of men and half of women, and we would want that also at governmental level. We will continue to consider the matter. However, we should recognise the scale of the challenge. Gender inequality is deeply imbedded. It is a long-term problem that requires a strategic Afghan-led approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para24"><a name="08071095000073">DFID works towards gender equality in three ways&#151;through policy engagement with the Afghan Government, through support for national programmes and services that benefit women and through bilateral programmes. For example, DFID has funded the NGO Womankind with just under &#163;500,000 over four years, to ensure that gender equality in schools and in the political sphere is taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80710h0008.htm_para25"><a name="08071095000074">One of the main themes of the report was security and policing. The right hon. Member for Gordon pointed out that the EU is leading in the building up of an effective and legitimate Afghan national police force. Of the 68 UK personnel working in Afghanistan, the UK has seconded 11 to the EUPOL mission, including the deputy head of mission for operations. The UK plans to increase that to about 20. The Afghan Ministry of the Interior estimates that there are 160 female police officers, as against 73,000 male officers.</p>
