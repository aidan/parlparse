Patrick McLoughlin (West Derbyshire) (Con):</b> I start by
welcoming the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety to
his new responsibilities. The police force is not yet in the same mess
as the immigration service, and I hope that he will not allow it to get
into such a mess. If he follows my advice and that of my hon. Friends,
he will find himself on the way to ensuring that it does not do
so.</p><p><a name="06052399000011">I
know that whoever is in the Chair has to be unbiased, Mr. Taylor, but
it is worth pointing out that you are an east midlands Member of
Parliament. In a recent Adjournment debate on police reform you
said:</p><a name="06052399000502"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have
a similar situation in the east midlands, where there is no support for
an east midlands-wide force but that seems to be our
fate.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 30 March 2006; Vol.
444,c. 1078.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000012">I hope
that we can persuade the Government not to go down that road, as the
merger has no local support. I am pleased to see a number of my
colleagues from the east midlands on both sides of the House. In the
main, I have yet to find anyone who publicly supports a police force of
the size and nature proposed.</p><p><a name="06052399000013"><b><a name="06052399000566">Mr.
Tim Boswell (Daventry) (Con):</b> Is it not
the case that there is not only no local support but no geographical
coherence? On Friday I made an interesting visit to the constituency of
the hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)&#151;I gave him notice of
my visit&#151;and I then went to the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan). By the end of the day,
I had travelled nearly 200 miles from my home, but I still had not left
the east midlands. We could have journeyed on to Skegness to complete
the picture.</p><p><a name="06052399000014"><b><a name="06052399000567">David
Taylor (in the Chair):</b> Order. Interventions should be
brief; an awful lot of Members wish to contribute to the
debate.</p><p><a name="06052399000015"><b><a name="06052399000568">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for that intervention. I often say that there is no such place
as the east midlands. It is what is left over once the rest of the
country has been divided up. I do not know of a place called
&#147;the east midlands&#148; that is recognised as such. The idea
that Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire have something in common with
Derbyshire is for the birds&#151;or possibly for the
Government.</p><p><a name="06052399000016">Mindful
of what you say, Mr. Taylor, but wishing to allow a few interventions,
I shall try to speak for only 15 minutes or so, so that others have an
opportunity to contribute.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 382WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000017"><b><a name="06052399000569">David
Tredinnick (Bosworth) (Con):</b> Building on the point made by
our hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), is the change
not another part of the Government&#146;s plan for regional
government, which is deeply
unpopular?</p><p><a name="06052399000018"><b><a name="06052399000570">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> I shall come to that aspect, because I think
that the proposal is regionalisation by the back door. When the
Government attempted to get regionalisation through in the north of the
country, it was overwhelmingly rejected. The first area that they chose
for such a referendum was one where they thought they would find
sympathy and support for the idea, but it was rejected. If the Minister
is going pursue the merger, he should at the very least let the people
decide. He should put it to a referendum. I am keen for that to
happen&#151;I would be very happy about it. The Government were keen
on referendums until they started going wrong for them, and they seem
to have gone a bit cold on them since then.</p><p><a name="06052399000019">Not all is lost, however. The
idea was undoubtedly the driving ambition of the former Home Secretary,
who has since departed the scene. In response to a question by the
Leader of the Opposition, my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron), the Prime Minister
said:</p><a name="06052399000503"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have
to listen to what people are saying and, obviously, there are different
views about police reform. One possibilityis for strategic
coming together on certain issues, rather than
mergers&#148;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25 January 2006; Vol.
441,c. 1425-26.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000020">I
agree. That would be a sensible way forward. I do not say that there
should be no change at all. What I am saying is that I oppose the
creation of a super-regional police force, as it would have no
coherence.</p><p><a name="06052399000021">The idea
behind the mergers was to enhance the protective services that combat
serious crime crossing county borders. However, according to a
confidential report drawn up by Tim Brain, the chief constable of
Gloucestershire, the Government are aiming at a lower standard of
co-ordination. He says that the
project</p><a name="06052399000504"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will not do what
it says on the tin. If restructuring does not significantly improve
protective services, the question must be asked: &#145;Why are we
restructuring?&#146;&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000022">Why
are the Home Office and the Government insisting on it? According to
Tim Brain, the implementation of the plan nationally will cost the
equivalent of 25,000 police officer salaries. As the Government are
refusing to commit additional funds to pay for the mergers, the effect
would be a serious depletion of front-line policing. It is front-line
policing, not protective services, that fights the crime that most
concerns my constituents and those of my hon. Friends. Tim Brain
concludes that</p><a name="06052399000505"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the
impact of such a cut would destroy any realistic hope of developing
neighbourhood
policing&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000023">In the past,
the Government have said that they are keen on neighbourhood
policing.</p><p><a name="06052399000024"><b><a name="06052399000571">Mr.
Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton) (Con):</b> Quite
right.</p><p><a name="06052399000025"><b><a name="06052399000572">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> As my hon. Friend says, quite right. In some
respects, we fear the Government&#146;s plans in most respect of some
of the rural constituencies. I do not believe that the system is
broken, so why must 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 383WH</b><br>we interfere with it? I hoped that the Government would have taken
account of what has happened in the past when they have interfered with
things, only to reverse them back to the state in which they inherited
them.</p><p><a name="06052399000026"><b><a name="06052399000573">Mark
Simmonds (Boston and Skegness) (Con):</b> My right hon. Friend
makes the correct point. Is he aware of the deep concern in
Lincolnshire, where there are already worries about the lack of police
visibility, that the east midlands merger will transfer resources away
to big conurbations such as Nottingham, where there is serious crime?
That is inevitable, and it will be greatly to the detriment of those
who live in Lincolnshire.</p><p><a name="06052399000027"><b><a name="06052399000574">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. Although I do not
have the exact figures, Nottinghamshire has far more police officers
than Derbyshire, despite the fact that the counties are of similar
size. I am not relying on this morning&#146;s report about crime
levels, but there is no doubt that crime levels are higher in the
centre of Nottingham than in other parts of the east midlands. What
will happen to the police force? It will be concentrated in that
particular area. Perhaps that might please my right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), but it is a
problem.</p><p><a name="06052399000028">We have not
yet seen the details of the precept rationalisation that could come
about as a result of the proposal. Since 1997, the people of Derbyshire
have seen an increase of 165 per cent. in the police precept in the
county, because we have been paying for extra police officers to try to
catch up. Will that money just disappear into other parts of the region
on an equalisation basis? Those are only some of the questions that
have not yet been answered. That is part of the problem with this
reorganisation and rationalisation: it is being rushed to far too great
a degree.</p><p><a name="06052399000029">It is
interesting to note that the chairmen of the east midlands police
authorities and the chief constables have already outlined their
serious concerns to the Home Secretary. All five police forces voted
not to volunteer for a merger on the grounds of affordability and the
ability to enhance professional services quickly. They object not for
narrow-minded political reasons, but because they want to deliver the
best policing service for the local people. They are concerned that the
new merger plans will hinder their ability to do so, and I think that
they are right.</p><p><a name="06052399000030">Despite objections from all the
police authorities concerned, the former Home Secretary announced on 11
April that he still intended to proceed with the merger to a full east
midlands police force. That was rejected by the five authorities on 7
April, but four days later the former Home Secretary said, &#147;I
don&#146;t want to listen to what the police authorities or Members
of Parliament say. I intend to push forward with the merger.&#148;
Opposing views were totally disregarded, and that is a serious
issue.</p><p><a name="06052399000031">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Daventry(Mr. Boswell) mentioned, the
east midlands is not the easiest of areas through which to travel. It
is not like travelling north-south, which is relatively easy in this 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 384WH</b><br>country. The configuration of the roads means that travelling east-west
is far more difficult. That is one of the problems that a large force
such as the one proposed will face.</p><p><a name="06052399000032">The east midlands police
authorities have estimated the cost of a regional merger to be
&#163;101 million for its set-up plus &#163;45 million in ongoing
costs, with &#163;15 million in potential efficiency savings. The
Home Office has estimated the cost of a regional merger to be
&#163;80 million, plus &#163;20 million in ongoing costs, with
&#163;16 million in potential savings. The big difference between
what the Home Office and the regional police authorities say relates to
the set-up costs, and I am more inclined to believe the regional police
authorities than I am the Home Office, simply because they are the
people on the ground doing the job. We have to listen to what they
say.</p><p><a name="06052399000033"><b><a name="06052399000575">Mr.
Alan Duncan:</b> Is not the lesson of past
mergers&#151;clearly, the same will be true of this
merger&#151;that there are very high transitional costs and no real
economies of scale, and as soon as the merger has happened,
sub-structures and divisional units are set up in an attempt to restore
the local connection that was lost through the
merger?</p><p><a name="06052399000034"><b><a name="06052399000576">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> Yes. There is also something to be said for a
chief constable being accountable to local people. I am not sure that a
chief constable overseeing five forces would be sufficiently
accountable to local people. That is one disturbing element of the
proposals. I have not always agreed with the chief constable of
Derbyshire. In fact, before he retired the previous chief constable
appeared on a Labour party political broadcast in 2001. I do not want
to know the politics of chief constables; I want them to do their job
properly.</p><p><a name="06052399000035">Lord Denning
said that a chief constable should be answerable to the law, not to
politicians. One problem that may result from the size of the proposed
forces is that we will get chief constables who are more directly
accountable to the Home Secretary. At the moment, Labour Members may
think that a marvellous idea&#151;my right hon. and learned Friend
the Member for Rushcliffe might have thought it a marvellous idea when
he was Home Secretary&#151;but I say to Labour Members that they
should not be so arrogant as to think that they will always be in
power. One day, they may not like chief constables being directly
accountable to the Home
Secretary.</p><p><a name="06052399000036"><b><a name="06052399000577">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke (Rushcliffe) (Con):</b> At the second generous
reference to me, I thought that I might intervene. My right hon. Friend
is making a powerful case, but he did say that he does not oppose all
change. Does he accept that if the present system of local
accountability in Derbyshire is a model of perfection, that may be the
exception? We now have the opportunity to examine how to make
accountability work more effectively on whatever scale. Certainly most
inhabitants of my constituency are not aware of the existence of the
police authority; they do not know what it does. It is hardly the
strongest system of local accountability.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 385WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000037"><b><a name="06052399000578">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> I totally accept that. I am
not sure that my right hon. and learned Friend is not responsible for
the present system of police accountability, but I shall put that to
one side for a moment. In all seriousness, I am not arguing that the
present system is perfect and does not need changing. He has just
spoken about accountability and I agree with him about that. However,
what is proposed will remove almost all local accountability. At the
moment, imperfect as the system may be, we have 22 or 23 people serving
on the Derbyshire police authority; under the proposals, it is likely
that only four or five people will be appointed to serve on the
regional authority. The present system may not be perfect, but what is
proposed to replace it is wholly
imperfect.</p><p><a name="06052399000038">I do not
mind some change, as I have said to my hon. Friend the Member for
Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert). I do not mind more
collaborative services among police authorities&#151;for example, it
is ridiculous that every police authority has its own payroll system;
such services can rightly be centralised. However, we do not need to
centralise everything at regional level. The payroll could be
administered nationally&#151;it is ridiculous to have the sort of
payroll systems envisaged under the new police structures. If the Home
Office is seeking change for the sake of efficiency, there are many
other ways to achieve that without disregarding local
accountability.</p><p><a name="06052399000039"><b><a name="06052399000579">Mr.
Andrew Robathan (Blaby) (Con):</b> Is that not part and parcel
of the Government&#146;s plan? There will be a complete disconnect
between, for instance, the people of Leicestershire and their police
force, because it will be an east midlands police force, based
somewhere else. The problem is already to be seen in the East Midlands
regional assembly: it is totally unaccountable to anybody, yet has been
set up and will march in tandem with the new police
authority.</p><p><a name="06052399000040"><b><a name="06052399000580">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> I agree. There a huge amount that I could say,
but I see that I am coming up to the15 minutes I promised
you, Mr. Taylor, and I am mindful of other hon. Members who have given
up their time to be here this morning. I will therefore draw my remarks
to a conclusion.</p><p><a name="06052399000041">We
have discussed accountability in some detail. I believe in
accountability&#151;in a Member of Parliament, a local council or a
parish council being able to challenge a chief constable directly. I
have talked to a number of my parish councils&#151;I think that the
modern term for them is stakeholders, but perhaps I will not become
quite as modern as that&#151;and have received a communication from
parish council in Doveridge, which is right on the edge of Derbyshire.
Earlier this year, in an excellent example of police-community
relationships, Doveridge neighbourhood watch was fortunate enough to
have the chief constable address its annual general meeting. It is
difficult to imagine a chief constable of such a vast organisation as
the proposed force taking the time and trouble to visit such a small
community on the border of its territory.</p><p><a name="06052399000042">I cite Doveridge not only
because the parish council has written to me and expressed a view, but
because it is not far from Sudbury open prison, and we know some of the
concerns that have been raised about open prisons lately. It is
therefore perhaps a good thing that the chief constable can go along
and reassure people of 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 386WH</b><br>the services that he will provide in Doveridge, because some of the
absconders from Sudbury open prison have committed incredibly awful
crimes.</p><p><a name="06052399000043">Tissington
parish council, which is very small council, has
said:</p><a name="06052399000506"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
proposed merger is hastily drawn up, lacks accountability and has no
known community support. It would be unwieldy and inefficient in
management and there are no local perceived
benefits.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000044">Brailsford
parish council
writes:</p><a name="06052399000507"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We see
no...reason to make such extensive and important changes in what
seems undue haste. We foresee that a merger of this size would mean
resources were channelled to the larger cities and leave the rural
communities with very little
support.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000045">Stoney
Middleton parish council has
said:</p><a name="06052399000508"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
proposals seem to be expensive, ill thought out and detrimental to
effective policing in the county. They will also make the police force
less accountable&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000046">I
could go on to quote Longford, Matlock and various other parish
councils that have brought their concerns to me, but I will not,
because other hon. Members wish to
participate.</p><p><a name="06052399000047">There are
some salient questions. Where will the extra funding necessary for the
plans come from? Can the Minister assure me that council tax payers in
West Derbyshire will not have to foot the bill for a scheme that they
do not want and that will not provide the level of service that they
currently enjoy? How will the Minister justify the new regional
authority&#146;s ability to offer accountability with a ratio of only
one member to every 200,000 people&#151;in effect, three
constituencies having one person as an accountable member on the
authority?</p><p><a name="06052399000048">The
five police forces affected by the plan have severely criticised it and
do not want it. In their professional judgment, they think that the
plans will hinder policing rather than improve it. Local politicians do
not want the merger to go ahead, as we feel that it will prove
counter-productive in the fight against crime. Perhaps most important,
local people do not want the changes. They want a local, accountable,
responsive community service, not a large, unwieldy and remote
one.</p><p><a name="06052399000049">I have not yet
met anyone in Derbyshire who wants the merger. The police do not want
it, parliamentary representatives do not want it and local people do
not want it. According to the answer that he gave to my right hon.
Friend the Leader of the Opposition, even the Prime Minister is
lukewarm. So why on earth go forward with the changes? I ask the
Minister, on the first day of his new job, to say that he will not
embark on what will be a fiasco for the police service in the east
midlands, but that he will reverse these crazy decisions and make a
positive name for himself on day one in his new
job.</p><p><a name="06052399000050"><b><a name="06052399000581">Several

Tipping (Sherwood) (Lab):</b> I am delighted
to follow the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire(Mr.
McLoughlin) and I congratulate him on securing the debate. I also
congratulate him on defying the convention that influential figures in
the House should not speak on such issues; he spoke forcefully on
behalf of his constituents. He accepted the case for change, although
he has not told us what change is necessary. None the less, change is
necessary, and it is important to recognise that the proposals before
us come from the police themselves. We need change, and the notion that
43 police forces is the right solution for the present day is just
wrong.</p><p><a name="06052399000053">Although
I have questions and doubt, there is a need for change, and I know that
just from looking at my own authority in Nottinghamshire. A think tank
report out today says that there are more crimes in Nottingham than
anywhere else in the country, and high levels of homicide and serious
organised crime&#151;often related to drugs&#151;have led to real
policing problems in Nottinghamshire. There has been abstraction of
police officers from rural to urban areas, and the Nottinghamshire
police have had to call in resources from elsewhere. Members will also
remember the chief constable&#146;s comment that he had &#147;lost
control&#148;. All that seems to indicate that, faced with serious
levels of crime, we in Nottinghamshire need a larger, more strategic
police force.</p><p><a name="06052399000054">However,
I have doubts, concerns and questions similar to those that the right
hon. Gentleman expressed and I would like the Minister to acknowledge
those questions and look for solutions. First, it is important that
there is neighbourhood policing. The goal set out in the Labour
party&#146;s manifesto is to have neighbourhood teams in place by
April 2008. The debate about police changes has focused very much on
the regional level and the strategic police force, but it needs to
focus on the locality and the neighbourhood, because people want police
officers who understand and respond to their concerns. It is important
that the commitment to neighbourhood policing is not lost in the debate
about larger structures. It is important to accept and acknowledge that
larger strategic police forces must work hand in hand with
neighbourhood police teams.</p><p><a name="06052399000055">Secondly, we need
to ensure that the new authority is properly resourced. I shall not
repeat the figures that the right hon. Gentleman gave, but it is clear
that there is always a cost to change, because change in itself is
dysfunctional. I am concerned that police forces in the east midlands
have been traditionally underfunded, as previous Home Office Ministers
have acknowledged. There is a clear difference between local voices and
local police forces on the one hand and the Home Office on the other
about the cost of change, although figures are coming closer through
discussion. One of the important things that we must do is set up a
process to examine those figures and reach proper conclusions. Unless
we have a firm financial structure, there is a danger that the new
neighbourhood teams will be eroded by a lack of
financing.</p><p><a name="06052399000056"><b><a name="06052399000584">Patrick

between 1993 and 2003, compared with a national average of 2.7 per

overwhelming?</p><p><a name="06052399000057"><b><a name="06052399000585">Paddy
Tipping:</b> There is a case for extra funding and resources
for the Nottinghamshire police. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman,
who takes a close interest in such matters, that police numbers are at
a record level in Nottinghamshire. We need to talk not only about extra
resources but about their good and efficient management. I am not
confident that we have had the best such management in Nottinghamshire,
and that view is also taken by Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of
constabulary.</p><p><a name="06052399000058">Thirdly, the right hon. Member
for West Derbyshire talked about governance. If it goes forward, the
new east midlands strategic force will cover an area larger than
Belgium. It is really important that local people feel that they have
ownership of the police. That may not happen sufficiently at a top,
police-authority level, so it is important that a new strategic
authority should have the powers and structures to involve people at a
basic command unit level or through crime and disorder reduction
partnerships. It is important that people have a say about the problems
in their areas and a way of finding solutions, and I know that the
Government are taking measures to enable that to happen. It cannot be
right for there to be large strategic authorities but no say at a more
local level.</p><p><a name="06052399000059">Finally,
I turn to council tax equalisation; again, it is a governance issue. I
am far from clear about how it will be achieved. We need far more
clarity from the Home Office about taking that forward.</p><p><a name="06052399000060">Given the four concerns that I
have mentioned, I believe that the timetable for change is far too
rapid. Change is inevitable, but we need a timetable and framework for
change that allows time for the problems to be not only discussed but
resolved. I acknowledge that when a change is made, it is important to
take its benefit quickly. However, on the face of it, the move to
change in the east midlands is far too quick. There needs to be greater
consultation so that we can find real solutions that will meet the
needs and aspirations of people, not only in Nottinghamshire but across
the east
midlands.</p><p><a name="06052399000089"><b><a name="06052399000595">Several

the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) on securing this
debate. I am 100 per cent. opposed to the abolition of
Northamptonshire&#146;s own police force and to its absorption into
an east midlands police service. The absurdity of the
Government&#146;s merger plan 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 389WH</b><br>is that Northamptonshire will end up paying more for a police service
that will provide fewer police officers to patrol our local
area.</p><p><a name="06052399000064">I recently
spent 22 days with the parliamentary police scheme in and around
Kettering. It is my firm view that local people there do not want the
headquarters of Northamptonshire&#146;s police to be in Nottingham;
they want more police officers, not fewer, to patrol our local area. A
full regional merger would cost &#163;100 million up front and a net
additional &#163;30 million a year. Where is the sense in
that?</p><p><a name="06052399000065"><b><a name="06052399000588">Mr.

Hollobone:</b> My hon. Friend, as usual, is absolutely
correct. Under the merger plans, we were promised greater emphasis on
neighbourhood policing, but the constituencies of Kettering, Corby and
Wellingborough now have one basic command unit instead of two, and
Northamptonshire now has two basic command units instead of four. As a
direct consequence of preparations for the merger plans, there is now
less local emphasis on policing. I urge the Minister to allow the five
forces, or some combination of them, to adopt a federated structure of
inter-force co-operation and not impose a merger on them.</p><p><a name="06052399000067">I impress on the Minister that
we are talking about a huge area, stretching from the borders of
Oxfordshire to the outskirts of Greater Manchester. When the county is
divided up, Northamptonshire is always on the edge, and given the gun
crime and gang crime that we have heard about in Nottingham, policing
in Northamptonshire will not be a priority for the new east midlands
police
service.</p><p><a name="06052399000068">The
budget shortfall faced by the five police authorities in the east
midlands is already &#163;17 million for 2006-07. They are five of
the most underfunded police authorities in the country. Over the past
10 years, in pounds-per-head terms, their income has risen by 24 per
cent; that is compared to a rise in inflation of 28 per
cent.In 2005-06, the average amount spent on policing in
England was &#163;174 per person. In the east midlands it was
&#163;143 per person, which is 82 per cent. of the English average.
All five police authorities were underfunded on that basis, and in
Northamptonshire the figure was &#163;139 per
person.</p><p><a name="06052399000069">Steve Green,
the chief constable of Nottinghamshire police, has written to the
former Home Secretary, and I hope that the letter is on the current
Home Secretary&#146;s file. That letter, dated 28 April,
says:</p><a name="06052399000509"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
current offer from the Home Office does not provide the necessary
financial support and...without substantial additional funding,
this region cannot achieve the minimum standard of Level 3 in
protective services, let alone any prospect of future improvement to
Level 4.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000070">I shall go on
with the letter, because this is an important
point:</p><a name="06052399000510"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is
equally clear from the Home Office analysis that the relatively small
amount of additionality that would eventually be released through
efficiency savings would not become available for investment in
protective services until 2014. This situation fundamentally undermines
the principal case for amalgamation.

merger proposals are not welcome in Northamptonshire; they would
undermine local policing and they enjoy no local support. The
Northamptonshire branch of the National Association of Retired Police
Officers is against the plans, as is Bill Dredge, who is the chairman
of Northamptonshire neighbourhood watch, and Dr. Marie Dickie, the
Labour chairman of the Northamptonshire police authority. The chief
constable of Northamptonshire is worried about the loss of
officers.</p><p><a name="06052399000072">In
conclusion, the new Minister for Policing, Security and Community
Safety is talked about as the great persuader; that is why he has been
put into his present job. I urge him to follow the advice of my right
hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire and on behalf of all the
residents of Kettering I ask him to think again, before it is too
late.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000540">10.4

Levitt (High Peak) (Lab):</b> It is worth noting that the only
reason why we are having a debate on police restructuring is that Her
Majesty&#146;s inspector of constabulary, senior organisations within
the police such as the Police Superintendents Association of England
and Wales and, according to a poll in <i>The Times </i>today, the vast
majority of senior police officers all want a restructuring of the
police to make it more efficient and effective in the battle against
crime, both strategically and
locally.</p><p><a name="06052399000075">The right
hon. Member for West Derbyshire(Mr. McLoughlin) is right to
say that it is simply not sustainable to have 43 chief constables, 43
personnel departments, 43 finance departments and 43 press officers, or
to have all those constabularies using different technologies and
protocols, and in some cases having real problems communicating with
each other. The status quo is therefore definitely not an
option.</p><p><a name="06052399000076">There are two
dimensions to the proposed restructuring, and I am sorry that the right
hon. Gentleman fell between two stools and did not give either of those
the necessary importance. The first dimension is the strategic level,
whereby organised crime operates not within localities&#151;the towns
and villages of our constituencies&#151;but nationwide and
regionally. We must have a system to fight organised crime and
terrorism that is not locally based within divisions or even existing
constabularies, but which has a bigger remit. That is why it is
important to pool resources and strengthen the police at a strategic
level.</p>

<p><a name="06052399000077">The other
aspect, which is probably more important for the current debate, is the
local level. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)
has pointed out, within the existing divisional structures, police
officers already have increased accountability through consultative
committees and forums&#151;certainly in Derbyshire&#151;and even
down to ward and beat level. In High Peak, we already have police
officers whose text numbers and e-mail addresses are known to the
people in their wards. They are directly accountable to the people they
serve. That is a welcome development and I want more
accountability&#151;not at county level, but at division and ward
level, and in localities. The good practice that already exists&#151;

<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 391WH</b><br>Derbyshire is well advanced in neighbourhood policing&#151;should be
made more widely available and should be used
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06052399000078">Will
the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire, on that understanding, join
me in saying that B division of Derbyshire constabulary, which is the
divisional command unit shared between our constituencies&#151;it
covers the whole of mine, and not quite all of his&#151;should not be
merged and should remain as the basic command unit? Does he agree that,
if we are to take neighbourhood policing seriously, it is important
that there should be no fewer divisions than there are at
present?</p><p><a name="06052399000079"><b><a name="06052399000591">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> The hon. Gentleman is trying to have it both
ways. I agree about B division, and I have no problem in supporting its
continuation. It is likely to survive if Derbyshire keeps its chief
constable, but it is highly unlikely to survive if there is an
amalgamated force of five different authorities. We, the two local
Members of Parliament, can have an influence on the chief constable,
because there are only 10 Members of Parliament in Derbyshire. A chief
constable with 44 Members of Parliament in the area covered by his
force might well ignore
us.</p><p><a name="06052399000080"><b><a name="06052399000592">Tom
Levitt:</b> One advantage of the debate is
that the Minister is here to listen and has heard us, on a cross-party
basis, say that the divisional structure in Derbyshire should remain as
it is whatever the final outcome. I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s support for that view.</p><p><a name="06052399000081">The last word
on accountability is that most people in my constituency would have
difficulty in saying exactly where the police headquarters is. Perhaps
that does not apply to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency,
which is closer to it. However, it does not matter where the chief
constable is based. The location of the communications room, which is
the place that people phone up, does not matter. People want to know
that the divisional commander is on the ball and that their local
policeman is on the beat in their neighbourhood. That is the level of
accountability that I want, and I believe that it can be retained and
strengthened under the new
proposals.</p><p><a name="06052399000082">I am
pleased that the right hon. Gentleman did not show a very strong
inclination to go down the road of federation. It has been proposed on
some fronts that we should adopt a loose federation of constabularies,
but that has all the disadvantages of the current system with few of
the advantages of the new proposal. The most important thing about
federating constabularies is that it makes long-term planning
impossible. As long as the federation is loose, it will not lend itself
to such planning.</p><p><a name="06052399000083"><b><a name="06052399000593">Mr.
McLoughlin:</b> I did speak in favour of federation as
preferable to what the Government are providing. There is a federation
between Derbyshire and Nottingham: they share a helicopter, and I
welcome that. It has been a useful part of the system and has not
stopped long-term
planning.</p><p><a name="06052399000084"><b><a name="06052399000594">Tom
Levitt:</b> Of course it is sensible to
share particular services, but that does not mean that the strategic
decisions 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 392WH</b><br>of the different authorities are necessarily being taken in line with
each other. The debate has evolved already in that the two-county
proposal that was on the cards a little while ago is no longer there.
It proved deeply unpopular in Derbyshire, and it is right that the
Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire proposal has been taken off the agenda and
that we should be talking solely about the five-county
proposal.</p><p><a name="06052399000085">I agree that
there are problems, and I hope that the Minister will address them.
They are to do with not just the different council tax precepts in the
five authorities that will be brought together, but with the hugely
different pension arrangements and pension scheme funding in the
different constabularies. There is historical underfunding in
Derbyshire, which is a much worse-funded authority than
Nottinghamshire, for example. We need some equalisation. We also make a
legitimate demand that the cost of the mergers should not either fall
on council tax payers or result in reduced services. We know that it
will take some years for the cost benefits of the merger to work
through, but in the interim there must be no cost to other services or
council tax payers.</p><p><a name="06052399000086">Like the hon. Member for
Kettering(Mr. Hollobone), I have taken part in the police
service parliamentary scheme. We get a wonderful insight into how
police operate and the huge diversity of services, and the scheme also
allows us to see how well police officers are doing throughout the
country. We have record numbers of police officers in Derbyshire and
elsewhere, as well as falling crime. In Derbyshire, we have rising
detection rates and some of the lowest crime levels in the country. We
are proud of our local policing services. This is not an easy project
to manage, and it must not be rushed. It is a year since it came on the
timetable, and with a four-month consultation I think that it will take
at least two years to put into operation.</p><p><a name="06052399000087">I stress to my hon. Friend the
Minister that it is important to get things right, rather than to get
things quickly. If the debate is centred on what people
wantin terms of policing in their localities and
neighbourhoods, and the quality of service that they see on the street
outside their front door, and if assurances are given on that, there
will be a lot more willingness to go along with different options for
strategic organisations above that
level.</p><p><a name="06052399000088">I am pleased
that the debate is taking place, as it offers us all an opportunity to
put the issues on the record. I hope that the problems and issues that
I have raised will help the Minister to guide and work with police
authorities to reach a solution that we can all live
with.</p><p><a name="06052399000089"><b><a name="06052399000595">Several

<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 393WH</b><br>that he is on his first day. I will not betray confidences by saying
what he said to me, but he did smile. One thing that I would have
thought should be going through his mind is the fact that he is in a
Department that is widely seen as absolutely chaotic: convicted
criminals who should be deported are not, there are problems with the
cleaners at the Home Office being illegal immigrants and there are
difficulties with the Criminal Records Bureau recording innocent people
as criminals. It is indeed
chaotic.</p><p><a name="06052399000093">I was looking
at my hon. Friends the Members for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) and for Newark
(Patrick Mercer)&#151;gallant Members who have served in the armed
forces&#151;and thinking what they, as soldiers, might say to the
Minister. They would probably say that he should try to shut down one
of the fronts. The Home Office seems to be fighting on so many fronts,
so surely this is a great opportunity for the Minister to get further
promotion with his boss, and at the very least to adopt the Rushcliffe
model. Rather than going the whole way, maybe he could reach an
accommodation or solution with my right hon. Friend the Member for West
Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin), the Conservative Chief Whip, whose debate
this is&#151;I am not looking for promotion&#151;and the hon.
Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping). There is common
ground.</p><p><a name="06052399000094">There is
almost universal disapproval of the proposals; no one wants them. Even
the chief constables who were so heavily influenced by the Home Office
when the Terrorism Bill was before the House&#151;who were
strong-armed into coming up with a position and briefing us&#151;have
changed their positions. One or two may covet the job of super-chief
constable or Metropolitan Police Commissioner of the shires, but even
they have come round. They do not want this nonsense. No one
does.</p><p><a name="06052399000095">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire said, accountability will be
hopeless and it will suffer. The situation will be like the one in
Hinckley. I have no chance of speaking to the chief constable for the
west midlands, which is on the other side of the A5, but I have the
mobile phone number of the Leicestershire chief constable in my pocket.
I have had it ever since the Home Office gave it to me when it was
trying to influence him, but we shall not go into
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000096">Members have
spoken eloquently about the chaos and ridiculous costs of merger. I ask
Members who have been in the House for a while&#151;I have been here
as long as some&#151;whether there has ever been a reorganisation
that has not cost more than expected. My hon. Friend the Member for
Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) alluded to that. Such
reforms&#151;for example, health reforms&#151;always cost more and
there is always some
difference.</p><p><a name="06052399000097">This is
completely the wrong tack, and we should take a leaf out of the New
York police force book. That force works within certain precincts and
uses sophisticated computer systems. In an age of information
technology when communications are improving all the time, why are we
told that we must accept vast, Stalinesque, monolithic structures that
are totally unaccountable? Surely, with all the electronic wizardry
around now, police force can talk to police force. It is not the case
that the protocols are all wrong.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 394WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000098">I say to the

the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) on securing the debate,
which is terribly important. I also congratulate the Minister on his
new appointment. I am sure that he will handle it with the same aplomb
as he has handled all his other appointments. I am pleased that there
are three Nottinghamshire Members here today, as I believe that they
will underline the importance of the issue to the
county.</p><p><a name="06052399000104">I
shall not iterate points that have already been made about
Nottinghamshire. The fact remains that this morning we have been told
that Nottingham stands high&#151;in fact, at the highest and most
lamentable point&#151;in the crime statistics for the country. Our
constabulary is constantly under pressure: it is underfunded,
understaffed and overtasked, and constituents in Sherwood, in
Rushcliffe and certainly in Newark and Retford feel that they are not
receiving the correct services from police officers whom they largely
admire and who do a splendid job, but who do not have the resources to
do what they are required to
do.</p><p><a name="06052399000105">I
have already made the point about Nottinghamshire&#146;s population
increasing by 4.1 per cent. in the past10 years, as opposed
to the national average of 2.7 per cent., and points about underfunding
have been made more eloquently by others than they would be made by me.
The hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) is dead right&#151;the
situation must change. If we are to deliver better policing to
Nottinghamshire, the structure must be
better.</p><p><a name="06052399000106">I probably
differ with the hon. Gentleman on one or two details. I believe that we
can achieve some economies of scale, but it worries me very much that a
large sum of money will be spent on a wonderful new police station in a
place such as Newark, yet the city of Nottingham&#151;and, I have no
doubt, cities such as 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 395WH</b><br>Leicester, Northampton and others within a large five-county police
force&#151;will continue to act as a magnet for police officers and
the dreaded policy community support
officers.</p><p><a name="06052399000107">Many
officers are abstracted from rural constituencies such as mine, as well
as Sherwood and the Rushcliffe constituency, to go into the city to
fight gun and drug crime, which mercifully have not yet struck the
streets of Newark. None the less, we have all sorts of difficulties and
we require our officers to be based locally, to have a local focus and
to be accountable to local people in a local way. I believe that the
scheme the Government are espousing will destroy
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000108">We
have a federated police force structure in the east midlands and it has
worked pretty well. I suggest that there is no better example of how
police forces co-operate than the way that Lincolnshire,
Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire co-operated on the prosecution of my
Labour predecessor in Newark. The three forces worked splendidly to
produce a wonderful result, at least in the short term, and showed how
a federated police force can work particularly well. As my right hon.
Friend the Member for West Derbyshire said, if we go down the
Government&#146;s suggested route, we will end up with a leviathan of
five counties and, in theory, a single chief
constable.</p><p><a name="06052399000109">As sure as
shooting, and in the same way that the national health service has
turned itself inside out over the past five or six years, we will
shortly see another restructuring of those large forces with less
accountability at local level, more costs, lack of focus and lack of
resourcing. There are bound to be changes because that is a law of
nature. My right hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Sherwood alluded
to that.</p><p><a name="06052399000110">There can be
economies of scale. Looking to my shadow responsibilities, when I first
heard about the plans, I wondered what use they would have. They could
be attractive in fighting terrorism, and in that respect they may make
sense, yet the model that has already been adopted for terrorism
stretches from the Welsh border to the North sea. It has nothing to do
with the five-county structure that is being prepared. If we want more
effective structures, let us consider what is in place: undoubtedly,
there could be economies of scale and there are ways of doing things
better, but I deeply resent the loss of local accountability and of
local policemen serving local
people.</p><p><a name="06052399000111">I believe that
the Home Secretary is seeing sense and that he is beginning to row back
on the proposals. If anything that my right hon. Friend, my colleagues

Government that this is the wrong course of action, the debate will

one.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 396WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000113">The objections to the creation
of an east midlands super-force fall into three categories. The first
is the undemocratic, rushed and sham way in which the proposal is being
forced through and the consultation is supposedly taking place. The
hon. Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt) said that it is important to get
these things right rather than to get them quickly. What has happened
so far provides no assurance of
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000114">These changes in
policing are the biggest in this country since the service was created
in 1829, yet they are being rushed through in just a few months.
On22 September 2005, the Home Secretary wrote to police
authorities saying that there were plans to merge police forces to
create super-forces. He said that within just five weeks he wanted
police authorities throughoutthe country to come up with
proposals for mergers. On 11 November, they were told to prepare their
preferred options by 30 November&#151;just 19 days later. At the
start of December 2005, police authorities were toldto
produce their final single preferred option by23
December&#151;just three weeks later.</p><p><a name="06052399000115">To force through such drastic
changes in such a short time is undemocratic and rushed, allowing no
time whatever for adequate consultation with the public. In that rushed
time scale, the Government refused to consider federations and local
forces, which we have discussed in the past hour. They refused to allow
consideration of co-operation on wider issues&#151;for example,
combating serious and organised crime, terrorism and even common
payrolls&#151;yet the same Government who refused to allow
consideration of federation have insisted that the fire authorities do
precisely that&#151;federate to run joint control rooms. There seems
to be no logic in a system whereby one branch of the emergency services
federates while another cannot consider
it.</p><p><a name="06052399000116">Finally, in the
past few weeks the pace of rushed, sham consultation picked up speed,
and on 20 March the Home Secretary announced that he intends to merge
the five police forces into one east midlands force. He asked each
police authority to inform him by 7 April whether it would like to
proceed voluntarily to merger. Without exception, every force in the
east midlands&#151;like most throughout the country&#151;said no,
they would not like to proceed with a voluntary merger for all sorts of
well thought out
reasons.</p><p><a name="06052399000117"><b><a name="06052399000602">Tom
Levitt:</b> Although I support the mergerin
principle, it was important that Derbyshire constabulary and the others
did not go down the volunteer route because had they done so there
would not have been the four-month consultation. Even if they had been
in favour of it, they still should have opted for the
consultation.</p><p><a name="06052399000118"><b><a name="06052399000603">Paul
Holmes:</b> That is exactly the point I want to come to next.
On 11 April, having been told on 7 April that the five forces did not
want to merge, the Home Secretary said, &#147;Well, you&#146;re
going to anyway&#151;I am going to force it on to you.&#148; There
is a four-month period for objections, which we are in the middle of
now, but the Home Secretary had already made it clear that at the end
of that period he would introduce a statutory instrument, using powers
in the PoliceAct 1996, to impose a merger. Therefore, the
whole consultation is a sham, and the whole thing so rushed it is
meaningless.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 397WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000119">The second
group of objections is to do with funding issues, which we have already
had examples of from around the region. Derbyshire is traditionally
underfunded, particularly since the dark days of the 1980s when a
left-wing council leader, the right hon. Member for Sheffield,
Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), fought battles with a right-wing
Conservative Government led by Baroness
Thatcher.</p><p><a name="06052399000120">In 2005-06,
the average funding increase for police forces across England was 4.4
per cent., but in Derbyshire it was only 3.75 per cent. despite the
traditional underfunding of the force. Over the next two years up to
2008, Government funding plans require a further &#163;6 million of
underfunding or cuts in Derbyshire police, which has led to the police
authority writing to every Derbyshire MP to say in blunt terms that
that means there will be a reduction in police officer numbers, less
resources for neighbourhood policing and reduced opportunities to make
full use of advances in forensic science that would otherwise improve
detection rates.</p><p><a name="06052399000121">That
is a grim background to start with, but we must look next at the
financial implications of this forced merger. We have had the details,
so I will not go into them all, but the east midlands police
authorities, which must be the experts on this, say that the set-up
costs will be about &#163;101 million and the ongoing costs
&#163;45 million. However, the Government&#151;the Home
Office&#151;say, &#147;No, we will fund this at &#163;80 million
on the set-up costs and &#163;20 million on ongoing costs,&#148;
which is considerably less. That can mean only that there will be a
reduction in the services provided as a result of this
merger.</p><p><a name="06052399000122">There are
other issues such as pay harmonisation. It will cost &#163;9.4
million each year to harmonise the different pay structures across the
five forces. The Home Office has made a partial commitment by saying
that it will fund the cost for the first three years only. What happens
after that? Either the council tax goes up or police numbers go down.
There is also precept equalisation, and again there are different
levels across the five forces&#151;there is a 30 per cent.
differential. How will that be harmonised out, given the capping
guidelines of the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which
would not allow harmonisation to take place in that time
scale?</p><p><a name="06052399000123"><b><a name="06052399000604">Daniel
Kawczynski (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</b> On precepts, my
understanding is that it will take at least three to four years for
them to merge, so during that time we will have the same police force
but some areas will be paying significantly more than others, which is
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06052399000124"><b><a name="06052399000605">Paul
Holmes:</b> Absolutely. That leads us to my final group of
objections to this forced merger, which involves the principle of local
accountability. The size and diversity of the east midlands have been
referred to, so I will not go into that, but the geographical
differences and communications difficulties in respect of a force
running from Northampton at one end to Skegness at another, and to High
Peak and Chesterfield at yet another, speak for themselves. However,
there is local accountability for a force such as Derbyshire. Let me
highlight that by referring to an issue that has been raised.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 398WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000125">In one or two of the previous
four years, Derbyshire police authority has increased the council tax
precept by well above the rate of inflation specifically to fund more
beat police. I argued at the time&#151;I have not received any
comeback from my constituents to say otherwise&#151;that my
constituents would support that because they would see beat police on
the ground making a difference. The right hon. Member for West
Derbyshire says that his villagers have not seen a difference, and
perhaps they are not so keen, but we have certainly seen a difference
in
Chesterfield.</p><p><a name="06052399000126">However,
would council tax payers in Chesterfield, West Derbyshire or High Peak
be willing to pay extra council tax for more police if those police
were going to Nottingham, Leicester or Northampton&#151;or anywhere
else in that giant super-region? It is not practical. For three
different sets of reasons, I urge the new brooms at the Home Office to
think again. Unfortunately, I do not have much confidence that they
will.</p><p><a name="06052399000127"><b><a name="06052399000606">Several

Stephen Dorrell (Charnwood) (Con):</b> I congratulate my right
hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) on raising
this topic. It is a long time since a Government Department has
produced a proposal for which there is less support in the House; more
important, less support among those in the police service who will have
to put the proposal into effect; and most important, as my right hon.
Friend pointed out, less support among our constituents. It is worth
pausing to reflect on why there is so little support in any part of the
community for the proposals.</p><p><a name="06052399000130">The fundamental reason is that
the arguments advanced in favour of the proposal remind me of nothing
so much as &#147;newspeak&#148;, as defined by George Orwell in
&#147;1984&#148;. Ministers and their apologists have offered
series of arguments that bear no relation whatever to what most of us,
and most of those in the police service, expect to be the reality. We
are told that the merger is important in order to improve
accountability. Since when did a shift of authority from a largely
county basis to a regional basis improve accountability? It stands
common sense on its head.</p><p><a name="06052399000131">We are told that the merger is
necessary to improve cost efficiency in the police service. Never mind
the fact that the police believe that the Government have
underestimated the cost, the Government themselves admit that it will
cost &#163;80 million, and that one day, five years
hence&#151;perhaps&#151;there may be a payback, assuming that the
Government do not change their policy again. Hello? Which world do the
Government live
in?</p><p><a name="06052399000132">Finally, we are
told that the proposals are important because they will assist
operational efficiency. I do not understand the logic of telling my
hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick) that the
efficiency of the commander in Hinkley in dealing with 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 399WH</b><br>nightclub louts, shifting between Hinkley and Nuneaton, will be improved
by bringing Nottingham into the loop. Will someone please explain that
to me and, more important, to the policemen and women who fear that it
is another scheme dreamed up by the Government that will undermine the
efficiency of their service and the delivery of that service to local
people?</p><p><a name="06052399000133">When I reflect
on why such a friendless proposal was driven so hard by the previous
Home Secretary&#151;we hope that it will not be driven so hard by the
new one&#151;I can draw only one conclusion. It is yet another
proposal dreamed up in the bowels of a Whitehall Department that may
look good on a bureaucratic organogram but simply does not reflect
operational efficiency on the ground&#151;or, more important, common
sense.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000545">10.34

Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> It is a great pleasure
to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell),
who made a powerful speech. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the
Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) on securing such an
important debate; the number of Members here today is testimony to
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000135">I shall
concentrate on something that affects my constituency of
Wellingborough. I founded a campaign called &#147;Listening to
Wellingborough and Rushden&#148;, in which a regular survey is made
of the constituency. Not only do we have a snapshot of people&#146;s
worries at any one time, but we can compare those snapshots, month to
month and year to year. You might think,Mr. Taylor, that
education would come top of the poll in Wellingborough, because a
secondary school has been closed under the Labour Government; or you
might think that it would be health, because many of my constituents
must wait more than six months for an NHS operation; but neither of
those issues are at the top of the poll. Law and order consistently
tops the poll and, interestingly, in the past few months the gap
between law and order and health and education in the survey results
has been growing. The perception, at least in Wellingborough, is that
crime is getting worse and people are more concerned about it. That is
how things are under the current arrangements.</p><p><a name="06052399000136">Further examination of the
survey results, to see what specific concerns the people of
Wellingborough have about law and order, shows that they are worried
about vandalism, foul language, yob culture, arson and mugging. Those
problems would, I believe, have a very low rating in a regional east
midlands police force. The problems are so bad on some estates that one
or two families are terrorising the law-abiding citizens of
Wellingborough. I recently met a delegation from the Croyland ward in
my constituency. They had put their heads above the parapet: usually
people are too scared to say anything when there is vandalism and yob
culture, but these people had said &#147;Enough is enough; we want
something done about it.&#148; What they want is more local police on
the street, catching criminals and deterring
crime.</p><p><a name="06052399000137">Let us think a
little about where Wellingborough is. I had hoped, Mr. Taylor, to bring
in a map to show hon. 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 400WH</b><br>Members, but I understand that parliamentary procedure does not allow
it. Perhaps I can describe it. Northamptonshire is right at the bottom
end of the east midlands and Wellingborough is right at the bottom of
Northamptonshire. Rushden, where I live, is the second town in the
constituency of Wellingborough and is right at the bottom of the
constituency. If I walk 100 yd I can be in Bedfordshire. That is where
Rushden is. The new centre for policing will be further up the map, in
Nottingham, and somewhere even further up the map will be the edge of
the east midlands. To the people of Wellingborough, the proposal is
ridiculous.</p><p><a name="06052399000138">The basic
command unit has already been changed to fit in with the new plans, so
my chief superintendent has moved from Wellingborough to Kettering. At
the moment I have meetings with the chief constable, and I used to have
meetings with the chief superintendent. Those will disappear if we have
an east midlands
force.</p><p><a name="06052399000139">We heard
earlier in the debate that Nottingham has come out pretty poorly in the
crime figures. Leicestershire has come top of the ranking for assaults.
If there is an east midlands regional force it will be the duty of the
chief constable to put his resources where there is most crime, so what
will happen? Police officers will be taken from Wellingborough and
moved to Nottingham and Leicestershire. That is the fear not only of
the people of Wellingborough, but of the chief constable of
Northamptonshire. We will lose policing, which will go towards
Nottingham and Leicestershire. The people of Wellingborough will lose
out.</p>

<p><a name="06052399000140">At the moment my
constituents do not have enough police out on the beat catching
criminals and deterring crime. If there were an east midlands police
force, any policing of that kind would disappear entirely and crime in
my constituency would go up and up. In the &#147;Listening to
Wellingborough and Rushden&#148; survey, law and order would become
an even higher
priority.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000546">10.39

Hunter (Cheadle) (LD):</b> I congratulate
the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) on securing
the debate. The issue is important and is likely to affect not only the
east midlands but many communities in the country. I am sure that many
of the concerns that the right hon. Gentleman has raised today are
shared by police officers, residents and, indeed, Members of Parliament
from south Wales to Suffolk. It is regrettable that several hon.
Members have had to seek Adjournment debates on the issue as a result
of the Government&#146;s attempts to sidestep debates on the Floor of
the House on such a hugely important
matter.</p><p><a name="06052399000142">I shall start
by outlining the areas in which I and my party agree with Government
policy. It is clear that in some instances small police forces do not
possess the resources to deal effectively with some serious crimes.
Several recent high-profile cases in which a particular force required
assistance&#151;Soham is just the most obvious example&#151;have
demonstrated that the Government were right to explore ways in which
police forces could better co-operate and support each other; that much
is not in doubt. It would be wrong to suggest that Liberal Democrats
oppose closer co-operation between different forces and agencies. For
example, we have called for a national border force to bring together
the disparate agencies that deal with border
security, 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 401WH</b><br>including the relevant police, customs and immigration officers. We have
also called for a new national body to deal with financial crime, which
seems to be a low priority for the Government.</p><p><a name="06052399000143">I do not
agree, however, that the nuclear option, if I might use that phrase in
this context, of axing entire police forces is a sensible way to deal
with the issues. In my view, the answer is staring the Government in
the face. The recently established Serious Organised Crime Agency gives
the police a ready-made resource on which they can call if they need
to. If SOCA could take responsibility for level 2 crime, as my party
has suggested, we would have the ideal solution, because serious crimes
and crimes that take up disproportionate resources could be tackled
without, in effect, bankrupting smaller forces and, crucially, local
communities in the east midlands and beyond would remain strongly
linked to their local police forces.</p><p><a name="06052399000144">My experience of local
government in the past10 years has demonstrated to me in the
clearest possible terms that, despite their rhetoric, the Government
remain committed to centralisation. They seem to believe that an office
in Whitehall can deal with community policing better than a local beat
bobby can. One has only to speak to local police officers in a
constituency to realise that much of their work is dictated by Home
Office targets and politically inspired initiatives. Worrying, that
trend is replicated across a broad spectrum of services, including the
NHS, where central mismanagement has led to local funding crises, and
local authorities, which must somehow reflect local priorities while
trapped in the central Government straitjacket.</p><p><a name="06052399000145">In pursuing the regionalisation
of police forces, we need to remember that current regional structures
in the east midlands, as in the rest of the country, are the result of
arbitrarily drawn administrative boundaries with no democratic
structures underpinning them. The amalgamation of police forces would
result in the abolition of police authorities and the loss of the link
to elected councils through local authority members. Although the Home
Office argues that new structures of accountability can be built around
basic command units, that would create the worst of both worlds,
because such structures would be too distant from local communities to
provide meaningful discussion of neighbourhood priorities, and too
fragmented to provide meaningful scrutiny of decisions that are taken
at force level.</p><p><a name="06052399000146">I
turn now to the practical pitfalls of the mergers policy as it affects
forces in the east midlands and elsewhere. Like all regions, the east
midlands is diverse, with large metropolitan areas and distinct rural
localities. Should the proposals be implemented, there is a real
danger, as has been said, that officers and other resources will be
drawn away from the quieter areas to police urban crime hot spots.
Chief constables of smaller forces act as champions for their areas and
can lobby for a fair share of resources, but that simply will not be
possible under the new model.</p><p><a name="06052399000147">In addition, there is precious
little evidence that big forces perform better than small ones, which
serves only to confirm suspicions that the real motive behind the
policy is to save money. The HMIC baseline assessment in 2004 found
that, regardless of size, all forces were classed as
&#147;fair&#148; or &#147;good&#148; at tackling level 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 402WH</b><br>2 crime. If the resources required for mergers come from the
neighbourhood policing strategy budget, that would signal in the
clearest possible terms that the Government&#146;s priorities lie
with centralisation, not local policing.</p><p><a name="06052399000148">Amalgamation would also reduce
police accountability and responsiveness by distancing force HQs
physically and figuratively from the communities that they serve and by
sacrificing coterminosity with local authority boundaries. However, it
is not only coterminosity with local authority boundaries that is
threatened, because the relationships between other agencies, such
as&#151;</p><p><a name="06052399000149"><b><a name="06052399000611">David

between other agencies such as the Crown Prosecution Service, the
courts and the probation service could also suffer. The last thing we
need to do now is to allow the gaps in knowledge between the police and
the probation service to grow wider. If ever a Government Department
was desperate to buy some good will it is the Home Office, and the new

this morning and to put a stop to the

Herbert (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</b> I congratulate my
right hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) on
securing this debate, and I welcome the Minister to his new position.
His predecessor as Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety
lasted for two weeks; I hope that the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr.
McNulty) lasts longer. Commentators have described the mini-reshuffle
that took place yesterday as reshuffling the deckchairs; I hope the
Minister enjoys life on the deck of the Titanic. When icebergs appear,
it does not make sense to steer the ship straight towards them, but
thatis what the Home Office has been doing in
relationto police amalgamation, in a totally unnecessary
distraction from the job that the Department should have been doing. It
is clear that the previous Home Secretary was too distracted by this
process. I hope that the Minister and the new Home Secretary will think
again&#151;we hear that they are considering doing so.</p><p><a name="06052399000152">My right hon. and hon. Friends
raised a number of important concerns about the absurdly tight
timetable for the amalgamations and the lack of consultation with local
people. I shall wish to focus on three points made by the hon. Member
for High Peak (Tom Levitt, because I think he was wrong on all three
counts.</p><p><a name="06052399000153">First, the
hon. Gentleman made some suggestions about local accountability and
people&#146;s ability to get hold of their divisional commanders and
to have their e-mail addresses. He suggested that the survival of the
basic command unit, although that is not assured in respect of the one
he referred to in west Derbyshire, would be an adequate substitute for
the loss of the chief constable. He said that nobody minded about where
their chief constable resides, but actually, that matters a great deal,
especially for a force that will cover an area of 6,000 sq miles and
serve 4.2 million people. It matters, 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 403WH</b><br>not only for the reasons that my right hon. Friend the Member for West
Derbyshire suggested in terms of direct access on the part of Members
of Parliament, but because power and decision making has to lie
somewhere. Ultimately, somebody has to run the force and decide where
resources will be deployed, and it would be a fiction to pretend that a
BCU commander will be able to respond to people in the local community
and say, &#147;Yes, I will do this,&#148; or &#147;I will do
that,&#148; when in fact the force is run by the chief constable who
is miles away. All Members will feel the loss when we find that our
local communities are no longer able to have any influence at all over
the proper decisions being made by the chief
constable.</p><p><a name="06052399000154">Secondly,
the hon. Member for High Peak suggested that the federation of forces
was not a viable option. I think that he is wrong. There is plenty of
evidence in the midlands that federation, or the sharing of services
between forces, is a viable alternative&#151;look for example at the
midlands counter-terrorism support unit, which operates in the east
midlands. The option of sharing services was suggested by the Prime
Minister, no less, as an alternative to amalgamation, which his own
strategy unit warned would be a risky undertaking. It has not been
properly considered by the Government. It was recommended by the
Association of Police Authorities, but the impetus to achieve
co-operation between forces has now been lost because there will be no
incentive on the part of the strategic forces, some of them much
smaller than the east midlands force, to share
services.</p><p><a name="06052399000155">Finally, on
funding, I hope the Minister has seen a copy of the paper prepared by
the Association of Chief Police Officers&#146; head of finance, the
chief constable of Gloucestershire, which was reported in <i>The Daily
Telegraph </i>last Friday. If he has not done so, he should read it.
The ACPO conference will debate it this week. The report represents a
salutary warning to those who believe that amalgamation will somehow
allow a reinvestment of resources into enhancing protective services.
We all agree that there is a gap and that protective services need
strengthening; the question is how we do that. ACPO&#146;s head of
finance warns that because of the triple counting of services, and
because amalgamations will cost money&#151;&#163;77 million in
respect of the east midlands force&#151;resources will not be
available for investment into protective services and there will be an
impact on neighbourhood policing.</p><p><a name="06052399000156">I end by quoting the conclusion
of the
report:</p><a name="06052399000511"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Ultimately
unless additional funding is identified the early years of Force
amalgamation are likely to be a period not of service improvement but a
period of rapid and significant reduction in service provision as the
new forces desperately try to balance their
books.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000157">If the Minister

useful debate, certainly for me, given my current circumstances. I
congratulate the right hon. Member for West Derbyshire and others on
both sides on the broad tone of the debate. It has been essentially
non-partisan, or cross-party&#151;whichever way one wants to view
it&#151;and it has been well informed. I would expect no less from
the MPs of the east
midlands.</p><p><a name="06052399000161">As a London
MP, I find that policing in London is different from policing
elsewhere, but I do, and will increasingly, appreciate what policing
means outside London and in other areas. By the bye, I do
notthink that I heard the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark
Hunter), who speaks for the Liberals, congratulate the Government on
leaving his Greater Manchester force alone, which I thought a bit
churlish.</p><p><a name="06052399000162">The points
that right hon. and hon. Members have made are important, but
most&#151;not quite all&#151;of them started from the premise that
the status quo is not terrible. Our broad position starts from that. As
hon. Members will know, the Government&#146;s plans for assorted
forces up and down the country are clear. However, none of the speakers
went to the ditch to defend, in absolute terms, where we are now with
policing. I am enormously grateful that that is the starting point. The
present model is some 30 years old and, purely in terms of the
development of society since then, bears greater
scrutiny.</p><p><a name="06052399000163">I take on
board all that has been said about merger being at one end of the
scale&#151;the nuclear option, I think it was called&#151;and all
sorts of collaborative work and other options on the road to merger
being at the other end. We should be clear that the proposed merger
model does not preclude that sort of collaboration,or a
federated structure, beyond and outside regions. As the hon. Member for
Newark (Patrick Mercer) suggested, there must be ever greater
collaboration across the country and across regions, not least on
counter-terrorism, as he says.</p><p><a name="06052399000164">Before I come to matters of
substance, let me say that I take on board what has been suggested
about the timetable. If hon. Members feel that they have not had
sufficient face time&#151;for want of a better phrase&#151;with
Ministers to talk through the issues in detail, I am more than happy to
ensure that that happens. I am not sure that I would welcome all 44
east midlands MPs in the same room, all barking and baying at me at
once, but we can certainly look into the details of how that should
happen. I would welcome that opportunity, too. However valuable the
Adjournment debate is, we can discuss these matters in far more detail
in much smaller groups. I am more than happy to do that, whether on a
county basis or otherwise, and I will afford the same
facility&#151;because it would help me as much as anyone&#151;to
the Front Benchers; I will come and hear their
concerns.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 405WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000165">Many of the
complaints about what the Government are trying to do&#151;quite
naturally, in terms of hyperbole and rhetoric&#151;involve attacking
straw men and putting forward simplistic models. If all that the
Government were offering was a rush to merge regional authorities, many
of the concerns about accountability, remoteness and day-to-day
operational policing would be well
made.</p><p><a name="06052399000166"><b><a name="06052399000617">Mr.

which are neighbourhood policing, a redefinition of basic command unit
accountability, and the broader strategic
structure.</p><p><a name="06052399000169"><b><a name="06052399000619">Mr.
Kenneth Clarke:</b> Many years ago I encountered the same
problem relating to force sizes and accountability. Will the Minister
accept in this debate that the accountability and contact that mean
most to many MPs and their constituents is at divisional level and
local level, and that it will take much longer than the
Government&#146;s present timetable to explain how accountability and
contact at those levels can be improved as we move towards a giant
overall organisation covering five rather disparate
counties?</p><p><a name="06052399000170"><b><a name="06052399000620">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I am grateful for that intervention because in
broad terms I agree with it. As I said at the beginning, I am not
metrocentric. I appreciate that London is policed differently, but to
return to the London parallel, I have never had cause, in specific
local terms, to ring up Scotland Yard for anything. However, like the
hon. Member for Newark, I have the numbers and other details of my
local basic commander&#151;borough commander, as we call it. That is
where the accountability
lies.</p><p><a name="06052399000171">It is important
to say that all three elements that we are discussing are significant.
I take the points that people make about neighbourhood policing and
wanting the police to be highly visible on the streets in their
neighbourhood. That is part of the debate. Itake the point
that the divisional level, the BCU level, must be the focal point for
greater and enhanced communication among local communities, local
representatives such as MPs and councillors, and local police forces.
None the less, the case is made for forces to cover a wider
area.</p><p><a name="06052399000172">I ask hon.
Members to take seriously what I say about seeing people and talking
these issues through in far more detail during the objection period.
Everyone can bandy about assorted quotes from chief constables. I
accept that, so let me do it. The chief constable of Leicestershire
says that merging five forces into one is going
in</p><a name="06052399000512"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the right direction

statement, but the chief constable accepts the broad thrust of where we
are
going.</p><p><a name="06052399000174"><b><a name="06052399000621">Mr.

Derbyshire. May I press him on one point? At the moment, we are in a
four-month consultation period. My understanding is that it will end
sometime in July. Will the Minister assure us that an announcement will
not be made on this issue on25 July, as the House rises, and
that we will have the opportunity to discuss it so that the House can
properly measure the
proposals?</p><p><a name="06052399000177"><b><a name="06052399000624">Mr.
McNulty:</b> I can give the right hon. Gentleman an assurance
on the first point, because I understand that the four-month objection
period finishes around 11 August, rather than in mid-July. Therefore
the small window at the end of July wherein he suggested there might be
parliamentary debate does not come into
play.</p><p><a name="06052399000178">Let me say this
as clearly as I can, because there have been intimations in the press.
The new Home Secretary starts from the premise that the current
position is simply untenable and the direction of travel of what we
have suggested is the right outcome. Quite rightly, as a new Secretary
of State, my right hon. Friend reserves the right to take a look at
things such as timetables and all the other elements that go with that.
With or without that, local MPs are right to raise what are very
important issues&#151;none of which I traduce as trivial&#151;such
as council tax precept equalisation, the disparity between urban and
rural areas and the disparity between the starting financial bases of
each of the counties. Work is being done on those matters. In fact, the
east midlands business plan for the merger was one of the best of those
submitted, but work
continues.</p><p><a name="06052399000179">If hon.
Members are suggesting that more time is required, I am not shocked or
astonished by that and I will certainly take their suggestions back to
the Department. I have commented on the Home Secretary&#146;s
position. If the concern is that they have not had sufficient time at
ministerial level to talk their concerns through, I will give an
assurance that that can happen for the east midlands and elsewhere. I
take seriously the concerns expressed by hon. Members and I will take
them back to the Department, but the current position is untenable. We
want to go in the direction outlined in the merger plans. Policing is
far too important to ignore the genuine concerns raised by hon. Members
from all parts of the
Chamber&#151;</p><p><a name="06052399000180"><b><a name="06052399000625">David

Hours</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000549">11
am</h5><p><a name="06052399000181"><b><a name="06052399000626">Mr.
Andrew Smith (Oxford, East) (Lab):</b> I am grateful for the
opportunity to debate Sunday trading hours and to do so with you in the
Chair, Mr. Taylor. I welcome my very good friend the Minister, who is
responding to this debate. He represents a London constituency and, in
that capacity, I hope he will join me in welcoming the goals of the
<i>Evening Standard </i>campaign for small shops in the
capital.</p><p><a name="06052399000182">I studied,
as I am sure the Minister did, the remarks of our right hon. Friend the
Minister for Trade, who, while in his current post, said in the recent
Commons debate on confident consumers:</p><a name="06052399000513"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I am determined
to...strike the right balance.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official
Report</i>, 11 May 2006; Vol. 446, c.
566.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000183">I am pleased that he used
that phrase, because the right balance is what the whole question of
Sunday trading hours must be about.</p><p><a name="06052399000184">I speak as a fully paid up and
long-standing member of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied
Workers. The issue is crucially important to the union and its members.
We need to strike a balance between more than the interests of shop
workers, whom I believe are the majority, who do not want longer Sunday
working hours, and consumers, whom I believe are the minority, who do.
This issue is about the right balance between large and small stores,
and between the character of Sunday and that of other days of the week.
It is also about the work-life balance and the balance between the
interests of those who are affected by the traffic, deliveries and
servicing of Sunday trading and those who want to shop.</p><p><a name="06052399000185">We should all recall that there
was intensive and prolonged debate on all those issues before the
passage of the Sunday Trading Act 1994, which was itself a considered
compromise between those who wanted no Sunday trading, those who wanted
deregulation and those who wanted a significant bit of trading for
large stores, more freedom for small stores and protection for affected
workers. It was a compromise&#151;it struck a balance&#151;and
subsequent developments qualified it, notably the welcome introduction
of the minimum wage and Christmas day
protection.</p><p><a name="06052399000186">The
balance has, on the whole, worked better than opponents at either end
of the spectrum expected. People can shop in large supermarkets and
stores for much of the day and they can use smaller shops outside those
hours, yet Sunday remains a bit different, and shop workers retain some
protection in law and in practice. If we were seeking to change that
Act, there would be a much stronger case for entrenching legally the
right to premium payment and for strengthening workers&#146;
protection against pressure to work on Sundays when they do not want to
do so, rather than for moving in the opposite
direction.</p><p><a name="06052399000187">Sunday
trading is one of the subjects on which we never get everyone to agree.
I do not see any evidence that opinion has shifted much one way or the
other.We should not keep compromising with those who want a
total free-for-all. If we were to do so, we would allow them to
salami-slice their way to complete deregulation, which is not what most
people want; it is not even what all the big retail chains want. The
onus is 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 408WH</b><br>on those who want longer or deregulated hours to make the case. I do not
think that they have succeeded in doing so, and they have not convinced
the
public.</p><p><a name="06052399000188">From
what my constituents in Oxford tell me, and from opinion polls, I see
no tide of opinion in favour of longer opening hours for large
stores&#151;quite the contrary. For example, a British Market
Research Bureau survey for the Association of Convenience Stores found
that 68 per cent. of the public did not want large supermarket chains
to open for longer hours on Sunday. Of the remainder, a further 14 per
cent. said that they would reconsider and not support longer opening
hours if they threatened small businesses. USDAW&#146;s NOP survey
found that 62 per cent. of the public do not want longer Sunday opening
hours. Even a survey of people who were out shopping on a Sunday
conducted for the lobby group, Deregulate, found that only 56 per cent.
favoured longer opening hours. That is hardly a ringing endorsement
from those in the public whom one might expect to be most in favour of
longer hours.</p><p><a name="06052399000189">The inquiry
by the panel of parliamentarians, including my hon. Friend the Member
for Loughborough (Mr. Reed), who is present, found widespread
opposition not only from religious groups and trade unionists but,
significantly, from groups such as Working Families, the
Mothers&#146; Union and CARE, and particular concern for the effects
on family life and especially parents&#146; ability to spend time
with their children. That is an issue, rightly, of growing
concern.</p><p><a name="06052399000190">Such
important considerations were given surprisingly little attention in
the cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the Department of Trade and
Industry. Indeed, some important arguments were explicitly excluded
from the analysis, such as people not wanting trading because it is the
Christian day of rest, restrictions being necessary to protect workers
from pressure to work on a Sunday, and a collective preference for a
quiet day. In a rather haughty get-out clause the authors, from
Indepen,
state:</p><a name="06052399000514"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We have
not attempted to evaluate these arguments
quantitatively.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000191">They
ought to have added &#147;qualitatively&#148; as well. They go on
to say:</p><a name="06052399000515"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;If
they have merit, it would be necessary for Ministers to make judgements
as to how their merits compare with the net benefits of liberalisation
that we have
quantified.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000192">I urge
Ministers to do just that. Some of the most important arguments are at
stake in the decision about what sort of a day we as a society want
Sunday to be for workers as well as consumers and for us all as human
beings.</p><p><a name="06052399000193">Colleagues
will, I am sure, have scope in their speeches to consider such matters
and other issues from the cost-benefit analysis in further detail.
However, it is important to stress three key points. First, the
cost-benefit analysis report sees no net job generation from further
deregulation. Secondly, the gains that it claims, such as the effect on
prices, derive largely from the progressive erosion of premium
payments. Even if the reduction in consumer prices and higher profits
were to materialise, it would largely be at the expense of low-paid
workers. It is inconceivable in such circumstances that the already
extensive pressure that shop staff feel that they are under to work on
Sundays&#151;more than half of staff reported such pressure in an
USDAW survey&#151;would not increase.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 409WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000194"><b><a name="06052399000627">Mr.
David Drew (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I do not know whether my
right hon. Friend has been the fortunate recipient of a paper from
Deregulate, but it
states:</p><a name="06052399000516"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our
proposals are supported by...many who work on Sundays in the
industry because they may want to top up pensions, or are the 170,000
students facing debt who find it convenient to work at weekends or are
those recruited through
&#145;Jobcentreplus&#146;.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000195">There
it is; we are doing this on behalf of those who are most in need. Does
he think that that is a good
argument?</p><p><a name="06052399000196"><b><a name="06052399000628">Mr.
Smith:</b> I have not seen that briefing from Deregulate, but
that does not surprise me. Indeed, the cost-benefit analysis
commissioned by the DTI pointed to both students and single parents as
potential recruits for additional Sunday working. As far as the latter
are concerned, who is looking after the children while those lone
parents are out working? As USDAW&#146;s surveys have shown, many
people are not doing such work through choice but out of necessity as a
means of keeping body and soul together. No one would dispute that
Sunday working suits some people. The thrust of my argument is not that
it does not, but that many people feel under increasing pressure to
work when they do not want to do so. Moreover, as the cost-benefit
analysis report showed, the premium payments that attract some people
to work on Sundays at the moment have been progressively eroded, from
the typical double time, at the time of the 1994 Act, to time and a
half, time and a quarter and, in many cases, single time. That pressure
would get worse.</p><p><a name="06052399000197"><b><a name="06052399000629">Tony
Lloyd (Manchester, Central) (Lab):</b> My right hon. Friend
made the valid point earlier that we should consider strengthening the
rights of workers to guarantees of premium payments. Does he accept in
any case that there are many exploited workers even now, both in the
sectors brought into Sunday trading by the most recent changes and in
those that could always trade on Sunday? People need proper protection
from being forced to worked to work on Sundays for inadequate
remuneration.</p><p><a name="06052399000198"><b><a name="06052399000630">Mr.
Smith:</b> I certainly accept that, and that point is clear
from surveys and the anecdotal evidence of workers in the
industry.</p><p><a name="06052399000199">The third
key point that came out of the cost-benefit analysis was that small
stores will lose out, especially on current out-of-hours sales, for
which they are a substitute for large store provision. Given the
report&#146;s precision on the benefits that it claims will come from
extending hours, it is striking how vague its conclusions are about the
quantitative effects on smaller and convenience stores. How many small
shops would close and how many jobs would be lost? We must give weight
to the conclusion drawn by the Association of Convenience Stores that
liberalisation would have a</p><a name="06052399000517"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;devastating effect on local
convenience stores&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000200">We
should also bear in mind the sector&#146;s survey, which showed that
as many as 30 per cent. of independents would be likely to close if
Sunday trading hours were extended and that 44 per cent. of retailers
would be forced to cut staff.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 410WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000201">To draw to a conclusion, the
case for further deregulation has not been made; indeed, there are good
grounds for being apprehensive about its effects. I hope that the
Government, having reviewed all the evidence, will come to the same
conclusion. If by any mischance they do not, I would seek assurances,
first, that there would be votes on primary legislation in Parliament
before any change could be made and, secondly, that any such votes
would be free votes, so that MPs could vote according to their
conscience and judgment.</p><p><a name="06052399000202">I hope that the situation does
not come to that and that the Government will share my view that they
have many more important and constructive things to do than bring in
longer Sunday trading hours. Doing so would put shop workers under
unacceptable pressure, further diminish the special character of Sunday
and lead to the closure of many more small shops. Let us keep a
civilised balance and stick with the 1994
Act.</p><p><a name="06052399000203">I leave the last
word to Heather Morris and Debbie Davidson, shop workers who gave
moving accounts of what the possibility of more Sunday working meant to
them at a seminar that USDAW organised for MPs. They pointed out that
Sunday working hours are already longer than the six hours for which
the shops can be open, because of preparation and clearing-up time.
They
said:</p><a name="06052399000518"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Sunday
is losing its tradition of being a family day. We look forward to
having Sunday tea together because we can no longer have Sunday lunch
together.</p></ul><a name="06052399000519"><ul><p class="tabletext">Some of us
don&#146;t have the luxury of choosing to work on Sundays or choosing
to work in retail. We are hardworking people...there to support
our families.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000204">One
added:</p><a name="06052399000520"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I know
dearly how important families are. How important it is to spend time
with them, to create memories for our children, keep traditions and

want to spend my bank holidays at home with the family&#151;but we

attention will be given to the likely impact on our towns and cities,
and on the roads between them and the adjoining villages. We already
have six-days-a-week congestion, and we are in danger of having
seven-days-a-week congestion. That means that we will need more bus
services to be provided on Sundays and more filling stations to be
open. If Sunday trading hours are extended, premises both in and out of
town will be used for even more hours than they are now, people will
expect bus services to run earlier, and people who live in town centres
will be awoken earlier.</p><p><a name="06052399000211">Take, for example, someone who
lives in the centre of Ryde or Newport in my constituency&#151;I
declare an interest because I live in the centre of Newport. It is not
unusual for large delivery lorries to arrive at supermarkets such as
Somerfield and Sainsbury&#146;s well before the official opening
hours of those stores on six, no seven, days a week. If the time at
which those stores can open is made earlier on a Sunday, people will be
disturbed earlier by delivery lorries. In my constituency, there will
be more pressure for people to work on the ferries earlier, so that the
delivery lorries can cross the Solent in time to reach the supermarkets
before they open.</p><p><a name="06052399000212">The
proposals will have an impact on employment, as I am sure the Minister
understands, but they will also have an impact on the condition and
state of our towns and villages. People quite like walking around
Newport and Ryde on Sundays, because there is less traffic and
congestion. Sundays would become very much like any other day if the
proposals of the big conglomerates were to take effect in the manner
under consideration. I hope that the Minister will consider carefully
with his colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local
Government the impact of Sunday trading on planning and local
government.</p><p><a name="06052399000213">I hope
that the Minister will also consider the impact on tourism. Obviously,
there is some demand for some stores to be open on Sundays, but for the
most part it is small stores, shops and businesses that open on Sundays
to deal with the needs of tourism. Thankfully, most tourism has not yet
been taken over by the Sainsburys and Tescos of this world; there is
already a danger of that with garden centres, which are increasingly
being swallowed up by big chains. There was a time when I felt some
sympathy for the desire of garden centres to open on Easter day, but no
longer, because for the great part they are no longer small, local
businesses that breathe money into the economy of their local area,
although many still are.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 412WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000214">I hope that the Minister who has this
difficult responsibility will allow the Department of Trade and
Industry to shed its traditional appearance, and that it will look more
carefully at the whole range of community interests across the
nation.</p><p><a name="06052399000215">The right
hon. Gentleman referred to the seminar provided for right hon. and hon.
Members by USDAW and the &#147;Keep Sunday Special&#148; campaign.
The contributions of Heather Morris and Debbie Davidson were moving. In
particular, I remember their references to the hours at which people
have to start work. Supermarkets have to open on weekday mornings with
all the shelves full and all the bread freshly baked, and that would
have to be translated to Sunday mornings if Sunday trading was to be
extended in the same way. We were told that the bakers have to start
work at 4 o&#146;clock in the morning if fresh bread is to be on the
shelves by 7. There is no reason why that should not happen also on
Sundays under proposals currently up for consideration.</p><p><a name="06052399000216"><b><a name="06052399000634">Mr.
Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> May I place on record
my support, on behalf of my constituents, for USDAW&#146;s
&#147;Save our Sundays&#148; campaign and for the &#147;Keep
Sunday Special&#148; campaign? I congratulate my hon. Friend on his
remarks about the impact of deregulation on family life. Is he as
shocked as I am to hear that there are 1.4 million families with
dependent children in which both parents already have to work
throughout the
weekend?</p><p><a name="06052399000217"><b><a name="06052399000635">Mr.
Turner:</b> I am surprised that the number is as great as my
hon. Friend suggests. I am concerned about it, however, because those
children deserve to have time with their parents&#151;with both
parents together&#151;and they need to see how, ideally, families
should work. I know that it is difficult for people to bring up
children, and I know that many children are not fortunate enough to be
brought up by both parents; but we do not want more children to be
forced for reasons of economic necessity to be left by their parents on
Sundays as they are left on other days of the
week.</p><p><a name="06052399000218">I was speaking
about the effect on shop workers. It can be argued that shop workers
are grown up people and can make up their own minds when they want to
work and when they do not want to work; they can take what is on offer
or they can work elsewhere. That is the traditional argument of the big
conglomerates. I subscribe to the view that people should make their
own decisions on where and when they work, but it is not sufficient for
us simply to wash our hands of our responsibility to them and to the
shop workers of future generations.</p><p><a name="06052399000219">It is not because of how much
shop workers are paid that I worry about them working on Sunday: I am
sure that many students are happy to work on Sunday. I am concerned
about the extension of Sunday trading because of the consequences for
communities and families. I am concerned also about its impact on those
families who already run small businesses, because it is a form of
unfair competition. Large businesses are backed by a huge amount of
capital, and they can spread that capital and the cost of that
investment over seven days a week; but a family running a corner shop
naturally wants some private time, and it will be much more difficult
to spread the cost of the investment over seven days a week with full
opening hours.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 413WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000220">I believe that if such a
proposal ever came before the House in the form of legislation, we
should look again at the further regulation of Sunday trading. However,
I suggest that further regulation should not be imposed nationally but
that it should be for local authorities to impose it within the current
regulations. I suggest, for example, that local authorities ought to be
given the power to limit further the hours of Sunday trading for all or
any class of business if they so desired. For instance, they could
permit sole traders to open for the full six hours but require larger
traders to open for less. They could permit locally owned businesses to
open for the full six hours but restrict other businesses. They could
permit small garden centres or farm shops to open the full six hours
but not permit other businesses to do so. The House will need to take
account of those considerations if the proposal ever forms legislation,
but most important is that the Minister considers carefully the views
of his colleagues in other Departments as well as those of the public
on this unpopular
proposal.</p><p><a name="06052399000221"><b><a name="06052399000636">Several

temptation for people to stand up and say that they will be brief.
Having already lost a couple of minutes, I shall try to keep to a
narrow point.</p><p><a name="06052399000224">I thank
my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) for
securing this debate. It is important that the Minister and his team
know the strong feelings of Back Benchers not just from one party but
throughout the House. I am grateful that my right hon. Friend mentioned
the document, &#147;Whose Convenience?&#148;, in which I declare a
bit of an interest. It did what the Department of Trade and Industry
failed to do, examining the social effects of extending weekend working
and Sunday trading.</p><p><a name="06052399000225">My
right hon. Friend highlighted one of the big problems, which was that
the DTI focus was too narrow. The cost-benefit analysis was based
solely on the economic arguments of extending Sunday trading, but as
other hon. Members have said, the real problems with extending Sunday
trading are the effects on family life, parenting and
relationships.</p><p><a name="06052399000226">I come
to the issue with my faith. I am one of those who believe that it is
possible for Members of Parliament to have a strong faith and to bring
it to policy making. My faith underlies much of what I have to say. I
keep Sunday as special as possible, but I recognise that in a secular
society it is impossible to impose my views about Sunday on everybody
else. I am flexible, but I try as much as possible not to shop on a
Sunday and to make it a special day. Such an approach can even help MPs
to ensure that they see more of their
families.</p><p><a name="06052399000227">MPs
have some choice in the matter. To a certain extent, apart from a few
things that we have to do throughout the year, we have some choice
about how we 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 414WH</b><br>structure our week. The people who will be most affected by the proposal
probably have very little choice. The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr.
Hollobone) raised this matter earlier, when he said that 1.5 million
families include people who have to work on Sundays. If we extend
trading, we will make that much
worse.</p><p><a name="06052399000228">Because of my
faith, which underpins my values and the way in which I look at
society, I believe
that</p><a name="06052399000525"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;God
measures a society...not by the size of its GDP or by the
efficiency of its markets, but by the quality of its
relationships.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000229">&#147;God&#148;
could be changed to
&#147;we&#148;.</p><p><a name="06052399000230">This
is one of the two or three areas about which I feel strongly. As people
know, I have a great passion for sport and for international
development. The third area that I wish to pursue while I am in the
House is getting the balance right for encouraging, fostering and
nurturing relationships, as that is the key to solving many of
today&#146;s social ills and problems. The Government can assist and
create environments, but the single biggest thing that they can do is
to create time for families to encourage and nurture
relationships.</p><p><a name="06052399000231">I
thank those who helped to write the report. As usual, those of us who
are named in it probably did very little work. The credit goes to
others who are here today. I shall not refer to the whole of the
report, but what is interesting in paragraph 3.5, which deals with the
effects on family life and parenting, is that it was not just the usual
suspects who provided the strongest opposition to a relaxation of the
six-hour rule. Obviously, organisations such as the TUC and USDAW were
involved, but it was nice that others such as Morrisons were as well. I
was encouraged by that. We should remember when we castigate the big
supermarkets that companies such as Morrisons recognise that there is a
balance to be struck. The British Shops and Stores Association, Working
Families, the Mothers Union and CARE were also involved, and it was the
National Centre for Social Research that highlighted the number of
people who already work long
hours.</p><p><a name="06052399000232">It is a little
late in terms of the work that has already been done, but it is
imperative when the Minister and his colleagues consider the report,
that they consider introducing primary legislation. I and other hon.
Members urge them to give us a free vote so that we can all have our
say. [Hon. Members: &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;]
At that point, the Minister will get the message that there is no great
support for the measure in the House or the country. As my right hon.
Friend the Member for Oxford, East rightly said, even research done
among those who had chosen to go shopping on a Sunday showed only 56
per cent. support for extending Sunday shopping. Clearly, support is
not that large in the country; indeed, other research and opinion polls
generally show about 70 per cent. opposition.</p><p><a name="06052399000233">There is nothing for the
Government to gain by extending Sunday shopping. Given that they want
to generate good news stories rather than bad, why would they generate
another bad news story unnecessarily? They should just kill this one
off at the end of this Adjournment debate, and we could all walk away
happy, praising the Minister as he went on his way. Perhaps one or two
extra Members need to be present to convince him, but he would make
friends here and across the House if he killed the proposal off today,
rather than waiting for the summer recess. We need to 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 415WH</b><br>get our values right in society, and that is also true of the work-life
balance. The Department has introduced several welcome legislative
changes, which have started to address the need to get the work-life
balance right, and it would be strange if it took the retrograde step
represented by the present measure and undermined much of the good work
that has been done.</p><p><a name="06052399000234">As I said, my other interest is
in sport, and I chair the National Strategic Partnership for
Volunteering in Sport&#151;we actually got consultants in to come up
with a shorter title, but that was the one that they came up with.
However, the body is important because we speak on behalf of the
roughly 2.5 million people who volunteer in sport. As everybody who has
volunteered will know, however, the increased pressure of work is
squeezing people&#146;s ability to give regular time to volunteering.
We all volunteer, but we also know that sport is increasingly changing.
The 3 o&#146;clock Saturday afternoon kick-off has changed and the
mini rugby clubs and the football teams are full. Indeed, my little
eight-year-old son has just started playing football and was supposed
to have been in a tournament on Sunday. However, it is impossible to
get the balance right, and we need to create extra time.</p><p><a name="06052399000235">The Institute of Management did
research into lifestyle measures and asked people whether they had time
for other interests. Even in 1997, 77 per cent. of people said that
they did not, but by 1999, about 87 per cent. said that they had little
time for additional interests. When they were asked whether their
extended hours were damaging their health, 71 per cent. said that they
did, so people recognised the problem. When they were asked whether
their hours had an effect on their relationship with their children, 86
per cent. said that they did. As we know, the time that people enjoy
together with their family is a vital part of the week. We must
recognise the need to get the work-life balance right when we have our
children. One of those who was surveyed said that he was working as
hard as he could to spend lots of time with his grandchildren. That is
great, and it will be some consolation to him, but it might not be a
consolation to his children.</p><p><a name="06052399000236">We need to get the balance
right to free up people&#146;s time. The biggest contribution that we
can make is to create time so that families can spend quality time
together. That will deliver not only a better Sunday but a better
quality of life right across the nation in terms of what we as families
and individuals achieve.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000552">11.33

I too congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East
(Mr. Smith) on obtaining the debate. I should declare that I am a life
member of the Association of Town Centre Management, although I do not
believe that it has a particular view on Sunday trading.</p><p><a name="06052399000238">The question
I ask myself is where the call to extend Sunday hours comes from,
because it does not seem to come from us in Parliament, and as we have
heard, it does not come from those who work in shops or from the
public. Surveys show very low public support for changing the law;
indeed, the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned a
cost-benefit analysis by Indepen 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 416WH</b><br>Consulting Ltd, which bears that out. It surveyed the current situation,
and page 16 of its report shows that 13 per cent. of adults aged 16 and
over shop at supermarkets every Sunday, while 7 per cent. shop at other
large stores every Sunday. The conclusion that most of us would draw
from that&#151;oddly, the Indepen report does not draw it&#151;is
that 80 per cent. of adults do not shop at supermarkets on Sundays and
93 per cent. do not shop at other large stores on Sundays. Even the
Department&#146;s own commissioned report seems to bear out that lack
of public support.</p>

<p><a name="06052399000239">So
who wants change? Not necessarily all the big four supermarkets. A
representative of Sainsbury&#146;s quoted in <i>Retail Week </i>late
last year
said:</p><a name="06052399000526"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Our
customers tell us they are happy with our opening hours and we have not
had any demand to change
them.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000240">Of
course, however, if change should come I am sure that
Sainsbury&#146;s would follow the other big supermarkets in extending
its hours. I can only conclude that the pressure comes from the big
three supermarkets, if not from all of the big four.</p><p><a name="06052399000241">I am sure that the Minister
will want to take into account the fact that the Competition Commission
has now been asked by the Office of Fair Trading to carry out a new
inquiry into the grocery trade, and in particular the effect on it of
the big four supermarkets. In addition to all the other reasons that
have been given that support my belief that it would be unwise for the
Government to proceed with an extension of opening hours at present, it
would be unwise to proceed with any proposals for change while that
Competition Commission inquiry is under way. If the Minister wants a
reason to kick the idea into the long grass, that is very respectable
one for him to make use
of.</p><p><a name="06052399000242">I welcome the
assurance, given by one of the Minister&#146;s colleagues at the
USDAW conference a month or so ago, that if any change were to be
proposed in future it would be subject to a vote in Parliament&#151;I
hope that it would be a free vote&#151;and would not be dealt with
under the powers that might be given to Parliament under, for instance,
the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill.</p><p><a name="06052399000243">An argument urged by some
supporters of extending hours&#151;whoever those shadowy characters
might be&#151;is that it would mean lower prices for customers.
However, the Indepen report gives no evidence that that will be so. It
merely asserts it. It does not mention, for instance, the fact that in
the past the Competition Commission logically said that supermarket
pricing depends on local competition; the effect of change on that
competition and on the smaller, independent convenience stores and
other independent retailers concerns me. We all know the figures about
closures of independent convenience stores in the past few years: 2,000
of them closed last year, and their sales are regularly down an average
of 5 per cent. a year. The recent report by the all-party small shops
group, &#147;High Street Britain: 2015&#148;, which I am pleased to
have played a part in preparing, showed the pressures to which those
small shops are already subject.</p><p><a name="06052399000244">The Indepen report states that
extending hours
will</p><a name="06052399000527"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;impact negatively
on small stores that are primarily substitutes for large
stores&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000245">and could have a
positive impact on</p><a name="06052399000528"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;small stores that are complements
to large stores&#148;.</p></ul><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 417WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000246">What the report ignores
is the fact that in the past few years the number of small stores that
complement larger stores has decreased, and the number of small stores
that act as substitutes has increased. That is because the larger
stores have extended beyond their usual grocery base the range of goods
and services on offer to customers, to include DVDs and CDs, white
goods, clothing, magazines and newspapers, pharmacy services, photo
processing and so on. More and more of the small stores near the bigger
stores are not complementary to those bigger stores, but are
substitutes, and the Indepen report completely overlooks that important
factor.</p><p><a name="06052399000247">In Brighton
and Hove we are lucky. We have a good, successful sub-regional shopping
centre, where most of the big multiples are represented, and we also
have a vibrant and diverse area of small, independent retailers around
the Lanes and the North Laine, which many people who have visited
Brighton will know. The North Laine and the Lanes are currently voting
on whether to become a business improvement district. We do not know
how the vote will turn out, but by making it possible to set up
business improvement districts the Government are helping small
retailers who want to help themselves. If they extend the opening hours
of larger stores they will put small retailers under still further
pressure rather than helping them. I urge the Minister, as others have
done, to look at the evidence, which is that the public and Members of
Parliament do not want it, and to take the matter no further and forget
about
it.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000553">11.40

Jones (Warrington, North) (Lab):</b> I congratulate my right
hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on securing the
debate.</p><p><a name="06052399000249">It seems to me
that we have seen a steady erosion of time off and special days. I
remember a long debate many years ago when I was a councillor about
whether we should allow the market to open on Good Friday. We said no,
but Good Friday is now a normal working day for many
people.</p><p><a name="06052399000250">It is
important to protect family life when we can. People have strong views
about Sunday trading, which have been expressed in the House many
times. Most of us accept that the decision was made to allow stores to
open for a limited number of hours and that it will stand. When that
decision was taken by the House, there were a number of safeguards in
place to ensure that people did not have to work on Sundays if they did
not want to and to ensure premium payments. However, all the evidence
from the survey carried out by USDAW is that those safeguards are being
eroded. Eighty per cent. of people who work in shops now work on
Sundays and say that it is difficult to have a Sunday off. Almost half
are unhappy about
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000251">Let us be clear:
we are talking about many low-paid workers who feel under pressure to
work on Sundays if they are to keep their jobs and who need to work on
Sundays to keep their wages at a decent level. We should tackle that
rather than force people into longer and longer hours to earn a decent
wage. Sunday working is not always as voluntary as it
seems.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 418WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000252">I believe that the pressure on
stores to open longer is taking valuable time away from family life.
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed), I try not
to have engagements on Sundays. We have a choice, but many people do
not, and parents need that time to spend with their children. It is
difficult to find child care on a Sunday and even more difficult for
carers. We should not forget that many people who work in shops are
also carers and have family
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06052399000253">The
cost of Sunday working has an impact on us all. It has an impact on
local authorities, which must provide more cleaning services and ensure
that transport is running and rubbish removed. It also has an impact on
the emergency services, which have many more calls to accidents on
Sundays as traffic builds up. If we extend opening hours, it will not
be long before Sunday becomes a normal working day for many more people
than those who work in
shops.</p><p><a name="06052399000254">The cost falls
on all of us in the community. What for? Who has ever starved to death
because a shop was not open on a Sunday, never mind that it is not open
for a few extra hours? Who has ever found themselves in real difficulty
because they cannot suddenly run down to the shops to buy an extra tin
of beans? Let us try to put the matter in perspective: what we are
trying to protect is far more valuable, even though it cannot be
measured. What is important is not always measurable&#151;it is the
right to a decent family life and to be able to spend time with
children. It is important to us as a society that our children are
properly brought up, otherwise the price will fall on us all.</p><p><a name="06052399000255">It is time we stopped defining
ourselves as a nation by how much we shop. Going to the shops is
beginning to be a definition of life and leisure. There are more
important things: family, sport, volunteering and what people put back
into their communities. We need to protect that community time, as well
as those workers on low wages who work very long hours in shops, who
can have their hours changed at a moment&#146;s notice. They deserve
what we consider our
right.</p><p><a name="06052399000256">Like many
others, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to kick that deregulation

three quick points. I might be wrong, but I am led to believe that
Tesco has now withdrawn from Deregulate, which is promising. Tesco is
now calling for partial deregulation. I hope that that is a result of
the pressure brought to bear by USDAW. I am pleased to say that Tesco
has always recognised USDAW and has good industrial relations with
it.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 419WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000261"><b><a name="06052399000644">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> But does the hon. Gentleman
accept that Tesco and businesses large and small would need to open for
longer hours if there was deregulation because of the commercial
imperative to maintain their market share? That would damage the
workers and our
communities.</p><p><a name="06052399000262"><b><a name="06052399000645">Mr.

John Grogan (Selby) (Lab):</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that
although Tesco has pulled out of the Deregulate campaign, which calls
for complete deregulation, it intimated that it is in favour of nine
hours of trading on Sundays? That is a false compromise that should be
rejected by the Minister and the Department of Trade and
Industry.</p><p><a name="06052399000264"><b><a name="06052399000647">Mr.
Drew:</b> I think we are on to a winner here. We should take
half a loaf at the moment, but we want the full loaf, as we want Tesco
to leave things as they are. I share the views of my right hon. Friend
the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), and I share the faith of my
hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough(Mr. Reed). I think
that we should be going backwards towards more regulation, but that is
just my political
stance.</p><p><a name="06052399000265">I have two
other points to make. The first is a serious point about the damage
that deregulation would do to our smallest stores. Anyone who has seen
the evidence from the New Economics Foundation on clone towns and ghost
towns could not help but worry that deregulation would be another nail
in the coffin of those smaller stores that choose to open on
Sundays&#151;and people choose to work in
them.</p><p><a name="06052399000266">I do not wish to
ban such working, because everybody needs some services on Sundays and
we should protect those services. People can get basic groceries and
materials outside the normal restricted hours on a Sunday. However, I
still believe that we should restrict the hours of opening for all
services, bar the emergency ones. We should protect those services,
which are so crucial, and keep them in
operation.</p><p><a name="06052399000267"><b><a name="06052399000648">Rosie
Cooper (West Lancashire) (Lab):</b> I visited a convenience
store in my constituency the other week, and the Association of
Convenience Stores and USDAW should be congratulated on ensuring good
public debate and that Ministers know just how badly deregulation will
affect our constituencies and
constituents.</p><p><a name="06052399000268"><b><a name="06052399000649">Mr.
Drew:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend, and I share the view
that there should be a free vote. I do not blame the DTI, as I think
that the pressure for deregulation comes largely from the Treasury,
although I might be wrong. I hope that the DTI will stand up against
the Treasury, if that is the case, and tell it that this is the wrong
way to go.</p><p><a name="06052399000269">My next
point refers back to Deregulate, which I mentioned when I intervened on
my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East. It says that 80 per
cent. of the population agreed with the statement that politicians
should not be involved in setting opening hours on Sundays. Well, there
is a good reason why we 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 420WH</b><br>are here, is there not? We might as well let the market take over
everything, and then why would we need to exist? Let us not have
democracy; let us just have the market running everything. I hope that
the next point was, &#147;And you will be required to work on
Sundays.&#148; We would then have seen whether that same 80 per cent.
put their hands up and said, &#147;Great, we can&#146;t wait to go
out and work on
Sundays.&#148;</p><p><a name="06052399000270">It is
pure hypocrisy for people to say that others should work on Sundays
when they are not prepared to work on Sundays themselves. We should say
to them, &#147;If you want it, you do it,&#148; because a lot of
people do not have that choice. They are forced into working Sundays,
and they are the people we should be
protecting.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000555">11.50
am</h5><p><a name="06052399000271"><b><a name="06052399000650">Shona
McIsaac (Cleethorpes) (Lab):</b> I congratulate my right hon.
Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on securing this debate
on Sunday trading. One matter that I want to focus on is work-life
balance, although I must say that I do not like that phrase and wish we
could find a better one to describe the subject. <i>[Interruption.]</i>
Yes, time off. That is an excellent idea. Another related matter is the
effect that these longer hours would have on families.</p><p><a name="06052399000272">As we have heard, there simply
is not a demand for longer shopping hours on Sundays. I hope the
Department of Trade and Industry takes not of that; I am speaking as a
former DTI Parliamentary Private Secretary. Survey after survey and
opinion poll after opinion poll says that that is not wanted. The
strongest opposition to longer hours comes from those who are concerned
about the likely effects on family relationships and community life,
and we have heard some excellent contributions demonstrating
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000273">Let us look at
the submission from Shirley Dex, professor of longitudinal social
research&#151;whatever that is&#151;at the university of
London&#146;s Institute of Education. She observes that recent
changes in the labour force</p><a name="06052399000529"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;have shown that very large
proportions of mothers and fathers, sometimes both, work on Saturdays,
Sundays or both weekend
days&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000274">and adds that that
proportion would inevitably increase as a result of further
deregulation.</p><p><a name="06052399000275">Professor
Dex also notes that a number of studies have found significant
dissatisfaction among parents working atypical times, with the amount
of time they have spent with their children being of serious concern to
them. That dissatisfaction was shared by children. We have talked about
parents today, but the effect on family life is also a worry for
children, who will not be able to see mum and dad as much as they would
like.</p><p><a name="06052399000276">The professor
concludes that the main benefit of working at weekends is additional
household income, but the majority of parents who work at weekends find
that that seriously interferes with their ability to have a family
life.</p><p><a name="06052399000277">However, in
this context we are not just talking about children. As has been
mentioned, there is also an impact on people with caring
responsibilities, such as for an elderly or disabled relative or
somebody who is terminally ill. They have even fewer options for
finding somebody to look after that relative than parents do for 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 421WH</b><br>their children. It is phenomenally difficult for people to get somebody
in to look after an elderly relative&#151;perhaps somebody suffering
from
Alzheimer&#146;s.</p><p><a name="06052399000278"><b><a name="06052399000651">Bob
Spink:</b> One in 10
adults.</p><p><a name="06052399000279"><b><a name="06052399000652">Shona
McIsaac:</b> As the hon. Gentleman says, the figure is one in
10 adults. We should be concerned about this. Rather than just wanting
a free-for-all, as some have said, we must be very careful
here.</p><p><a name="06052399000280">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Oxford, East said that he is proud to be a member
of USDAW, and its contribution to the debate has been praised. I am
also a member of USDAW, although it has been many years&#151;probably
decades&#151;since I worked in a shop. USDAW has analysed what its
members have said about Sunday deregulation. The evidence from people
working in shops on Sundays who are USDAW members is overwhelming: they
say that they would find it difficult to get babysitters and it would
have a dramatic impact on their family life.</p><p><a name="06052399000281">The DTI has as part of its
remit the subject of work-life balance, as well as trade and industry.
That is why the idea of deregulation on Sundays should be kicked into
the long grass, as my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North
(Helen Jones)
said.</p><p><a name="06052399000282">There will also
be an impact on convenience stores. We have heard about the
representations made by the Association of Convenience Stores. It, too,
says that deregulation will have a dramatic impact on communities. If
the larger shops are allowed to have a free-for-all, there will be
closures of smaller shops, which will have a devastating impact on
communities in many smaller villages, as well as in suburban and rural
areas, particularly where there is no public
transport.</p><p><a name="06052399000283">I heard
what the hon. Member for Isle of Wight(Mr. Turner) said about
possible increases in public transport, but in many rural areas in my
constituency there is simply none. People rely on small suburban and
village shops, but I make no bones about the fact that those will close
if there is deregulation. That will isolate people, particularly the
elderly.</p><p><a name="06052399000284">We have seen
the potential effect on families, people with caring responsibilities
and elderly people who perhaps cannot drive, or are no longer allowed
to, and who have no public transport available. Such people will be
isolated in their communities, which does not improve quality of life.
This move would be seriously detrimental to the quality of life in
Britain today. Yet again, I ask the Minister to kick it into the long
grass.</p><p><a name="06052399000285">Finally, I want
to touch on the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
(Mr. Drew), who was right in saying that Tesco has pulled out of the
campaign for total deregulation. On 10 May, the <i>Financial Times</i>
stated:</p><a name="06052399000530"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Tesco
has abruptly pulled out of the retailers&#146; campaign to deregulate
Sunday trading in a move that will undermine the lobby for longer
opening
hours.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000286">I
heard it mentioned that Tesco does not want total deregulation, and
perhaps wants partial deregulation or slightly longer hours, but I do
not care. It was one of the main backers of the campaign to deregulate,
and it has pulled out. That is a serious blow to the deregulation
campaign.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 422WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000287">We have looked at this issue as
a debate between convenience stores and supermarkets, but it is far
more than that. Do-it-yourself and furniture stores, clothes shops and
car showrooms are involved. This is not just about supermarkets; we are
examining the whole retail sector. Whatever the reason, Tesco pulled
out of backing the campaign. That is a blow to those who want
deregulation of Sunday trading, and, as Tesco says, &#147;Every
little
helps.&#148;</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000556">11.58

Some people want an extension, particularly the big retailers. I
exclude supermarkets for the moment, because I have something special
to say about them. It is estimated that garden centres lose &#163;45
million a year because of the restriction on Sunday opening hours, as
do DIY and high street shops and similar organisations.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 424WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000306">Let us consider the pattern of
consumers. The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) said
that only a small number of people shop on a Sunday. I shop on Sunday
with my daughter; it is a family activity and we do it together. I do
not know where everyone else is, but the nice shopping areas in the
high street such as clothes shops and shoe shops certainly seem to
trade very well given the present Sunday trading

and to those workers who are being constrained. A lot of time has been
given to them. However, some like to work on Sundays because they have
the opportunity to do so, despite disparaging remarks about students
having to pay off their student debts or people wanting to supplement
their pensions. As for the traditional family, if the primary carer
goes out to work on Sunday&#151;let us say that it is mum&#151;then
the children will be left with dad. That gives the children an
opportunity to have some quality time with the parent who remains at
home. <i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> I give that argument for what it

on Sundays, thus giving ourselves a chance to work
then?</p><p><a name="06052399000311"><b><a name="06052399000671">Lorely

community events on Sundays. It is not a great deal of fun. MPs work a
phenomenal number of hours. All hon. Members in the Chamber would
agree. </p><p><a name="06052399000314">With some
relief, I now move on to the arguments against. I shall talk first
about the idea that Sunday is just another day. Whatever one&#146;s
religious beliefs, there is something to be said for Sunday being one
day in the week that is slightly different. We have been talking about
family time. Families can also spend time shopping. Some families
choose to have their Sunday roast together, but patterns of family
behaviour change over time.</p><p><a name="06052399000315">My family used to have a
traditional Sunday lunch, but kids today often do not want to do that.
They want to do other things instead. We might watch a football match
together, but those professional footballers will 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 425WH</b><br>be working on a Sunday. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I note the
sedentary remark made by the hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen
Jones) that those footballers may well be reasonably well rewarded for
their endeavours. Their case is certainly nothing compared with that of
the shop workers to whom we referred earlier.</p><p><a name="06052399000316">My main
concern, which has been raised, is the idea of the Tescopoly&#151;the
monopoly of the supermarkets&#151;and the threat that large
supermarkets pose to small retail shops. A recent study discovered that
a third of trade for small shops occurs outside the hours of 10 and 4
on a Sunday. I note with great regret that 7,337 independent retailers
closed between 2000 and 2004. It is incumbent on hon. Members, who
certainly need no persuading in this room, to remember that employing
local people is important, as the creation of more local jobs means
that more money goes into the area, and such businesses source more
products locally and can choose whether to open or close. I will not
repeat the points about worker concerns over the erosion of premium
payments and the pressure to get them to work, because those points
have been made already.</p><p><a name="06052399000317">In conclusion, several comments
have been made about Tesco&#146;s withdrawal from the Deregulate
lobby group. My view, for what it is worth, is that perhaps Tesco has
its hands full with the Competition Commission. I do not know. The
recommendation or suggestion that we could perhaps raise hours from six
hours to eight on a Sunday would seem to me to be a reasonable
compromise and so, hopefully, something of that nature might meet with
approval from all sides of the House.</p><p><a name="06052399000318"><b><a name="06052399000674">Several

attempt to be reasonably
brief.</p><p><a name="06052399000321">As
we have discovered in the debate, Sunday trading is an issue about
which many people understandably feel strongly. It is a complex issue:
it appears on the surface to be about retail trading hours, but it is
also about employment rights. It would seem to be merely an economic
matter, but self-evidently it is fundamentally a social issue as well.
Sunday trading hours are a matter for families as consumers and as
workers.</p><p><a name="06052399000322">The
Government, as we know, have undertaken an initial consultation. It did
not start out as an initial consultation but it has suddenly become
that. They have now commissioned a cost-benefit analysis, which has
been discussed in this debate. Ministers have said so far that they are
considering the balance of views, but we have yet to hear a clear
statement of intent from Government. I hope that the Minister will
correct that 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 426WH</b><br>omission and put on record the direction in which the Government intend
to travel and, indeed, whether they intend to ensure that their Back
Benchers take that path with them in the form of a whipped vote. My
view is that the Government need to be very careful in ensuring that
they get a sensible balance between the needs of families, workers and
retailers, so that those who shop may choose to do so but those who
choose not to work are properly protected. There has to be a clear case
for change.</p><p><a name="06052399000323">The
Sunday Trading Act 1994, and its amendment through the Christmas Day
(Trading) Act 2004, were the result of a classic British parliamentary
compromise. The 1994 Act was designed to reflect the different concerns
of those who I have mentioned and of many Christian groups. It also
reflected the nature of retailing in society in 1994. Clearly society
and our lifestyles have changed since then. We live in a more mobile
and multicultural world. We are, whether we like it or not, a more
consumer-led society. The hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen
Jones) articulately expressed why that is often a bad thing in our
society. Whether we like it not, for many people in this nation,
shopping is an essential part of their leisure. We have seen the
arrival of the internet. We now face the peculiarity of being able to
shop online with Tesco at 6 o&#146;clock on a Sunday evening, but not
being able to go to its
supermarkets.</p>

<p><a name="06052399000324">There
have been notable changes in habits in relation to retailing. I am told
by experts in the industry that whereas 10 or 15 years ago, we used, on
the whole, to go to the supermarket once a week&#151;I say
&#147;we&#148;; it is usually my wife, I admit&#151;now the
pattern is to go there two or three times a week. Habits have changed
and the result is that the convenience sector is growing faster than
the traditional supermarket. That is why large retailers entered the
convenience sector a few years ago and are competing directly with the
independents. In many of our communities&#151;I am surprised that
this was not debated today&#151;the large retailers can circumvent
the Sunday trading laws because they own convenience stores that are
below the 3,000 sq ft threshold. It is important to remember that when
considering any change in the law that the Government may be thinking
about. In many of our towns, the Sunday trading laws are irrelevant to
the debate between large and small
retailers.</p><p><a name="06052399000325">It can be
argued&#151;many people do&#151;that in a free market it is up to
retailers to decide when they trade, based on consumer demand, and
there is much to be said for that argument, but it depends on the
market being free, open and fair. In recent years, many small shops
have closed. I think that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David
Lepper) said that about 2,000 such shops had closed in 2004. Many more
are threatened. There is a growing chorus of concern about the pricing
tactics employed by larger retailers when opening new
stores.</p><p><a name="06052399000326">The recent
decision by the Office of Fair Trading to refer the whole of the
grocery market to the Competition Commission confirmed that there are
clear problems in that market. The inquiry must be comprehensive. A
narrow inquiry that failed to address the allegations, whether the
issue was predatory pricing 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 427WH</b><br>or unfair contracts, would leave a shadow over the market. That would be
bad for consumers and for retailers, large and
small.</p><p><a name="06052399000327">Some people
have argued that with that significant inquiry under way, the
Government should delay their plans to change the Sunday trading hours.
What does the Minister think? Does he recognise that if he implements
legislation in the next year, before the commission has concluded its
work, that could adversely affect the very basis of the inquiry? I
suspect that the whole House would want to hear his
reply.</p><p><a name="06052399000328">The starting
point in this debate is the consumer. People should be free to make
their own choices. It is not the role of Government or politicians
generally to dictate where people should spend their leisure time; I
shall come to working time in a moment. For many people&#151;I say
this with some incredulity&#151;shopping is their favourite leisure
activity. As, perhaps, a typical middle-aged man, I find that prospect
truly ghastly, but who am I&#151;who are any of us&#151;to tell
people how they should spend their
time?</p><p><a name="06052399000329">The converse of
being free to shop on a Sunday is the right not to be forced to work on
that day. Although the current law works well in some respects, I have
much sympathy for what the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied
Workers and many of its members have said on that issue. We have to
recognise that there is informal pressure, but we also have to be clear
that legislation often cannot deal with such pressure. The Government
need to be careful to ensure that whatever they do, those who do not
want to work on a Sunday can make that choice without it unfairly
affecting their job or their
prospects.</p><p><a name="06052399000330">I shall now
deal briefly with the question of family life. Of course, Sunday
trading is a much broader question than just economics. I understand
and have much sympathy with the position of groups such as Keep Sunday
Special. To me, a practising Christian, Sunday is a special day,
different from the rest of the week. It is also right to say that in a
society in which often both parents work, the time that parents have
for each other and for their children is under incredible pressure. As
a society, we may be financially richer, but sadly the price is that we
are time poor. Of course in a multicultural society, Sunday is not
everyone&#146;s Sabbath; but the principle of a day of rest
nevertheless can and should be recognised if we are to give our
relationships the time that they need to grow.</p><p><a name="06052399000331">Sadly, the time for my speech
to grow is not with me. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response to the questions that have been
raised.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000558">12.20

in energy policy have been so resolved that I have time on my
hands&#151;there still seems to be some political interest in one or
two
issues&#151;</p><p><a name="06052399000336"><b><a name="06052399000680">Shona

way?</p><p><a name="06052399000337"><b><a name="06052399000681">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Perhaps later in my speech. I am talking about
Sunday trading because my right hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, who
also deals with investment and foreign affairs, is unable to respond to
the debate. He sends his apologies, but he cannot be here, sadly owing
to personal and family circumstances.
</p><p><a name="06052399000338">I do not accept the
caricature of the Department of Trade and Industry that the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) depicted. I know that it is now
fashionable for the historic party of capital to attack big business,
but to caricature us as a Department solely concerned with big business
is unfair. We are concerned with employment relationships, work-life
balance and consumer policy, as well as the needs of business. Before I
came to the House I directed a body called the Family Policy Studies
Centre, so I am aware of the need to take account of the impact of
proposed legislation on the diversity of family life. Also, when I look
at my red boxes on a Sunday and compare them with the grass uncut, the
young cabbages unplanted and so on, I have some sympathy with the idea
of keeping Sunday special.</p><p><a name="06052399000339">The present
position is that the Government are reviewing the Sunday trading laws
in England and Wales. We welcome an open debate on the issue, and
today&#146;s debate has been an important contribution to that. Since
the review of Sunday trading was announced last November, we have asked
for and received a range of evidence in response to our informal
consultation. We also commissioned the cost-benefit analysis, which is
now available on the DTI website. However, in case there is any
misunderstanding, we also made it clear on our website that we would
welcome further relevant evidence or views&#151;from consumers,
religious groups, employees and businesses&#151;not only on the
economic case, but on all aspects of further liberalisation. A
cost-benefit analysis is a contribution to the process, but it can only
be partial.</p><p><a name="06052399000340">Two weeks
ago we held a stakeholder conference to give people the chance to
debate the cost-benefit analysis and have their say on all aspects of
Sunday trading. We have made it clear that if we decide to proceed with
the review, there will be a further period of formal consultation on
any change. We want our consumer and labour policies to be well
informed, although we recognise that there will never be an overall
consensus on such a controversial issue.</p><p><a name="06052399000341">The current Sunday trading laws
were established12 years ago. The Sunday Trading Act 1994
restricts large shops in England and Wales from opening for more than
six hours between 10 and 6, and prevents them from opening at all on
Easter Sunday. The fact that the legislation has been in place for 12
years does not necessarily mean that it is wrong, but it is sensible
for us to look at it again.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 429WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000342">We know from the responses to
our informal consultation that there is a wide range of opinions on all
sides of the debate and that some are very strongly held. Many of those
views have been expressed today. This debate forms part of the ongoing
consultation, and all views expressed will be taken into account. To
illustrate the extent to which the Government have been listening, I
will summarise the range of perspectives that has been put
forward.</p><p><a name="06052399000343">Some look at
the question purely from a consumer perspective and argue that it
should be business that decides when shops should open, not the
Government, and that shops should be free to respond to the needs of
their customers. The Government often get accused of over-regulating
business, and there are those who feel that it is not the
Government&#146;s place to regulate at all in this
area.</p><p><a name="06052399000344">Others feel
strongly that there is more at stake than mere consumption and they
would like to see Sunday protected as a day of rest: a quieter day when
families can spend time together. We must also respect the position of
those Christian groups who, because of their deeply held religious
beliefs, feel that shops should not open at all on a Sunday, or should
certainly not open for longer than they do under current
law.</p><p><a name="06052399000345">Others focus on
the impact of extending Sunday opening on employees, and we have heard
that argument today, not least from my right hon. Friend the Member for
Oxford, East. Some employees value the chance to work on Sundays, but
others feel that Sunday opening has made their working life and family
life more difficult. There are those who argue that the undertaking of
work by parents on weekends can have an adverse impact on children and
knock-on consequences for society.</p><p><a name="06052399000346">I welcome the comments of those
who reminded us that in a modern society with an ageing population, we
are not just talking about the care of children, but the responsibility
that many adults take on for the care of elderly relatives or grown-up
children with disabilities. I had a private Member&#146;s Bill that
dealt with this subject, which became the Carers (Recognition &amp;
Services) Act 1995. Another important perspective that we have heard
much about is the impact of further liberalisation on small
shops.</p><p><a name="06052399000347">Where are we?
Those, and all the other views that have been expressed, have to be
given proper consideration. My right hon. Friends, the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Trade are considering
carefully all the views and evidence they have received so
far.</p><p><a name="06052399000348"><b><a name="06052399000682">Shona

way?</p><p><a name="06052399000349"><b><a name="06052399000683">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Perhaps a little later. In addition, my right hon.
Friends are also considering the cost-benefit analysis, which examines
the economic impact of extending Sunday shopping hours for large shops.
We welcome this report as a key contribution to the debate, alongside
the views and evidence we have 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 430WH</b><br>received from others. After hearing those views, if the Government feel
that any change to the status quo is to be considered, there will be a
formal consultation.</p><p><a name="06052399000350"><b><a name="06052399000684">Several

question, &#147;Where are we?&#148; I have listened carefully to

he tell us when he thinks our right hon. Friends the Secretary of State
and the Minister of Trade will take a decision on whether they need to
proceed to a formal review, or whether&#151;in accordance with the
overwhelming view expressed here and in the country&#151;the matter
should be
left?</p><p><a name="06052399000353"><b><a name="06052399000687">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> I am bound to say that we have not yet reached a
conclusion about what should happen to Sunday shopping hours. No
decision will be taken until we have assessed all the evidence,
including the views expressed today. We want to make a decision based
on all the information and informed by all perspectives on this topic.
We want all interested parties to have a say about whether further or
partial liberalisation&#151;or no change&#151;is the right way
forward. In particular, we need to consider carefully whether large
shops should be allowed to open on Easter Sunday. We have been told
that shop workers either are not aware of their legal right to opt out
of Sunday working, or do not feel that they can use it, and we want to
understand that issue better.</p><p><a name="06052399000354">We need to consider the
evidence on the wider social issues that have been identified, which
are as relevant as economic issues to decisions on Sunday trading. I am
afraid that I cannot give my right hon. Friend a specific date, but I
am able to give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona
McIsaac), if she is still eager to
intervene.</p><p><a name="06052399000355"><b><a name="06052399000688">Shona
McIsaac:</b> The Minister mentioned the Ministers in his
Department who will consider all the views expressed in the debate. As
Minister for Energy, what impact does he think that deregulation will
have on energy consumption in this
country?</p><p><a name="06052399000356"><b><a name="06052399000689">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> It probably depends how much energy people expend
on devising ingenious questions when they are at home on a Sunday. Let
me make it clear that the special protection allowing shop workers to
choose not to work on Sundays is here to stay, It is important to
stress that. I cannot be more specific about time scales, but I would
like to repeat that we have had a useful debate. I am pleased to have
been able to stand in for my ministerial colleague and to get into a
controversial issue at long last. I thank my right hon. Friend the
Member for Oxford, East for giving me the opportunity to bring my mind
to bear on the
subject.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 431WH</b><br>

(Herefordshire)</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000559">12.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06052399000357"><b><a name="06052399000690">Mr.
Paul Keetch (Hereford) (LD):</b> I am delighted to have
secured this important debate for my constituents and delighted that
the Minister is here to answer some of the questions that I shall put
to her.</p><p><a name="06052399000358">It is evident
that the questions surrounding the availability of cancer care and
drugs are common to many primary care trusts in England. The lack of
vital services, medical personnel and new technology make news
headlines almost every day. However, it is the availability of new
life-saving drugs, such as Velcade for multiple myeloma and Herceptin
for breast cancer, and the provision of acute radiotherapy care, that
concerns my Hereford constituents
most.</p><p><a name="06052399000359">Herefordshire
PCT has an excellent reputation as a cancer service provider. It is one
of only 4 per cent. of PCTs in the UK that have achieved a three-star
rating for two years running in the Healthcare Commission&#146;s
assessment of trust performances. However, the notion of a cancer drugs
postcode lottery and the need to travel excessive distances to obtain
vital care is fuelling a great deal of anxiety among my
constituents.</p><p><a name="06052399000360">Cancer
is one of the biggest killers in the UK, and accounts for a quarter of
all deaths. One in three people has the prospect of being diagnosed
with cancer at some stage of their life, so it is understandable that
people are concerned when they believe that they are being denied the
right to critical care and life-saving drugs just because they do not
live in the right area. Surely everyone should have an equal right to
life and
treatment.</p><p><a name="06052399000361">Under the
current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence, both Herceptin and Velcade are still waiting to be agreed
as suitable for cancer sufferers in England. Yet in Wales and Scotland
they were approved more than a year ago. Consequently, Welsh patients
being treated in Hereford county hospital and, indeed, other English
hospitals along the Welsh border, automatically receive those drugs.
However, Herefordshire patients being treated at the same hospital do
not always receive them. I am delighted that Welsh patients receive the
drugs, but the essential thrust of my debate is to ask when the
Government and NICE will stop the postcode
lottery.</p><p><a name="06052399000362">The
county hospital in Hereford is one of the finest hospitals in the
region and I was delighted when it opened. I pay tribute to the Labour
Government for providing that hospital. We have some of the most
dedicated doctors and nurses in the country&#151;a plethora of
talent&#151;who cater for approximately 200,000 patients and provide
acute care for those in Herefordshire, Powys and the bordering areas of
Gwent, Shropshire and Worcestershire. The hospital provides essential
health care&#151;not only accident and emergency care but vital
cancer care.</p><p><a name="06052399000363">Between
2004 and 2005, there were more than 2,000 finished consultant episodes
at the county hospital and 96.2 per cent. of cancer patients were
treated within31 days; that is a very good record. Only
recently it was announced that my constituents will be blessed with a
new &#163;3.4 million cancer care unit, partly to be funded by the
national charity Macmillan Cancer Support. The remainder of the funding
will be provided by the 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 432WH</b><br>hospital trust. Indeed, I shall shortly attend the launch of the
Macmillan appeal to raise its &#163;1.5 million towards the cost of
the unit. The new facility will provide first-class chemotherapy care
for the county, and I of course welcome that investment in cancer
provision. However, much more still needs to be
done.</p><p><a name="06052399000364">The
nearest hospitals to Herefordshire offering full oncology treatment are
in Cheltenham and Birmingham. Many patients from the Herefordshire
catchment area must travel to the Cheltenham general hospital for
radiotherapy treatment. For some that is a 150-mile round trip in
difficult circumstances. Many of the patients are old and frail and
have little support at that most trying of times. On top of the mental
anguish and distress to which the disease subjects them, they must
undergo harrowing journeys because of the current unavailability of
radiotherapy facilities in Herefordshire. My constituents have written
to the Prime Minister on that very issue, and a local newspaper, the
<i>Hereford Times</i>, has carried a campaign to cut the cancer miles
misery which has attracted huge local
support.</p><p><a name="06052399000365">The 3
Counties cancer care network, which is responsible for providing acute
services in Gloucester, Herefordshire and south Worcestershire, is
looking to develop a radiotherapy service in the next few years, but
many people in my county believe that that is too late. As anyone who
has come into contact with cancer sufferers will confirm, it is a
disease that can break hearts as well as bodies, and time is of the
essence. It has come to my attention that cancer sufferers in
Herefordshire are cutting their treatment short because they can no
longer cope with the journeys. Frankly, that is a disgrace in a country
whose health service was once the envy of the world.</p><p><a name="06052399000366">Macmillan Cancer Support claims
that many patients in outlying rural areas are facing &#147;grossly
unfair&#148; journeys of up to 200 miles. I know that my neighbour,
my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), is
campaigning about that, as his constituents also suffer. He wanted to
be present for this debate, but he is attending to other parliamentary
business. When will the Government begin to address the shortage of
cancer care provision before it is too late for many of my
constituents?</p><p><a name="06052399000367">Not only
are many cancer sufferers in Herefordshire forced to travel hundreds of
miles for vital treatment, they are denied life-saving cancer drugs. I
have been contacted by constituents who are suffering from multiple
myeloma and just cannot understand why NICE is still appraising
Velcade, the cancer drug to treat myeloma. Velcade was granted a
licence in spring 2004, so will the Minister explain why its appraisal
is taking so long?</p><p><a name="06052399000368">The All Wales Medicines
Strategy Group, the Welsh version of NICE, appraised and approved
Velcade in June 2005 and Welsh patients can now receive it on the NHS.
You will be pleased to hear, Miss Begg, that the drug has also been
approved by the Scottish Medicines Consortium and is available in
Scotland. So why is it not yet available on the NHS to my constituents
in Herefordshire?</p><p><a name="06052399000369">It is
expected that Velcade will not receive guidance from NICE until
September 2006, despite the fact that the Government issued a statement
in November 2005 saying that it and other life-saving cancer drugs
would be part of a new rapid process for accessing drugs&#151;the 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 433WH</b><br>so-called fast-tracking. When I asked the then Health Minster, the right
hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy), a parliamentary
question about that, she replied that
the</p><a name="06052399000531"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;proposed
changes to enable the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
to produce faster guidance on life-saving drugs would go ahead
immediately."&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 2 December 2005; Vol.
440, c. 854W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000370">The former
Minister said that that system would benefit thousands of patients,
especially those with life-threatening conditions, and would provide
greater certainty about the provision of new treatments, yet we are now
six months down the line and it is more than three years since the drug
was licensed, but English patients are still waiting.</p><p><a name="06052399000371">In that time, many thousands of
people have been diagnosed with myeloma, yet their pleas have fallen on
deaf ears. Sufferers cannot wait until the end of the year to start
receiving the drug. Myeloma is a terminal disease and more than one
third of patients die within a year of diagnosis. Between 1998 and 2001
the relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma
in England was 25.6 per cent. That is worrying and must be addressed
now.</p><p><a name="06052399000372">Of course the
NHS is not obliged to fund the provision of a drug until NICE issues
guidance, but cancer sufferers do not have time to wait. According to
the Department of Health, PCTs are free to use treatments that have
been licensed, even if they have not received NICE approval, and
Ministers have repeatedly stated that whether funding is provided for
treatment is a matter for local decision making. However, in practice,
hospital bosses and local clinicians are reluctant to provide the drugs
because of financial constraints.</p><p><a name="06052399000373">Herceptin is another
life-saving drug that is being denied to cancer sufferers, although in
recent weeks one patient has successfully won a High Court appeal to be
prescribed Herceptin by her local PCT. I am extremely pleased for the
lady involved, who fought a very dignified campaign, but many thousands
of breast cancer sufferers are still being denied Herceptin for
early-stage breast cancer. No doubt that court ruling will have huge
complications and we must wait to see what the result will be, but it
highlights the fact that we are still witnessing postcode prescribing
rather than local decision making.</p><p><a name="06052399000374">In Herefordshire, that is a
sensitive issue. We are witnessing breast cancer sufferers in Wales
being prescribed Herceptin free of charge&#151;as with
Velcade&#151;because the drug is funded by Welsh local heath boards,
even if patients are treated in England at Hereford county hospital.
However, women in the early stages of breast cancer who live in England
and who are treated at the same hospital must pay between
&#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000 a year because the local trust will
not always foot the bill. Again, NICE has said that it will fast-track
the appraisal when the licence has been granted&#151;supposedly in
July&#151;but that does not alter the fact that many PCTs cannot
afford the new drugs and are avoiding the issue.</p><p><a name="06052399000375">The
Government have said that PCTs need to ensure that they allocate
sufficient resources to meet their local contribution to tackling
cancer care, and we would all agree with that. However, given that one
in four NHS trusts failed to balance their books in 2004-05, leaving
the NHS with a deficit of &#163;250 million, how on earth 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 434WH</b><br>can the Government expect the trusts to fund the new cancer facilities
and drugs? Many PCTs believe that the Government are passing the buck
to them. The Government also expect PCTs and hospital trusts not only
to keep within their budgets&#151;again, I do not disagree&#151;but
to be able to dispense the drugs at higher cost from existing funds.
The trusts simply cannot afford it.</p><p><a name="06052399000376">In conclusion, when will the
Minister&#146;s Department tackle this grossly unfair postcode
lottery, so that everyone has an equal right to life and treatment?
When will the new drugs be available to my constituents? When will the
Government begin to address the problem of the harrowing journeys that
my constituents have to make to receive radiotherapy and other vital
cancer care? My constituents and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
reply.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000560">12.41

Minister of State, Department of Health(Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Hereford
(Mr. Keetch) on securing this debate. He has set out his and his
constituents&#146; concerns clearly. However, I hope he accepts that
cancer has remained a key priority for the Government and that there
has been real progress in recent years. For example, cancer mortality
rates have fallen; more than 99 per cent. of patients with suspected
cancer are now seen by a specialist within two weeks of being referred
by their general practitioner, up from 63 per cent. in 1997; the number
of cancer specialists has increased by 42 per cent.; and since 2000,
more than 1,200 items of equipment have been delivered to diagnose and
treat cancer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that those
improvements have been made.</p><p><a name="06052399000378">However, cancer continues to
remain a priority, because there is a long way to go before we have a
perfect system. Whether, as medical technology changes, there can ever
be a perfect system is debatable, but the Government have made a real
commitment to investing in and improving cancer
services.</p><p><a name="06052399000379"><b><a name="06052399000692">Mr.
Keetch:</b> I should like to put on record
my acknowledgement that, as I have said publicly in Herefordshire,
under recent Labour Governments there has been a massive increase in
investment for health care provision in the county. I welcome that; I
am only sorry that the hon. Member for Leominster (Bill
Wiggin)&#151;the other MP with a Herefordshire constituency&#151;is
not here to hear me say
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000380"><b><a name="06052399000693">Mr.

Winterton:</b> Yes. I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Hereford for his comments.</p><p><a name="06052399000382">Quite rightly, the hon.
Gentleman wanted to highlight the provision of cancer services for the
residents of Herefordshire; he highlighted some of the difficulties
that they experience. I join him in congratulating all the staff who
work in local cancer care services in his constituency, because they
have achieved a number of things at a local level&#151;not least the
fact that Hereford county hospital is one of the top-performing
hospitals in England in respect of cancer treatment.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 435WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000383">I turn to some
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific points. He referred at length
to the drugs Herceptin and Velcade. I shall give a little background,
of which I am sure he is aware. While NICE is developing guidance,
there is no restriction on the prescribing of those drugs within their
licensed indications. During that time, decisions remain for local
determination, but the Department has made it clear that funding for
newly licensed treatments should not be withheld because NICE guidance
is unavailable. As the hon. Gentleman said, NICE is assessing Herceptin
and Velcade under its new single-technology assessment, which has been
specifically designed to meet some of the concerns about the time that
it sometimes takes to carry out appraisals. Velcade is one of the first
five drugs to be appraised using the new process, and we expect
guidance shortly.</p><p><a name="06052399000384">As
regards the use of Herceptin and Velcade in Herefordshire, my officials
have checked again with Herefordshire PCT. We have been assured that no
patients from Herefordshire have been refused treatment with Herceptin
or Velcade when it was recommended by an NHS clinician. The key, of
course, is that the treatment must be recommended by an NHS
clinician&#151;that is absolutely right, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman agrees. I hope that that addresses some of the particular
issues about those two
drugs.</p><p><a name="06052399000385">More
generally, we want treatment for cancer patients in Herefordshire to be
delivered quickly. Obviously, that is a key condition for successful
outcomes, and the information that we have shows that treatment is, by
and large, delivered quickly. At the same time, I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concern about the distance that some of his
constituents must travel to receive
treatment.</p><p><a name="06052399000386">Let me
return to the issue of cancer networks, to which the hon. Gentleman
referred. We have set up cancer networks&#151;the first were set up
about 10 or12 years ago&#151;to bring together all the
bodies in an area that are responsible for planning and developing
cancer service strategies, and there were good reasons for doing that.
We wanted to make sure that clinicians, the NHS, patients organisations
and other stakeholders were looking at overall provision to ensure that
it was planned carefully, particularly where specialist treatment might
be needed. The sad truth, particularly as regards specialist treatment,
was that a proper view was not taken of how to maximise the use of
individuals&#146; and clinicians&#146; skills, so it was important
to have a view from a wider area than just one PCT. Networks therefore
play a crucial role in delivering cancer services and they have played
a major part in delivering some of the improvements that we have
seen.</p><p><a name="06052399000387">Herefordshire,
together with Gloucestershire and south Worcestershire, is part of the
3 Counties cancer network, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He also
mentioned the rural nature of the area that he represents and the fact
that the geographical challenges can be quite significant when it comes
to providing specialist health services. As he said, the 3 Counties
cancer network specialist regional services are provided by the
Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust at the Cheltenham
oncology centre. Currently, patients from Herefordshire who need
radiotherapy and in-patient chemotherapy are treated in
Cheltenham.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 436WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000388">I accept that the distances for
Herefordshire patients are large, and for those living on the
Herefordshire-Wales border they are greater still. However, the hon.
Gentleman will agree that it is important that issues of patient safety
are paramount in providing specialist services such as those provided
at Cheltenham. It is important that there are sufficient numbers of
patients to make sure that staff can maintain and develop their
specialist skills. As I said, in rural areas that brings significant
challenges, but the 3 Counties cancer network is looking into how to
make sure that it meets those
challenges.</p><p><a name="06052399000389">As I
understand it, some patients at Cheltenham will require in-patient
treatment, and it is important that there is an oncologist on hand to
monitor those in-patients when they have their chemotherapy. That is
one reason why it is important for the services to be in a specialist
centre. There has been an increase in the levels of chemotherapy
carried out, and the number of day-case sessions of chemotherapy at
Hereford county hospital has increased from about 1,800 in 2003-04 to
about 2,800 this year. The cancer network is looking at how that
progress can be built on.</p><p><a name="06052399000390">The Hereford Hospitals NHS
Trust, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, has announced that it will
work with Macmillan Cancer Support to build a new cancer unit at the
county hospital to replace the Charles Renton unit. The hon. Gentleman
is going to the launch of the appeal, which I am sure will be very
welcome. I understand that it will be a state-of-the-art unit costing
&#163;3.4 million&#151;&#163;2.4 million of which will come from
Macmillan, with the trust providing the balance. That will
significantly increase the capacity for patients to receive
chemotherapy in Hereford. I understand that when the centre is
completed, it will have the capacity to provide some 4,500 sessions of
day-case chemotherapy each year. That is sufficient capacity for all
Herefordshire patients to be treated locally.</p><p><a name="06052399000391">In-patient chemotherapy will
continue to be provided in Cheltenham, as I said, because specialist
staff are required&#151;for example, to support a consultant
oncologist&#151;to monitor patients for up to 24 hours after
receiving the treatment. The hon. Gentleman referred to radiotherapy.
The network currently has four linear accelerators and two simulators
at the Cheltenham oncology centre. That is the only radiotherapy
service in the network at present, and all patients requiring
radiotherapy are treated in
Cheltenham.</p><p><a name="06052399000392">The hon.
Gentleman raised the sensitive issue of patients not travelling to
receive radiotherapy because of the distances. I understand that there
are some patients who had a terminal diagnosis and who have chosen not
to travel, essentially as a quality-of-life decision. However, the PCT
has assured us that there is no evidence of patients who are receiving
curative radiotherapy choosing not to travel. Obviously, this is very
difficult, and I will come on to what else is being done in terms of
increasing the provision of radiotherapy locally.</p><p><a name="06052399000393">Recommendations on these issues
have come from the Royal College of Radiologists. As a result, the
number of linear accelerators in the network will be increased to seven
by 2010-11. The network is supporting plans to increase the linear
accelerator 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 437WH</b><br>complement at Cheltenham to five by 2007-08. Beyond that, it has asked
interested trusts to put forward proposals for developing the next
round of linear accelerator provision in 2009-10. All three
trusts&#151;those based in Cheltenham, Worcester and
Hereford&#151;have expressed an interest in developing these
services. The network has produced draft criteria for assessing the
options; access is included as a criterion alongside issues such as
safety, staffing and cost.</p><p><a name="06052399000394"><b><a name="06052399000695">Mr.
Keetch:</b> I hope that access is one of the key criteria,
because if the 3 Counties cancer network were to develop yet more
centralised operations at Cheltenham that would be very unfortunate,
not only for my constituents but for those from Powys and Brecon who
also come across. Access for people suffering from cancer is a key
criterion, and I hope that the Minister will ensure that it is one of
the unit&#146;s principal
criteria.</p><p><a name="06052399000395"><b><a name="06052399000696">Ms
Winterton:</b> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman looks at the
draft criteria that the network has produced just to reassure himself.
I have certainly been assured that those criteria include access, but
he might like to check that, and I shall make sure his comments on this
matter are passed
back.</p><p><a name="06052399000396">I am informed
that the current clinical view is that a linked satellite of the
Cheltenham service could be viable in either Hereford or Worcester, but
I must stress that no decision has been made on the final location of
the two additional linear accelerators, one of which will replace one
of the older machines at Cheltenham. The three trusts have all been
invited to submit their proposals to the network board and a decision,
which will be based on the criteria, is likely to be made in spring
2007.</p><p><a name="06052399000397">In
conclusion, I reiterate that I am sure that the3 Counties
cancer network is aware of the points about which the hon. Gentleman
and his constituents are concerned. It is planning future development
of radiotherapy services across Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and
south Worcestershire. It is aware of the difficulty that some of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents are encountering in travelling to
the service in Cheltenham, and access is one of the criteria being
considered in the development of those services. There have been
improvements in recent years, but we obviously always need to ensure
that the services are of the highest quality. It is what the public
want, and I am sure we would all agree that it is what our constituents
deserve.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 438WH</b><br>

1993</h3><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000561">12.59
pm</h5><p><a name="06052399000398"><b><a name="06052399000697">Hywel
Williams (Caernarfon) (PC):</b> I am pleased to have this
opportunity to discuss the operation of the Welsh Language Act
1993.</p><p><a name="06052399000399">I shall not be
calling for a new Welsh Language Act, as hon. Members might have
expected. People in Wales might be mystified by that, but the
convention in these debates is that one does not call for new
legislation&#151;there are other opportunities to do that. However,
this is a timely debate given the forthcoming national rally organised
by Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, the Welsh language society, which will
be held in Aberystwyth on 10 June and will call for a new Welsh
Language Act.</p><p><a name="06052399000400">When
discussing Welsh language provision there is a great temptation to list
various outrageous cases where people have been denied a service by the
public sector. There is a danger of an extended whinge&#151;during
the past 30 years many cases have led to people such as myself
whingeing extensively&#151;and of our losing sight of the principal
fault with the 1993 Act as a permanent solution to the languages
question in Wales. That principal fault is inequality, which is written
into the Act.</p><p><a name="06052399000401">Of
course, the 1993 Act is concerned with treating Welsh and English on an
equal basis. That equality is qualified in the Act by its being subject
to being &#147;reasonably practicable&#148; and &#147;appropriate
in the circumstances&#148;. So, Welsh and English are not wholly
equal; the equality is a qualified one. I have a difficulty with
qualified equality as a concept; in my book, we are all equal or we are
not. The Act seems to echo Orwell&#146;s point in &#147;Animal
Farm&#148;:</p><a name="06052399000532"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;All animals are equal
but some animals are more equal than
others.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000402">By now, it is
abundantly clear that, even following the 1993 Act, Welsh and English
are not even treated on the basis of that qualified equality. My
argument runs contrary to that treatment: Welsh and English are equal,
should be treated as such and Welsh speakers should have equal rights
to use either language, or both, as they see fit. That is my basic
argument; it is one of equality.</p><p><a name="06052399000403">Cutting across the detail of
individual cases, although I shall refer to such a case later, the crux
of the argument is about equality. I would like to make it clear that
the primary response that I am seeking from the Under-Secretary of
State is an explanation of the Government&#146;s stance on the
fundamental inequality that Welsh speakers face: the lack of a positive
right to use Welsh equal to the right to use English, which is assumed
without thought.</p><p><a name="06052399000404">We
are talking about a fundamental principle, and as such, however we
organise and develop it in the future, it must be established and we
must see it as a process to an end point. I accept that we will not
achieve that overnight, in months or perhaps in years, but we must
insist on the process towards equality. I want to hear the
Government&#146;s response to my call for nothing less than the full
emancipation of the Welsh language and of the individuals and
communities that speak it.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 439WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000405">We are not just considering my
right and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy
(Mr. Llwyd) as Welsh speakers to use the language. We must also realise
that communities in Wales use Welsh as the primary social mode of
discussion; using Welsh is the way we talk to each other in some
communities. There are not just individual rights, but community
rights.</p><p><a name="06052399000406">I said that I
would not whinge about cases, not that they are scarce. Of course,
there is a fine tradition of using cases to drive through progressive
legislation.My illustrious predecessor as Member for
Caernarfon, David Lloyd George, used the famous achos claddu
Llanfrothen&#151;the Llanfrothen burial case where nonconformists
were not allowed to bury their departed in the graveyard in
Llanfrothen&#151;as a battering ram that eventually led to the
disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales. I am not going to
list a lot of cases, but I will base my arguments about equality on a
case concerning British Gas Business that neatly encompasses some of
the principles. I refer hon. Members to my early-day motion 2185 on
this matter.</p><p><a name="06052399000407">First, I
would like to quote briefly from letters sent to me by British Gas
Business. Hon. Members will note that I quote from the original and in
English, for even though I usually correspond with the company in
Welsh&#151;not in this case, as it happens&#151;it has replied to
me in English. I will begin with a letter entitled in large letters
&#147;We won&#146;t be able to send your bills in Welsh
anymore&#148;.</p><p><a name="06052399000408">I
would like the Chamber to note that British Gas, as a former public
utility, has been providing a Welsh language service to both its
private and business customers for a large number of years, as have
other former public utilities. I have here some material sent to me the
other day that includes a bill from Welsh Water, which is now a private
company. It is entirely bilingual, although English is first and Welsh
second. I can access the material in Welsh and English as I want. I
also have some leaflets, which are also bilingual. That is an example
of a former public utility, which is now a private company, that finds
no difficulty in corresponding with me in Welsh, yet British Gas
Business tells me that it will not be able to send me my bills in Welsh
any more.</p><p><a name="06052399000409">Irrespective of that case,
British Gas assures me that it will continue to use Welsh in
correspondence with its private domestic customers. However, it is a
case of a service withdrawn, a service cut and a service lost. I wonder
how you would respond, Miss Begg, if you were to receive a letter from
such a utility saying that it was unable to send you your bills in
English any more. I was surprised, shocked and dismayed at the
cut.</p><p><a name="06052399000410">In the first
letter that I received, the customer manager at British Gas Business
said that it wanted to
</p><a name="06052399000533"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;make sure we&#146;re
investing our money in the right
places&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000411">That is the
driver behind the change. I do not know what the savings from cutting
the Welsh language service will be, but Centrica, the parent company,
made a profit last year of &#163;1.5 billion, so it is not short of a
shilling or two to put in the meter. In 2005, British Gas Business made
a profit of &#163;77 million. It is clearly searching for cuts and to
spend its money in the best way, but it has a little in its back
pocket.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 440WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000412">The customer service manager
went on to say that British Gas Business is withdrawing the Welsh
service</p><a name="06052399000534"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;so that we can
provide all our customers with outstanding customer
service&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000413">Clearly, that
is not &#147;all our customers&#148;&#151;my constituents and I
count as customers. I cannot see how British Gas can rationalise the
step by saying that it is serving all its customers.</p><p><a name="06052399000414">A further explanation was
offered in a further letter, which stated
that</p><a name="06052399000535"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the reason we have
taken this decision is that British Gas Business customers are being
migrated to a new billing
platform.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000415">I could say
that British Gas Business should not only provide a service in Welsh,
but that it would be good if it provided one in English as well.
Perhaps it is unfair to tease British Gas any further. The point is
that we have a former public utility that is now in the private sector
and it is not subject to the principles of language planning. That is
as envisaged in the 1993 Act, from which the private sector was
excluded. The Act is concerned primarily with the public sector and, by
voluntary agreements, with the voluntary and private
sectors.</p><p><a name="06052399000416"><b><a name="06052399000698">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):</b> I remind my
hon. Friend that in 1992, when we were discussing the 1993 Act in
Standing Committee&#151;the Under-Secretary was also a member of the
Committee, and I am sure that he and I agreed on this&#151;we said
that the private sector needed to be included. However, it was not
included, and we are still suffering from that
mistake.</p><p><a name="06052399000417"><b><a name="06052399000699">Hywel
Williams:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that. I do not wish
to labour the matter, because the First Minister in Cardiff said at the
time that he would ensure in future that we had a proper Welsh language
Act.</p><p><a name="06052399000418">The private
sector was excluded under the 1993 Act. That sector includes not only
British Gas but the other former public utilities and large private
sector businesses&#151;unless they have entered into a voluntary
agreement with the Welsh Language Board. I hardly need say that
voluntary means just that. British Gas concludes its most recent letter
with this
statement:</p><a name="06052399000536"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
may be the case that further legislation compelling energy suppliers to
provide a fully bilingual service to business customers is necessary to
reverse this
decision.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06052399000419">That plainly
says that British Gas will act if forced to. Let us be clear: it will
provide a Welsh service only if the law compels it to do so. That is
the stance of the self-proclaimed No. 1 supplier of energy to the
commercial sector in Britain, so it will affect a large number of
people.</p><p><a name="06052399000420">I said that I
would not tease British Gas any further, but its attitude is perfectly
explicable given the current Act. The Welsh language may count for
something to its private customers, but it has no place in the real
world of business, as in the Act&#151;or apparently so. However, many
businesses in my constituency and throughout Wales now operate through
the medium of Welsh. How could they access business services if every
other company took the same view as British
Gas?</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 441WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000421"><b><a name="06052399000700">Mr.
Dan Rogerson (North Cornwall) (LD):</b> I congratulate the
hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. Does he agree that that point
may be a disincentive to people whose first language is Welsh who are
considering starting a business&#151;an obstacle in the way of some
who wish to form a new small business, particularly in the communities
to which he referred where Welsh is the primary medium of
communication?</p><p><a name="06052399000422"><b><a name="06052399000701">Hywel
Williams:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. There are
companies in my constituency that would not dream of operating through
the medium of English. Welsh is their internal language and it is the
language of their customers. Why should they operate in English? They
should operate in English only if they have to, because of the attitude
of other businesses. That is why the 1993 Act is deficient. It says
nothing about the large parts of the world in which Welsh speakers
live.</p><p><a name="06052399000423">I am sure that
the Under-Secretary will welcome the fact that many companies now
operate through the medium of Welsh. However, he cannot welcome that
end unless he wills the means, and in this case the means are being
denied. I have no doubt that if British Gas, as a responsible employer,
faced a case of discrimination on the basis of gender, disability race
or even age, it would act, but the language rights of Welsh speakers
and Welsh-speaking communities are somehow seen to be different in this
case. As I said, that can be traced back to the deficiency of the 1993
Act.</p><p><a name="06052399000424">There is a long
history of legislation on the Welsh language, and that deficiency runs
throughout. The Acts of Union barred anyone who chose to speak Welsh
from holding public office; the aim was to expiate &#147;sinister
usages and practices", one of which was the speaking of Welsh. As a
younger man, I was rather pleased to have the sinister usage and
practice of speaking Welsh, but I am now slightly wiser.</p><p><a name="06052399000425">Among 20th century legislation,
we had the Welsh Courts Act 1942 and the Welsh Language Act 1967. The
latter bought in the concept of equal validity, and states explicitly
that where there is a discrepancy between English and Welsh texts, the
&#147;English shall prevail&#148;. If the Welsh text says that so
and so is four and the English text says that it is five, it must be
five. Such is the idiocy of that provision. We then come to the 1993
Act, with its qualification of
equality.</p><p><a name="06052399000426">Even the
most determined radical would concede that there has been a good deal
of progress&#151;but at what a slow pace. Each change has been won
from a grudging Government after much hardship, and I am afraid that
each change has been deficient, but I believe that we are at the start
of a new era for the Welsh language. I am sure that the Under-Secretary
will agree that the demography is encouraging, with more and younger
Welsh speakers. The bulge is at the young end of the population, not
the old. The language is now heard on the streets of Cardiff and
Newport as well as Caernarfon and Aberystwyth.</p><p><a name="06052399000427">In those
urban communities, however, Welsh is not the common language of social
life. The Welsh speaker in Cardiff would have to be pretty assertive to
demand a public service in Welsh&#151;such as education, where
recently the bungling local authority coupled a growth in Welsh
language provision with the closing of English-medium 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 442WH</b><br>schools, and effectively scuppered the plan. There are of course many
enterprises that are private but which provide public services, most
obviously in health and social services. The world has
changed.</p><p><a name="06052399000428">Furthermore,
in the heartlands the Welsh language is not faring as well, because of
migration from those areas that is driven by fewer opportunities, lower
wages and the draw of the city. This is a time of potential hope and
growth, but a time when we also need to be open to change. After all,
why should John and Jane have an automatic right to public service in
English, when Si&#244;n and Si&#226;n have to fight every inch of
the way&#151;perhaps not successfully, in the end? As to the private
sector, let us be clear that it is not a matter of forcing the corner
shop owner to learn Welsh; it is a matter of large and profitable
companies taking their responsibilities seriously&#151;by law, if, as
the British Gas case clearly suggests, that is necessary.</p><p><a name="06052399000429">This year Rosa Parks died. As
many hon. Members will know, she was one of the people who symbolised
the fight for the rights of black people in the USA. She did so by the
simple act of taking a seat on a bus&#151;a seat that was reserved
for white people. She dramatised the inequality of the treatment of
black people. In Wales a more subtle and less dramatic form of
inequality is present, and perhaps the steps that we take to deal with
it are more subtle and less dramatic. However, change we must have. It
must be based on full emancipation and full equality, and equal rights
for Welsh and English speakers
alike.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06052399000562">1.17
pm</h5><p><a name="06052399000430"><b><a name="06052399000702">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Nick
Ainger):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Caernarfon
(Hywel Williams) on securing the debate. The hon. Gentleman has chosen
an important issue for us to debate, and I have listened with interest.
He claims that the current Welsh language legislation is no longer
adequate. Perhaps it never was, in his view, in relation to private
companies. He argues that the way forward is to establish genuine
equality between the English and Welsh languages in Wales. I understand
his desire to achieve a bilingual Wales and equality between the two
languages, and for Wales to be at the forefront of the conduct of
public and perhaps private life in Wales. However, I remain convinced
that the way to achieve that is through greater co-operation and
encouragement, not
compulsion.</p><p><a name="06052399000431">The Welsh
Language Act 1993 has had a huge impact on the use of the Welsh
language and I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that. The language
now plays a more prominent role in our national life than it has done
at any time in living memory. The statistics from the 2001 census
provide further evidence of that. It is important that fluent Welsh
speakers feel that they have as many opportunities as possible to use
the language in their everyday lives. There are now many more services
available in Welsh than ever before, but one of our biggest problems is
getting people to use the services that are currently available in
Welsh. The Welsh Assembly Government have made great efforts positively
to promote the use of Welsh, and I fully support them in
that.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 443WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000432">The long-term
future of Welsh as a language rests in our ability to encourage more
people to speak the language. A new Act would achieve some things, such
as compelling even greater use of the language in business and
services. Would it, however, really encourage more people on the
streets of Wales to learn it? Legislation can be an effective tool for
dealing with problems that society faces, but, as I have said
previously, my colleagues in the Welsh Assembly Government and I feel
that it is far more important to channel our efforts into ensuring that
more Welsh is used every day in all aspects of life through promotion
and co-operation. We need to ensure that there are services available
in Welsh for those who want to use them, and, at the same time, to make
sure that opportunities are available for people to learn the language
or enhance their language skills. It is through a combination of those
efforts that we will achieve our desired outcome of a bilingual
Wales.</p><p><a name="06052399000433">Although the
UK and Welsh Assembly Governments are not minded to bring forward new
specific Welsh language legislation, it does not automatically follow
that we are not prepared to consider how we can strengthen our
commitment to the language in other legislation. I should point out
that the Welsh language has featured prominently in the debates on the
Government of Wales Bill. Clause 61 gives Welsh Ministers the power to
do anything that they consider appropriate to support the Welsh
language. Together with the Assembly Ministers&#146; functions under
the Welsh Language Act 1993, it will provide a broad basis for
promoting the Welsh
language.</p><p><a name="06052399000434">Welsh
Assembly Ministers will inherit the Welsh Assembly&#146;s existing
Welsh language scheme and the commitments in it to produce an annual
compliance report. As required by section 21(3) of the 1993 Act, the
scheme has been prepared having regard to the Welsh Language
Board&#146;s guidelines. The Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s
proposals to bring the board in-house have been well documented and
debated, and consultation is taking place on them. When they come into
effect, Welsh Assembly Ministers will inherit one of the primary
functions of the board: promoting and facilitating use of the Welsh
language. Having such a function will mean that the Welsh Assembly
Government will have to take action to do so. A duty will be imposed on
them. That, along with provisions in the Government of Wales Bill, is a
reflection of the Welsh Assembly&#146;s commitment to the Welsh
language.</p><p><a name="06052399000435">The hon.
Gentleman referred specifically and at some length to British Gas and
its decision no longer to provide bills in the medium of Welsh to its
business customers. We accept that private businesses have the right to
make changes to their services on commercial grounds. However, it is
disappointing when a prominent organisation such as British Gas takes
such a decision. The company has informed my officials that it will
continue to provide a bilingual service to all domestic customers who
wish to communicate through the medium of Welsh. It has a voluntary
Welsh language scheme, agreed by the Welsh Language Board, and a
dedicated Welsh call centre based in Cardiff. However, this move is
disappointing, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State intends
to raise the matter with the company. I understand that Alun 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 444WH</b><br>Pugh, the Welsh Assembly Government Minister with responsibility for
promoting use of the Welsh language, plans to do the
same.</p><p><a name="06052399000436"><b><a name="06052399000703">Hywel
Williams:</b> I welcome the Minister&#146;s words about the
Government&#146;s stance on the issue. How does he respond to the
point in the letter from British Gas that it is only through
compulsion&#151;through a change in legislation&#151;that it would
consider moving back to a Welsh language service for its
customers?</p><p><a name="06052399000437"><b><a name="06052399000704">Nick
Ainger:</b> That is one of the issues that my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State will discuss with British Gas. As the
hon. Gentleman said in his contribution, a significant number of
companies are in exactly the same position as British Gas but continue
to provide that service, and I hope that British Gas will seriously
reconsider its decision. It is not justified, and we shall make our
view clear.</p><p><a name="06052399000438">There are
several other examples not raised by the hon. Gentleman; for example,
the Football Association of Wales. It is worth putting it on record
that Alun Pugh, the Minister who has responsibility in this area, has
urged it seriously to reconsider its
policy.</p><p><a name="06052399000439">The decision
of British Gas, which is extremely disappointing, is an example of the
challenges that we face. However, such cases do not necessarily justify
or demand sweeping new legislation that compels organisations to
provide services in Welsh. They demand greater co-operation,
understanding and determination on behalf of us all to promote the use
of the language. The Welsh Assembly Government have set out clearly
their desire to create a fully bilingual Wales in which use of the
Welsh language sits comfortably with the day-to-day functions of
life.</p><p><a name="06052399000440">The Welsh
Assembly Government have outlined their policies in &#147;Iaith
Pawb&#148;, their national action plan for a bilingual Wales. It sets
out how the Welsh Assembly Government will set about raising awareness
of the language and encouraging more and more people to speak, learn
and use it. The scheme will also ensure that Welsh language
considerations are mainstreamed into other Welsh Assembly Government
policies. That is a welcome move that I am sure will bring considerable
benefits to the language.</p><p><a name="06052399000441">Iaith Pawb has set a target of
increasing the number of people able to speak Welsh by five percentage
points by 2011. That will be an increase on the 2001 census figures,
from 20.8 to 25.8 per cent. That is ambitious, but underpins the
determination of the Welsh Assembly Government to secure the future of
the Welsh language. Fforwm Iaith, which is a programme of public
meetings and consultations taking place throughout Wales, has
demonstrated further the desire to create a language policy that has
the buy-in of all the people of Wales. It is no good having the ideas
but not backing them up with resources. The Welsh Assembly Government
have put their money where their mouth is and invested more than
&#163;28 million extra in the Welsh language since 2003.</p><p><a name="06052399000442">It is not
just in large-scale programmes of work such as Iaith Pawb that the
Welsh Assembly Government are making progress, however. The UK
Government are determined to promote the language. Nine Departments now
have Welsh language schemes: the Department for 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 445WH</b><br>Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Department for Transport, the Department for Education
and Skills, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Home Office, the
Office for National Statistics, the Ministry of Defence and the Wales
Office. Another three Departments&#151;the Department for
Constitutional Affairs, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#151;are in the process of
preparing those schemes in consultation with the Welsh Language
Board.</p><p><a name="06052399000443">We have
announced that Welsh will appear for the first time on UK passports
from this year. The Home Office has also demonstrated its commitment by
introducing Welsh into the swearing of oaths and affirmations in
citizenship ceremonies. Some of those commitments vary in size, but
they are all
significant.</p><p><a name="06052399000444">Again, I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising such an important issue.
He has raised genuine concerns and again demonstrated his commitment to
the Welsh language. I hope that I have done that as well. Although we
might not agree on the need for new legislation, it is clear that we
have the best interests of the language as our primary
objective.</p><p><a name="06052399000445">Wales is a
special place and our language is to be treasured. It is an old
language, with a rich history. It has been used to write some of the
most magical and compelling literature and songs. Both the UK and the
Welsh Assembly Governments are committed to the preservation and
promotion of the Welsh language. We will continue to strive towards
that through the initiatives that I have described. I am sure that we
will do so by working with the hon. Gentleman, other elected
representatives and the people of
Wales.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 446WH</b><br>

Evan Harris (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD):</b> I welcome
you, Miss Begg. I think that this is the first Adjournment debate that
I have had with you in the Chair, and I am pleased to see you. I also
welcome the Minister, because this is the first time I have introduced
an Adjournment debate with him in his new role at the Department of
Health. He has long taken an interest in health, both before becoming
an MP and in his early and brief days as a Government Back
Bencher.</p><p><a name="06052399000447">We debate the
role of animal research in health care and medicines against a
background of animal rights extremism, and there is no denying that. I
do not want to talk too much about animal rights extremism, as I want
to discuss the broader issues that we need to address to win the hearts
and minds of the public over the value of, and therefore the need for,
well-regulated animal research. However, it is worth saying a few
things about what has happened recently in the context of Oxford, but
not to concentrate on them too
much.</p><p><a name="06052399000448">I certainly
recognise that animal rights activists have an ethical position that is
coherent. That position is that we should not use animals as a means to
benefit humans. That is not a position I agree with, but I recognise
that one can hold it and that to do so is not wholly outlandish or
irrational. However, if one argues on that basis, one must look first
at the use of animals by the million&#151;indeed, by a multiple of
those used in medical research&#151;for human consumption and other
uses by humans. There is less value in using animals in that way, as it
provides menu choice but is not essential for saving human life in the
way that animal research in the biosciences is essential for finding
insights into diseases and for safety-testing medicines that save life
and significantly improve the human
condition.</p><p><a name="06052399000449">The
part of the animal rights movement that I strongly disagree with is
that which attacks science and has a pseudo-scientific justification
for its position. However, those involved take that position because
they know that it is hard to argue against the use of animals in
medical research, particularly as it is so tightly regulated in this
country and is used only in the context of the3 Rs&#151;the
aim to reduce, refine and
replace.</p><p><a name="06052399000450">For reasons
that I shall come to later, people in that part of the animal rights
movement choose not to concentrate their fire on the farming, abattoir
and butchery industries, but resort to anti-scientific methods. I feel
very strongly that we need to expose that as wrong, irrational, unfair
and anti-scientific.</p><p><a name="06052399000451"><b><a name="06052399000706">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for raising this important subject and for giving way. Does
he accept that the animal rights movement has not attacked the
registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals
regulations&#151;the REACH regulations&#151;in Europe, although
those will mean about 3 million animals being bred for research, with
very little defined benefit for mankind? Will he draw attention to
that?</p><p><a name="06052399000452"><b><a name="06052399000707">Dr.
Harris:</b> It is fair to say that the
broader animal welfare movement is split, with the WWF supporting, and
indeed instigating, the REACH regulations. However, 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 447WH</b><br>to be fair to anti-vivisection organisations&#151;I am always keen to
be fair&#151;have made representations to the Science and Technology
Committee, on which the hon. Gentleman and I serve, opposing those
regulations because of the number of animals
used.</p><p><a name="06052399000453">I want to
concentrate on the false arguments used by the animal rights lobby on
the validity and value of animal research for the production of
medicines, and, before that, on getting insights into the development
of disease, both veterinary and
human.</p><p><a name="06052399000454">It goes without
saying that I condemn unreservedly the violence, intimidation and
harassment used by animal rights activists. I urge the mainstream
animal rights organisations to condemn unreservedly violence,
intimidation and harassment, and not by saying, &#147;We condemn
violence against both people and animals,&#148; because there is a
difference, even if some choose to define research using animals as
violence. One is lawful and sanctioned by Parliament, and tightly
regulated; the other is wholly unlawful criminal behaviour. The two
should not be mixed. Therefore, condemning violence against people and
animals, in the way that some organisations do, is not an acceptable
way of claiming to condemn those
techniques.</p><p><a name="06052399000455">Mainstream
organisations need to condemn that violence, because it will enhance
them and their cause if they dissociate themselves from what they must
recognise, and many do, as not representative of the vast bulk of
people who care about animal welfare, nor even of those people who
describe themselves as animal rights
activists.</p><p><a name="06052399000456">To turn to
the general issues of which I have given the Minister notice, the
Department of Health, the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry need to
do far more to explain to, and educate, the British
public&#151;through the media, but also on occasion by educating the
media&#151;about the value and essential nature of research using
animals. That is not done
sufficiently.</p><p><a name="06052399000457">Perhaps
the Minister can help me with this, but I have not found a speech by a
Secretary of State for Health in which the main issue was the value to
our health service of the work done by beleaguered scientists,
including those in Oxford, who work in basic science or do pre-clinical
work to produce new insights into disease, new targets for drugs and
new drugs.</p><p><a name="06052399000458">People
working in the NHS, whom I accept are hard pressed, do not recognise
that they, too, have a roleto play in taking every
opportunity, within reason, to make it clear what work has been done on
animals to help to provide the health care that they deliver.
Clinicians are busy people, so there is the following strong argument
to be made about research, whether it is sponsored through NHS research
and development funding, or worked on by the Department of Health or
the Medical Research Council: somewhere in press releases about
breakthroughs in human&#151;that is, clinical&#151;trials, there
should be, perhaps in the notes to editors, a statement that the
therapy was developed through animal
models.</p><p><a name="06052399000459">That statement
should detail what those models were, and, when applicable, what
animals had been used to test efficacy and safety before the relevant
medication was put into man. It should also point out 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 448WH</b><br>that the use of animals was an essential part of the process. The onus
would then be on the media to report that part of the story.</p><p><a name="06052399000460">We should make the provision of
such information a general rule, so that individual scientists would
not feel singled out when it was provided. When I volunteered for tests
on a putative HIV vaccine, I made it clear, as best I could, in live
interviews&#151;otherwise it was edited out&#151;that I had done so
knowing, and being grateful for, the fact that the vaccine had been
developed using animal models. It had been tested on animals for
efficacy, at least in respect of immunogenic impact; primate models had
developed the immune response that researchers were looking
for.</p><p><a name="06052399000461">I do not want to
blow my own trumpet, but we need more people to seize every opportunity
to make that point. If they do not, we shall not convince the public of
the need to safeguard animal research. We can rejoice&#151;if that is
the right word&#151;in the recent convictions and long sentences. We
can welcome, as I certainly do, the actions of the young people in the
Pro-Test movement in Oxford. They put the case positively for research
using animals, rather than simply opposing the extremism. We can
welcome all that, but those acute, short-term effects have to be
sustained.</p><p><a name="06052399000462">I worry
about polls that reveal the high number of school leavers who have a
negative view of animal research, think it cruel and unnecessary, and
have read and accepted the propaganda of the animals rights movement. I
speak generally; the counter-argument has been more successful among
those who have been exposed to debates on the
subject.</p><p><a name="06052399000463">There is an
overwhelming argument for using the opportunity of medicines labelling
to make the case for animal research. It has two bases. First, the
educative one: it is right that the key role that animals have played
in the development of the therapeutic option, in identifying what the
drug is targeting and in testing for the efficacy and safety of
it&#151;any and all of those, as they apply&#151;should be
explained to consumers at the point of use. That is important; it is
not done, but it needs to be.</p><p><a name="06052399000464">Secondly, informed consent
means that people are entitled to know about the contentious issue of
whether drugs have been tested on animals. People are entitled to know
that, whether or not it would make a difference to whether they would
choose to use a drug. We label as to whether food is GM-derived, even
if there is no GM product left in it, on the basis that consumers have
a right to know and should be able to choose whether they want to
support GM technology.</p><p><a name="06052399000465">I do not think that many people
would refuse to use animal-tested medicines if such labelling were
introduced&#151;I hope that very few or no people would&#151;but it
is important that people should have that right. The argument that we
should not label in that way because people might choose on ethical
grounds not to have treatment only proves me right. That view is
paternalistic; we must recognise that competent adults have a right to
make such decisions for themselves. That paternalistic argument is the
worst that could be used, because it sells the pass on the right of
people to give informed consent for their
treatment.</p><p><a name="06052399000466">The
Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has said to me, and
said on the radio this 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 449WH</b><br>morning, that the issue is difficult. Well, labelling is difficult. It
would involve legislation, and it might be difficult or inequitable for
it to be introduced in this country and not others, but we have
requirements for labelling in this country and in the European Union. I
want the Government to say that they accept that a good case has been
made and that they will explore what can be done to bring such
labelling about.</p><p><a name="06052399000467">I
come back to the point I made at the beginning of the debate. One
reason for animal rights activists not targeting the food industry is
that they know it would be difficult to argue, as they have on animal
research, that such testing is useless. Everyone who eats meat, and
presumably enjoys doing so, recognises that there is a direct benefit
from having the meat industry. However, what they do not
see&#151;unless and until, sadly, they are ill, and it might be
explained to them&#151;is the direct benefits of research using
animals. They see it as testing things for other people, not for
them.</p><p><a name="06052399000468">In the same way,
as the Minister will be aware, people do not necessarily correctly
quantify the risks, if there are any, from mobile phones and mobile
phone masts. They see the benefit of the mobile phone that they use, so
they discount their fear of the risk, even though the dose from their
phone might be greater than that from a mast. They do not see a direct
benefit from mobile phone masts, even though they might use a mobile
phone&#151;one might consider that a little quirky, to say the
least&#151;so large numbers of them campaign against the
masts.</p><p><a name="06052399000469">Animal rights
campaigners recognise that there is a similar issue here, which is why
they do what they do, and we must counter that. I fear that the climate
will not always be such that the vast majority of the public believes
that animal research is essential. However, if we can conquer animal
rights extremism and unlawful behaviour through the efforts of the
police and the intelligence services, that will bolster public opinion
in support of animal research. If we are successful, we can then go
back to the battle, which I am happy to have, to secure public support
for animal research that does not rely, in a strange way, on the animal
rights extremists&#146; counter-productive activities.</p><p><a name="06052399000470">I hope that the Minister will
offer me some comfort on the points that I have made, particularly on
the lead that Health Ministers can take by backing the admirable work
done by Lord Sainsbury, the science Minister, and, on occasion, by the
Prime Minister. I also hope that there will be action on the design of
press releases to ensure that the press have the option of reporting on
animal
research.</p><p><a name="06052399000471">Finally,
I hope that the Government will look seriously at allowing patients to
give informed consent and at educating the public generally through
medicines labelling.</p><p><a name="06052399000472"><b><a name="06052399000708">Bob
Spink:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on how he has
presented his comments. I agree with everything that he has said, and
he has said it very well, but would it help his case and help to win
over the public if he confirmed that the UK has one of the strictest
licensing regimes in the world for using animals in medical research?
Research can be conducted in the UK only if no non-animal options are
available. Only essential research takes place, and the animal&#146;s
welfare is always at the forefront.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 450WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000473"><b><a name="06052399000709">Dr.

comments. The key point is to recognise that work is being done on
finding replacements, refining animal experiments and minimising the
number of animals used. However, we must recognise&#151;this is my
only criticism on the issue&#151;that as more animal
modelsare created as a result of transgenic research, more
breeding pairs will be produced. That is particularly true of mice.
More mice will be used, so we need to lower expectations on whether
there will be a reduction in the overall
numbers.</p><p><a name="06052399000474">That
technique is powerful, and as more genes are identified, more animal
models may be used. We will continue to see an increase there, but
minimisation of the numbers is still possible within that, and I wholly
endorse the strategy of the three R&#146;s. I look forward to the

parties. That shows that mainstream opinion is firmly on one side of
the argument and sends an important message to the public.</p><p><a name="06052399000477">I am pleased to be back at the
Department of Health and I was grateful to the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon for welcoming me back. During my time dealing with
identity cards and other matters, I also had responsibility at the Home
Office for the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, so, usefully,
I saw the licensing side of this issue and I have acquired experience
that I hope will inform how I do my current
job.</p><p><a name="06052399000478">I agree with
almost all of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. He made some
challenges to the Department, and I will want to address them. However,
let me begin by saying that animal research and testing has played a
part in almost every medical breakthrough of the last century and is
vital to the functioning of our national health service. In recent
times, research using animals has led to new treatments and therapies
for many conditions including stroke, which is the third largest cause
of death in the United Kingdom and the largest single cause of severe
disability. Studies with mice and rats have shown the complicated
cascade of events that takes place during and after a stroke and have
led to successful treatments being developed. These include drugs that
prevent or inhibit the harm caused by glutamate, which damages the
brain cells and is released in huge quantities during a stroke. New
treatments being tested on animals include stem cells and bone marrow
injections, which appear to restore much of the brain&#146;s
function.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 451WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000479">In introducing my remarks, I
want to take head-on the hon. Gentleman&#146;s challenge. If I
interpreted correctly, there was a criticism that the case for animal
research and testing was not made strongly enough across all arms of
government. I refute that by saying that it is evident that the
Government from the very top down&#151;from the Prime Minister
downwards&#151;have been steadfast in supporting necessary animal
research and testing. To be fair to the hon. Gentleman, he made
reference to that. Support for that comes from the top, and I assure
the hon. Gentleman that there are no differences of opinion between the
Departments of Government.</p><p><a name="06052399000480">It is also important to
introduce a note of balance by saying that it is Government policy to
support what is called the 3 Rs agenda&#151;reduction, refinement and
replacement. Where possible, we should work to reduce the number of
animals used. The hon. Member for Castle Point made that point. We see
the need for this balance; we support animal research and testing, and
we robustly and resolutely defend that principle in many forums, but we
also say clearly to the public that where necessary and where possible
we will support the reduction of animal
use.</p><p><a name="06052399000481"><b><a name="06052399000711">Bob
Spink:</b> Will the Minister clarify that the refinement
element of the 3 Rs addresses the welfare of the animal by making sure
that that is as high as possible in all
circumstances?</p><p><a name="06052399000482"><b><a name="06052399000712">Andy
Burnham:</b> I gladly confirm that.</p><p><a name="06052399000483">The hon. Gentleman made an
important point in his intervention on the hon. Member for Oxford, West
and Abingdon. Speaking from the Home Office perspective, as I used to
do, it is right that the British regime for the conduct of research and
testing in this area is, I would go so far as to say, perhaps the best
and the strictest in the world. We set the standard for many other
countries to follow; they look to us for standards of animal welfare in
science and in research and development. One of the great ironies of
the actions of so-called animal rights extremists is that if they
achieve their goal and drive this work from our shores, they could
drive it to countries that have a far less strict regime for the
conduct of such research, and by implication they could therefore cause
more suffering to animals in the long run. They would do well to think
about that point.</p><p><a name="06052399000484">That is not to say that, as the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon mentioned, there are not
groups that legitimately apply pressure in respect of reduction,
refinement and replacement. We should hear that pressure and respond to
it wherever we can, but without losing sight of the central point that
is being made in this debate: that we should strongly, clearly and, if
possible, in unison defend the use of animal experiments to the wider
public. That is certainly the position that I am here today
unequivocally to
support.</p><p><a name="06052399000485">The hon.
Gentleman will know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wrote
an article published in <i>The Sunday Telegraph </i>on 14 May, setting
out the Government&#146;s position on animal testing and our
determination to stand up to animal rights extremism and to protect
those targeted by it. The article sets out 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 452WH</b><br>the importance of as many people as possible standing up to extremists;
recognises that British scientists and companies are at the forefront
of research that saves and improves the quality of countless lives; and
affirms that we should be proud that the UK leads the way in the
robustness of our licensing regime and in developing new testing
techniques.</p><p><a name="06052399000486">I
wholeheartedly endorse those sentiments. The Government, police and
courts are making increased efforts to stamp out illegal and
intimidatory conduct by animal rights extremists. We have a
comprehensive strategy, with the Prime Minister taking overall charge,
and we have made excellent progress in better co-ordinating our
efforts. The Government have injected significant new resources into
that work. At national level, a specialist team has been set up to
co-ordinate operations against extremists. At local level, awareness
has been strengthened through workshops with local police, and the
issue is being flagged as a key priority in the national policing
plan.</p><p><a name="06052399000487">More
people, including health professionals, are now prepared to speak out
on behalf of research using animals, as the hon. Gentleman said. In
February 2006, the &#147;Pro-Test&#148; campaign attracted twice as
many demonstrators on to the streets as the anti-testing demonstration
on the same day. I believe that the former demonstration was attended
by many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents, if it did not go
through part of his constituency. I commend the courage of the
demonstrators in defying the bullying and intimidatory tactics of the
small number of
extremists.</p><p><a name="06052399000488">The
centrepiece of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments related to Health
Ministers and the Department itself being on the front foot and
supporting the agenda that he has outlined. I strongly welcome the
&#147;People&#146;s Petition&#148;, registering support for the
properly regulated animal testing that takes place in this country. It
has attracted thousands of signatures and gives voice to the majority
position in this country. The hon. Gentleman is doing a great deal to
ensure that that position continues to command majority support from
the public, and I commend his efforts in making the public argument, as
he does whenever he has the
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06052399000489">The hon.
Gentleman expressed a need for Health Ministers to defend, promote and
support essential medical research. That is what we do. Wherever
possible, the Department of Health&#151;together with the
pharmaceutical industry, the scientific community and funders of
research using animals&#151;makes the case strongly for the
importance of such research. All those partners have a role to play in
explaining its legitimate and responsible
use.</p><p><a name="06052399000490">Ministers from my
Department, the Home Office and the Department of Trade and Industry
have spoken many times on that subject. The hon. Gentleman said that he
had not found such a speech. I can refer him to countless speeches and
comments from Ministers not only in the Department of Health but across
the spectrum. In those speeches and comments, he will find unanimous
support for the position that I am outlining. We set out, and will
carry on setting out, the benefits of medical research and the fact
that the UK has the strictest regime in the world for animal testing,
designed to minimise suffering and to ensure the highest welfare
standards.</p><br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 453WH</b><br><p><a name="06052399000491">The Government are committed to
developing alternatives to animal testing wherever possible, and fund
work to reduce, refine and one day replace the use of animals in
research. UK universities and companies have an excellent record of
developing and using
alternatives.</p><p><a name="06052399000492">As
a Health Minister in April 2002, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath set out in
full for the first time the Government&#146;s policy on the use of
animals in medical research. Two years later, at the first Coalition
for Medical Progress parliamentary reception, my ministerial colleague
Lord Warner of Brockley spoke about why research using animals is
essential. That is a speech to which I can refer the hon. Gentleman.
The Government welcome and support the work of the coalition, which
presents data from scientists engaged in biomedical research in order
to explain how animals help research on the causes of disease and
enable new treatments to be developed. The coalition communicates with
a range of audiences, including
nurses.</p><p><a name="06052399000493">I shall touch
on some of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. He said that he
understands the position taken by some people who believe that it is
defensible to say that animals should not be used to benefit humans. I
believe that the vast majority of people would find that position
difficult to sympathise with or agree with and it becomes completely
unacceptable when combined with violence and intimidation against those
who do not hold a similar view. He was right to say that it is
important not to suggest that the groups that indulge in such extremism
are in any way representative of the huge number of people in this
country who care about animal welfare, and it is right that we make
that distinction here today. There is a long and respectable tradition
in this country of campaigning on such matters and many people take a
strong personal interest in them, but there is a major difference
between wanting a reduction in the unnecessary suffering by animals and
those who understand the need for medical research for the benefit of
humankind. It is important that the hon. Gentleman put that distinction
on the record.</p><p><a name="06052399000494">I take
on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about press releases. It is
important to make the case whenever we have the opportunity. I will not
flinch from doing so and I do not believe that a single ministerial
colleague in the Department will flinch from doing so. The hon.
Gentleman may have given us a useful jab and he was right to say that
we should carry on making the case clearly and
unequivocally.</p><p><a name="06052399000495">The
hon. Gentleman said that he was a volunteer for the HIV vaccine, which
demonstrates a personal commitment, and I want to make a brief comment
about the Northwick Park issue which is commanding so much attention at
the moment. People have asked whether that demonstrates that animal
testing is 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 454WH</b><br>unnecessary because it did not prevent the incident. There will be
further announcements in due course about the reasons for what
happened&#151;and some expert work is necessary&#151;but it
demonstrated the danger of putting people into early clinical trials
when there has not been sufficient animal research. That makes the
point that animal testing is important; it does not make the reverse
case. It would be a dangerous world if people were not confident about
going into such trials and it is very important, if we are to maintain
public confidence in clinical trials, that we continue to use animal
testing when
necessary.</p><p><a name="06052399000496"><b><a name="06052399000713">Dr.
Harris:</b> I back the Minister&#146;s support for the idea
that press releases on clinical trials should refer to animal research
and I hope that it is fair to say that there is now Government support
for funders to ask for or even to insist that researchers do
that.</p><p><a name="06052399000497">Will the
Minister use the last two minutes to refer to the labelling of medicine
packs because I know that many people want to hear his
views?</p><p><a name="06052399000498"><b><a name="06052399000714">Andy
Burnham:</b> I will. I heard the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments and have read the transcript of his interview on the
&#147;Today&#148; programme. He is making an interesting proposal.
I know that it has been discussed before and I have an open mind about
it. I am prepared to consider the issues further, but I urge him to
recognise that a cost-benefit analysis is required because there are
risks&#151;it has been suggested that some people may be deterred
from taking medicines&#151;and there is a financial cost to the NHS
of doing so. There may be other risks in following such a
course.</p><p><a name="06052399000499">At the same
time, the benefit that the hon. Gentleman wants is public confidence
and acceptance of the need for animal testing so there is a benefit,
but I hope that he recognises that there may be dangers also. The
matter should be considered in the round before a firm commitment can
be given one way or another. I do not have a closed mind on the issue
and if he wants to do further work and to engage us in further debate,
I am happy to do so. However, the matter is not as straightforward as
it may seem initially, although I am not saying that I have a real
desire or a closed mind.
</p><p><a name="06052399000500">In the short time
remaining, I want to congratulate the hon. Gentleman again on the
debate. He mentioned young people, who are an important audience for
the issues that we have discussed today. We would do well to think more
about how we can communicate some of the messages that we are sharing
today with that audience. I believe that most young people would accept
the position that we are outlining, but let us communicate with
them.</p><p><a name="06052399000501"><i>It being Two
