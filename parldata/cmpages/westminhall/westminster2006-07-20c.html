The commission was established in the wake of the Scottish Affairs Committee report entitled &#147;Coincidence of Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in Scotland and the Consequences of Change&#148;, which followed the Government&#146;s decision to retain the number of Members of the Scottish Parliament at 129 and the provisional proposals of the Boundary Commission for Scotland to reduce the number of Scottish constituencies represented at Westminster from 72 to 59.</p>

should be based on local authority areas rather than Westminster constituencies, with the regions revised to better reflect natural local communities; that candidates for election to the Scottish Parliament should not be prohibited from standing in a constituency and on the regional list; that clearer and more positive roles should be developed for constituency and regional MSPs; that the single transferable vote system should be introduced for European parliamentary elections; and that Scottish Parliament and local government elections should be held on different days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="60720h0001.htm_para6"><a name="06072048000014">In February this year, the Scottish Affairs Committee took evidence from Sir John Arbuthnott, the chairman of the commission, and from one of its members, Dr. Nicola McEwen. During the evidence session, members of the Committee raised several matters of concern about the commission&#146;s report, including coterminosity of Westminster and Holyrood constituency boundaries; the remit of the commission and honouring the devolution settlement; the voting system for elections to the Scottish Parliament; the boundaries and size of Holyrood constituencies; Scottish local government elections; wasted votes; the multiplicity of MSPs representing Scottish Parliament constituencies; voter confusion; dual candidacy for elections to the Scottish Parliament; and elections to the European Parliament.</p>

I am sure that if they catch your eye, Mr. Caton, members of the Committee will express their own concerns, but I would now like to make a few observations on my own account, rather than as the Chairman of the Select Committee. I am greatly concerned that the Arbuthnott commission has simply not resolved three fundamental issues. The first is the complicated and confusing system that we have in Scotland, with four different voting systems for the four different types of elections. We have STV for local government elections; proportional representation for elections to the European Parliament; a mixture of first past the post and a list system for elections to the Scottish Parliament; and first past the post for elections to the House of Commons.</p>

 I have never been keen on first past the post and prefer proportional representation, but the mess that I witnessed during elections to the Scottish Parliament with list membership means that I now have serious reservations about proportional representation in our country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="60720h0001.htm_para8"><a name="06072048000018">All hon. Members will share my concern about the falling number of people who bother to vote in elections. Part of that reluctance to vote must be due to the confusion caused by having different systems for different elections, and the fact that, for elections to the Scottish Parliament, electors have two votes: for a constituency MSP and for a list MSP. The Scottish Parliament has introduced the single transferable vote for local government elections, and it clearly likes that system, so why does it not ask Westminster to introduce STV for Holyrood elections? If it is good enough for local government, surely it is good enough   <br>

for the Scottish Parliament. Has the Minister received a request from the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation so that STV will be used in future elections to the Scottish Parliament?</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="06072048000019"><a name="60720h0001.htm_spnew5"><a name="06072048000360"><b>Ms Katy Clark (North Ayrshire and Arran) (Lab):</b>
 My question is about the change to STV in local government elections. Does my hon. Friend share my concern about local representation on councils? The break between voters and councillors is something many of us are worried about. At the moment it is clear who people can go to and who is responsible for ensuring that council services are delivered in their area.</p>

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="06072048000020"><a name="60720h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="06072048000361"><b>Mr. Sarwar:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes an important point. A constituency link with the elector is vital. However, my concern is that, because we have elections on the same day for both local government and the Scottish Parliament, if the Scottish Executive think that it is a good idea to have STV in local government, people will ask why it is not a good idea for the Scottish Parliament. Introducing STV in the Scottish Parliament and in local government would at least reduce confusion for voters when they go to the polling station.</p>

 Is it not true that most Labour Members of the Scottish Parliament are, for the reasons set out by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine), totally opposed to the introduction of STV? Is it not the case that STV is being forced on the people of Scotland by the Liberal Democrats?</p>

<p><a name="st_10"><a name="06072048000022"><a name="60720h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="06072048000363"><b>Mr. Sarwar:</b>
 I do not speak on behalf of Labour Members of the Scottish Parliament. I believe and agree that there is a coalition in Scotland with the Liberal Democrats, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Labour members and activists who I have spoken to in my wards and my constituency are totally opposed to the introduction of STV in local government elections. If elections to Holyrood and for local government are to be held on the same day, surely it would make perfect sense, in order to reduce the voter confusion that I mentioned, for the same voting system to be used for both types of election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="60720h0001.htm_para9"><a name="06072048000023">Another matter that the commission does not address is the coterminosity of constituency boundaries for elections to the Parliaments in Westminster and Holyrood. The present system has led to the current situation, whereby there are 11 MSPs interfering in my constituency of Glasgow, Central. Four of them were elected by first past the post, and seven from the list. That situation is unacceptable and must change.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="06072048000024"><a name="60720h0001.htm_spnew9"><a name="06072048000364"><b>Ms Katy Clark:</b>
 Are my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents similar to mine in that when they think about which MSP they should go to with their problems, they think of their directly elected MSP? One worry about the move towards single transferable votes for councillors is that it will not be clear to whom constituents should go. Perhaps, rather than the Scottish Parliament moving to a system with more STV, we should review how councils are elected.</p>

 May I suggest to my hon. Friend and neighbour that he is making an assumption about my view? I have reservations about reducing the existing number of MSPs; my anxiety is maintaining the constituency link. While I can see the point of joining two constituencies together and having such areas elect four MSPs, would it not be even better if we simply had two Holyrood MSPs for each Westminster constituency, to be elected on the basis of one man and one woman from each constituency, thereby giving a gender balance and reducing the number of MSPs?</p>

 An even better proposal came from my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe), who is unfortunately not present. He suggested that if there must be a proportionality element, we could elect 118 by first past the post and  11 using proportionality.</p>

 I am well aware that the Conservative party made a similar proposal. When we make proposals on which there is consensus with the Conservatives, I become a bit doubtful about whether we are doing the right thing. That is why I did not mention this proposal in my submission.</p>

My third fundamental issue is that there are two classes of MSPs, as many colleagues have mentioned: the constituency MSP and the list MSP. In paragraphs 4.23 and 4.24, the commission rightly highlights the less than clear role of the list MSP, and that constituency MSPs have accused list MSPs of cherry-picking individual cases, about which my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark) made an eloquent point. The commission does not actually address the issue. The report is therefore disappointing, as it raises the problem, but does not seek to offer a solution.</p>

It makes a number of useful and positive recommendations that I believe will help the cause of Scottish democracy. It also deals with a few myths that were beginning to emerge, particularly among Labour Members. It debunked those myths constructively and positively. Sir John was given the massive task of looking at boundaries, voting and representation in Scotland and trying to put the voter first. This is a good report and Sir John went about his business in the diligent and professional way that we expected from one of the most respected academics. It is a testament to him that we are still debating his report a few months later and kicking around some of the issues to ensure that we try to improve on some of his work.</p>

I clearly remember them coming to the House week in, week out, saying that something must be done and the matter must be looked at. They came up with stories of constituents who were perplexed, confused and anxious about the different voting systems, coterminosity and so on, and demanded that the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, South-West (Mr. Darling), do something about it. To his credit, he acted on those concerns and asked Sir John Arbuthnott to set up his commission. It was important that the commission was to be consensual, cross-party and independent, and that was the case because all the parties were represented and all Scottish interests were reflected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="60720h0002.htm_para8"><a name="06072048000066">The commission worked diligently and I was particularly impressed by the way in which it sought the advice and views of focus groups and consulted all political parties. I think there were three meetings at Dover house to discuss those issues, and the report fairly and accurately represents the evidence.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman mentioned focus groups. Does he accept that the clearest finding from the focus groups was that the electorate preferred the first-past-the-post system because they find it easy, straightforward and preferable to any other complicated system?</p>

 That is one issue that came from the focus groups, although they also recognised in the same breath that STV would solve some of the coterminosity issues and the problem of different sorts of MSPs. When it came to the focus groups, there was a mixed bag for all of us. Focus groups were a good idea and Arbuthnott produced a good report. Although there are some recommendations that I do not agree with, the report was independent, cross-party and consensual, and the House asked for it. It was demanded by Labour Members. We accept Arbuthnott&#146;s proposals because he did his job and he did it well.</p>

The approach was entirely different. The Labour party could do that in Scotland, but if they tinker with democracy, change the voting arrangements and try to improve democracy, it must be with consensus and cross-party support. If a political party imposes its view on a democracy, there is a strong suspicion that it is doing so for its own, narrow, party political interests.

entitled to many more than that. We must move on from the Jurassic dark days of first past the post. Those days have gone and Labour Members must get used to that, move on and accept that the future is proportional voting because people&#146;s votes matter.

 In an earlier contribution, it was said that the Labour party introduced the voting system for the Scottish Parliament after many years of consultation in Scotland with a wide range of organisations. In the Scotland Act 1998, the Labour party was generous in the representation that it gave to other political parties and opinions. It could have gone ahead with proposals more akin to Labour&#146;s representation at Westminster. Does the hon.

 I think the hon. Lady is on more solid ground. The point that I was making was that the Arbuthnott commission, the Scottish Office and the Labour party in Scotland went about their business in a different way from that of the Welsh Labour party, which simply imposed its view on an unwilling Welsh electorate. I congratulate the Government on the way in which they approached the matter and for making it cross-party, consensual and independent. That is why the report reached different conclusions from the provisions in the Government of Wales Bill.</p>

I observe hard-working constituency Members of the Scottish Parliament, just as I observe Members of the Scottish Parliament who do almost next to nothing, and I observe hard-working list Members and list Members who do almost nothing. The difference in class is the difference in the quality of work from Members of the Scottish Parliament. That is the only distinction.</p>

Member for Glasgow, Central about proportional representation. There is growing consensus among some Labour Members, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party Members about that, which could help to drive the matter forward, with a strong and vigorous case for proportional representation in future.</p>

Arbuthnott said of dual candidacy that trying to stop constituency Members of the Scottish Parliament standing in the list would be undemocratic and would place an unnecessary restriction on the democratic rights of potential candidates and local electors to have as unrestricted a choice as possible.</p>

 I should explain that I did not hear the first part of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution because I was attending the important debate in the main Chamber. As he will know, many Labour Members do not agree with some colleagues&#146; arguments as regards dual candidacies. I am quite happy with what the Arbuthnott report says about the issue. However, rather than being an analysis of the Arbuthnott report, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last point strayed into the world of sectarian politics. Do I take it from what he says that the SNP, having failed to persuade the people of Scotland that they want independence, has adopted a policy of getting the people of England to throw Scotland out of the Union as the second-best way of reaching its objective?</p>

 I did not know that that was the analysis, so I will leave that one firmly alone. However, like me, the hon. Gentleman probably saw the front page of the <i>Sunday Mail</i>, which suggested that a third of English people want independence for England. There are two reasons why that is happening&#151;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I see the incredulity on the faces of the Minister and some Labour Back Benchers, but a third of English people now want independence for England. If the poll had happened 10, five or two years ago, a miniscule number of people would have supported independence for England. However, the number who do is growing and will soon become a majority, unless the issue is addressed.</p>

 As a matter of fact, the proportion of people in England who say that they do not want to be part of the Union has not changed significantly over decades.

is unfortunate that the Conservatives have backed off from trying to represent such views. Having said that, I should add that I have no idea what Conservative policy is, although I am sure that we shall hear about it later from the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell). A new, defined sense of English nationalism is emerging in the opinion polls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="60720h0002.htm_para20"><a name="06072048000092">The second thing that is happening is more disturbing. There is a growing sense of grievance in England, which we see reflected in several debates, including those that are taking place just now on funding issues. That is particularly true of the Barnett formula and the totally erroneous view that we in Scotland are subsidised to the hilt. English metropolitan commentators and Members believe that Scotland is somehow subsidised to the tune of&#151;well, God knows what it is this week, but it gets more and more fantastic the more we look at it.</p>

I am certain that the constituency postbag of the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) will be full of letters about that, because I am seeing genuine concern about it down here.

 Will the hon. Gentleman clarify why he believes that the issue did not arise in previous years, when the same situation applied to Northern Irish Members?

It is the defining constitutional issue of this Parliament, and the debate on it will be had and will be concluded&#151;it has to be, because the situation is just not fair.</p>

 I do not want to debate classes of MSP, because that would not be particularly useful, and it would not help us. If we&#151;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, I will answer that. If we become the Executive next year, which looks increasingly likely, we will seek to introduce the single transferable vote system. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Central thinks that that system is a sensible solution, and, indeed, it is the only sensible solution to the problem of ensuring that all Members of the Scottish Parliament are the same. It is the only solution that will work under the existing rules, which the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues created in the Scotland Act 1998. We tried to improve that legislation as it went through the House, but we are now stuck with the present system and we will contest things democratically and fairly in the way that the rules suggest.</p>

 The hon.

Let me just point out to the hon. Gentleman that, by his logic, there are not just two categories of Member, but five. The Scots&#146; position is different from that of the Welsh, whose position is different from that of Members from Northern Ireland, whose position, in turn, is different from that of English Members in London and other English Members. It is therefore false to say that there are two classes of Member; under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, there would be five.</p>

I say that it is not the Conservative party that is playing fast and loose, when it tries to answer the West Lothian question. It is by refusing to answer it that my cause is helped. I believe passionately in normality and independence for my nation, so please do not answer the West Lothian question. You guys are helping my cause immensely by letting it sit and leaving it unanswered. All that you are doing is adding to the frustration of the constituents of the hon. Member for Broxbourne as well as the general frustration and sense of injustice down in this part of the country. In the end, not just 31 per cent., or a third, of English voters will want English independence; soon a majority will want it. If the question remains unanswered that is what will happen&#151;but it will be addressed. It has to be. It is not fair or just. I think that everyone in this Room agrees that the West Lothian question will at some point have to be answered. The Scottish Affairs Committee did us a great favour by recognising that something had to be done. You gave us the four options.</p>

We must acknowledge that the concern has been a pressing one and that the Select Committee did us a great favour by highlighting the four possible solutions to the West Lothian question. Of the four, only one would work. That must be independence and mutual self-respect for both nations. It is the only one that could work.

That is what we would propose for dealing with some of the anomalies in the Scottish Parliament. I think that it would be the right approach, but I accept Arbuthnott and its recommendations. Some of the things that I have heard from Labour Members amount almost to rubbishing and disparaging Arbuthnott, and that does Sir John Arbuthnott and the people who served on the commission a great disservice. I wish that Labour Members would stop doing that, because it was the Scottish Labour party in particular that asked for, or demanded, the report, and said that something should be done.

 Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many of us who wanted the issues to be examined recognised, as soon as we saw the membership and the remit, that the whole thing was rigged? Part of the remit of the Arbuthnott commission was to preserve the proportional balance of the Scottish Parliament.

 That is the very point that I am making. That is where we start to criticise Arbuthnott, the process and the way that Sir John went about his business. I think that it is grossly unfair, and it is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman says such things and feels that way. Obviously, the things he says are sincerely felt. I know that Arbuthnott came up with the wrong answer and conclusions for the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. In some respects it came up with the wrong answers for me, too, but I accept it. I accept that the process was right, fair, appropriate and responsible, and I just wish that we could all say that there is something in Arbuthnott that will help to improve our democracy for the next election and the one after.</p>

The remarks that have been made along the lines of &#147;an affront to democracy&#148; about dual candidacy do hon. Members no favours. Arbuthnott looked at the issues in the cold light of day, independently and consensually, and drew his conclusions. The affront to democracy, as I have said, is our role here in this Parliament. That is what must be addressed&#151;not the fables about dual candidacy. The real issue is the voting rights of Scots Members in this place. After the opinion poll and the evidence that a majority of people in Scotland favour independence, we are now edging forward to somewhere where both our nations will have mutual self-respect and normality and be good neighbours. England will lose its surly lodger and gain a good neighbour. That day is coming soon.</p>

 Thank you for calling me to speak in this important debate, Mr. Caton. It is a great pleasure to be here this afternoon as the English Member of Parliament.

in Scotland by Scottish MSPs. Quite rightly, Parliament debated it in this part of the world, and Scottish MPs voted on a matter that related solely to England. I think that that applied to fox hunting as well.</p>

Friend the Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (Mr. Mundell) for those two days as well&#151;and myself and my English colleagues can sit in England on Monday and Tuesday debating English matters. On Wednesday and Thursday we all get together to have a big old discussion on things that affect the Union. That seems to me to be a very sensible idea.

I do not want to make a partisan point because I have been to Scotland: I have been to the Shetlands, the Orkneys, the highlands and the islands and there are huge distances that need to be travelled. There are a range of issues that mean that Scotland, geographically for a start, is very different from the south-east and the east. But it would be useful if Parliament could have an honest and open debate without prejudging the findings as to the nature of the settlement between Scotland and England, perhaps for no other reason than to lance the growing discontent among my constituents. Perhaps there is a very, very good reason why Scotland gets more money, &#163;2,401 per head more money than for the equivalent people in my constituency.</p>

 No, I am not proposing to change that system. There are various systems used in this country; I am speaking purely from my experience on what I believe works best.

 It is with some pleasure that I follow the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) who gave us the very interesting notion that if you vote Tory, you get midges. At the last election, we said that if you vote Liberal you would get Tories, but that is a further variation on that theme.</p>

considered, matters will be skewed towards a proportional bent. I regret that, and the way in which consideration was undertaken without proper debate early in the process. I worry that some people deliberately seek to drive a wedge between Westminster and Holyrood, accentuating not only disagreements but differences.</p>

Whether there were two Westminster Members to four Scottish Parliament Members, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar) suggested, or one Westminster constituency with two Members of the Scottish Parliament and a smaller number of top-ups, as others have suggested, we would work more closely than we do now in our devolved and disparate state. We must consider whose interests are served by driving that wedge between us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para4"><a name="06072048000150">I do not support the first-past-the-post system, but Professor Arbuthnott and his commission did not adequately address two issues that arise from the two-ballot system. First, that system creates two classes of MSP: the first-class MSPs from the constituency section, and the top-up MSPs, who regard themselves as second-class, because they spend so much time trying to become first-class MSPs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para5"><a name="06072048000151">I represented the parliamentary constituency of Glasgow Pollok until last year&#146;s general election, and I still represent a large chunk of it. Back then, it was noticeable that Johann Lamont, the Labour and Co-operative party MSP for that constituency, was frequently pursued by two list MSPs. One, Tommy Sheridan, was elected for the Scottish Socialist party. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is noticeable that the very mention of his name brings laughter from all parties in this Chamber.</p>

Mr. Sheridan sought regularly to attend the same meetings as Johann Lamont, and he presented himself as the MSP for Glasgow Pollok. Kenny Gibson, a list MSP for the Scottish National party and a councillor in part of the Glasgow Pollok constituency, also attended many meetings in the area, similarly presenting himself as the MSP for Glasgow Pollok. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Gibson stood for Glasgow Pollok in the subsequent Scottish Parliament elections. I am glad to say that they were roundly defeated. However, they spent a long period trying to persuade the electorate that they were MSPs for that area. Few if any MSPs elected by first-past-the-post seek to become list MSPs, which indicates their priorities.</p>

 I do not understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, which others make, too, because the Scottish Parliament has a corporate body on which the Labour party is represented. That body has made rules about how MSPs may act, but despite such concerns, it has not moved forward and the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have not brought any pressure on the correct forum, the corporate body, to make clearer the rules about the roles of regional and constituency MSPs. Even without the Arbuthnott commission, if the Scottish Parliament were sitting, that could be done tomorrow.</p>

 I understand that many of my Holyrood colleagues have made that point but have been unable to attain the satisfaction about the make-up and structure of the Scottish Parliament that they desire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para7"><a name="06072048000155">My second point about the two-ballot structure, which no one has touched on, is that in Glasgow, Labour votes in the second ballot are wasted. Labour is successful in the first-past-the-post section, winning 10 out of 10 seats last time, but it means that unless we get 135 per cent. of the votes in the second ballot, we cannot have anyone elected in the top-up section. If one knows that one&#146;s vote for one&#146;s first choice in the second ballot is not likely to succeed, the second ballot becomes second choice. That is ridiculous and anomalous and it ought to be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para8"><a name="06072048000156">That situation does not apply in all parts of Scotland, however. I said that a Labour vote was effectively wasted in Glasgow, and some bad thinkers presumed that I meant that nobody should vote Labour in other parts of Scotland in the second ballot. My point does not apply in those circumstances, and I look forward to seeing Labour Scottish parliamentary candidates elected on the list in several areas. However, it undoubtedly applies in Glasgow. Any solution that fails to address that will fail to address one of the main issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para9"><a name="06072048000157">Many of my constituents who vote Labour in the general election, the first ballots for the Scottish Parliament and the local authority elections have to opt for their second choice in the second Scottish ballot.

 I hope that it will not be such a big issue in the next elections, as I predict that a number of Labour seats will fall in Glasgow during the great wipe-out that we expect next year. However, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the new ballot paper is helpful? It will specify the second vote first, and then the constituency candidate. Will not that assuage his fears about the second vote?</p>

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="06072048000159"><a name="60720h0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="06072048000447"><b>Mr. Davidson:</b>
 If the hon. Gentleman assumes that the second vote will be first and the first vote second, will he clarify how it will make any difference to people casting their votes? They will regard the vote that they cast for the first-past-the-post seat, the first-class seat, as the most important. They will still have to choose where to cast their second vote, even though it might be first on the ballot paper. They will know, because we will tell them, that in Glasgow, there is no point voting Labour in the second ballot, so if they want their vote to count, they will have to identify someone else to vote for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para10"><a name="06072048000160">It is widely known that I was always in favour of the Co-operative party standing in the second ballot in parts of Scotland where it would have been beneficial. I am a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament at Westminster. It makes sense in such circumstances for the parties to run joint candidates. It would make equal sense in Glasgow to run separate candidates next time, with the Labour party not standing in the second ballot. The strategy might apply elsewhere, too. My main regret is that the issue has not been addressed.</p>

The Liberals have an MSP elected for Orkney. Had the same number of votes been cast in East Kilbride for that Liberal candidate, he would have come not first, second, third or fourth, but fifth. It seems unfair that constituency sizes are skewed in favour of some areas rather than others. Arbuthnott ought to have examined the issue more carefully.</p>

 Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that in island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, there are such different circumstances that it makes sense to create specific representation solutions not only for the Scottish Parliament, but for Westminster, where such solutions have existed for a long time, even if on the Scottish mainland there is greater parity?</p>

 There are undoubtedly difficulties in those areas. I am not entirely sure how best they ought to be addressed, as two conflicting issues have to be dealt with at the same time. One is sparsity, rurality and so on, and the other is the question of equal votes of equal value. The two are clearly incompatible and the fact that Arbuthnott did not consider the issue at all seems to be a noticeable omission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="60720h0004.htm_para12"><a name="06072048000164">I recognise that those who represent scattered and widespread constituencies, if they were given equal numbers of electors, would certainly require additional resources to ensure that they could provide a decent service to their constituents. When the European Parliament was elected on a first-past-the-post basis, Dr. Ewing, who represented Argyll and the Highlands, if I remember correctly, was given a large amount of additional resources to allow her to travel though her constituency and to employ additional staff to serve that widespread area. I am not sure what exactly the balance ought to be, but it is undoubtedly an issue and it is to be regretted that the Arbuthnott commission did not examine it in any way whatsoever.</p>

 I am a little confused by what the hon. Gentleman is saying. The Arbuthnott commission addressed the issue of the number of representatives to geographical area. That was one of the reasons he gave in his evidence and in the report for not recommending the introduction of the single transferable vote across Scotland. The highlands and islands would have seen a reduction in the number of Members and Arbuthnott said in his evidence to the Committee that he thought that the geographical area that would have to be covered by those who were elected to represent the highlands and islands would have been too great. Although he did not consider the specific issue raised by the hon. Gentleman, he did touch on the issue when it came to suggesting a balance between geography and the number of elected representatives.</p>

 Arbuthnott gave much more information on those issues when he met the Select Committee than he did in his report. It is noticeable that the issue is not pursued by the Liberals because they benefit from it. They constantly raise the issue of equal votes of equal value when it suits them, but they decline to do so when it does not. I see the hon.  <br>

 Can I point out to the hon. Gentleman that that is not true? We could win a large number of seats on the list for the south of Scotland, the north-east of Scotland or the north of Scotland through there being a swing to Labour in those areas. As well as holding on to the first-past-the-post seats that we have, we could gain seats by gaining more votes. It is entirely possible for us to gain more votes without losing first-past-the-post seats. I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s apology.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that the Labour vote will be on the way down next year. I notice, for example, that Lord Foulkes has put his name forward to top the Labour list in Lothian. He clearly wishes to be elected to the Scottish Parliament, and I think that even he would accept that the huge, astronomical swing to Labour that would be needed to win a seat on the Lothian list without losing any first-past-the-post seats would be simply incredible. The much more likely scenario is that the Labour party will lose several seats in Lothian, and that its vote will therefore fall so low that Lord Foulkes will be elected. Both the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West and Lord Foulkes seem to be thinking along the same lines. </p>

 Yes, that is right. It is simple for the elector to use but to explain the effect of their vote is actually quite complex. Basically, it is impossible to predict the outcome of their vote as party A might lose a constituency seat to party B, which could mean that party C would receive an extra seat through the list. The effects of the system are simply bizarre. In the west of Scotland region, for example, the Labour party won all the constituency seats in 1999 and lost one in 2003. If Labour were to lose more constituency seats, it would not gain corresponding seats on the list. However, the party that gained the corresponding seats on the list might be entirely different from the one that gained the constituency seats. The knock-on effects of parties losing constituency seats are impossible to predict.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is putting forward an interesting argument. Of course, because Labour wins eight out of the nine seats in the west of Scotland and has a low share of the vote, a lot of those seats are marginal. He might find that if he gave that advice to electors, the Labour party could lose a lot of the first-past-the-post seats and might need some of the votes on the list. It is impossible to predict what will happen. Advising people not to vote for a party on the list because it is bound to win too many constituency seats is a dangerous argument.</p>

 People certainly can make an informed decision about the effects of casting their vote as far as their constituency representative is concerned, but it is impossible for anybody to predict the effect of that vote on the regional list.

system and, although it is close and certainly a great improvement on first past the post, it has several defects. The first is that it is not proportional. Another is that it is impossible to predict the knock-on effect of casting a constituency vote. A third, as the hon. Gentleman described in his speech, is that although a small number of regional list MSPs carry out their duties conscientiously throughout their regional list area, it is my experience that the majority of them concentrate on one constituency and seek to become the constituency MSP for that area. Sometimes they try to become the MP for the constituency, as did Jamie McGrigor MSP, the regional list MSP who tried to become the MP for Argyll and Bute. However, I am pleased to inform the House that he failed miserably; in fact, his vote went backwards.</p>

That means that they are concentrating all their efforts on that constituency. A failed Tory candidate, Mary Scanlon, former MSP, was supposedly a representative of Argyll and Bute but no one there had a clue who she was and we never saw her. Rob Gibson MSP is also supposed to be a list MSP but again not a single person in Argyll and Bute has had sound or sight of him.

for the council. It would therefore have an electorate of 68,000, compared with the national average of 55,000 and with only 35,000 in the compact constituency of Clackmannanshire. In the past, the assumption has generally been that scattered constituencies that include islands should be smaller than the average. Unfortunately, Arbuthnott recommended one constituency for an extremely scattered area that includes 26 inhabited islands, despite the fact that the electorate is 13,000 above the average and 30,000 above smaller Clackmannanshire.</p>

I recommend to the House that the Government should instead adopt the single transferable vote system. I know that Arbuthnott recommended that system for European elections. I am certainly in favour of it. The Scottish Parliament is adopting that system for local council elections, and it would make sense if the Scottish Parliament elections are held on the same day that it should use the same system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="60720h0005.htm_para3"><a name="06072048000192">The single transferable vote has several advantages. It is a proportional system that allows a direct link between the elector and the elected representative. Unlike the closed lists used for the European elections or for the regional ballots used in the Scottish parliamentary elections, STV would allow the elector to vote directly for the elected representatives. It therefore means that they could directly choose their elected representatives without any of the bizarre knock-on effects of the constituency vote on the regional list of which we spoke earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="60720h0005.htm_para4"><a name="06072048000193">Another advantage of the single transferable vote is that the constituencies can be of different sizes yet still maintain the same ratio of electors to elected representatives. If the natural boundaries of an area were of a size to justify five elected representatives, five people would be elected by STV for that area; if the natural boundaries were such that four elected representatives would be right, we could have four. We could still maintain the link with local authority boundaries as proposed by Arbuthnott yet avoid the situation of wildly fluctuating numbers of electors per elected representative. It would certainly satisfy the requirement that each vote should be of equal value. Another advantage is that there would be only one class of elected representative; rather than having two separate categories, as we do now, every one of them would be equal.</p>

 I thank all hon. Members who have participated in the debate. Like so many Scottish debates, and like Scottish questions, it has been lively and interesting. A great deal of expertise and consideration has gone into the Arbuthnott report; it was a thorough process. I congratulate the Select Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar), and the Committee members. I am not a member of the Committee, but I have read the evidence transcripts. They flagged up some interesting points, which were highlighted in the report and some of which were brought to our attention this afternoon.</p>

In general, it is a helpful step in the right direction, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) said, a focus solely on local authority boundaries can bring with it problems, not least because of the sheer number of voters represented. He outlined the issues for Argyll and Bute, and I would draw attention to my part of the world, East Dunbartonshire. It is one fairly small local authority but, because it has 80,000 electors, it is proposed under Arbuthnott&#146;s recommendations that it would have two Members of the Scottish Parliament. Next door in West Dunbartonshire, which is not much smaller with 68,500 electors, there would be only one. A lot of people would see that great difference as something of a problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="60720h0005.htm_para7"><a name="06072048000197">We must remember that there has been a lot of local government reorganisation over the years. Let us hope that the Scottish Executive do not have the appetite suddenly to do it again. It has meant that community boundaries are not always the same as local authority boundaries. Areas in different local authorities but close together can have an affinity and share similar issues, whereas areas in the same local authority are often very different and face different challenges.</p>

It will make things clearer for voters, which is particularly important considering the new voting systems that have been put in place in Scotland in the past few years. Making it as simple as possible for people to exercise their democratic right is vital.</p>

Different parties have different ways of setting the order of their lists; in my party everything is democratic and decided by single transferable vote. I understand that other parties have moved towards allowing every member in an area to vote on the matter, but that still means that a fairly small section of an area&#146;s electorate&#151;those who are members of a particular political party&#151;decide the  <br>

 Does the hon. Lady recognise that one of the problems with that system, admirable though it might be, is that in reality members of the same party will end up fighting each other for their core vote?

 I certainly do not want that to be the outcome, but a bit of healthy competition even within parties can be an excellent tonic. It is clearly important that political ideas are discussed in election campaigns, but there might be differences of opinion even within political parties, and voters might prefer to choose a particular candidate who is on one ideological wing of a party. That could mean that we get more debate on the issues.</p>

 On the point about allowing different ideological perspectives on the same list, is the hon.

It gives maximum power to party bosses and minimum power to the voters. Voters do at least get a crop of MEPs more representative in political affiliation, but they do not get to choose who their representative should be. That decision is made by party hierarchies. A move towards single transferable vote for European elections would help to solve that problem.</p>

It will be helpful considering the complexities of counting in the list and constituency system, but it must be implemented properly, with testing before the election. I have slightly more reservations about e-voting, because we must ensure that any security issues are properly dealt with. As we move into the 21st century, it is reasonable to suggest that we should not keep exactly the same method of voting that we had in the 19th.</p>

 The same arguments could be made for postal voting, which has been opened up in recent years. There have been concerns in some cases about security and fraud, but some people find it difficult to vote because of the lifestyles that they lead. I am sure that we have all knocked on somebody&#146;s door and found that they have left the house before 7 o&#146;clock in the morning and are not getting back until after 10 o&#146;clock at night because of work commitments that they did not know about in time to request a postal vote.

 We argue too often about today&#146;s lifestyle. I am pretty sure that our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents worked a great deal longer and harder than we do for a great deal less.

 I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman does, but there are cases in which somebody can reasonably argue that they cannot get to the polling station.

Here, everything is dark and there are lush carpets; the Scottish Parliament is light, airy and feels very modern. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I appreciate that the building has caused some controversy and that not everybody is a fan of it, but it has a very different feel, consistent with the type of democracy that was envisaged.

Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) referred, on decoupling at the elections.

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="60720h0005.htm_para21"><a name="06072048000223">My concern with decoupling elections relates primarily to turnout. Back in 1995, turnout for local government elections was 45 per cent. When those elections were held on the same day as those for the Scottish Parliament, turnout increased to 59 per cent.; in fact, turnout for the local elections was 1 per cent. higher than that for the Scottish Parliament elections. In 2003, the figure for local elections dropped back slightly to 49 per cent., but that resulted from a general drop in turnout and it was still significantly higher than in 1995. I worry that turnout might drop if we held the elections on a different day.</p>

 I am confused, and not for the first time. The hon. Lady&#146;s argument on turnout is precisely the opposite of one made by her colleagues in the Scottish Parliament on the introduction of the single transferable vote. I was a member of the Committee that considered that issue; we were told that the Scottish electorate would be so galvanised by the introduction of the single transferable vote that they would turn out in their droves at local government elections held under that system. Is it not the reality that she&#151;and, unfortunately, Labour colleagues in the Scottish Executive&#151;is frightened of having Scottish local government elections on a different day because they know that STV will be a damp squib that will not return hundreds and thousands of people to the polls?</p>

 I certainly think that making every vote count would be an additional incentive for people to go to the polls. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is as concerned about turnout as I am, and that he would not decide to settle on only one solution to try to increase turnout. If there were other ways of doing it, he would surely embrace them as well. That is why I think that holding elections on the same day, in addition to STV, makes sense.</p>

 I am intrigued. Why does the hon. Lady think that turnout for local council elections in Scotland is so much higher than for those in England? We are lucky to get 32 per cent. or 35 per cent. in England, but the hon. Lady was talking about well over 45 per cent. in Scotland.</p>

 Indeed, the turnout in Scotland was  45 per cent. even in 1995, before the elections were held on the same day. I am not sure why; perhaps people in Scotland are more politically aware. We always hear from Conservative Members that the UK is being ruled by a Scottish raj; perhaps Scottish people are intrigued by politics. However, that may not be the case. Interesting research could be done on that issue.</p>

 The hon. Lady is straying into giving ammunition to an argument of which she should really steer clear. She compares turnout of 45 per cent. in 1995 with the 32 per cent. of the most recent English local elections. However, I remember campaigning vigorously in the English local elections of 1995, and there was a very high turnout. One cannot compare one election with another that happened 10 years later. </p>

Lady believes that it is axiomatic that the very fact of having an STV election will mean a higher turnout? If she does believe that, how does she explain the low turnout for the European elections under STV&#151;I mean the proportional system?</p>

 The Minister makes my point; the European elections are not held under the STV system. I have pointed out that I do not think that the European election system is a great system of proportional representation, although it is better than the first-past-the-post system because it allows more proportionality.</p>

 Is the hon. Lady saying that people would turn out to vote if we replaced the d&#146;Hondt system with an STV one? Does the d&#146;Hondt system explain why an extra 100,000 or 200,000 people do not come out to vote? Is she saying that people are abstaining from casting a vote in a democratic election for a Member of the European Parliament because they do not like the d&#146;Hondt system and prefer an STV one? Does she seriously expect us to believe that?</p>

 There are many reasons. People do not necessarily deliberately abstain in a European election; in 1999, the turnout was 24 per cent. or 25 per cent. For many reasons, such elections are not much covered by the media. However, as a general rule, the more people feel that their vote counts, the more likely they are to vote. In the same way, there is often a higher turnout in marginal constituencies because the parties campaign more vigorously and people see that their votes are more likely to make a difference.</p>

 Is the hon. Lady contending that there is a hierarchy, that under first past the post people do not feel that their votes count, that the d&#146;Hondt system is more proportional so people will feel that their votes will count more and that STV is the better system, under which people&#146;s votes absolutely count? If that were the case, one would expect turnout for Westminster elections to be lower, turnout in elections under the d&#146;Hondt system to be higher and turnout in the STV local council elections next year to be the highest of all. May I wager with her that that will be the opposite of what will happen?</p>

 That is far too simplistic. There is a hierarchy, and STV brings about the best situation. However, I do not propose STV mainly as a way of increasing turnout, but for reasons to which I shall come in a second.</p>

massive Labour majorities, so what is the point in voting? Of course, there would be an increase under proportional representation in such constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="st_140"><a name="06072048000236"><a name="60720h0006.htm_spnew7"><a name="06072048000493"><b>Jo Swinson:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. There are issues with the European elections. Although a benefit of proportionality is introduced, there is the disbenefit of the parties still having a lot of control and voters not getting to choose individual candidates, although they like to make that choice. My solution would be to move to STV. Various arguments are made against that, among which is one that the Scottish people will be unable to work out the different systems if elections are held on the one day. However, the systems are fairly simple in respect of voting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="60720h0006.htm_para1"><a name="06072048000237">Obviously, as a Liberal Democrat, I am interested in constitutional affairs, voting systems and so on. However, I appreciate that I am not necessarily representative of the population. However, people do not need to understand exactly how quotas are calculated or how many excess votes will be transferred for candidates to meet their quota and be elected or to be eliminated, nor do they need to get down to 1.26 of a vote going one way or another. People do not need to know any of that to cast their vote under the single transferable vote system. They only need to be able to rank the candidates in order. We rank things in order all day, every day, filling in surveys and making choices as consumers.</p>

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="06072048000238"><a name="60720h0006.htm_spnew8"><a name="06072048000494"><b>David Mundell:</b>
 Yes, but the hon. Lady is making a spurious argument. The point about ranking candidates on the same day is that on one ballot people are asked to place an X and on the other they are asked to write 1, 2 and 3. We have clear evidence from elections in Northern Ireland&#151;I had the opportunity to see the count in the last Assembly elections&#151;of large numbers of people who understood that they had more than one vote but who, despite 20-odd years of operating that system, put two Xs on the ballot paper, making it invalid. Even if we accept the argument for STV, which I do not, what can be the purpose of holding such an election on the same day if&#151;as was again shown in the London mayoral elections&#151;having two separate systems exposes us to the risk of a disproportionately large number of people spoiling their ballots?</p>

<p><a name="st_142"><a name="06072048000239"><a name="60720h0006.htm_spnew9"><a name="06072048000495"><b>Jo Swinson:</b>
 Northern Ireland holds first-past-the-post elections and STV elections on the same day, but the number of spoiled ballots is not dramatically high, at 1.4 per cent., which is only slightly higher than the figure for the equivalent elections in Scotland. However, that is of course a good argument for having strong educational programmes and ensuring that the information is available. That issue is also an argument for another point&#151;which the Arbuthnott report should have addressed&#151;in relation to holding STV elections for the Scottish Parliament too, which would be a simpler and better solution. Many hon. Members have referred to that, which would clearly help the situation. Indeed, I welcomed the comments that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central made in opening the debate in support of STV for the Holyrood elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="60720h0006.htm_para2"><a name="06072048000240">My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute outlined some of the advantages of that system, which I shall run through. It would give voters more choice, making the list open, so that they could choose which candidates they wanted, rather than that being decided by party hierarchies. Those who were elected would also be more representative of the population, because there would be a degree of proportionality, which would be an obvious advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="60720h0006.htm_para3"><a name="06072048000241">STV for the Scottish Parliament would also mean that a constituency link would be retained, even though the constituencies are larger. One of the arguments that is often made against proportional systems is that multi-member constituencies ensure that Members still have a responsibility to, and a link with, their constituencies. If voters have a problem, they can also decide which Member to go to. I am sure that all hon. Members in the Chamber are assiduous in dealing with their constituents&#146; concerns, but someone living in a constituency where the MP is a bit rubbish at dealing with concerns does not have much choice. As we all know, because of the protocols, if a constituent from another constituency asks us to help them, we are constrained from doing so. With multiple Members in a constituency, if one of them does not give help, somebody else can be approached for assistance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="60720h0006.htm_para4"><a name="06072048000242">Multi-member constituencies also give voters the chance to support different parties if they so choose. We all campaign in elections, telling people to use their votes for the Liberal Democrat, Conservative, Labour or nationalist candidates, depending on the individual concerned. However, some voters out there do not have such party loyalty&#151;we are probably in the minority in that regard&#151;and would perhaps like to support a particularly assiduous local councillor, even though they did not like their party, and express further preferences in support of different parties. Multi-Member constituencies would give voters more choice over the type of representatives that they end up with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="60720h0006.htm_para5"><a name="06072048000243">Multi-member constituencies would also encourage more diverse candidates, and therefore elected representatives. For argument&#146;s sake, if a party fields three or four white male candidates in a constituency, it will be quite obvious that it fields candidates who are all the same. I am sure that we would all agree that there is not enough diversity in this place, of gender, ethnicity and so on.</p>

 I do not know whether the hon. Lady is aware of the evidence that was given to the Scottish Parliament&#146;s Local Government and Transport Committee on the matter, which demonstrated that where proportional systems and the STV system had both been used, there was absolutely no impact on the gender balance within the Parliament concerned. Australia is a good example of that. Subsequently, those arguing the case, at least on that point, had to drop it, because the argument is totally spurious. As my party has recognised, a party&#146;s internal procedures determine who goes forward on behalf of that party. The electorate do not use proportional systems to change that.</p>

recent local elections, in which not many female candidates stood&#151;voters have clearly made that choice, perhaps voting for a woman from one of the parties, alongside other candidates. People do distinguish. Multi-member elections would also force parties not to put up slates of candidates who are very similar in their backgrounds, the way that they look and where they come from.</p>

 Will the hon. Lady not accept that that is precisely what her party does and what my party does not do? She has been railing against manipulation by party hierarchies, as an argument against the closed-list system, but she cannot produce any evidence to refute the point that was made by the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell), who is actually half right in this instance. Is not the benefit of our system that parties can actively and positively promote gender balance in lists, by having male and female candidates, twining constituencies and so on? Those are all positive steps that the Labour party has taken, which is why we have a far better gender balance, both in the Scottish Parliament and here, whereas the hon. Lady&#146;s party talks a good game and appeals to <i>The</i><i>Guardian</i>-reading classes in its rhetoric but, when it comes to making tough decisions on such matters in its internal party structures, it flunks it every time.</p>

 I refer the Minister to his party&#146;s record in local government in Scotland, which, at 20 per cent., is appalling. All the other parties&#151;even the Conservative party and the SNP&#151;manage one quarter and my party manages about 30 per cent. The difference is that my party manages to do that through supporting and mentoring positive action measures, yet without resorting to positive discrimination. I accept that that might be the only way to achieve gender balance in the Labour party, but there are alternatives. </p>

 Thank you, Mr. Caton. I have outlined the arguments for the single transferable vote, particularly the fact that every vote counts. When we have disengagement from the political process, it is important that we encourage parties to campaign across the country and across constituencies, not only in those few marginal constituencies, to maximise their vote share. The STV system would engage people and ensure that more people went out to vote, which is what we all want.</p>

That is not really the subject of the debate, but to respond briefly, the issue requires some discussion, although the suggestion from Conservative Members would not work. Apart from anything else, power is currently devolved to the Scottish Parliament, not ceded, which means that different constitutional difficulties would arise. Indeed, it would be unfair to impose a de facto English Government and English Parliament, meeting on Monday and Tuesday, as the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) suggested, without allowing the English people a democratic vote on that in a referendum.

 I hope that you have found this an enlightening debate on matters Scottish, Mr. Caton. I have three things to declare. First, I was a witness to the Arbuthnott commission and therefore get a mention in the report in that, as a Member of the Scottish Parliament, I proposed a Bill to split the local government and Scottish Parliament elections, for reasons that I will come to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="60720h0006.htm_para8"><a name="06072048000255">Secondly, I was a Member of the Scottish Parliament for the South of Scotland region. We have heard much talk about the roles and responsibilities of regional MSPs. I want to touch on that, but most of all I proudly wish to declare that I voted against the introduction of the single transferable vote in the Scottish Parliament&#151;sadly, along with only two Labour MSPs&#151;and in the coming months and next year, the logic of doing that will be clearer than ever. I am afraid that, during the contributions of the hon. Members for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) and for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson), I was no more convinced of the case for the single transferable vote, particularly in the context of the contribution of the hon.

Although Government Members have suggested different numbers for the make-up of the Scottish Parliament, I hope that at least some of them will accept that 108 is a workable number. Indeed, some have suggested that, if there were fewer MSPs with more focus on their duties within the Scottish Parliament, Members might not perceive that they were interfering so much in their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para0"><a name="06072048000269">I completely reject the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine) in his interventions that people who are not elected by the first-past-the-post system are somehow losers who are then elected in another way. Similar arguments were, unfortunately, voiced during many of the debates on the Government of Wales Bill. I accept the legitimate argument that we want a first-past-the-post system rather than PR, but people must accept that if we move to PR, we will move away from the traditional system of having winners and losers. It is as simple as that. I shall not repeat the quote from the Arbuthnott report  <br>

that the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire read out setting out the reasons why that should not be split, although it was the one sensible contribution that he made to the debate. I do not know why Scottish Ministers have held firm on that, but I commend them for doing so rather than going down the spurious and unhelpful route taken by the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para1"><a name="06072048000270">As my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) has pointed out, the Labour party plays fast and loose with the old winners and losers argument. Indeed, the lady who lost the Blaenau Gwent seat in the general election has been appointed to the House of Lords and will now be able to legislate on behalf of Wales. I do not recall, from my days in the Scottish Parliament, the chant of &#147;loser&#148; coming from the Labour Benches when Mr. Peter Peacock&#151;the Labour MSP and Minister for Education and Young People&#151;or Maureen MacMillan, stood up. I shall be pleased, therefore, if the commission&#146;s report has done nothing more than put that idea to rest.</p>

He let us into the secret that he and his colleagues are whipping up English nationalism. My hon.

 We are straying into some unsavoury territory. There is nothing wrong with recognising the new positive English nationalism that has emerged, particularly in the past few months. That can be completely disassociated from all the horrible racist nonsense that comes from the BNP. Even the hon. Gentleman, down here, must recognise that a big cultural debate is going on, which is starting to be reflected in a very positive English nationalism. I recommend that he read some of Billy Bragg&#146;s words on this issue. I am sure that he would find them worth a read.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para7"><a name="06072048000291">I am concerned about local government and Scottish Parliament elections being held on the same day, and have repeatedly raised that issue. I am particularly concerned that I am not aware, as a voter in Scotland, of any voter education programme having been carried out. I am slightly older than the hon. Lady and therefore was not party to modern studies classes on the subject, but I would wager that if we were to walk down Argyle street in Glasgow and ask people what they thought the STV was, they would tell us that it was a television station. That is the reality.</p>

<p><a name="st_173"><a name="06072048000292"><a name="60720h0007.htm_spnew15"><a name="06072048000526"><b>Mr. Walker:</b>

 Just as one would for midge bites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para8"><a name="06072048000294">More urgently needs to be done to address the issue of the lack of understanding of the STV system. One single thing could be done&#151;and this is where I reject the Secretary of State&#146;s response at the recent Committee meeting. It is an interest of his, because he is responsible in respect of the Scottish Parliament elections being on the same day as the Scottish local government elections. He should bring what influence he has to bear on the matter. He told us that he was in regular text contact with Jack McConnell. He could send Jack a text now saying, &#147;Stop this lunacy. Step back from having these two elections on the same day.&#148; It is not too late to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para9"><a name="06072048000295">If the argument of the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire is right&#151;I disagree with it, but let us put it to the test&#151;that STV will increase voter turnout, why are people afraid to have the elections on separate days? The evidence is there in the Arbuthnott commission&#146;s comments about the London mayoral elections: muddling two systems on the same day leads to a much higher proportion of spoilt ballots. We all talk about the difficulty of getting people out to vote. It is ridiculous that when we do, hundreds of thousands of people&#146;s votes are rendered invalid. That is what happened in the London mayoral and Assembly elections. There is no excuse for carrying on with this situation, and I make a final call to make progress on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para10"><a name="06072048000296">I have always argued, interestingly, that we need to have a better definition of the role of regional MSPs. That is a difficulty within the Scottish Parliament. As I said in my comments to the hon. Member for Glasgow, South-West, in the Scottish Parliament, Labour has not taken that issue forward. Its Members of this House have said a lot about that issue, but within the Scottish Parliament it has not got a grip of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para11"><a name="06072048000297">The other sensible thing said by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire was that the contributions of Members of the Scottish Parliament, particularly regional Members, vary enormously. Some people go round vast regions, but others do not. There is no clear guidance on the issue. It is hypocrisy to suggest that if other parties were in a different position, they would not do some of the so-called &#147;shadowing&#148;, because clearly they would. We need the Scottish Parliament to have clear guidelines about what regional MSPs are expected to do. That could be addressed tomorrow without any legislation or difficulties. If I recall it correctly, if the Conservatives and Labour on the Scottish Parliament&#146;s corporate body were to combine, they would have a majority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para12"><a name="06072048000298">I have made the argument against STV. The AMS has a lot of issues with it and we have touched on those. I am not particularly in favour of open lists, because they are not the panacea that is presented by the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire. The evidence from Australia demonstrates that when people have the choice either to select from an open list or just vote for a party list, more than 90 per cent. of people vote for the party list. In countries such as Finland, which have open lists, certain people tend to be elected. This is not a direct criticism, but one of Finland&#146;s MEPs is a famous rally driver and another was involved in the modelling industry. The downside of the open list is that it can play to the cult of celebrity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para15"><a name="06072048000302">I want to say something clearly from the outset: the report came out in January, and in the normal course of events it would have been the Government&#146;s firm intention to respond to it and to give our views definitively on its recommendations by now. However, we became aware that the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs was holding an inquiry into the report, and obviously it would not have been appropriate to bring out our response before that. As the only recommendation from that Committee was that we have a debate on the issue, it would again not have been appropriate for us to bring out our response, particularly as it requested us not to do so until this debate took place.</p>

I wish to take this opportunity to put on record the new Secretary of State&#146;s gratitude to Sir John and the members of the commission for all the hard work they have done throughout the 18 months of their inquiry and for their wide-ranging report.</p>

Not all of them are for us in this House; some of them are for the Scottish Parliament and others are for the Scottish Executive or the Electoral Commission. It is for others to come forward with their responses to the recommendations as and when. I know that the First Minister has written to Sir John thanking him for the recommendations, particularly those that fall within his sphere of responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para19"><a name="06072048000306">As has been said by several speakers in the debate, the commission was set up in the middle of 2004 by the previous Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South-West (Mr. Darling), following the decision taken by this Parliament on the reduction in the number of Scottish MPs and subsequently the retention of the original size of the Scottish Parliament, and the decision by the Scottish Parliament to introduce the single transferable vote for Scottish local government elections in May 2007, of which we have heard a great deal today. The remit was to examine the consequences of having four different voting systems in local and parliamentary elections in Scotland and different boundaries between Westminster and Scottish Parliament constituencies.</p>

I do not propose to go through all of them today because some are not for this House to adjudicate on but are for other bodies. The main recommendations include retaining the current mixed-member system for electing the Scottish Parliament, but with reform of the open lists, and basing constituency and regional boundaries for the Scottish Parliament on local authority areas rather than Westminster constituencies, with the regions revised better to reflect natural local communities. The most recent revision of Westminster constituencies had as one of its two yardsticks the degree to which the new constituencies were based on  <br>

local communities and local authority boundaries, with the result that my constituency is now exactly coterminous with my local authority, so harmonisation along the lines that Sir John and his commission advocated may already be under way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para22"><a name="06072048000309">The commission also made a clear recommendation that candidates for election to the Scottish Parliament should not be prohibited from standing in a constituency and on the regional list. There was a call for clearer and more defined and delineated roles for constituency and regional MSPs which, from my reading, mirrors closely the same delineation proposed by Roy Jenkins in his report in 1998 on, as you will remember, Mr. Caton, possible voting reforms for this House. He recommended broadly similar delineation of the roles that new regional MPs could take and I noted with interest that it was roughly similar to the conclusions that Sir John arrived at in his report. As the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) said, there was also a recommendation that the single transferable vote system should be introduced for European parliamentary elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para23"><a name="06072048000310">The way in which the commission went about gathering evidence was exemplary and difficult to fault in any way. The report is complex and political. It is difficult to think of something that interests politicians more deeply than the way in which we are elected and the systems under which we operate. The commission operated in a highly complex and political area and it is clear from the report that there was not unanimity in all the recommendations. The commission did an exhaustive job, not least in putting all the current relevant issues on the table and allowing them to be debated here in Parliament today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para24"><a name="06072048000311">As the Secretary of State said at the time of publication, we had not reached a conclusion on a number of the recommendations because we wanted to hear what was being said in debates such as this one today. However, he said clearly at that time that because of where the date of publication fell in the parliamentary calendar it would simply not be possible to forward any of the recommendations that require primary legislation before the elections in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="60720h0007.htm_para25"><a name="06072048000312">Those elections are complicated. The system for administering any election is complicated, but, as there was a brand new system for local authority elections under STV in Great Britain and an ambitious Electoral Administration Bill going through Parliament&#151;I am pleased that it received Royal Assent a few days ago&#151;to bring forward new ways of conducting elections and new rules for electoral registration officers and for joint valuation boards in Scotland, it was simply not practical to introduce primary legislation to implement any of the report&#146;s recommendations. That was clear from day one and I do not think anyone has gainsaid that. Some of the issues that we have discussed&#151;for example, dual candidacy, which would require an amendment to the Scotland Act 1998, and moving the day of the Scottish Parliament elections, which is also fixed in the  1998 Act&#151;were never going to be enacted by 2007 because they required primary legislation.</p>

of factors. First, we are introducing STV, which is a novel system that requires us, as those who write the rules by which elections are administered, to ensure that we have the greatest possible clarity for the people who will take part in it. Because of the decision to have STV, it has been confirmed that we will move to e-counting. A great deal has been said about that during the debate. Great care is required to ensure that the ballot paper can be read by the machine. Because of those twin impetuses&#151;should that be &#147;impeti&#148;?&#151;it was logical and compelling to look at the ballot papers for the Scottish Parliament elections and we can do that absum primary legislation.

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="60720h0008.htm_para1"><a name="06072048000314">It was always clear that any recommendation requiring primary legislation would not be enacted before 2007. That also means that there has been no urgent rush to introduce definite conclusions in the Government&#146;s response. However, it should not be assumed that because we have not introduced proposals to implement recommendations before 2007 that is off the agenda for all time and will never happen. We made it clear that we would not do anything before 2007, but that should be not understood as meaning that we will not do anything after the 2007 elections.</p>

 What does the Minister anticipate his reaction would be if there were a request from the Scottish Parliament to change its voting system to the single transferable vote after the Scottish Parliament elections next year?</p>

 It would be for the Scottish Parliament to bring forward such a recommendation to this House and for the House to make such a decision. However, obviously we would have to bear in mind the fact that Sir John Arbuthnott does not make such a recommendation. He does not recommend, as some thought he would and to the disappointment of those who genuinely and legitimately favour the single transferable vote, that that course of action should be followed for the Scottish Parliament. It is entirely for the Scottish Parliament to make that recommendation to this House if it wishes to do so, but the method by which the Scottish Parliament is elected is a matter reserved to this House. I would not wish to pre-empt the decision that the House might wish to make.</p>

For clarity, we have it on the record that Mr. McConnell does not have the capacity to offer the Liberal Democrats the single transferable vote as a system of election for the Scottish Parliament in negotiations over the formation of a Scottish Executive next year.</p>

 I am not entirely sure for whose benefit such a matter has been put on the record, because it is blindingly obvious to anyone with even a cursory, passing acquaintance with the Scotland Act 1998 that it is for this House to decide how the elections to the Scottish Parliament should take place, and what should be the shape of the Scottish Parliament and the voting system under which that election should take place. I am happy to have it on the record, but I cannot imagine that it will come as a surprise to anybody, because it has been the case since the Scotland Act was passed.</p>

 The Minister said that it is the right of this Parliament to determine the electoral system for the Scottish Parliament. Will he give me an assurance today that it is, and will always remain, the Government&#146;s policy that whatever electoral system is used for the Scottish Parliament the seats allocated are roughly proportional to the votes cast?</p>

 I am being invited to speculate on the outcome of a request, which may or may not happen as a result of some negotiations that have yet to occur following an election that has not even happened yet. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for regarding that as one hypothetical question too many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="60720h0008.htm_para2"><a name="06072048000321">The Scotland Act is entirely clear; it was born out of the discussions of the Scottish Constitutional Convention that took place for many years and to which his party was an honourable participant, with my party, the trade unions, the Churches, civic society and all those who had Scotland&#146;s best interests at heart. It was a source of great regret at the time, and it remains so, that two parties refused to take part in the constitutional convention: the Scottish National party stood on the sidelines moaning and whingeing because, given the opportunity of engaging in a debate and actually having some influence, it chose to stand to one side, and the Tory party, which was dead agin the whole notion of devolution from the start and opposed it tooth and nail. It is now embarking on a policy choice that will inevitably lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. As I said in Scottish questions last week, I well understand why the Scottish National party supports that as it is in its interest to make Parliament unworkable, to create multiple categories of MPs from Scotland, from Wales, from Northern Ireland and from London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="60720h0008.htm_para3"><a name="06072048000322">Where will it end? I firmly wager that, once we have multiple categories of MP, those living in the countryside in farming communities will ask why people in towns and cities are voting on agricultural matters that do not affect them. People living in fishing communities will ask why MPs in land-locked constituencies are voting on issues that do not affect them&#151;</p>

 I will give way in a second. In a unitary country we have a unitary Parliament where every hon. Member has the right to vote on whatever legislation happens to come before them. Once that principle is breached&#151;it is the policy of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party&#151;it will lead to this Parliament becoming unworkable, which will lead to the inevitable breach of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="60720h0008.htm_para4"><a name="06072048000325">In all seriousness, I appeal to those Conservatives who consider themselves Conservatives and Unionists to rethink that policy and go along with the reservations expressed by the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) and the hon. Member for Woodspring  (Dr. Fox). The <i>Daily Mail</i>, for goodness sake, is saying that the Tory party should think again; Peter Oborne is saying that the Tory party should think again. The hon. Gentleman should listen to his friends.</p>

 We did warn that devolution would put the Union under stress. Does the Minister not think that it is unjust that Scottish Members of Parliament can vote on matters to do with the NHS, for example, that relate purely to my constituents in England? That seems terribly unfair.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman gave the very interesting example in his speech of the smoking ban. He seemed to be suggesting that Scottish MPs had voted on a discrete Bill. It was not; the smoking ban was a measure contained in the Health Improvement and Protection Bill, which had lots of clauses that applied in Scotland. His proposal is not English votes for English Bills, because not even his party could certify that Bill as an England-only Bill. It was a clause within a Bill.</p>

 I will give way in a moment. Not only will we have multiple categories of MP voting on different Bills under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal, but if we take the smoking ban as an example there will be multiple categories of MP, some voting on some clauses of the Bill and some voting on other clauses&#151; because the smoking ban in that Bill does not apply in Northern Ireland, they would have to vote on different clauses.</p>

 The Health Bill did not apply only to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency&#151;he is plain wrong on that as it did not simply apply to England. Under proposals announced by the Tory Party democracy commission&#151;whoever thought we would hear those words in the same sentence&#151;the certification of Bills would not have applied to that particular piece of legislation and clauses and amendments would have had to be certified. The hon. Gentleman may shake his head, but that is the simple fact. He brought up the example of the smoking ban, which is part and parcel of a wider Bill that did not apply only to England.</p>
