 It is particularly appropriate that you should be in the Chair for this important and timely debate, Mr. Bercow. I welcome the new Minister to his post and give him my good wishes. I wrote, on behalf of the International Development Committee, to the new Prime Minister before he took up office to ask him to beef up the Department for International Development and to give it an appropriate number of Ministers. I am glad that he has done so, and I expect that the Minister appreciates having three colleagues rather than only one, as would have been the case in the previous Administration. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply and to the future engagements that I am sure that members of the Committee will have with him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para2"><a name="07070556000008">Obviously, events have moved on since we produced our report, and not for the better. When it was published, in January, after our November visit to Palestine and Israel, we were particularly concerned, from a development point of view, that although an increasing amount of development aid was going to the occupied territories, poverty was also increasing at a high rate. The reasons for that were not hard to find, and I shall address them, as the report has done. We said in the report that the situation was unsustainable and would deteriorate, stating:</p>
<a name="70705h0001.htm_brev0"><a name="07070556000262"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The danger of the current approach is that it might push Hamas into a corner which encourages violence rather than negotiation.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para4"><a name="07070556000010">The events of the past two or three weeks show that that was not an inappropriate analysis. Indeed, last year, Jan Egeland described Gaza as a &#147;ticking time bomb&#148;. Unfortunately, it has now exploded and the fallout is not yet clear. The takeover of Gaza by Hamas was brutal and unjustified, but the failure to secure recognition of its election victory may have contributed to its frustration, at least in part.</p>

 We know that, and I might come to that point later. I could retort to the hon. Lady that Israel is illegally occupying a significant piece of territory that does not belong to the state of Israel, and yet it does not always suffer the same degree of international condemnation for so doing, but I do not want to justify one wrong against another. I shall address her point in slightly more detail later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para6"><a name="07070556000014">Like all hon. Members, I am sure, I very much welcome the release of Alan Johnston this week. His kidnapping was deeply stressful and was damaging to the Palestinian cause. Clearly, Hamas will want to take credit for the release, or at least to tell the world that it indicates that it has control of the security situation in Gaza. We were unable to visit Gaza because of the security situation. The previous Secretary of State managed to get in shortly afterwards, but others have found it difficult. It is effectively a prison, sealed off by land, air and sea, with virtually no resources and no functioning economy. The question that we have to concern ourselves with is: how is the basic essence of life to be maintained there?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para7"><a name="07070556000015">Our former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is to take up the role of Quartet representative. He faces an awesome challenge and a crisis of credibility with the Palestinians, given his close ties to the Bush Administration and to Israel. How can he mobilise international assistance, as he has been specifically asked to do, let alone develop the economy of Gaza in those circumstances without talking to Hamas? He will have to do so sooner or later. If he were here, I would say to him that Hamas will have to be involved in talks at some stage, as part of the wider process, just as on the path to peace in Northern Ireland he had to talk to Sinn Fein and the IRA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para8"><a name="07070556000016">Our report, and its timing, were motivated by the fact that while international aid and the UK&#146;s contribution to the occupied territories was rising, incomes were falling and poverty was increasing, with the most vulnerable&#151;older people, women and children&#151;suffering the most. I shall not go into the statistics now, but they show how deeply people were affected in practical ways. As our report says, that situation was directly attributable to two facts, the first of which was the withholding of revenue from the Palestinian Authority: both the customs revenue collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and budget support from international donors. The second fact was the effective blockade of Gaza and the total disruption of access and movement around the west bank, both of which were imposed by the Israeli Government.</p>

 Our Committee&#146;s focus was the alleviation and tackling of poverty, but we cannot tackle poverty in the west bank and Gaza without considering the politics and economic realities. The right hon.

 I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention, because that is the essence of our argument. Our report is an International Development Committee report, but I make no apology for straying into politics, because we cannot deliver development in the occupied territories without some form of political settlement. I want to know how it will be possible to deliver humanitarian assistance and support to the people of Gaza if we do not talk to the people who are in control there. I do not see how that assistance can be delivered in any other way.</p>

Its employees, by which I mean not only civil servants but nurses, teachers, doctors&#151;essential workers&#151;went unpaid, and, as a result, many went on strike. Economic activity was paralysed by the restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para10"><a name="07070556000020">The Quartet is unequivocal in its requirements of Hamas and, if I may say this to the hon.

 I am sure that the hon. Lady will have many more such quotes. I want to reassure her that I endorse nothing of what Hamas says, stands for or does in terms of violence. I am not here as an apologist for Hamas; I am here as a political realist, accepting the fact that, whether we like it or not, Hamas was elected by the people of Palestine. However, it has been denied the right to have any kind of engagement.</p>

That is the essence of my point. I am not asking anyone to like or appreciate Hamas, but at some point we will have to talk to it. It is my belief that Tony Blair, in his position, may have to talk to it sooner rather than later.</p>

There were indications of difficulties in that regard. Are hospitals and schools functioning? What measures are in hand to provide long-term support&#151;access and movement? Is the temporary international mechanism&#151;TIM&#151;continuing or are steps in hand for salary payments to be restored directly, through the Palestinian Authority? If that happens, will they be backdated, and if so, will TIM contributions be in any way deducted from or charged to the PA? While we were there, that possibility was mooted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para15"><a name="07070556000028">On the west bank, are the number of restrictions increasing or diminishing? Is work continuing on the security fence? Is the development of E1 still on hold? Are other settlements on the west bank still expanding? Those are real questions; we need to know whether the situation has changed positively or negatively. I suspect that I know what the answers are, but if the Minister has up-to-date information, hon. Members would be happy to hear it.</p>

I believe that Israel and the Quartet are taking a significant risk by investing their support so directly and completely in President Abbas. His Fatah party was defeated at the elections to the Palestinian Authority largely because of public disaffection with extravagance and corruption in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70705h0001.htm_para18"><a name="07070556000031">Many Palestinians, most of whom had voted for Fatah, told the Committee that they felt they were being punished for a democratic vote.

who support what Hamas stands for, although some might have voted for it. The Palestinians have made many mistakes for which they are paying, and Israel has legitimate security concerns, which they are addressing robustly. Nevertheless, we face a long haul, in which the ordinary, beleaguered Palestinians face unreasonable hardship, are prevented from developing their own economic salvation from what should be a productive economy, and find that Israel is free to impose disproportionate reprisals, seal off activity and continue an illegal occupation without let or hindrance.

 I, too, welcome the Minister to his new position, and to this debate in particular. This is an area of the world in which I know he has a genuine personal interest. Both he and I were observers to the Palestinian parliamentary elections in January 2006. All the international observers agreed that those elections were fair and democratic.

It seemed to come from a script that was written before anyone had read our report and that representatives of the Departments concerned rehearsed before us during evidence sessions. As a result of those evidence sessions, we produced a report that challenged some fundamental inconsistencies in the approach hitherto adopted by not only the UK, but the EU and the Quartet. The inconsistencies and challenges that we outlined were based not on prejudice or conjecture but on the evidence that we had received in our evidence sessions and what we saw with our own eyes when we went to the area. When we produced those challenges, we got back a response that simply repeated that script complete with the same inconsistencies.</p>

movement restrictions; closures; Israel&#146;s construction of a wall and of settlements on land that does not belong to it; the economic and military blockade of Gaza by Israel; and the withholding of millions of dollars of tax revenues. Our report makes it clear that, although those are the causes of the suffering, the imposition of a boycott policy on Hamas and then on the national unity Government by the Quartet has made that bad situation even worse and even more dangerous.</p>

 On the Government of national unity, will the hon.

 On the second point, we will wait and see. I welcome any release of money, but I am not sure that the money that my hon. Friend mentions has actually been released yet. Similarly, the Israelis gave a commitment to release 250 prisoners, but I am not sure that that has happened yet either, although I am aware that more arrests have been made. On the question of why no money was released, let us be clear that the boycott was put in place and maintained during a Hamas ceasefire; it was introduced not in response to terrorism, but in the context of a ceasefire. So what my hon. Friend says is simply factually incorrect.</p>

We told the Palestinians to go down the path of democracy, but then shunned the Government who came out of the elections that we supervised. We told Hamas to turn away from violence and to commit to democracy, so it stood for election, suspended its attacks on Israel and offered a long-term ceasefire. When that happened, we ignored those changes and, as my hon. Friend made clear, we are still not admitting that they took place.

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para1"><a name="07070556000047">We are absolutely right to say that all those ingredients are essential to a long-term solution, but we made them preconditions to even talking to the elected Hamas Government. We have never applied similar preconditions in other situations and we certainly do not apply them to Israel, despite the fact that it does not live up to them, as was proved in evidence before the Committee. For example, Israel has never, in practice, renounced violence in pursuit of its objectives. It also continues to violate its own obligations under international law and existing agreements through its continued occupation of Palestinian land and its construction of a wall, not along its own lawful borders, but beyond them. That was confirmed in evidence that the Committee received.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para2"><a name="07070556000048">The trouble is that our boycott has provided a cover for the economic and military blockade of Gaza, which has cut off most Palestinian trade access by land, sea and air. Last month, Christian Aid reported that more than 80 per cent. of the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza are without a regular income. Are we trying to address that through measures such as the temporary international mechanism? Of course we are, but the bitter irony is that we are now having to spend more on emergency food and medical aid to a Palestinian population caged in by the boycott and by isolation than we ever did before we imposed the boycott. That aid is more expensive and less effective than it would have been, because we have insisted on bypassing the very institutions that we would need to use to deliver it effectively. That has helped to increase unemployment among public sector workers and to deepen poverty across the west bank and Gaza. As a result, we now have to put in even more aid to offset the effect of our own policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para3"><a name="07070556000049">The crisis in Gaza is getting even worse. Only last week, a mother of five, aged 31, died because she was one of thousands of people who were stuck at the Rafah crossing after Israel closed the border. People were stuck outside in the searing heat, in some cases without any shelter. We should remember that the border is not between Israel and Gaza, but between Gaza and Egypt. If we are to help the people of Gaza, we must do something about that. The international community and indeed the EU are meant to have monitors there, but our ability to affect the situation seems to be hampered by whether Israel allows the border to be opened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para4"><a name="07070556000050">If we want to help President Abbas, as I think we should, we should really do something about the continuing conditions of occupation in the west bank. We should insist that the release of tax revenues happens in practice and that it goes further. We should do more about prisoners; even some of our colleague parliamentarians&#151;some of those who were elected in the elections that my hon. Friend the Minister and I supervised&#151;have been abducted by Israel, in contravention, once again, of international law.</p>

our report, including illegal settlement building, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the fact that, under the EU-Israel association agreement, Israel continues to claim trade preferences for goods imported into the EU that are produced on illegal settlements, not in Israel.

 I am pleased to be called to speak today, and to see you in the Chair, Mr. Bercow. As a member of the Select Committee, you have taken a great interest in its work over many years.

The Committee not only produces effective reports; it gets up to a lot of other things as well. As I have said, the report was one of the last that I was involved in preparing, and although events have moved on considerably since it was published, it is still useful in outlining the immense challenges that we face. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) mentioned, the Government response was disappointing. However, I shall, I hope, touch on that aspect of the matter later.</p>

However, we are all aware of the former Prime Minister&#146;s role in the past 10 years, and his special friendship with the US Government. I for one am left wondering what he can do that he has not tried already. Will he be a force for good, or will his presence be a red rag to a bull? US and UK foreign policy in the region has not added much to its stability in recent years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para23"><a name="07070556000070">The ultimate solution must be the two-state solution, to which the UK Government have repeatedly stated their commitment. In time, the new Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary will presumably, like their predecessors, confirm that that is still the case: that is at the heart of the report. However, that solution cannot happen if one state is non-viable. At the moment, Israeli occupation of the west bank is making it impossible. If the Palestinians have their own state, it is increasingly likely that Palestine will be a failed state before it has a chance to grow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para24"><a name="07070556000071">The facts on the ground are incontrovertible. GDP is in decline. More than 1.3 million Palestinians are still living below the poverty line. Food insecurity rose by  13 per cent. during 2006, and between 25 June and  12 October 2006, 261 Gazans died&#151;60 of them children&#151;following Israeli air strikes in retaliation for rocket attacks. That is more than 10 times more than during the same period in 2005. During the same period, two Israelis were killed and 15 were injured by home-made rockets fired out of the Gaza strip. The number of checkpoints and road blocks, many of which the visiting members of the Select Committee saw during their visit, has increased by 40 per cent. during 2006, and more than half of the 700 km-long barrier route has been constructed, despite the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which declared the route to be in contravention of international law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para25"><a name="07070556000072">The facts of what is happening on the ground, many of which are detailed in the report and were seen by members of the Select Committee, show the difficulties that exist. Back-to-back transfers of goods at checkpoints have resulted in the destruction of fresh produce. The Select Committee Chairman, my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) referred to those problems and the fact that checkpoints, the barrier wall and the lack of aid getting through were destroying not only the day-to-day existence of men, women and children, but business life. That business life must develop if development assistance to the territories is to be reduced in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para26"><a name="07070556000073">As has been mentioned already, Israel&#146;s withholding of the Palestinian Authority&#146;s revenues and the withdrawal of budgetary assistance have come to an end, and the Israeli Government have agreed to release some of the funds to the authority. However, I do not believe that the international community put sufficient pressure on the Israeli Government to do that earlier. The freezing of funds, coupled with the western economic boycott, had crippled the Palestinian Authority, depriving key workers of pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para27"><a name="07070556000074">The key problem throughout has been the use of aid as a political tool; that does not work. It would be easier to understand Israel&#146;s withholding of such aid for political reasons if there were a track record of such action yielding political results. In reality, the withholding of aid has only worsened the situation in the west bank and increased feelings of distrust among  <br>

many Palestinian people. The temporary international mechanism has been established, and perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us how that is developing now and what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para28"><a name="07070556000075">Practical programmes to combat poverty in the Palestinian community are desperately needed, but we have a ridiculous situation in which some projects funded by UK and EU taxpayers are being blown up by the Israeli Government. When I was last in Palestine, I saw the remains of a bombed Palestinian police station, which was full of computers supplied by the UK Government&#151;the UK taxpayer&#151;to help to combat crime. One reason given to us for the attack, at the time, was that it was to deal with an unknown terrorist: to kill a terrorist who was being held at that police station. He fled when the building collapsed. Such contradictions are commonplace there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para29"><a name="07070556000076">Aid alone, however, will not solve the problem. In the report and in the Government&#146;s response, it emerges that Palestinians are the most aided people on the planet. If aid solved problems, we should not be having today&#146;s debate. We need real moves forward to make Palestine a viable place for inward investment, trade and economic development. On paper, the occupied territories enjoy a liberal market and trading regime; in reality, both internal economic activity and external trade are hugely disrupted every day. Encouraging words are useless unless they are backed by action. That leads me to the double standards applied in our treatment of Israel and Palestine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para30"><a name="07070556000077">Although severe pressure, including the withdrawal of humanitarian assistance, has been placed on Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, no comparable pressure has been put on Israel to meet its obligations under international treaties. The Government point out in their response to the Select Committee&#146;s report that the Quartet is asking nothing more than the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel&#146;s right to exist. I accept that, but I argue that what each side does is more important than what people say. That very point was confirmed in an exchange, during a Select Committee evidence session, between the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield and a Mr. Gooderham. He was asked:</p>
<a name="70705h0002.htm_brev11"><a name="07070556000280"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;So the theory is more important than the practice. That is what you are saying?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para31"><a name="07070556000078">Mr. Gooderham replied:</p>
<a name="70705h0002.htm_brev12"><a name="07070556000281"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I think it is, yes. I think so long as you have an organisation that is committed to violent means to achieve its political ends, then, yes.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para32"><a name="07070556000079">The final comment from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield was:</p>
<a name="70705h0002.htm_brev13"><a name="07070556000282"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;So you withdraw aid to the Palestinians because theoretically Hamas is committed to violence, even though they are not actually committing violence, but you do not do anything to Israel if they are theoretically in favour of the Roadmap, even if they are not abiding by their obligations under it?&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para33"><a name="07070556000080">The reply was yes: and that is what is happening on the ground. Hamas may regularly state its desire to wipe Israel off the map, but it is in no position to do so. Israel, on the other hand, does not explicitly call for the destruction of Palestine and often talks a good talk. Yet its wall-building programme, the theft, I would say,  <br>

of natural resources, and the expansion of settlements amount to doing that by stealth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para34"><a name="07070556000081">I should like the Quartet to focus less on what is said and more on what is done by both sides. Israeli policy on settlements and the building of the wall are dividing the country and enforcing an effective apartheid on the Palestinian people. The details of the construction of settlements in map 1 in the report show, as well as access roads, razor wire, the domination of demand on water supplies and the strategic location of the settlements on hilltops. Those developments are the actions of a regime that has ended all hope for many Palestinians that the west bank will ever become their homeland in a meaningful way, unless those settlements are removed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para35"><a name="07070556000082">Many of the report&#146;s recommendations are identical to those made back in 2004. That shows the absolute lack of any positive movement, despite a number of token gestures. Although it is important that the international community puts appropriate pressure on Hamas to change its position and renounce violence, that is better done through dialogue, rather than using isolation and intimidation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para36"><a name="07070556000083">We only have to look to Ireland to see the importance of getting rival factions round the negotiating table. Much has been made of the part that the former Prime Minister played in the resolution of the long-running problems in Northern Ireland, but we must remember the role of those leaders who were prepared to get round the negotiating table with people they clearly despised.</p>

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="07070556000084"><a name="70705h0002.htm_spnew1"><a name="07070556000317"><b>John Battle:</b>
 This is an important matter&#151;we are discussing the politics of the situation and the difficulty of having dialogue with people who use violence&#151;but the hon. Gentleman and all of us may recall that the business of getting people to move away from violence and to get round a table and have dialogue is incredibly complex, difficult and takes place by stages. That does not always mean handing over guns immediately, but may involve intermediaries to negotiate that difficult process over a long period. That does not pre-empt the possibility of dialogue.</p>

 The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The process is long drawn out. It has taken many years to get to the present stage, and clearly it will be many years before anything like a solution is found, but steps along the way&#151;even small steps&#151;are important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="70705h0002.htm_para37"><a name="07070556000086">In the end, if development assistance to the occupied territories becomes a thing of the past&#151;that is what we all want&#151;and there is peace in the region, the economy can again grow and support those who live there. We will get there only if there is leadership on all sides, with leaders who are prepared to negotiate without resorting to violence and leaders who show that they have a vision for a peaceful future. Let us hope that, if there is another such report from the Select Committee in three years, we will have moved on further than during the past three years.</p>

no doubt that the humanitarian and economic conditions described in considerable detail are unacceptable. The major issue that we must all address is how the situation can be changed. I believe that the report, well documented as it is, does not fully comprehend the reasons for the situation. It acknowledged in a number of different places that Israel has security problems, but it does not sufficiently understand the nature of Hamas, and it does not address the reasons for the situation, so that they can be addressed and rectified.</p>

Before progress can be made in resolving a deeply complex and unacceptable situation, it is important to recognise that Hamas is not a normal political organisation. Indeed, it is clear from Hamas statements recently, as well as in its charter and its actions, that it inspires ideological hatred based on religion.</p>

I have watched that cartoon, and what it underlines is unacceptable. It teaches hatred and the cult of death to young children.</p>

 My quotations illustrate the fundamental nature of Hamas, not one of its policies. I do not think that, on its own, that is a reason not to talk to someone, but failure to recognise the existence of the state of Israel at a time when Hamas is firing rockets on civilians outside Israel&#151;2,000 rockets have been fired since the settlers left Gaza&#151;tells me about the nature of the organisation.</p>

The way to do that was shown by this country when a special Palestinian conference was held in London in 2005, at which the Palestinian private sector declaration was signed with the Israelis and involved the World Bank. That put together proposals to develop the economy of and business in the Palestinian Authority and to involve the private sector. At a meeting hosted in Tokyo in March this year, a Japanese initiative launched a proposal to build a new industrial park on the west bank, and the Japanese pledged major investment there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para9"><a name="07070556000099">Negotiations are taking place between Israel and British Gas, which I hope are close to fruition, to supply Israel with gas from outside Gaza, with the royalties going to the Palestinian Authority. Work is going on with the Peres Centre for Peace and the Palestinian organisation, PalTrade. The World Economic Forum launched the Israeli-Palestinian Business Council in May this year. Those are all examples of economic co-operation that can take place between those authorities.</p>

 There are obviously many examples of constructive co-operation between Palestinians and Israelis in a business context, but does the hon. Lady not accept that, for such co-operation to deliver real economic benefits, all the restrictions need to be removed to enable economic transactions to take place? After all, Wolfensohn put his personal money into greenhouses in Gaza, and the people had to throw the produce away, because Israel would not allow them to the market. We had many examples of businesses on the west bank that simply could not get their people to work or their products even to the local markets, because of the restrictions. If Israel will not withdraw from the west bank and allow freedom of movement, none of that economic co-operation will deliver long-term benefits.</p>

 I agree that, to enable economic initiatives to flourish, there must be freedom of movement and a normalisation of relations, which means that there must be a peace treaty&#151;an agreed peace on agreed borders.

of references have been made to the security barrier. It would be much better if there were no need for any such barrier and if there were an agreed boundary, but it must be acknowledged that, since the barrier was put up, there has been a 70 per cent. reduction in civilian deaths by suicide bombings and a 90 per cent. reduction in incidents. Clearly, it has some relevance to the security situation.</p>

I ask them to remember that 8,000 Israeli settlers withdrew from Gaza, but that, since that withdrawal, more than 2,000 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israeli civilians. That is not a very good Palestinian response to withdrawal. However, it is paramount that an effort to restart negotiations takes place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para12"><a name="07070556000105">I am reminded not only of the Committee&#146;s visit to the west bank last November, but of my earlier visit to the Gaza strip as part of a parliamentary delegation organised by the Labour Middle East Council a few years ago. Visiting Gaza, one is struck by how small a piece of land it actually is. It is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and it is strewn with rubbish and graffiti. People literally live on a rubbish tip. It is a place of constant fear, tension and suspicion, but the fate of the children of that area has made an indelible mark on me, and it is something that I shall never forget.</p>

applied elsewhere, have to come up against some very undesirable Governments and political Administrations. Sudan and Zimbabwe are just two that spring to mind, and only this week, the Committee took evidence on the continuing conflict in northern Uganda, where the international community has to engage in dialogue with the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army&#151;an organisation that has committed some of the worst atrocities known to man. At times, we must make difficult decisions with organisations and Governments who lie on different parts of the scales on issues such as democracy, human rights and corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para15"><a name="07070556000108">However, we are discussing Palestine, so we apply a different set of principles to that situation. The international community took an immediate, absolutist approach by withdrawing all direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, even though it was widely recognised that public sector employment was a key element in maintaining the economy. The public sector was the largest employer and the biggest spender, employing more than 161,000 people, who, in turn, it was estimated, supported more than 1 million people in the population. The inevitable plummet to disaster, which we are witnessing, does not give the international community any credit. We have to ask whether we need to make some fundamental changes. Not paying up to 80,000 security staff proved to be catastrophic; it meant letting loose 80,000 people with guns on the streets. Imagine being a woman or a child in Gaza, faced with that situation on an hourly and daily basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para16"><a name="07070556000109">Yesterday in Parliament, Mr. Alastair Crooke, the UK director of Conflicts Forum, gave a talk to the Council for Arab-British Understanding. He has worked with, among others, former President Bill Clinton and Senator Mitchell to try to find solutions to the middle east problem. His analysis was particularly depressing, but he pointed out that the election result was very difficult for Fatah to cope with, because it believed that it had a natural leadership of the Palestinian Authority. It also proved difficult for anyone in the international community to accept the result of an election that it had encouraged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para17"><a name="07070556000110">The international community&#146;s reaction precluded the necessary dialogue to try to form a transition to a secure environment and a peaceful democracy. It encouraged Fatah to claw back powers from the Palestinian Government, and it funded an increase in the presidential forces and their training. That shows us that aid is not necessarily neutral; it certainly was not in Palestine. We must assess whether we made the right decisions, because as Mr. Crooke said, throughout the whole middle east region, tension is building upon tension, fear upon fear, suspicion upon suspicion. If we do not step back and try to relieve the tension, mistrust and fear, we will move towards a potential world catastrophe on a level that we have not seen since the world wars that afflicted the 20th century. That must make us step back.</p>

There is the issue of the temporary position, which cannot prevent the social and economic collapse that is happening now. It is by definition temporary. There have been welcome changes involving work with the Ministry of Finance this year. We must consider further that situation and the question of public employees and their salaries, which is vital to the stability of the economy, particularly in the Gaza strip. </p>

Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) mentioned the situation regarding border posts, which is an absolutely key point. We witnessed on the west bank last November the utter madness of so-called back-to-back crossings, whereby people have to unload their lorry and carry their goods by hand or in a small trolley to another lorry across the road. The process was chaotic and actually seemed to be insecure&#151;at one point, someone was told, &#147;Well, it&#146;s just bags of flour. Don&#146;t bother opening them, just carry them across anyway.&#148; There was no electronic testing or physical testing of the products. My impression was that the system was designed simply to frustrate.</p>

 It is worth emphasising that the back-to-back crossing that we watched was between two parts of Palestinian territory. It was not on a frontier, but was internal, within the west bank.</p>

 I absolutely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. What is worse is that people repeatedly face long delays at crossings, manual checks and young army staff who seem to have received little training and have little understanding of how to look for security items. However, the state of Israel has one of the most advanced and sophisticated defence industries in the world. It is a world leader in electronic defence equipment, yet it seems to be incapable of devising a sophisticated checkpoint system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para21"><a name="07070556000116">As we witnessed in Northern Ireland in the time of the troubles, the United Kingdom had the most sophisticated defence posts in the world. No one likes defence posts or checkpoints. However, in the case of Northern Ireland, that technology at least allowed them to cause the minimum of disruption, which allowed the economy to proceed fairly normally and caused as few queues as possible, so that people were not tied up for half a day or a whole day at a time, or told to turn back, because that day was just not suitable. Taking some simple steps to improve the efficiency of those posts could help the many law-abiding citizens who find their lives frustrated day after day, and&#151;if I might say so to the previous speaker, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)&#151;help improve the security of the state of Israel and that of the entire region generally.</p>

driven, unaccompanied and suffering from cancer, to enter the hospital, where no one knew who he was or where he had come from, except that he was seriously ill. The human rights of children should be paramount in any consideration on humanitarian relief. Small steps to alleviate such callous disregard for human rights should be key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="70705h0003.htm_para23"><a name="07070556000118">Finally, support for the Palestinian private sector needs to given now, not at an indefinite point in the future, when we think it might be appropriate to invest. It is difficult to strike a balance between humanitarian relief in an ongoing conflict and development. However, we need to support and maintain those businesses and organisations, some of which we met on our visit and which are struggling against all the odds that we can imagine in a business setting, and to keep them alive. If we allow them to die, close down or be destroyed, the task of eventually entering Gaza and trying to rebuild it will be one hundred times more difficult and we will have lost the skills, the expertise and the will to drive the economy forward.</p>

As we have heard, the Quartet laid down three key principles: renouncing violence, recognising Israel and respecting previous agreements. They are wholly reasonable demands and sooner or later they will have to be met. However, preconditions and setting barriers even to beginning a process are not conducive to reaching that outcome.

The Government rightly point out that Hamas needs to renounce violence and recognise Israel&#146;s right to exist. As I have said, that must be part of a process. To set a barrier so high that we know that it is impossible for Hamas to start on that journey will not deliver the result that we all want and that I am sure Israel wants. However, for many Palestinians Hamas has a mandate, and we cannot ignore that fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para1"><a name="07070556000128">Rather than seeing things in black and white, and imposing sanctions on people for having cast a vote, we must look at the reasons that Hamas was elected in the first place and the conditions for that result. One huge reason was the perceived corruption of various elements in the Palestinian Authority and the dominant Fatah party. It is clear that some of the votes were protest votes against Fatah, which bolstered Hamas. Also, Hamas is not a stupid organisation&#151;it uses opportunities. It provides essential services, such as schools, hospitals, food and housing in the occupied territories, which neither the Palestinian Authority nor the Israeli civil administration was providing, thereby creating dependency ties. Hezbollah did the same in Lebanon. If the &#147;civilised&#148; west takes away people&#146;s ability to survive, no wonder a vacuum is left for others to rush into. The electorate&#146;s decision seems to have been influenced less by foreign policies and more by Hamas&#146;s domestic policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para2"><a name="07070556000129">In a striking example of the importance of dialogue, the Palestinian Authority&#146;s and Fatah&#146;s lack of progress in reaching a peace deal with Israel also pushed people towards Hamas. Furthermore, although I congratulate Israel on having disengaged from Gaza as a unilateral initiative, that was inevitably seen in the Palestinian territories not to have been the result of negotiations with the Palestinian Authority or Fatah. Fatah therefore looked weak, and victory could be claimed by Hamas.</p>

 Is the hon. Lady suggesting that the Israelis should not have withdrawn from Gaza?</p>

 No, of course I am not; perhaps I did not explain myself brilliantly. I was saying that because the withdrawal was unilateral and had not been negotiated between the Palestinian authorities and Israel, it offered Hamas the opportunity to claim credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para3"><a name="07070556000132">We also need to realise that Hamas is a movement with many voices, and the voices inside the occupied territories often disagree with the leadership in Syria. The Government must not rule out dialogue and discussion with all elements. On the issue of the recognition of Israel, we must note that Hamas had been doing well in the municipal elections in the occupied territories before its victory in the Palestinian legislative elections. Several Palestinian mayors have been Hamas members who have had no choice but to deal with the Israeli authorities, given the state of occupation under which the Palestinians live. I regard that as a hopeful sign: if we can get the process started now, Hamas may one day recognise and work with Israel at the other end of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para4"><a name="07070556000133">Let us remember that before the Israeli-Palestine Oslo accords were signed, Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organisation were also classed as terrorist. At that time, various international actors started dialogues with the PLO, which was offered incentives and moderated. Israel herself was talking to the PLO behind closed doors at Oslo, and the declaration of principles was signed. What has happened since has not been perfect for various reasons&#151;including internal failings on both sides&#151;but it has been a step in the right direction and has showed that listening, dialogue and exchange are the only way forward and the only way to avoid further radicalisation and marginalisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para5"><a name="07070556000134">After President Abbas expelled Hamas from Government and set up an emergency Administration, the United States, Israel and the European Union chose to restore direct funding to the Palestinian Authority and its emergency Government. We welcome that resumption of funding. However, we cannot ignore the reality on the ground: there are now two de facto Governments, in Gaza and the west bank. The influence of the emergency Government is of little or no consequence in Gaza; it is therefore essential that aid should be delivered to avert humanitarian catastrophe. The European Union must play its part in that. At this point, I should raise the issue of the Rafah crossing. Whatever the politics, that involves cruel and unusual treatment for those stuck in an impossible situation on the border.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para6"><a name="07070556000135">The already difficult economic situation in the occupied territories was made worse by the withdrawal of funding to the Palestinian Authority Government. The international community has a duty to find a way of ending the economic and political marginalisation of the political wing of Hamas. Otherwise, we will simply exacerbate the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para7"><a name="07070556000136">The temporary international mechanism was flawed.

of government are being starved of funds, the resulting situation should surprise nobody. Financial aid is essential to the ordinary Palestinians of Gaza, who are most affected by those events but have least say in them. New efforts are needed to persuade the Israelis to release more of the money that they have been holding back for the past year, although we are delighted that some of it is now to be released.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para8"><a name="07070556000137">Europe has an immense role to play in the region; arguably, it has never maximised its influence. The European Union is both Palestine&#146;s largest aid donor and Israel&#146;s largest trading partner. Europe must find a strong common position on Israel-Palestine and use a singular voice to help find a solution to the conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para9"><a name="07070556000138">The report paints a stark picture of economic growth and private-sector development. The current state of play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires that the Palestinian people, their basic services and what exists of their institutions, are supported through donor aid. That position is untenable. The Government have to realise that the simple provision of aid, on which the Palestinian population so heavily depends, relates to the lack of a viable economy. Aid can help to bring a resolution to the conflict only if it is channelled into projects that promote economic growth and institution building in the occupied Palestinian territories and is complemented by a serious effort by the international community to bring about a fair and sustainable resolution to the conflict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para10"><a name="07070556000139">Such a resolution might not&#151;perhaps could never&#151;give each side what it wants, but it could be enough for both sides to have peace and prosperity. Economic growth in the occupied Palestinian territories is essential and could show the benefits of peace. Collective sanctions against all Palestinians just create more desperation, lack of faith in the international community as peace brokers and lack of faith in the future. They also create an atmosphere in which extremists can thrive and prosper by providing basic services such as food aid, hospitals and schools. Nobody else is providing those services, so dependency ties are created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para11"><a name="07070556000140">What I have learned from looking at such situations around the world is that intransigence delivers nothing&#151;it means that absolutely nothing can change. Recently, I visited the middle east, both Israel and the west bank, and my overriding sense was that it is the ordinary people on both sides who suffer greatly. To respond to an issue raised today, I should say that one thing that surprised me was that although the security blocks on the Palestinian west bank were indeed awful, the Palestinians whom I talked to still put the blame on the Palestinian Authority for deliberately retaining the better passes for those in senior positions. I am concerned that there is still a degree of corruption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para12"><a name="07070556000141">I went to a school by the Kalandia refugee camp to visit some 15-year-old girls who were having a workshop that aimed to build their capacity to vocalise their feelings. We are influenced by the media around us, and when I asked them what was the biggest barrier in their lives, I was expecting them to say that it was the corrupt Palestinian Authority or the Israelis who were making their lives a misery. However, they actually said that the biggest barrier was their culture; they were expected to get married and have babies at age 15. That brought it home to me that in such territories people  <br>

 May I begin by saying how pleased I am to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Bercow? I also welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment. We Conservatives are pleased that the Department for International Development has expanded&#151;indeed doubled&#151;its ministerial team. Although the number of Ministers has gone from two to four, I am sure that this Minister will have no shortage of issues on his desk. I am sure that he will find the job extremely rewarding; it is one of those rare departmental positions from which a Minister can make a real, immediate and lasting impact. I wish him well. Finally, we Conservatives were delighted at the release of Alan Johnston. We hope that he manages to find his feet again, and are delighted that he is back with his family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para13"><a name="07070556000143">The right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce), the Select Committee Chairman, should be congratulated on the Committee&#146;s thorough and prescient report. He introduced what is&#151;let us be honest&#151;an emotive and impassioned subject in his usual measured way. We have seen this afternoon that passions run high on both sides of the argument. He eloquently set out many of the issues in an articulate and detailed way. He was right to highlight the problems that have been exacerbated by continued building in the west bank and to highlight Israel&#146;s legitimate security concerns. I am sure that he would be the first to acknowledge that the international community needs to work together to find a satisfactory resolution to the problem or serious regional problems could well develop. I would certainly advocate discussions with Syria and the other main players in the region that need to engage with the issue, too.</p>

He seemed surprised at the Government&#146;s response to the Committee&#146;s report and its pre-meditated content. I was not particularly surprised when I saw the response, and I suspect that other members of the Select Committee were not particularly surprised either. He rightly mentioned the security barrier, which is an emotive issue. As the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) mentioned, there have been significant reductions in terrorist atrocities as a direct result of the construction of the barrier. However, as I saw when I was in Palestine, it divides some Palestinian communities. When I was there, a pregnant lady wanted to get to hospital to give birth and she was not allowed to do so. Some serious issues need to be addressed on both sides of the divide. All that I would say to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield is that to enable a satisfactory solution to that immensely complex issue, there needs to be a balanced view and an understanding of the issues on both sides. One of the depressing things that I found when I went to Israel/Palestine was that at a senior level and a political level, that balance was not there. It is present in both  <br>

He mentioned Tony Blair&#146;s appointment; we think that he will have problems generating traction on the Palestinian side, but of course we wish him well. If he can play a role in trying to engage the United States in this fundamental issue he will have played a significant part. There is no doubt that the disengagement of the US Administration in trying to find a satisfactory solution to the middle east situation has led to an exacerbation of many of the problems. The hon. Gentleman was also right to highlight the severe decline of the gross domestic product of the Palestinian areas.</p>

She was right to highlight the fact that the situation is complex and point to some of the appalling quotes from what Hamas and its supporters have said. There is more to democracy than winning elections, and once Hamas had won the election it needed to establish the rule of law. It needs to benefit and build a pluralistic civil society. It needs a commitment to peaceful dialogue. She was right to highlight the issue of hatred, which still exists on both sides.

She is a regular contributor to international development debates and her contribution is always welcome, illuminating and knowledgeable.

However, I would suggest that that is not only about supporting the private sector, but about stimulating and enhancing it. It is only through wealth creation that jobs will be created and poverty alleviated, and that there will be a greater understanding and bond between those on the different political sides.</p>

First, we need to find an acceptable way to continue the delivery of aid to the Palestinian population in Gaza under the temporary international mechanism. Secondly, we need to support and channel communication between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert aimed at improving conditions in the west bank and Gaza, despite the fact that President Abbas&#146;s Administration has, by his own admission, credibility problems with some of the Palestinian population. Thirdly, there need to be urgent diplomatic efforts by the Quartet and the Arab quartet to seek a way forward. Any way forward requires Hamas to make a credible movement towards the acceptance of the Quartet principles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para23"><a name="07070556000155">I have to say to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield that it would be difficult for any British Government, irrespective of their political colour, to approve the use of British taxpayers&#146; money for an organisation that has not yet renounced violence and still does not acknowledge the right to exist of the group with which it is supposed to negotiate. Those fundamental steps must be made before direct engagement with Hamas can take place.</p>

 I think that I follow what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but perhaps he could address the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle) about stages. The hon. Gentleman ran two things together: the use of taxpayers&#146; money for a Government or organisation, and the issue of engagement. When Hamas offers long-term ceasefires and talks about accepting Israel as a reality, do those moves go far enough? Absolutely not, but are they not grounds for saying that we should start to talk about things, see what they mean and see whether we can get things to move forwards?</p>

 I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points, and argue in return that an issue needs to be addressed. Of course, things need to take place in stages, but it would be difficult for the UK Government to have a direct conversation with an organisation such as Hamas. Other players in the region should be having that dialogue: Syria is one and Iran is possibly another, although it has perhaps been involved in a negative way with what has happened recently in Gaza. The regional players and the Arab quartet need to be involved in far greater detail and to a greater degree than they have been to date.</p>

unfreezing. I understand that some money was sent on Sunday, that more was sent yesterday and that some will be disseminated through the public sector&#151;but only in the west bank, not in Gaza. We need to return to that and it would be helpful if the Minister could explain the UK Government&#146;s position. It is essential that some money should circulate in the economy, or the people of Palestine will have no chance of generating economic growth and decent reasonable livelihoods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="70705h0004.htm_para25"><a name="07070556000159">It needs to be acknowledged that DFID has made a contribution in Palestine. Since 1996, it has provided &#163;372 million of aid. In 2006-07 alone, DFID allocated &#163;30 million for the Palestinian territories, of which  &#163;24 million has been disbursed via the temporary international mechanism, non-governmental organisations and international agencies. DFID has also allocated funds via the global conflict prevention pool for water resource management, policing advisory services and strengthening the capacity of civil society.</p>

Steps must be taken to ensure that at checkpoints there are legitimate, fair and efficient means to enable the swift movement of people and goods, while defending Israel&#146;s right to security.

Has any progress been made on greater use of the Rafah trade corridor to negate the suffering that many people are undergoing because of the closure of the limited access through it?</p>

Is DFID still working with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence to support the US security co-ordinators&#146; work there, for both commercial goods and people? Another fundamental factor in the depression of the Palestinian economy has been the fact that while almost 45,000 Palestinians used to work in Israel every day, for security reasons that figure is now almost zero.</p>

As I have said, Israel has agreed to resume the monthly transfer of taxes to the new, Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. We welcome that step. The Quartet has agreed to lift the economic embargo on direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority. Will the Minister provide more details? Will the direct budgetary support begin immediately? If so, how much of DFID&#146;s budget will be given? Will it be in addition to the temporary international mechanism, or will it act as a replacement? How will DFID monitor the money to ensure that it is spent for the purposes for which it was originally intended?</p>

How will the funds that are being put into the mechanism be delivered in Gaza if the circumvention of the Hamas political apparatus is to continue? The mandate for the mechanism ends on 20 September and has already been extended four times. Does the Minister expect it to be extended again and, if so, for what period?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para7"><a name="07070556000173">The priority for the Palestinian territories and Israel must be security and stability in the middle east. There is a blueprint as to the way forward, which was almost agreed at Taba. Palestine in particular must ensure economic growth and the ability to trade, which will contribute to the alleviation of poverty. Sadly, recent events in Gaza make a two-state solution less likely in the immediate future, more complex and more difficult to achieve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para8"><a name="07070556000174">The fact has been highlighted that there is no one person any more who represents the Palestinian people. I urge the Government to provide well targeted, accountable development assistance that is carefully monitored to ensure that it reaches those who most require support and assistance. They should also work with the international community not just to deliver humanitarian assistance but rebuild Palestinian public services and assist in the development of trade, economic growth and security. Those are the combining factors that will ultimately lead to a satisfactory political solution and the significant alleviation of poverty that is much needed in the Palestinian territories.</p>

It is the most unexpected of pleasures to have you in the Chair for my maiden debate as a Minister.

For obvious reasons, he is well respected in the field of international development. He is right that international aid cannot in itself lead to sustainable economic growth in the occupied Palestinian territories.

On whether there is a sustainable solution, the truth is that in the long term there can be no such solution in that part of the world without the inclusion of Hamas. At the same time, Hamas must be clear that it has obligations. The Quartet has set out principles and we expect them to be adhered to.</p>

Certainly, one of our colleagues did. If it was not him, my papers are a little muddled. None the less, I shall deal with the matter now. The Foreign Secretary will be speaking with his Egyptian counterpart over the next couple of days. He hopes to get some movement on a situation that, clearly, is unacceptable from anybody&#146;s perspective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para13"><a name="07070556000180">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) has a clear passion in this area. It is a passion that I share and that I believe every Member in this Chamber shares, by virtue of their attending this debate. He has done some interesting and valuable work in trying to move forward issues that, on occasion, are clearly contentious but that need to be raised and discussed none the less.</p>

Friend and other colleagues when we acted as international observers of the Palestinian elections in January 2006. They were, without doubt, the best elections that I have experienced in my life. I wrote in the <i>New Statesman </i>that Nablus was more like Notting Hill. There was a kind of carnival atmosphere, and there were more women out on the streets than anybody else. That was probably the peak of Palestinian optimism in the past couple of years. It is tragic that between January 2006 and July 2007 we moved to where we are now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para15"><a name="07070556000182">On Hamas, I reiterate that the Quartet has set out its three principles, which deal with non-violence, the recognition of Israel, and respecting and accepting existing agreements. My hon. Friend asked about the clearance revenues. The amount of $120 million has already been released to the new Palestinian Government, and I am happy to tell him that the total amount that we believe ought to be released is circa $800 million. It is certainly the position of this Government that the entirety of that money needs to be released.</p>

I believe that we would all agree that insisting that appropriate medical care reaches people, whether combatants or not, and whatever the conflict, is an absolute priority. Our report recommended that with regard to doctors&#146; and nurses&#146; salaries and medical provisions for hospitals and clinics in the occupied territories, the withholding of funds should be lifted. Has that now happened or is it happening today? Medical needs should have been exempted months ago, when our report was published.</p>

What is really needed now is for the Gaza borders to be opened and, as I believe others have said, for imports and exports to start to flow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para19"><a name="07070556000188">On the arrest of Palestinian Cabinet Ministers, this Government&#146;s position is clear: they ought to be charged or they ought to be released.

 I am sorry that I have not been able to make the speech that I wanted to make this afternoon.

Unfortunately, it has been one of those days. I shall not try to make my speech under the auspices of an intervention, Mr. Bercow, but I hope that I may be given a moment to raise one point in relation to what the Minister has just said.

The discrepancy between the Government&#146;s stated policy and action on the ground is profound. I had the opportunity to spend five days on the west bank about six weeks ago. Some of the issues that were dealt with in the earlier part of the debate, when I was here&#151;the separation barrier, checkpoints, settlements, settler roads, controls on access, annexation of east Jerusalem, and what is happening in the centre of Hebron&#151;are all matters that the Quartet and the British Government have expressed concern about and have said are illegal acts. The difficulty is that all those problems persist and are being accelerated. What are the Government actually going to do rather than say to curtail the Government of Israel in what is, in effect, the destruction of the possibility of a two-state solution by the cantonisation of the west bank?</p>

 My hon. Friend is correct. It takes all sides to work together to make peace, and although we can argue about which element has the greater share of blame, ultimately all sides must have some discomfort if we are to achieve peace in the region&#151;Lord knows there is enough discomfort there at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para21"><a name="07070556000194">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) was right to raise the potential of a failed state, as he termed it. He also spoke about the temporary international mechanism, which was mentioned by other hon. Members. The TIM will continue until the end of September, and President Abbas has welcomed that. It will play an essential role in delivering aid to Palestinians in the west bank and in Gaza. The UK and the EU are currently exploring other ways of providing support directly to the Palestinian Authority. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para22"><a name="07070556000195">It is right to say that leadership is critical and that moving the situation forward requires people who are willing to take risks and show leadership. In any crisis such as this there are opportunities, and it is up to people to grasp those opportunities. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West was, probably not for the first time, right in much of what he said. The UK Government must provide an even-handed approach to all sides of the conflict and ensure that all sides adhere to their international obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="70705h0005.htm_para23"><a name="07070556000196">I think that the right hon. Member for Gordon spoke about engaging with the national unity Government. This Government did engage with those elements of the national unity Government that were prepared to accept the Quartet principles. That might not be exactly what the right hon. Gentleman was looking for, but it would be unfair to say that there was not engagement with the national unity Government.</p>

Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) was right to talk about the constitutions and other things that exist on bits of paper. Obviously, people who say that their objective is the destruction of the Jews are despicable, and nobody in this room could possibly want to see that on any bit of paper. This Government will not tolerate anti-Semitism or any other form of discrimination. My hon. Friend was also right to talk about Hamas in the context that she did because it will be a constant reminder about the challenge that Hamas faces if it wants to move forward. I slightly disagree with her about the wall, because I would say that Israel has the right to build any wall that it wishes, if it feels that that would give it extra protection. However, that wall can only be within Israeli territory and cannot be on occupied territory where it patently contravenes international law.</p>

 It is the Government&#146;s stated position that in so far as the wall trespasses on to the west bank, it is illegal. Would the Minister go further than that and recognise that the principal purpose of the wall is to allow the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements on the west bank and as part of that process to incorporate Palestinian farmland and Palestinian settlements? Putting Palestinian settlements within the wall would, of course, negate the whole security argument. On that basis, will  <br>

 Sorry. Let me rephrase my point: at the moment I am dealing with responses to hon. Members and the prepared text is en route. Unfortunately, some of my remarks may be repeated, but it is better that they are repeated than omitted. The position of the Government is clear: we consider the future for the region to be a two-state solution based on the pre-1967 borders. That has not shifted for a number of years, since the previous Prime Minister gave the commitment in 2001. Thank you, Mr. Bercow, for reminding me that this is indeed the closing speech and that I do not get two bites of this particular cherry.</p>

Friend the Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin) gave a moving insight into the reality of life in the occupied Palestinian territories. Her description of Gaza as being literally a rubbish tip was very powerful, and I say to her that that is an indictment on all of us. We all need to do so much more to eradicate the poverty and hardship that are the reality for people who live in Gaza and the west bank. She spoke with much common sense, which is not unusual for her. Sadly, that seems to be a commodity that is, on occasions, in short supply in this part of the world.</p>

Let us be clear: there can be no viable Palestine without a diverse economy, and the private sector will play a crucial role in that. She was right to say that small steps will be important as we move forward.</p>

I think that I have dealt with that already. The Foreign Secretary will in the next few days ring his Egyptian counterpart to try to bring some relief to a situation that clearly ought not to exist.</p>

I was told to expect machine gun questions, but it was not as bad as I had expected. Maybe he was being kind and gentle because this is my first time speaking for the Government. Everybody in DFID welcomes the Committee&#146;s stance on the number of DFID Ministers. Personally, of course, I have much for which to be grateful. With my inclusion, we have doubled the capacity of the ministerial team&#151;although I am not so sure that we have doubled the intellectual capacity. There is a new political reality, but the truth is that we do not really know what that holds. We know that there is a real opportunity to get things moving in a way in which, over the past year and a half or so, we have been unable to do for a host of reasons.

June, more than 130 truckloads of basic food and humanitarian supplies have got through. That will help, but for Gazans to start rebuilding their lives, they need more than the very basics. They need to be able to buy fruit and vegetables, fresh milk and baby formula. For Gaza&#146;s people to have money in their pockets, the economy needs to function. That means not only importing but exporting goods. We are pressing Israel to ensure full humanitarian access to Gaza and to allow trade as soon as possible.</p>

We continue to call on Hamas to adhere to the Quartet principles: committing to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements. Ultimately, all parties must surely realise that sustainable peace can be attained only through dialogue that helps to create a common understanding. Bullets, bombs, killings and mayhem are exactly what ordinary people on all sides wish would cease.</p>

Blame for the violence in Gaza lies with those who have chosen to pursue their aims through violence, but as we know too well, the responsibility for bringing a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is spread much more widely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para15"><a name="07070556000224">For Israelis, the consequence of militant Palestinian violence is a life marred by fear. Last year, 23 Israelis were killed by the violence both inside and outside the occupied territories. In the past six years, 3,500 rockets have fallen on the Israeli town of Sderot&#151;I hope that I pronounced that correctly&#151;causing 10 deaths. Many people in Israel feel under attack. The threat is reinforced by the failure of Hamas to meet international principles, and its violence in Gaza has merely exacerbated the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para16"><a name="07070556000225">In 2006, 661 Palestinians died as a result of Israeli military action. In the same period, the Palestinian economy contracted by about 10 per cent. One of the main causes was Israel&#146;s decision not to pass on the VAT and customs revenues that it collects for Palestinians&#151;about $55 million a month. That starved the Palestinian Authority of more than half their revenue, leaving them unable to pay their workers, on whom one quarter of Palestinians depend for their family&#146;s livelihood. Businesses suffered because the Palestinian Authority simply could not pay bills. This week, Israel made its first payment in 15 months, of $120 million, to the emergency Palestinian Government. We call on Israel to release the remaining funds as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para17"><a name="07070556000226">Withheld revenue has been the immediate cause of Palestinian economic decline, but the longer-term cause is Israeli security restrictions on movement. The average west bank Palestinian has been unable to visit friends or family in Gaza since 2000. Almost 550 roadblocks and checkpoints in the west bank limit the movement of goods and people from one town to another. That makes trade impossible: the cost of transporting a container from Gaza to the west bank is as much as that of moving it from the west bank to China. That has huge consequences for the economic, cultural and social fabric of Palestinian life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para18"><a name="07070556000227">Israel&#146;s security concerns are legitimate and must be addressed, but the presence of almost 500,000 Israeli settlers throughout the occupied west bank, including  <br>

East Jerusalem, means that the security restrictions affect the whole west bank economy. The barrier winds its way around settlements, placing 10 per cent. of west bank land inside Israel, as has been said. Roads reserved for settlers make transport between cities for Palestinians in the west bank virtually impossible. Many colleagues have had the misfortune to witness that at first-hand; mercifully, we do not have to witness it every day.</p>

We are providing support through the EU&#146;s temporary international mechanism. Built on initial work by the UK, that has helped 150,000 Palestinian families&#151;about 1 million people. It has ensured that health and education services have continued and it has provided fuel to ensure that power is provided to medical facilities, water and sewerage plants serving 1.3 million people.</p>

 The Minister has been generous with his time. He said that he hoped that the Palestinian people thought that the British Government had not forgotten them. I fear that people probably do think that the British Government have forgotten them. The statistics that he has given perhaps reveal that. I am thinking of the inequality of arms, quite literally, and the power that the Government of Israel have in relation to the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para20"><a name="07070556000230">The Minister gave the figure of 10 per cent.

Are the Government not falling into the trap, in trying to be balanced, of not being balanced at all? They are giving equal weight to the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority in these matters, whereas in fact almost all the infringements that prevent the economic and political operation of a Palestinian state are as a result of the actions of the Government of Israel.</p>

Friend is doing. I was aware that the former Economic Secretary made those remarks; I happened to be present at the time and they are quite stark remarks, which should make us all face the reality of what is going on in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories and should fuel us to do even more to try to bring lasting peace and solve a problem that simply will not go away.</p>

suffering in that part of the world believe that they are being neglected, but I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush (Mr. Slaughter) that the Government do not believe that we could ever neglect the issue of the middle east. With regard to conflicts that need to be settled around the world, my personal perspective is that this one is probably No. 1. We need to understand that we live in an interdependent world. If we can get some hope in the middle east and bring some kind of just resolution for all parties concerned, that will take out much of the anguish and anxiety that we see, which affects not only the middle east but all parts of the world.</p>

We agree that working outside the Palestinian Authority has added to the risk of its institutions failing. Following the appointment of the new Government of Prime Minister Fayyad we, along with the rest of the EU, are urgently looking at ways of working directly with them.</p>

 I am not going into the detail today, but am speaking about the principle. The detail will be negotiated and discussed between the parties who are directly involved. I am making a basic point about our position. We want to see a viable Palestinian state, on the pre-1967 borders, side by side with a secure, safe and confident Israeli state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para25"><a name="07070556000242">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) has helped me to move to my next point. Ultimately, only the Israelis and Palestinians can make peace. The Palestinian leadership must work hard to resolve the current situation. It must restore calm, it must open internal dialogue and it must demonstrate that it is capable of providing a competent Administration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para26"><a name="07070556000243">Israel must also play its part. As a first step, it must urgently release the remaining Palestinian revenues and provide adequate access into and out of Gaza. It should then ease movement and access restrictions in the west bank, and take a hard look at its policies on settlements, which are contrary to international law and threaten the viability of an agreed two-state solution. Actions from both Governments are needed. The current crisis might suggest that peace is further away than ever, but they could also choose to see it as an opportunity. For the sake of both ordinary Palestinians and Israelis, it is an opportunity that they must not fail to grasp.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="70705h0006.htm_para27"><a name="07070556000244">I end by sharing an anecdote with the Chamber, which is about being positive. There is a lot of negativity around this subject, for obvious reasons. I was there as part of a delegation back in 1993. You are probably thinking that I was too young to be there, Mr. Bercow, or perhaps you are not, but I was there none the less. It was day seven, and the Oslo peace accord had just been announced. When one is there when something like that is happening, one thinks, &#147;Is this really happening? Is it momentous, is it big, is it small?&#148; At the time we relied on the seven o&#146;clock news or the nine o&#146;clock news to tell us what was going on in the world, or I certainly did, so when one is there and something like that happens, one thinks that it is too much of a coincidence.</p>

At the time, Arafat et al were in Tunis and the delegates were in New York. We were with the PLO official who was the most senior in Gaza at the time, unofficially, when a camera crew came bursting in and a journalist thrust a mike in his face and said, &#147;This peace&#151;people are saying that it&#146;s nothing and that the PLO have sold out.

I do not criticise him for being unable to answer fully some of the questions that were asked, but I hope that he will consider the debate and write to hon.

Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) made in his intervention is very relevant here. It has to be taken on board, bluntly and squarely, that the situation with the settlements on the west bank is impossible if there is to be a solution. I want to quote from the evidence that David Shearer, the head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Occupied Palestinian Territories, gave to the Committee. When talking about the road blocks on the west bank, he pointed out:</p>

He does not have democratic legitimacy. We must therefore acknowledge that we cannot assume that by dealing with President Abbas, giving him the money, working directly with him and pretending that Hamas does not exist, we have somehow solved the problem.
