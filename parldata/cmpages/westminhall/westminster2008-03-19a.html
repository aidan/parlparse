 Good morning, Mr. Hood. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, and we are privileged indeed to have you in firm but fair-minded command of our proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000011">When I heard that I had secured the debate, I was tickled to learn&#151;hon. Members will be able to tell that I had not planned things this way&#151;that this is the first week of a two-week national campaign to promote neighbourhood policing and enable people to learn the names and identities of their local police officers and how to contact them. The debate has turned out to be very well timed, but that was entirely accidental.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para2"><a name="08031958000012">By April, every community in England and Wales will have in place neighbourhood policing teams of police officers and police community support officers. As it happens, Staffordshire anticipated that requirement and set up its neighbourhood policing teams more than 12 months early. Such teams&#151;whether in Staffordshire or nationally&#151;are dedicated to working with their local communities, agreeing priorities for action and informing the public of their progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000013">It should now be possible for residents everywhere to find out the identities of the members of their neighbourhood policing teams. They need only ask their local police or local council, inquire at a local library or look on the internet, including on a new national website which has the names and numbers of members of their local teams. There has been some debate about giving out the mobile phone numbers of individual police officers, but all I can say is that there has been no reticence among community police officers and PCSOs in my constituency about giving them to local residents. In Staffordshire, we are certainly interested in sharing best practice on neighbourhood policing. We want to learn from what police services elsewhere are doing well and we are happy to share our successes with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000014">In his final report on the review of policing, Sir Ronnie Flanagan speaks of a vision of successful 21st-century policing. He says that its components include having</p>

Like Sir Ronnie, I believe that neighbourhood policing is effective in cutting crime and popular with the public because it provides reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000016">Let me illustrate that belief using some recent experiences in my constituency. Last summer, I walked a beat with a community police officer and another beat with two  <br>

PCSOs. I also joined a whole neighbourhood policing team to try to solve a specific problem in a particular community. Community engagement and the accessibility of officers are given high priority in Staffordshire, and I have worked with the police and their partners in establishing a number of police surgeries in various public premises. Members of the public can now approach police officers in confidence in settings as diverse as a converted shop, a charity drop-in centre, a university campus and a children&#146;s centre, to give just a few examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000017">In the year in which neighbourhood policing is being rolled out in my constituency, I joined the police to present a roadshow. Together, the police and I explained at a series of public meetings how neighbourhood policing will work. Additionally, I encouraged residents to join existing neighbourhood watch schemes or to start new ones in areas where none existed before.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000018">The message that I put very strongly to the public was that if the police are to put in this extra effort to be visible and up front in the community, it is time for members of the public to respond positively to support them&#151;as eyes and ears, as providers of information and by putting peer pressure on people in their localities to behave in an acceptable way.</p>

 I congratulate my hon. Friend on obtaining the debate. I was pleased to hear him mention neighbourhood watch, which is very successfully organised and exists in strength in several areas of Leicestershire. Does he agree that such activities would benefit from more central funding? Much of what such schemes do depends on the money that they raise at charitable and other fundraising events. That seems a little hit and miss, and we need a bit more central support if such schemes are to continue to develop and work with the neighbourhood policing teams.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that comment. Like him, I am a keen supporter of neighbourhood watch. He will recall, as I do, the kerfuffle a couple of years ago at the national level about the organisation of neighbourhood watch. That was partly a dispute within the organisation itself and it has now been resolved. At the local level, I would say that the best way to secure funding to support neighbourhood watch activities is through the safer communities partnerships and local area agreements. Certainly in Staffordshire there are good relationships between police, councils and other partners. Our neighbourhood watch annual conference is an effective and well-attended event.</p>

 This is an important matter. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the four objectives of the Government&#146;s neighbourhood policing initiative, which was very necessary. One was to increase accessibility to the police for the public. Does he therefore agree that it is important to ensure that we protect those police stations in small communities which many hon. Members from all parties have fought to keep open&#151;small stations such as Benfleet in Canvey island, for instance?</p>

stations. I am a little hesitant about supporting the maintenance of bricks and mortar as the place where the service should be delivered. As I said, there have been some innovative ideas in my constituency, where the police can gather and meet the public out on their patrols, and that has proved highly successful. Perhaps it is a case of horses for courses. One solution may be appropriate for one place, but a different one may apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000023">It is too early to say whether neighbourhood policing is specifically responsible for falling crime, but we have had neighbourhood policing teams for more than a year in Staffordshire and there have been reductions in acquisitive crime, violent crime and antisocial behaviour. Details from the police in my constituency for the period from April 2006 to February 2007 and the equivalent 11-month period for 2007 to 2008 show that total crime has fallen by more than 14 per cent. The figure for criminal damage cases in the earlier period is 22,897 crimes, but it is 18,842 in the later period, which is a fall of more than the average&#151;by more than 17 per cent. For antisocial behaviour incidents, only some of which will be crimes, the police gave me a figure of 58,195 reported incidents in the earlier period, with 56,897 in the later period, which is a fall of more than 2 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000024">I frequently hear from constituents that they want to see police patrols on their streets, and they are increasingly seeing those patrols. They can often recognise the individual officers as their regular police officers, and I know that they are engaging with their local police teams to tackle local problems. Back in 1997, constituents&#146; concerns in Staffordshire and elsewhere in the country would have been about high levels of burglary and theft of and from motor vehicles. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000025">Nationally, we have made vast improvements in reducing such crimes. However, on the whole, people feel no safer despite those achievements. The complaint that I hear more often than any other is that antisocial behaviour is ruining people&#146;s daily lives. I also hear of older residents worrying about gatherings of young people, whether or not there is any overt sign of unlawful or unruly behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000026">In cases of antisocial behaviour and intergenerational mistrust, neighbourhood policing is ideally placed to intervene and be part of the solution. Close working with the public, effective partnerships with councils, social landlords and others, and decisive action taken together can offer communities a successful end to problems of antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000027">It would be wrong, however, to label neighbourhood policing as narrowly focused. It offers visible reassurance to communities and promises speedier responses to local matters. Trusted local police teams pick up intelligence from residents that contributes to the more effective operation of intelligence-led policing more generally. Further, the evidence, which admittedly is early, shows that neighbourhood policing contributes to crime reduction across a broad range of offences. It also offers a better quality of police service to the public. In Staffordshire, every victim of criminal damage or antisocial behaviour has contact with their local PCSO. The new chief constable, Chris Sims, intends to take the emphasis on quality of service much further still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000028">In taking up Sir Ronnie&#146;s recommendations on reducing the bureaucratic burden on police officers, Chris Sims and his police force are at the forefront with a number of initiatives, including reducing the amount of information routinely recorded for many crimes while retaining extensive recording for serious crimes. Staffordshire police is one of four police services trialling a new streamlined crime recording process. The adoption of standardised forms based on minimum appropriate reporting requirements, as recommended in Sir Ronnie&#146;s report, has also reduced the size of many forms by half.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000029">The Staffordshire police force has offered to pilot the implementation of mobile data technology across the entire front line. The chief constable has the backing of officers and police staff for his bold offer to the Staffordshire public to home in on quality of policing even where it conflicts with centralised targets based on quantity. I know that that is what local communities want. I can give a recent example from a public meeting that I convened of all the relevant agencies last Friday in the village of Wheaton Aston. At the end of the meeting, the chair of the local parish council said to me, &#147;David, will you tell Parliament that we want to see more police officers on the beat in our village?&#148; I said, &#147;Yes, I&#146;ll do it next Wednesday morning,&#148; which was very impressive for the audience to hear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000030">I suggest that if we follow the line of Sir Ronnie&#146;s recommendations and the offer being made by Staffordshire police and their chief constable, we can free up more resources so that more police officers are seen more of the time in communities such as Wheaton Aston. The prize that many judge to be worth pursuing, myself included, is more time for police officers to spend on front-line policing. The commitment made to communities in Staffordshire about patrols and responses to some crimes, thanks to successful neighbourhood policing, can be amplified and extended to a wider range of crimes and situations. The Prime Minister visited Staffordshire police on 3 February. He listened attentively as police officers and PCSOs spoke of the work that they are doing to cut the bureaucracy faced by front-line officers.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman speaks with a great deal of passion, and he is obviously well informed. I am somewhat sceptical in my researches into claims to cut paperwork, but I cannot speak for Staffordshire. Will he enlighten us by giving specific examples that he has seen? He gave one example of a form that had been halved in size.</p>

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="08031958000032"><a name="80319h0001.htm_spnew6"><a name="08031958000463"><b>Mr. Kidney:</b>
 I was there as the officers made their presentations to the Prime Minister, and I felt proud of their professionalism as they did so and answered the Prime Minister&#146;s searching questions, which were rather like the hon. Gentleman&#146;s. The officers gave the Prime Minister this kind of example: the domestic investigation arrest log, which collects information on domestic violence cases, was once a 20-page form but has now been reduced to 10 pages; a 16-page traffic collision form is now eight pages; and the usual recording form for what police regard as non-serious crimes, which they reckon make up 80 per cent. of the total, has been reduced from 16 pages to one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000033">As I said, Staffordshire police have also been trialling hand-held mobile data computers at Longton, which is  <br>

not in my constituency but in Stoke-on-Trent, and have found that they reduce the need to fill in paper forms by enabling officers to make direct contact with the police national computer and the police station. Those are all examples of how police officers on the beat have more time to do their proper work as a result of spending less time filling in pieces of paper. As the hon. Gentleman asked about it, another presentation that the police made to the Prime Minister involved a Staffordshire pilot of a speedy justice initiative. When evidence is collected, if a guilty plea is anticipated, the police officer responsible for the case can submit minimal evidence on paper to the Crown Prosecution Service instead of a raft of paper prepared specially in case of a not guilty plea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000034">Those are the examples given to the Prime Minister in Stafford just a month ago. I was there, and the police and I made the point together that neighbourhood policing and reducing bureaucracy are intrinsically linked. After the visit, the chief constable said:</p>
<a name="80319h0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08031958000399"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;By tackling the culture of form-filling, we want to free up extra time and space for our officers and staff to deliver a better service, engage with communities and change public opinion&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000035">That is what is at stake in Staffordshire&#146;s offer to implement the Flanagan report&#146;s recommendations locally and early. I accept that offer willingly, and I urge the Minister to do the same. Will he say today that the Home Office will back Staffordshire&#146;s plans with money for the investment needed, especially in new technology? We are currently using 175 mobile data devices in the pilot at Longton. The police say that with the money, they will roll out 1,200 devices to front-line police officers by September. How quick is that? Is it not an offer worth accepting?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000036">Nationally, as in Staffordshire, Home Office policy on neighbourhood policing should focus, as Sir Ronnie observed, on supporting and sustaining the model being set up. Like Sir Ronnie, I welcome the decision to ring-fence PCSO funding for a further year. Overall, the funding this year for neighbourhood policing, including PCSOs, will be &#163;324 million, a 2.7 per cent. increase from last year. The settlement shows that the Home Office is committed to making a success of neighbourhood policing, and I thank the Minister for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000037">I acknowledge the other good work that all police services carry out alongside neighbourhood policing. Response policing bears the brunt of public service and crime detection. The last time I had cause to call the police personally&#151;I thought that I was witnessing a possible burglary&#151;the response was excellent, but others report mixed response times to me. The drive to reduce bureaucratic burdens promises the best gains for response policing. However, when I met representatives of manufacturing businesses recently, they warned me against over-reliance on neighbourhood policing and response policing. They were concerned about organised criminal gangs&#146; targeted thefts of their metal stocks as a result of huge rises in the price of metals. The manufacturers made the point&#151;valid, I am sure&#151;that between neighbourhood policing and response policing, there lies a wide range of complex and inter-related police services to be delivered.</p>

Even with that long list, I am sure that I have missed many.</p>

Let us ensure that we embed it for the long term. We in Staffordshire certainly embrace the Flanagan reform agenda, including cutting form lengths and reducing record-keeping to free up more time for front-line policing. We are willing to roll out mobile data across the whole police service in Staffordshire. We just need the money, Minister; let&#146;s have it.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on obtaining this debate, and on how he presented his case. It was gleefully unpartisan, and he made some important points. He will recognise that, historically, this country has always had citizen-based police organisations; we have had special constables, of course, for some years. In many ways it is regrettable that in recent decades&#151;the situation certainly predates 1997&#151;that practice seems to have diminished. That is why many of the new initiatives are very positive. Our policing model, in contrast with that of European nations, has always been firmly drilled into local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para24"><a name="08031958000041">Much as I think that neighbourhood policing is important, a visible police presence alone should not be the be-all and end-all of the policing challenge. I find that to be the case particularly in central London, where intelligence-led policing has great import, not least in fields such as counter-terrorism. The Metropolitan police and a range of other agencies, including the City of London police in the eastern part of my constituency, do painstaking work, but that approach has a less high profile. I appreciate that the villages in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency regard policing as being about bobbies on the beat and a visible presence, but it is important that we give as much credit as possible to a lot of the other work that goes on behind the scenes. In my constituency&#151;in Westminster at least&#151;the local authorities are at the forefront of a partnership with the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Service over PCSOs and a range of other initiatives, some of which I shall discuss in my brief contribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para25"><a name="08031958000042">Many of the new initiatives were key to restoring public confidence in the aftermath of 9/11. At the outset, the concern in London was that too much of the PCSO initiative was driven by a campaign to keep numbers high. PCSOs are added routinely to overall police numbers; no doubt Ken Livingstone and his mayoral campaign will make much of that. However, I have always supported the idea of PCSOs, even in the immediate aftermath of 2001, when such support was not terribly fashionable in the Conservative party. To  <br>

be fair, they have worked well, although if there is one slight criticism it is that there is a risk that they have helped to crowd out special constables. From my work with the City of London police, it seems that the cadre of special constables feel that they are now third-class citizens compared with PCSOs. Becoming a PCSO is now an alternative career route in policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para26"><a name="08031958000043">In Westminster, we have an initiative called CivicWatch, the key to which is that the police safer neighbourhood sergeant is partnered with a local government officer, which ensures effective liaison between the police and the local authority. I hope that the same applies throughout the country. We have found that one of the few positive by-products of the early retirement rule in the police is that some very talented ex-superintendents can come on board and work at City hall in Westminster. We currently have a retired superintendent, Dean Ingledew, who headed up the west end police service, and before him we had Bob Currie. That arrangement has worked extremely well in developing those partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para27"><a name="08031958000044">The only potential flaw in the safer neighbourhoods initiative is that most community aspirations are not within the gift of the police but are down to local authorities, which means that the strength of the partnership, which hopefully extends beyond the political divide, is key. For as long as there is increased pressure on local government financing arrangements&#151;I am sure that there will be for the foreseeable future&#151;it will be all too easy for such innovative programmes to fall by the wayside. It is therefore crucial to keep that relationship as strong as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="80319h0001.htm_para28"><a name="08031958000045">Crime and antisocial behaviour are as big a problem in my constituency as they obviously are in Stafford, but community confidence and perceptions have improved, which stems from the ability to report incidents easily, to see a reaction within a reasonable time and to receive feedback from the responsible authority. That helps to build confidence through the reassurance cycle, through which we can reduce the fear of crime and improve many of the positive perceptions.</p>

It was established five years ago as a pilot project in three areas, but has been such a success that it has been rolled out across Westminster, which is now divided into 26 distinct CivicWatch areas, closely aligned to ward and police boundaries.</p>

In part that is done to raise confidence. Although central London has a relatively small residential population, some 900,000 people come to work in the 7 sq m of my constituency every day.

 I am grateful to my MP&#151;at least for four days a week&#151;for giving way. The hon. Gentleman mentioned his positive attitude towards PCSOs, but does he agree that the initial reluctance and doubts about the value of PCSOs and co-operation with them, which was reasonably widespread among the police force, has virtually disappeared? It has certainly disappeared in Leicestershire. It would help if his party abandoned the tired old rhetoric about plastic police and became more enthusiastic about the role that they can play.</p>

 There is no doubt that there was some hostility, not least from the Police Federation, which no doubt lobbied Labour Members as much as they did Opposition Members when the PCSO initiative began. In fairness, at the outset my party might have been slightly hostile to the idea of PCSOs, for public relations reasons as much as anything else, but we have now moved away from that hostility. I shall not take words out of the mouth of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), but I am sure that he will comment on that. However, where special constables, PCSOs and the police work together, they work extremely well. If there is a residual problem, it is with the Police Federation in certain parts of the country, which obviously is worried about terms and numbers. However, it has worked well and I am certainly a believer in neighbourhood policing and similar initiatives. PCSOs clearly have an extremely important day-to-day role in ensuring that that works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000050">I appreciate that many other hon. Members wish to contribute, so I shall end on one brief point. Without getting over-bureaucratic, the example of Westminster works extremely well. It has a three-tiered approach towards running the CivicWatch programme: local briefings and meetings occurring on a weekly basis in each CivicWatch area to enable local teams to share information and direct problem-solving activity on the ground; fortnightly meetings chaired by a chief inspector and a CivicWatch manager, which looks at best practice within the 26 areas; and an accountability meeting every six weeks, which is open to the public as well as the leader of the council and the police borough commander.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para2"><a name="08031958000051">These are exciting times in policing. My main point is that, historically and rightly, policing in this country has been very much citizen-led, of which we should be very proud, instead of the police being a class apart, as they are in many countries in Europe and across the world. Some of the initiatives being discussed are very important as we look forward to 21st-century policing, because there was a sense among the public that the police had lost their way in relation to their neighbourhood responsibilities. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

 I congratulate Thames Valley police on completing the roll-out of neighbourhood policing across the Thames Valley police area this month&#151;one month ahead of the deadline. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for securing this debate in such a timely fashion and for opening it with such an excellent speech. I should like to say how much I agree with the remarks of the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field). It is very good if neighbourhood policing can be entrenched on a cross-party basis, which is obviously best for community confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000054">Neighbourhood policing is a great success, popular with the public and effective in fighting crime. It is popular with the public because it puts more uniformed officers on the streets and, I am sure, because it links local policing to local priorities through the involvement of local people in neighbourhood action groups, which in Oxford pool the input of residents, neighbourhood watch, parish, city and county councillors, housing officers, youth services and schools, the city council crime and nuisance action team, city council street wardens and park rangers&#151;all of whom address the problems of antisocial behaviour, about which my hon. Friend spoke. The use of consultations and surveys helps to keep policing focused on what people are most concerned about and ensures that it addresses the day-to-day issues of community safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000055">At a time when many types of crime, perpetrated by highly organised criminals, must be combated with specialist units and sophisticated operations, which are often inevitably remote, neighbourhood policing makes policing visible at street level, thus enhancing confidence and security and garnering intelligence. I thank the neighbourhood specialist officers, the supporting special constabulary officers, the police community support officers, street wardens and park rangers for all their work in our community. Thanks to the innovation and resources provided by our Government, their work is just what modern policing often lacked before they came along: officers out on foot or on their bikes, with time to chat to pensioners and to youths hanging out, time to call round the shopping precincts and estates and time to engage actively in community events&#151;all the time building trust and confidence and forging local links and friendships.</p>

 Oxford city currently has 48 community support officers&#151;a number that will go up to 59 from this summer. Ten are part-funded by the city council and four by the university of Oxford. It is a pity that, after the police authority announced the expansion in numbers, the Liberal Democrat-controlled city council saw it as an opportunity to cut plans to expand further the city&#146;s contribution, even though it would have attracted additional match funding. I warmly welcome the expansion, and I know that my constituents do, too. The bottom line is that all those measures are making a real impact on fighting crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para5"><a name="08031958000060">In the three priority Oxford areas where neighbourhood policing operates&#151;Blackbird Leys, Rose Hill and Barton&#151;there has been a measurable reduction both in all crime and in key categories. For example, if we compare April to December last year with the same period the year before, violence against the person was down 16, 13 and 18 per cent. in the three areas respectively. Coupled with the work of the Oxford safer communities partnership, neighbourhood policing is contributing to a significant fall in crime throughout our city and, moreover, in the crimes that people fear most.</p>

 I am glad that my right hon. Friend also mentions safer community teams. Does he agree that one great advantage of neighbourhood policing is the way in which the police now work much better with other public services, principally health and social services, but also youth services and the rest? That is partly because we now give the police more time to undertake that more integrative role.</p>

 My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The inter-agency work and collaboration with other organisations through the neighbourhood action groups, to which I referred earlier, lies at the heart of that activity.</p>

Our police&#151;all of them&#151;and all the community support officers and neighbourhood action groups deserve praise and thanks for that achievement. There is still, of course, far too much crime and too many nasty incidents&#151;one crime is one too many&#151;but let us celebrate the progress that is being made. Let us build on what so clearly works to achieve still more for the future. Let us do all that we can, so that people can enjoy the community safety that is a hallmark of any civilised society.</p>

right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) said about the achievements of Thames Valley police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000066">We usually have debates in Westminster Hall because there is a problem, but I do not think that there is a problem with neighbourhood policing&#151;an issue to which I shall return. There are, however, a couple of problems with policing, and I should like to mention them briefly. First, the Minister must recognise that there is still considerable upset, dissatisfaction and frustration at the fact that the police pay award was not fully honoured this year, and that will rankle for a long time. If an independent police arbitration system says that a fair pay settlement is 2.5 per cent. and the figures are then massaged so that officers do not receive that settlement, it is simply unfair, bad personnel management and unjust for those people who provide an excellent public service.</p>

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="08031958000067"><a name="80319h0002.htm_spnew11"><a name="08031958000476"><b>Mr. Ruffley:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend also welcome the announcement by the shadow Home Secretary, our right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) that a departure by a Home Secretary in any future Conservative Government from any independent award will only ever happen under the affirmative procedure in the House? That is an important safeguard for police officers.</p>

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="08031958000068"><a name="80319h0002.htm_spnew12"><a name="08031958000477"><b>Mr. Jim Hood (in the Chair):</b>

 I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Those in public service need to know that they will be treated fairly and that, if independent arbitration systems are put in place, they will be honoured except in the most exceptional circumstances, which would have to be demonstrated using the affirmative procedure in Parliament. I hope that we never reach that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000070">The second issue is a problem, and as the Minister is present, I should like to have another crack at it. I am sure that I shall be supported by Members with constituencies not only in the Thames valley but throughout south-east England. The issue is the haemorrhage of police officers from Thames Valley police to the Metropolitan police. Over the past five years, we have lost 388 police officers to the Met, but the problem is worse than that, because they tend to be firearms officers, detectives and road policing officers. The chief constable of Thames Valley police, Sara Thornton, says:</p>
<a name="80319h0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08031958000400"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;This is a disproportionately high number of specialist officers, who are more experienced and highly trained. It seems likely that this proportion will rise in future years because of the high demand for specialist trained officers for the 2012 Olympics, the increased risk of terrorism, and other factors such as the opening of Terminal 5 at Heathrow.</p>
</ul><a name="80319h0002.htm_brev1"><a name="08031958000401"><ul><p class="tabletext">The loss of specialist officers impact in two ways: it leaves a capability gap, and increases the recruitment and training costs to replace the lost officers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000071">In Thames Valley police, it costs &#163;55,000 to train a patrol constable, &#163;63,000 for a detective constable and &#163;77,500 for a firearms constable&#151;not insignificant figures. The chief constable observes:</p>
<a name="80319h0002.htm_brev2"><a name="08031958000402"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;One of the factors cited by police officers who left or are thinking of leaving is the increased pay in the MPS&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000072">the Metropolitan Police Service&#151;</p>
<a name="80319h0002.htm_brev3"><a name="08031958000403"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;due to the London Allowance, compared to the South East England Allowance, and the difficulties of buying a house because of high property prices in the South East. Police officers are &#163;4,393 p.a. better off by transferring to the MPS, in addition to free travel on public transport up to a radius of 70 miles.</p>
</ul><a name="80319h0002.htm_brev4"><a name="08031958000404"><ul><p class="tabletext">A key point is that the South East England Allowance is frozen, while the London Allowance increases with inflation. When it was set in 2003 the differential was &#163;4,000, it is now &#163;4,393.&#148;</p>

Members went to see the Home Secretary, and I am sure that we were all grateful to her, because she very courteously listened to what we had to say. We do not criticise police officers who move, as anyone who has skills must be allowed to transfer them, but the difficulty in the Thames valley is that we are spending money on training police officers and then losing our most experienced officers. It would be fairer if police officers in the Thames valley got the same kind of pay and settlement as those in the Met. It is difficult to see why police officers in Slough should get one rate of pay while those just across the border in Uxbridge should get so much more. It is also daft that a police officer who lives in Banbury can travel to work in London for free, as police officers have free travel, thus taking the benefit of their skills and knowledge away from the Thames valley and my constituents. That issue cannot rumble on; it must be addressed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000075">Let me turn from the matters that are of concern to neighbourhood policing. The other day, I spent a day with neighbourhood police officers in Bicester, and I was extremely impressed by what I saw. There are three groups&#151;established police officers, police community support officers and street wardens&#151;and I was impressed by the mutual respect that they have for one another. I was particularly impressed by the respect that regular police officers have for PCSOs, and vice versa, and by the way in which all three teams work together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000076">PCSOs focus on areas in which they can make a difference, such as neighbourhood environmental quality. They respond positively to the concerns and needs of young people, and they deal with litter, antisocial behaviour and graffiti. One young PCSO has shown great initiative. She took it upon herself to write to Network Rail to ask what it was doing about the homophobic graffiti under a bridge in an underpass through which many people walk between housing estates and Bicester town centre. She did not receive a satisfactory answer, so I took the matter up with the chief executive of Network Rail. We eventually got it sorted, and the underpass has been painted. Similarly, the district council has now put litter bins in an area where the PCSOs had picked up a lot of litter. I was impressed to hear that the same PCSO, when she realised that a derelict factory was being used as a refuse dump, tracked down the owner and told them to get it sorted. Regular police officers probably would not have time to do that, and the matter would not necessarily be picked up by street wardens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000077">My impression is that everyone works together positively in Bicester&#151;I am sure that that happens in other towns&#151;and that it is making a real difference. However, there are also concerns about PCSOs, such as their pay, which is not fantastic. It is fine for young, single people, but I suspect that it is not a great salary for married PCSOs whose pay is the only family  <br>

income. Also, it is difficult to see what the promotional prospects will be for PCSOs, although I am glad that quite a lot of them in my patch eventually transfer into the regular police force. That creates a good opportunity for each side to evaluate the other and works well. However, there might be issues about the long-term career and pay structure for PCSOs. I do not see neighbourhood policing as a problem. In fact, it is very positive and everyone understands where it fits in. In my patch, it is a good news story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000078">The final issue that I want to discuss is neighbourhood watch. One advantage of being my own Member of Parliament is that, when I write to myself, I always agree with what I have to say, and I should like to share with the Chamber my views about neighbourhood watch. The traditional, old-fashioned neighbourhood watch scheme has something of Miss Marple about it and may have passed its sell-by date. Villagers think of themselves as living in villages, but people in towns do not think of themselves as living in neighbourhoods, except perhaps those in the Grimsbury area of Banbury. However, people recognise that the relationship between neighbours is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000079">We could introduce variations on neighbourhood watch, such as neighbour schemes that invite people to act as neighbours. Given that most future policing will have to be intelligence-led, the police will frequently need information, so people should be encouraged to give relevant information. In addition to the telephone numbers that people can use to give information, we should make better use of websites. We could increase people&#146;s ability to send information, perhaps anonymously, by text or electronically to local websites, such as a Banbury neighbours site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000080">Keeping young people on side is also important to intelligence-led policing. A difficulty with neighbourhood policing is that, if we are not careful, we can give the impression that all young people are a problem. When I go out with my two children, my son says to me, &#147;Look, dad, you&#146;ve got to be very careful; if we meet another youngster and they join us, we will be a group of feral youth, and you will be associated with a group of feral youth.&#148; There is a danger that younger people will feel that way. They will often have intelligence and other information that they could send by text, so we need to have mechanisms by which they can do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="80319h0002.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000081">Another variation of the neighbourhood watch scheme could be to use e-mail, which most people use. If we wrote to people locally to ask for their e-mail addresses for a positive purpose, most of them would respond. If the local police had the e-mail addresses of people in Banbury, they could send them updates about neighbourhood policing once a quarter. They could also send out instant alerts, for example, if the M40 is closed, which it is from time to time, or if they were looking for particular people. There is two-way traffic with information and intelligence, but how do we bring in the community? The community wants to be brought into neighbourhood policing, but the difficulty with neighbourhood watch is that it has depended very much on everything going through neighbourhood watch co-ordinators. With interactive websites and e-mail, the community could be more involved, especially if local authorities contributed, and the whole issue could be more positive.</p>

 It is a great pleasure to take part in the debate as someone who also represents middle England. It is a pleasure to support and congratulate my near neighbour in Staffordshire, my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), on securing the debate, which is timely because we are at the beginning of the neighbourhood policing campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para0"><a name="08031958000085">In Staffordshire, there are 2,300 officers and 21 neighbourhood policing units, each of which is headed by an inspector with 251 police constables and 224 PCSOs. I congratulate all the officers in Staffordshire, but perhaps I will especially concentrate on the neighbourhood policing teams and the neighbourhood policing campaign. I join my hon. Friend in supporting Staffordshire&#146;s bid for the roll-out of hand-held computers. I also commend Staffordshire police authority for reducing bureaucracy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000086">I also congratulate Staffordshire police authority on being at the forefront of introducing neighbourhood policing. In Staffordshire, neighbourhood policing was introduced well over a year ago and Staffordshire has been a leading police force in guaranteeing named officers in every neighbourhood. Understandably, there is pride in the achievement of Staffordshire police. My old friend Mike Poulter, chair of Staffordshire police authority, is quoted on the authority&#146;s website as saying:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000088">PCSOs bring with them a wealth of experience from their previous occupations. I have met many PCSOs who have had jobs in different sectors, gaining experience that is a considerable advantage when it comes to local neighbourhood policing. They also represent a wide range of ages, because they enter the PCSO family at different ages, and they are from various backgrounds. They are truly representative of the local communities that they serve. I am glad that our neighbourhood police officers work as a team with the PCSOs and in partnership with our local communities, including with local councillors and wardens. They know their communities and provide the reassurance that the public need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000089">We should also remember that, in the family of neighbourhood policing, we have the volunteers&#151;our special constabulary that splendidly supports the regular police force. Indeed, in most ways it is indistinguishable from the regular police force. Reference has been made to the number of special constables. In the Burton neighbourhood policing unit, we have 14 police constables, 14 PCSOs and 25 special constables, and in the Uttoxeter NPU, we have six police constables, five PCSOs and six special constables. There are more special constables in those areas than full-time officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para5"><a name="08031958000090">I thank all those involved in law enforcement in Staffordshire and congratulate Staffordshire police authority on the content of its website. Some hon. Members have already mentioned the importance of websites. The Staffordshire police authority website not only gives some of the history of the police force, but provides information on the policies and aspirations of Staffordshire police, neighbourhood watch schemes, Crimestoppers and PCSOs. Most importantly, the website gives full details of how people can contact their own neighbourhood police officer and their PCSOs, including by e-mail. The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) mentioned e-mail, and certainly in Staffordshire the website sets out how e-mail contact can be made with officers. My constituents can look at the details of the Burton and Uttoxeter NPUs; they can see how many officers we have and they can access their contact details, including their phone numbers; and they can obtain that information through the website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000091">Through local events, Staffordshire police authority is promoting awareness of neighbourhood policing fortnight and the importance of people learning the contact details of officers. I welcome that process. People can also get that information by visiting the local police station or by phoning 0845 330 2010, or from the <i>Safer Staffs.</i> newspapers. I urge people to find out who their local officers are, whether that is in Staffordshire, including in my constituency, or elsewhere in the country, because it is important to ensure that people are aware of their local police officers. We can make people feel safer in our communities by providing that knowledge of whom they can contact.</p>

my area there are some concerns about the long-term funding of those co-ordinators. In my patch, one officer is being funded through the borough council and the other through the county council, but because that funding is not long-term, we have certainly lost one of those officers. I am therefore concerned that we should ensure security of funding. If we lose those officers, we will lose the great service that local people have developed over the years to try to help the police to protect their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000093">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for raising this subject. As has been said before, it is opportune. We should raise the public&#146;s awareness that they have neighbourhood officers and encourage our constituents to attend the local consultation meetings, to talk to the police and to help to provide that safety, security and reduction in crime in our neighbourhoods that we all wish to see.</p>

 I too start by congratulating the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on securing this debate. He deployed a rare quality in a politician&#151;frankness&#151;in admitting that he secured this debate without knowing that it was opportune. It is indeed opportune and we are all grateful to him for securing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000095">The debate has been consensual. All the parties that were represented here&#151;the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink) has left us now&#151;agree that neighbourhood policing is a good thing and the Liberal Democrats certainly support it. As a party, we are very much in favour of &#147;pavement politics&#148;, so it is no surprise that we are in favour of &#147;pavement policing&#148;, which is what neighbourhood policing is largely about. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000096">We have some concerns about the level of resources that are available. We know from research that in the period up to March 2007, 20 out of 43 police forces experienced a drop in the number of police officers. We can only hope that when the figures for the period up to March 2008 become available, we will see that that trend has been reversed in those forces. Of course, we know that the total number of community support officers who were going to be deployed was reduced from the 24,000 that the Government had pledged to 16,000. No doubt, when the Minister responds he will point out that that lower number was the number that the police thought they could work with. However, I think that all hon. Members who have spoken here today are aware of areas in their own constituencies where there is still a high level of antisocial behaviour, for example, and where additional resources, if they could be brought to bear, could make a significant difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000097">There is one thing that is perhaps surprising about neighbourhood policing. I suppose I am slightly too young to have been brought up on &#147;Dixon of Dock Green&#148;. None the less, I was under the impression that intelligence about individuals in a particular neighbourhood was something that was accessible to the police and that they had people on their force who knew who the local hoodlums were and so on. However, it is only as a result of neighbourhood policing that there are now sufficient police resources available to enable that very individual identification of potentially problem people or households.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Mar 2008">

When that was revealed to me three or four years ago, it was a source of some surprise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000098">Like other Members, I am happy to endorse the activities of my own safer neighbourhood teams, and have joined several of them on patrol to witness first hand how they work. We did some canvassing in one road where one of the residents raised concerns with me about allegations of drug dealing going on close by. When I went out a few weeks later with the relevant safer neighbourhood team, I reported the matter to the lead officer, who raided the property a few weeks later and found that cannabis plants were being grown there. It is clear that safer neighbourhood teams are working, in that intelligence gets to the right people and can be acted on promptly at the right level. Like other Members, I attend the panel of my own safer neighbourhood team when I can, just to see how it and local councillors and leading members of the community identify what the priorities will be in their ward in the upcoming quarter. That works effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000099">That is not to say that bureaucracy, to which Members have referred, is not real; it needs to be tackled. The Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate, Brian Paddick, who has experience in the police force, will be looking carefully at it. Let me give the Minister one concrete example of bureaucracy, which was raised in the Home Affairs Committee yesterday, in the hope that he will be able to write to me and other Members about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000100">I do not whether the Minister has seen the Committee transcript, but Mr. Gargan, who is an assistant chief constable, raised a problem relating to CCTV cameras. He gave evidence that to change the direction that a CCTV is pointing&#151;not to install a camera, but to change its direction&#151;officers are required to fill in a 17-page form. That applies regardless of whether the surveillance is covert or overt. I questioned him further on that and asked whether the police were required to do that, or whether there is some scope for interpreting the law in one way or another. He said that it was probably because of the latter&#151;interpretation of the law rather than a clear command&#151;that the form had to be filled in to change the direction of a CCTV camera. If nothing else results from this debate, I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify for our benefit and for that officer&#146;s benefit whether that is, in fact, a requirement. If it is not, could it be made clear that it is not, so that if the police want to make such a change&#151;perhaps to move a CCTV camera so that it focuses on a particular parade where there have been significant problems&#151;they can deal with it more effectively and without the need to complete a 17-page form?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000101">We need to tackle problems of bureaucracy, but neighbourhood policing requires other actions to be taken as well. Such actions are not necessarily about policing but to do with licensing, particularly licensing regimes and ensuring responsible behaviour on the part of off-licences, bars, clubs and so on, and ensuring that we design out crime in our town centres. Those matters need to be addressed before we come to the question of neighbourhood policing itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000102">My party can happily sign up to the four key principles that the Government have set out for neighbourhood policing: having visible and accessible police, influencing community safety priorities, interventions that solve local problems, and answers that give solutions to problems  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Mar 2008">

and feedback on results. The hon. Member for Stafford said that police accessibility was not simply about bricks and mortar. I agree that it must not simply be about that, but making the police accessible often does boil down to bricks and mortar, or at least to there being a contact point that people know about. It could be a mobile police station as opposed to a permanent base; what is needed is a known location to which people can go to visit their police officers. That is why at local level and, indeed, in London and beyond, the idea of safer neighbourhood teams having their own permanent base in their ward is appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000103">The police certainly are more visible and accessible. The surveys that we have done over many years confirm that to be true. When we put out surveys five or 10 years ago that asked, &#147;When did you last see a police officer?&#148;, the responses that often came back were, &#147;Never,&#148; or &#147;Twelve months ago.&#148; Now it is almost not worth putting out such surveys because the responses tend to be much more positive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000104">Progress is being made on the key principles, and Liberal Democrats support that. It is clear from the statistics that community support officers and safer neighbourhood teams are increasing public confidence in the police through their extra visibility, and, as in the concrete example to which I referred, through ensuring that local intelligence is passed on to the appropriate people and acted on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000105">One of the key recommendations in Sir Ronnie Flanagan&#146;s review of policing was that partnership working between the police and local communities and councils should be prioritised. I commend the example of my own borough, the London borough of Sutton, which for several years has had joint working and a joint appointment. The person happens to be a police officer, but someone from the local authority or, indeed, from outside the local authority could have been appointed. One person is responsible for the parks police, the safer neighbourhood teams, the wardens and aspects of enforcement that the local authority takes on, so that all the resources can be brought to bear in an organised fashion when local problems are identified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000106">I conclude by drawing attention to concerns about neighbourhood policing that other Members have referred to and which have been raised by the Police Federation. The Minister will be familiar with the report that the federation produced in December 2006, &#147;24/7 Response Policing in the Modern Police Organisation&#151;Views from the Frontline&#148;. Things have moved on, and the level of resources is clearly now much more significant, but the concerns that the federation raised then&#151;only 18 months ago&#151;were about whether staffing would be sufficient to provide the safer neighbourhood teams, and whether 24/7 response officers would be drawn from their activities and put into safer neighbourhood teams. The federation was also concerned that safer neighbourhood teams would not reduce the work that 24/7 response officers had to do but might, in fact, increase it. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that discussions with the federation indicate that those issues have either gone away or are not as salient now as they were then.</p>

Once it is bedded in, there will no doubt be a need for some fine tuning. That may mean looking at the balance of police officers and community support officers on safer neighbourhood teams. Undoubtedly, there will be discussion at some point about how we balance the real need for visible policing by officers who are known to the people in an area, with the real challenges that the police face in specific locations where they might want to deploy more resources. There will be discussions about how we get that balance right, but, broadly speaking, my party supports and welcomes the direction of travel. Subject to some fine tuning, it will deliver real benefit to communities up and down the country in years to come.</p>

 I and my colleagues congratulate the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on securing this timely debate. Let me make it clear that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition support the six broad goals set out in the Government&#146;s 2005 document on neighbourhood policing. We believe in the principle that local people should have more influence over setting local safety priorities. We believe in stronger partnership working not just between local authorities, neighbourhood watches and local citizens&#146; groups, but also between primary care trusts and the whole family of partnership workers in crime and disorder reduction partnerships and other groupings. We also believe that having a more visible presence on the streets is vital to neighbourhood policing. We need to cut the paperwork and get more officers and police community support officers back on the beat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para22"><a name="08031958000111">My concerns do not relate to the principle of neighbourhood policing, which we support, but its implementation. The Conservative-controlled borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, which I visited earlier this week, provides an excellent example of delivering 24/7 policing. Two wards are enjoying this piloted experiment, which involves working across 24-hour periods. They have, on average, 30 officers, rather than the London average of six. It is worth while focusing on the results, and I would like the Minister&#146;s views on them. In Shepherd&#146;s Bush, for example, robberies are down by 48 per cent. In Fulham Broadway, overall crime is down 10 per cent., with burglary down 27 per cent. and theft down 22 per cent. Those are real examples of a very aggressive 24/7 neighbourhood policing policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80319h0003.htm_para23"><a name="08031958000112">What is the evidence for crime reductions in non-24/7 areas&#151;our average neighbourhood policing areas? The Home Office&#146;s report this February, &#147;Neighbourhood policing: the impact of piloting and early national implementation&#148;, which I know the Minster will have studied with care, did not provide any numerical evidence for significant reductions in crime in the 16 wards that it studied. I wonder what the Minister&#146;s view is of the empirical evidence for crime reduction in neighbourhood policing areas.</p>

need to go into the argument about the Government&#146;s promise at the time of the last election to recruit 24,000 PCSOs by 2008. That target has been reduced to 16,000.

I have one simple question, to which the House deserves an answer, and I am not making a party political point, because every hon. Member who cares about the problem will want the answer.

In his interim report on 11 September, he strongly recommended that the Association of Chief Police Officers and the National Policing Improvement Agency draft a national suite of streamlined forms containing minimum reporting requirements by summer 2008. Conservatives support that, but we do not seem to be having much success. If anyone speaks to ACPO and the NPIA, as I did yesterday, there is not much evidence of a national suite of forms with minimum reporting requirements being produced by the summer of this year, as Sir Ronnie originally wished to see. Perhaps the Minister can comment on that. We are not going to have better and more effective neighbourhood policing unless the Government get serious at a national level on cutting red tape and reducing bureaucracy.</p>

 It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) on securing the debate. If he does not mind me embarrassing him, may I also say that, as normal, he introduced his subject in an intelligent and thoughtful way? That gives enormous power to his arguments. I know that he works assiduously for his constituents, not only in respect of neighbourhood policing, but on a whole range of different matters, and I congratulate him on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000125">Before I respond to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), I shall deal with some of the other points raised. This was a very intelligent debate and discussion, and hon. Members raised matters of importance. They were concerned with how to improve the delivery of neighbourhood policing in every area. The debate was not about the principle of it, because we all know that what people want is a visible uniformed presence on the street, but about how we can make that as effective as possible and how we ensure that local people can influence those officers in a proportionate way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para5"><a name="08031958000126">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) was right to say that issues other than neighbourhood policing are important. It is for local police forces to achieve a balance in relation to that, which is something that we should not lose sight of. I was pleased that he and others highlighted the role of PCSOs. Given some of the publicity about them, it is important to say again that the Government and the vast majority of hon. Members think that they do an outstanding job in our communities. The introduction of PCSOs has been a major reform and has led to considerable improvements. We should consistently acknowledge that. When I and many other hon. Members travel around the country or are in our constituencies, we pay tribute to the role of PCSOs. I am grateful for his support on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000127">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the role of specials, and it is right and proper that we recognise their role in delivering neighbourhood policing. It is not just the number of specials that is important, but  <br>

the number who are active in communities, which is a point that is often lost. A change was made in the past few years and the police work hard to ensure that specials are properly integrated into neighbourhood policing teams, and that they are active and working hard in those teams, rather than simply being numbers in a book. There has been considerable improvement in that and integration has been an important factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000128">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) talked about neighbourhood management, which is a particularly important point&#151;in fact, it is crucial. Neighbourhood policing cannot be delivered without being part of neighbourhood management. He made that point when he talked about the reduction in crime in his area, brought about by a neighbourhood management approach. The role of PCSOs was also important and, again, he highlighted the difference that they have made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000129">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry) talked about a subway in his area where a tremendous difference has been made by the local authority&#151;or Network Rail or whoever was responsible&#151;painting out some graffiti. That is not a policing function. In many respects, it is the function of the local authority or whoever is responsible. Painting out graffiti containing homophobic hatred or other types of graffiti means that when people walk down the subway, they will feel the benefit of the actions of those who take a pride in the community. Sometimes the simple measures that people think should be done&#151;and they cannot understand why they are not done&#151;make a real difference. In all our constituencies, fixing a broken streetlight or sign makes a huge difference. That is not part of a policing response, but part of neighbourhood management, in which the police play an important role. I think it would be a shock if I&#151;a Labour Minister&#151;turned up in the middle of Banbury, and we would perhaps have some fun if I did so, but, on a serious note, I will consider visiting.</p>

We have been asked to revisit that allowance and to uprate it to deal with inflation.

One of the tasks for neighbourhood policing is to ensure that local people feel that they can influence the priorities and have a real say.

Clearly, one of the reasons we reduced the funding for PCSOs from last April was because the Association of Chief Police Officers asked us to. Similarly, surely the mix of police staffing, staff numbers, PCSOs and uniformed officers is a matter for local police chiefs. Sooner or later, Parliament will have to make up its mind across the board about whether it wants to issue national diktats to local police forces or have local decision making, even if that sometimes means taking an easy political hit. With respect to the police, we must decide whether we want effective policing determined locally or yah-boo politics dictating what is an appropriate public policy. That is something on which we need to reflect. The Flanagan review has made its recommendation, which the Government will consider in due course.</p>

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="08031958000144"><a name="80319h0004.htm_spnew6"><a name="08031958000493"><b>Helen Jones (Warrington, North) (Lab):</b>
 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I am glad to have secured a debate on housing need in Warrington and to see my hon. Friend the Minister in his place&#151;he takes a serious interest in such matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000145">I am not here as a nimby. Warrington is not a town of nimbys. For many years, it was part of the Warrington-Runcorn new town area, and the town expanded rapidly. We have a thriving economy, and under this Government, people in my constituency have seen a change: vast numbers of people were unemployed, but now more people are in employment than Beveridge defined as full employment. As a result, my constituency contains a surprising mix of people, including families who have lived in the town for generations, people who have come from Manchester and Liverpool, and people who, like me, have come from further afield and who are proud to live in the town even though they were not born there. Nevertheless, we have a serious housing problem, and my constituents are concerned about the kind of housing that is being built and that is planned for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000146">Our problem can be summed up very simply. Warrington has exceeded its house building targets for years, yet we do not have the kind of housing that we need. At the last count, 11,320 people were on the housing waiting list; yet between 2002-03 and 2006-07, only 142 units of social housing were built. We have the additional problem that house prices in the town are much higher than in the surrounding areas. The average cost of a semi-detached house in Warrington is more than &#163;175,000 and the average cost of a terraced house is more than &#163;130,000, but many people in the area are on low wages, despite the Government&#146;s efforts to get people back to work. The town as a whole does not score high in the indexes of deprivation, but seven wards, many of which are in my constituency, are in the bottom 25 per cent. of the most deprived areas in the country. As a result, the average house price in Warrington is nine times the average wage and, to get a typical mortgage, it is estimated that someone needs to earn about &#163;50,000, which is twice the average wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000147">We have a joint problem. People who need social housing cannot obtain it, and young couples who want to get a foot on the ladder cannot afford to buy. The problem is not exclusive to Warrington. When the Government office for the north-west held a meeting to brief MPs on housing growth point status bids&#151;it was rather late in the day, if I may say&#151;the problem was raised by many hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Minister will have seen at his surgeries families who live in such overcrowded conditions that people sleep in living rooms and boys and girls share bedrooms, sometimes when one is in their teenage years, and young couples who are desperate to buy but simply cannot find anything that they can afford. At the briefing meeting, I hope that it was conveyed to him that many of us who unfortunately have Liberal Democrat or Tory-controlled councils&#151;or, as in my area, an alliance of both, which we call the &#147;ConDems&#148;&#151;have no faith in the willingness of those councils to supply affordable housing even when they have put in growth point status bids. I have no doubt of  <br>

the Government&#146;s commitment, but I have grave doubts about the ability and willingness of Warrington borough council to deliver.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000148">Warrington&#146;s bid gives all the appearance of having been cobbled together. Originally, it was a stand-alone bid from Warrington, but at the suggestion of the Government office for the north-west, it was linked with the bids from Halton and St. Helens. I am concerned about that because those areas have different housing problems, and they are in a different situation from Warrington. For instance, the bid says that the council can deal with the traffic problems, but anyone who lives in Warrington knows that the town is frequently gridlocked. It also says that there is no flooding problem, which is interesting, because I received a letter from the strategic director of environment and regeneration that says,</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev1"><a name="08031958000409"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;as you know, the town is vulnerable to flooding from a number of sources&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000149">It goes on to say that I should lobby the Government for more money to deal with flooding, stating:</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08031958000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I remain concerned however that such increased funding remains insufficient to permit spending on flood defences in Warrington&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para22"><a name="08031958000150">The bid has not been thought through. When my hon. Friend the Minister looks at it, he will not need a crystal ball, but simply to read the book. The last big planning permission granted by the council was for a site on Loushers lane. Some 178 houses will be built, only 17 of which will be affordable. Frankly, that is scandalous given that the council holds the whip hand in granting planning permission, because it has exceeded its housing targets. In its bid, the council says that it will require about 419 units of affordable housing a year to meet the need, despite</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev3"><a name="08031958000411"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;having a considerable over-supply of housing in relation to the regional requirement&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para23"><a name="08031958000151">That is exactly right, but only because we have been building the wrong sort of housing for people&#146;s needs. I fear that the bid will continue that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para24"><a name="08031958000152">My hon. Friend the Minister should not be fooled by some of what is said in the bid; the key is in the front, where the council talks about building on</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev4"><a name="08031958000412"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;previously developed and under-used land in the town centre and its waterfront&#151;transforming the area as the platform for the town&#146;s economic growth&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para25"><a name="08031958000153">The bid document returns to that, but it does not sound much like affordable housing to me. Planners and some Warrington councillors have long held the ambition of developing the waterfront in the same way as they have been developed in Manchester and Liverpool. However, if people want to buy waterfront flats in a big city, they would normally go to a big city; yet the council has allowed such flats to be built there and in other areas in the town. Anyone can pick them out not only because they stand out like a sore thumb from the rest of the town, but because they are festooned with &#147;To let&#148; signs. They have been bought and put into the buy-to-let market at prices that most of my constituents cannot afford. When I asked the chief executive whether there would be affordable housing along the river, she looked sheepish and said, &#147;Well, some.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para26"><a name="08031958000154">The real intentions could be deduced at a meeting that was held when my right hon. Friend the Minister for the North West visited Warrington last year. The  <br>

meeting was set up by the Government office for the north-west, which is why I do not have much faith in its ability to assess the bid. It invited big developers and even the principal of the local college, but not the town&#146;s MPs. If it had done so, we might have had something to say on aspects of the bids. For instance, the bid states:</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev5"><a name="08031958000413"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Many...urban sites lend themselves to high density developments in the form of flats or apartments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para27"><a name="08031958000155">Perhaps the difference between a flat and an apartment is how much someone pays for it, but that is not what my constituents or the people who are looking for housing want; they want houses in which they can bring up their families decently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para28"><a name="08031958000156">The bid talks about &#147;building a new image&#148; for Warrington. Frankly, I would rather the council builds some affordable housing. I hope that, when looking at such bids, my hon. Friend the Minister will not allow a situation in which families who have lived in an area for generations are priced out because of the kind of buildings that are being developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para29"><a name="08031958000157">Even when there is affordable housing, the council cannot be relied upon to keep it in the affordable sector. Many allegations about properties built as affordable homes being sold to the wrong people have been made. For example, a lady who was previously a constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Helen Southworth) was renting a house for &#163;550 a month. The house was built as affordable housing and was sold for &#163;79,000 to someone who already had a property. When my hon. Friend raised the matter with the council, it told her that there was</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev6"><a name="08031958000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;insufficient evidence to prove that there is a breach of the S106 agreement.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para30"><a name="08031958000158">When the case was passed to me, I pointed out that the council had admitted that there were flaws in the section 106 agreement and asked what it was doing to strengthen it. I got a reply from the strategic director of community services, who shows neither any strategy nor any regard for the community. I was told that the council could not strengthen the agreement because</p>
<a name="80319h0004.htm_brev7"><a name="08031958000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;S106 agreements are precisely that, an agreement between signatories.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para31"><a name="08031958000159">Well, knock me down with a feather. In this case, one of the signatories holds most of the cards and is not using them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="80319h0004.htm_para32"><a name="08031958000160">I was also told that, although affordable housing should not be sold to someone who owned a property or had sold one in the past three years,</p>

Yet it told my hon. Friend that it would deliver 50 per cent. affordable housing if it were allowed to be a housing growth point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000162">The council makes great play of inward movement to Warrington. We are not nimbys, but the first duty of a council is to cater for its own population. At the moment, people are moving in to buy the more expensive housing, which is still less expensive than in some of the big cities, whereas young couples who have grown up in the town are having to move out to find somewhere affordable to buy. I hope that, when my hon. Friend the Minister examines the bid, he will take steps to stop that happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para2"><a name="08031958000163">There are fears about sites that are coming on stream, such as the site of the old Bruche police training centre in my constituency. English Partnerships has bought it and wants to develop it for housing. A lot of consultation is still needed with the local community about what community facilities there should be and so on, but I understand from my discussions that the council is already trying to impose conditions that would reduce the amount of affordable housing that could be built there. The fear is that the same thing will happen if the council closes Woolston high school, in the centre of my constituency, as it scandalously wants to, and that the site will be sold to the highest bidder and developed without regard to the housing needs of the community and without proper community facilities, thus enabling the council to bank large capital receipts, which it will no doubt spend south of the river in the town, so my constituents will not benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000164">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure me and my constituents on a number of matters: first, that the bid will be properly appraised, despite being lumped in with two other councils that have very different circumstances at the instigation of the Government office for the north-west. I hope that the bid will be examined, so that if it is allowed, the council provides 50 per cent. affordable housing on different sites around the area, instead of pricing local people out of an area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000165">Secondly, my constituents will want to be reassured that the housing that is built will be of good quality, with the right community facilities. They do not want more high-rise flats, and they do not want what one lady described to me as &#147;cheap and nasty&#148; affordable housing. That is not the Government&#146;s intention, and my hon. Friend is committed to providing good-quality housing for hard-working people, but I should like to know how he will ensure that the council does that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para5"><a name="08031958000166">Thirdly, my constituents are keen for affordable housing to be built for the sons and daughters of Warrington people. I have done a lot of surveys all around my constituency, and that message has come out loud and clear. We must ensure that we do not just have expensive houses that local people cannot afford to buy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000167">Fourthly, we must tackle the shortage of rented housing in the borough. Building affordable housing will help to tackle the waiting list that I mentioned, but there will always be people who want or need to rent. There is also a hidden need among people who want to move, for various reasons, but know that they have no chance of doing so at the moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000168">I want my hon. Friend to reassure my constituents that we will get the kind of housing that we need. He and the Government are committed to that, but the real question is how we can get local authorities, which might not be as committed to it as we are, to deliver for the people whom I represent.

my constituency are fed up of being priced out of their own area. I do not want to see any more people in my surgery crying because they cannot move into rented housing or because they are desperate to get a start in life and find somewhere to buy but cannot do so in the area where they have grown up. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to reassure me on the matters that I have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="st_40"><a name="08031958000172"><a name="80319h0005.htm_spnew1"><a name="08031958000496"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 It was alcohol-related crime&#151;I am sorry. My hon. Friend works assiduously on behalf of her constituents on a range of matters, not least the need for more affordable housing in Warrington. She has been particularly strong in ensuring that her constituents are heard here in the House, in Whitehall and throughout the north-west region, particularly with regard to housing. <i>Hansard</i> demonstrates her persistence on that subject. Both I and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing can personally testify to the representations that she has made on behalf of those seeking affordable housing in the borough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000173">If you and my hon. Friend will allow me, Mr. Hood, I wish to mention the national housing picture and then apply it to the circumstances in Warrington. My hon. Friend will welcome the fact, as I do, that housing is back at the top of the political agenda, and that the Government are determined to provide better, greener and more affordable housing. To be frank, this country has not been building enough homes since the early 1970s, which means that concerted effort is needed. Rising prosperity and a thriving economy over the past decade have meant that more people want to get on the property ladder&#151;particularly, as she said, hard-working families. Equally, more people are living alone as a result of social change, and people are living longer, with the result that we need more homes that are suitable for older people, perhaps with provision for their grandchildren to stay with them to maintain a family network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000174">The Government published the housing Green Paper, &#147;Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable&#148;, in July 2007. It set a target of 2 million new homes by 2016 and 3 million by 2020. Within that total, we have set a target of providing at least 70,000 new affordable homes a year by 2010-11, of which 45,000 should be for rent. The Government expect at least 30 per cent. of new socially rented provision by the Housing Corporation to be family accommodation, to ease the overcrowding pressures that my hon. Friend so eloquently mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000175">With the renewed political priority have come substantially increased resources. The Government have pledged about &#163;8.4 billion over the next three years to  <br>

tackle the problem of affordable housing. There has been a substantial increase in the resources available for providing new and affordable homes in the north-west region. About &#163;526 million has been allocated to the national affordable housing programme for the next three years, with the aim of aiding the completion of about 6,500 socially rented homes and up to 3,000 affordable properties for sale.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000176">The regional housing strategy in the north-west is currently being refreshed to better reflect the affordability agenda, and I understand that Warrington should be better placed to attract support in future years because of it. I understand also that the borough has so far secured &#163;4.7 million, in strategic partnership with a number of registered social landlords, to fund the development of 94 new homes for rent in the current bidding round. Further bids will be developed for the Housing Corporation&#146;s regular market engagement in the coming months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000177">Like my hon. Friend, I represent a northern seat and I am conscious of the fact that pressures on housing and affordability are not confined to London and the south-east. As she so excellently said, there are concerns about affordability in every region, which is why the Green Paper extended the growth points programme to the north for the first time. Growth point status is not a statutory designation, but represents a relationship between central Government and local partners. It is built on four principles: early delivery of housing as part of growth plans; supporting local partners to achieve sustainable growth; working with local partners to ensure that infrastructure and service provision keep pace with growth; and ensuring effective delivery. Levels of growth will be subject to comprehensive testing and public consultation through the regional and local planning processes, and I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend. The aim is to ensure that individual proposals are sustainable, environmentally acceptable and realistic in terms of infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000178">As my hon. Friend said, Warrington, in conjunction with neighbouring authorities, submitted an expression of interest for growth point status in October 2007. In December, the Government office for the north-west held an informal briefing for the region&#146;s MPs, at which my hon. Friend expressed her views&#151;in a somewhat forthright manner, as she said&#151;about the priority that affordable housing should be given in the delivery of new housing in her patch. The Government office for the north-west passed on her views in writing to the chief executive of Warrington borough council. Again, my hon. Friend is to be commended on her interest in this emerging agenda, which will impact greatly on the level of affordable housing available to her constituents. I fundamentally agree that MPs should be at the heart of this process representing their constituents. At this point, however, I should make it clear that we are still considering all applications for new growth point status, and no decisions have been made, but I cannot say more on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000179">As I have mentioned, and as my hon. Friend said, affordability has emerged as the single most important issue in housing almost everywhere. Warrington is one of many areas suffering the consequences of the market&#146;s historical failure to supply enough housing to meet rising demand. Average lower-quartile house prices in Warrington have risen by about 179 per cent.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="19" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>19 Mar 2008 : Column 253WH</b><br>
in the past 10 years, which is much faster than comparable incomes. Between 2001 and 2006, the average property price in Warrington rose by 83.7 per cent., compared with an increase of 74.7 per cent. for England and Wales as a whole. As my hon. Friend suggested, the ratio of lower-quartile house prices to income was 3.26 in 1997 and 6.72 by 2007, although it has come down slightly from a peak last year. Taken together, those figures make Warrington the 15th least affordable borough in the north-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000180">Warrington&#146;s history of new town development and subsequent strong economic growth, as well as the investment that has been put into education, of which my hon. Friend is a massive champion in her area, have attracted many workers to the town, and that, in turn, has fostered significant housing development. However, my hon. Friend is right that we must do more to encourage and enable young families who were born in Warrington and who want to stay there to do so. I am anxious that we do not price them out of their home town. My hon. Friend has often expressed concern&#151;she has done so in an excellent fashion this morning&#151;at the apparent disconnect between the rising number of homes in Warrington and the growing number of people looking for social and affordable housing in the borough. My comments on that will form the main part of my response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000181">My hon. Friend made the important argument that we are talking not simply about housing numbers, but about the type and mix of new housing that is created in the borough. Again, the figures bear out her analysis. Access to social housing has become more difficult: there were about 10,400 households on Warrington&#146;s housing waiting list on 1 April 2007, and that has increased. That compares with 2,516 in 1997. The number of new social lettings has also declined in recent years, from 1,311 in 2003-04 to just 1,112 in 2006-07&#151;a fall of about 15 per cent. The number of new houses built, as opposed to other properties, such as maisonettes or flats, is slowing more markedly, falling from 421 in 2003-04 to 311 in 2006-07, and I fully understand&#151;I think that my hon. Friend will share this concern&#151;that that needs to be tackled. Finally, 90 households were accepted as homeless in Warrington between October and December 2007, which is a 14.5 per cent. increase over the same period the previous year. Bringing those figures together, there is no doubt that housing supply and affordability are crucial issues for the town.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000182">The council has a key role to play in addressing those challenges, as my hon. Friend has said. It must ensure that it stands up for mixed developments that provide a range of buildings, tenures and, crucially, community facilities. Planning policy statement 3 should help to achieve that. To illustrate my point, I will quote from the letter that my Department sent to local planning authorities when PPS3 was released. The letter states:</p>
<a name="80319h0005.htm_brev1"><a name="08031958000183"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;PPS 3 puts in place a national policy framework for planning for housing at the local and regional level. It provides an enabling framework for local planning authorities, working with their stakeholders,&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000184">&#151;MPs are crucial stakeholders in this respect&#151;</p>
<a name="80319h0005.htm_brev2"><a name="08031958000185"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;including developers, to deliver both the right quantity of housing to address need and demand in their area, and the right quality and mix of housing for their communities.&#148;</p>
</ul><br>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000186">That last point is crucial. I know that my hon. Friend agrees that we do not wish to see the physical polarisation of the poor and the affluent. We do not wish to see gated communities on the canal in Warrington, away from ghettos elsewhere in the borough. Such an approach is not conducive to sustainable, prosperous and thriving communities. The local authority needs to aim to create vibrant, mixed-tenure communities by ensuring that the right housing of the highest quality is in the right place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000187">Our housing Green Paper announced various measures to help councils to carry out their strategic housing role and deliver such communities, such as a new housing and planning delivery grant totalling &#163;510 million to direct extra resources to councils; new approaches to help councils provide more social housing; joint venture vehicles that councils can establish to work in partnership with the newly created Homes and Communities Agency to deliver affordable housing on council land; and encouragement for councils to bring long-term empty homes back into use, making better use of existing stock and partnerships with a wider range of housing providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para22"><a name="08031958000188">Our recent efforts have focused particularly on attempts to encourage local authorities to make better use of their statutory planning powers to improve the supply of affordable housing through section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which I understand has played a particular role in Warrington in the recent past. Some 420 affordable units were completed in the six years up to 2005-06, and the local authority has reported to me that an additional 667 units have already been secured for future delivery. The council also expects to receive more than &#163;5.6 million in section 106 commuted sums to be spent solely on future affordable housing projects, move-on accommodation and tackling long-term voids. However, I take on board precisely what my hon. Friend was saying on the matter and I will look closely at it.</p>

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="08031958000189"><a name="80319h0005.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031958000497"><b>Helen Jones:</b>
 Does my hon. Friend agree&#151;I am sure he does&#151;that councils should not accept those payments when they are a way for a developer to wriggle out of their obligation to provide affordable housing, thus making it more difficult to provide mixed communities?</p>

<p><a name="st_42"><a name="08031958000190"><a name="80319h0005.htm_spnew3"><a name="08031958000498"><b>Mr. Wright:</b>
 That is an important point. We need to ensure that the agreements that have been made under section 106 are followed through absolutely and complied with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para23"><a name="08031958000191">At this point, I should say that my hon. Friend has pushed this agenda in Warrington and made the council address the issues we are talking about. Warrington has also completed a strategic housing market assessment, which has identified a shortfall in smaller one and two-bedroomed houses, particularly in the social sector, a shortfall in larger family housing across all sectors, and the potential for intermediate housing. I commend my hon. Friend for taking that agenda forward in Warrington and highlighting to the council and others precisely what is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para24"><a name="08031958000192">Let me briefly mention the regional spatial strategy to give a more regional perspective. The RSS panel report refers to the delivery of an average of 380 dwellings per annum in the borough, and I understand that Warrington is pushing forward with a clear ambition to deliver substantially more, although I recognise that we  <br>

are talking not only about housing numbers, but about ensuring that we have the right mix of tenure in the right place. I would be honoured if my hon. Friend invited me to Warrington to have a look around, to address the issues and to ensure that the principles of having housing developments in the right place with the right mix and the right community facilities are engaged on the ground. If Warrington is to realise its ambition to deliver half of the new growth as affordable housing, that would represent a step change in performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para25"><a name="08031958000193">I hope that I have demonstrated that we are fully aware of the affordability problems in Warrington. The Government have provided the borough council with the strategic framework, the powers and the funding and partnership opportunities to make a real impact on this issue in the future. Furthermore, we are committed, through our agencies and Government offices, to working with the local authority, elected representatives and all partners to help Warrington deliver the right kind and mix of housing in the right place as quickly as possible. I hope that the local authority in Warrington, as well as other agencies, is as bold, clear minded, determined and ambitious as my hon. Friend is on behalf of the hard-working, decent families and people of Warrington.</p>

 It is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I look forward to an interesting debate. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this topic. I thank in particular the hon.

It takes only a fraction of a second, and we are all very used to it. Water is one of the handful of substances essential to life&#151;not a convenience, a whim, a habit or a trend, but a necessity. Without water we die, so we need a regular, easily accessible supply of water. If water is not immediately accessible, we must go to find it. None of us in this room has to go far. This debate aims to draw attention to the fact that for too many people worldwide do not have that ease and convenience of access, and that what we take for granted is far from being taken for granted all over the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="80319h0005.htm_para28"><a name="08031958000197">World water day, 22 March, is being marked in this place by this debate and an early-day motion tabled by the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore), who is in his place on the Liberal Democrat Benches. This debate and the early-day motion underline some uncomfortable facts. Half the developing world lacks basic sanitation. Nearly 2.5 billion people in the world, roughly two in five of all of us, do not have proper drains or toilets, and 1.1 billion, roughly one in six, do not have access to safe drinking water. Some 1.8 million people, 90 per cent. of whom are children under the age of five, mostly in developing countries, die every year from diseases related to diarrhoea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. Water-related disease is the second biggest killer of children worldwide. The average person in the developing world uses 10 litres of water every day&#151;the same amount that we use every time we flush the toilet.</p>

All other developing regions have made insufficient progress towards this target. In sub-Saharan Africa, the absolute number of people without access to sanitation actually increased&#151;from 335 million in 1990 to 440 million people by the end of 2004.

In some circumstances, that parade of graceful, incredibly resourceful people can appear rather romantic&#151;a traditional pattern of life being carried on in the modern world&#151;but in reality it is the face of a disaster. Lack of water is one of the single greatest factors restraining developing nations from fulfilling their true potential, as women and children&#146;s time and effort is diverted from other activities to the daily grind of securing water&#151;an act that all of us take for granted. The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is four miles, and the average weight of the water that they carry on their heads is some 20 kg, roughly the same as our baggage allowance in a United Kingdom airport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000200">That is why, yesterday morning, a collection of hon. Members, religious leaders and some 30 wonderful children from All Souls Church of England primary school in Foley street, London, led by their head teacher, Miss Alex Ascough, assembled in Parliament square to undertake a symbolic four-mile journey to collect water from a fountain in Hyde park, fill some containers and return. We carried nothing like the amount of water that we would actually need for the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para2"><a name="08031958000201">I asked the House of Commons Library to estimate how much water is used each day on the parliamentary estate, and the Library kindly put together some figures for me. In 2006-07, the estate used 178,084 cu m of water. In working out what that comes to for each of us, one can do various calculations: per Member and peer, per working day or per sitting day. Our best minimum estimate was that all of us&#151;MPs, peers, parliamentary staff, political staff and visitors&#151;use 23 gallons of water every day, 365 days a year. Imagine if we had to carry that every day&#151;fetching it, carrying it, bringing it into our offices&#151;before starting work and getting on with the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000202">I commend those who walked with us yesterday, particularly the children. Their behaviour was impeccable, their interest in what we were doing was remarkable and their sense of solidarity with their brothers and sisters in so many places around the world who do the same for real every day was palpable. I thank them and the school for their efforts. The walk was, we hope, the first of hundreds in the &#147;Turn on the Tap&#148; campaign of challenge walks being organised nationwide by the Christian international development organisation, Samaritan&#146;s Purse. Churches, community organisations, schools, clubs and individuals are being encouraged to organise similar four-mile walks on or around 10 May this year. The charity hopes that the simple symbolism captured by the walk will encourage more people to direct their aid efforts towards water provision, and it has prepared aids for schools, including lesson plans and charts, to encourage those who wish to organise a walk. I commend Samaritan&#146;s Purse for what it is doing and for its efforts to bring it to the attention of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000203">Samaritan&#146;s Purse is far from being the only charity involved with water provision.

importance of the provision of water and provide opportunities for people to donate to support such projects. I am sure that the whole House would commend such work and urge individuals and communities to continue to do what they can to support it. Although government has its role in development&#151;I shall come to that shortly&#151;it should not be forgotten that each of us owes an individual responsibility to our neighbours in a rapidly shrinking world. We cannot expect all the burdens to be shouldered by others or by Government. By supporting individual projects and the work of charities and NGOs such as Samaritan&#146;s Purse, and by taking part in the &#147;Turn on the Tap&#148; challenge, we are all playing our part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08031958000204">I should like to say a word about one aspect of the importance of access to water in the developing world, apart from the obvious connection with disease or health, which I think others might cover. The developing world knows that its future does not rely on aid donations, nor has it done so for many years. It relies on countries and their peoples developing their full potential, but if the basics of life are inaccessible, the time spent acquiring them takes people away from the very processes needed to help a country develop in the best possible way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000205">For children in particular, the absence of water makes a substantial difference to their schooling. Last year, I had the honour of visiting Rwanda with colleagues, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) and my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell), as part of a substantial project. As we travelled through the country, we saw children taking water to and from places and we visited children in village schools. We saw the quality of some of those schools and of the toilets and sanitation in them. As a result of that, we recognised how important the process of fetching water is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000206">WELL, the resource centre for water, sanitation and environment health at Loughborough university, says that in Madagascar, for example, 3.5 million school days are lost each year owing to ill health related to poor sanitation, and that children frequently miss school owing to domestic and water-carrying duties. It reports a 12 per cent. increase in Tanzanian school attendance when water is 15 minutes away rather than an hour. Of the 120 million school-age children not in school around the world, the majority are girls. Some 41 per cent. of primary-age girls worldwide not enrolled in school are in south Asia and 35 per cent. are in sub-Saharan Africa. When women and girls have access to water and sanitation, less school time is lost. Where there are working and well maintained separate sanitation facilities for girls, school enrolment increases. In rural Pakistan more than 50 per cent. of girls drop out of school in grades 2 and 3 because the schools do not have toilets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000207">Many questions surround the provision of water, which cannot and will not always be supplied in exactly the same way. The needs of urban and rural communities are different. There are complex questions about how water is supplied; about the role of non-governmental organisations, charities, Governments and the private sector; about ensuring that a country&#146;s resources are best used to provide water; about how utilities are provided all over the world and how those services can  <br>

Those are all questions with which Governments and others must wrestle, but the basic underlying facts remain undeniable and must challenge us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000208">The debate in this country, which centres on questions such as the provision of bottled or tap water, what we ask for in a restaurant, whether water comes with bubbles or without, and so on, is one of luxury and must seem a world away from the roads lined with women and children as they carry their cans to some hole in the rock from which water is flowing, or to a polluted well where water is not flowing at all. By accidents of birth, they are where they are, and we are here. We cannot put everything right that we would wish to through the stroke of a pen, or the signing of a cheque, but we can individually make a difference by remembering, each time we reach for a bottle or a tap, the difficulties experienced by those who can do neither.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000209">I hope that the &#147;Turn on the Tap&#148; walks will be well supported around the country. I commend Barbara Farquhar, who is promoting the walk for Churches Together in Biggleswade in my constituency on 10 May. I urge my constituents to join her and me in this and similar walks.</p>

This debate has aroused interest already, both inside and outside the House, and I know from conversations with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster) that he takes it very seriously. By and large, the subject unites the House. It is a question of how we, as politicians, as a nation and as individuals, can best deliver. The subject might be complex in the detail of how water is supplied, but in essence it is a simple matter of justice and equity and of ensuring that people all over the world have what we take for granted and have so easily available at the turn of a tap.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) on securing the debate on what is undoubtedly one of the most important and pressing issues facing the world. I commend him on his speech, his evident commitment and the way in which he set out his arguments. I always listen carefully to arguments in the Chamber, from whomever they come, but it is rare that I agree with every word of an argument made by an Opposition Member&#151;this is one of those occasions.

water distribution. We saw the water distributor that Oxfam sends out to areas in need. It is simple to erect and operate, with buckets designed to be as easy for people to carry on their heads as possible and with tamper-proof lids. As the hon. Gentleman said, that was a humbling reminder of how arduous it is for the women and children who do much of the water collection in poor countries, and of how, in zones of disaster and war, very simple devices to allow people to get the basic essential of water can make an enormous difference to their lives, and indeed to whether they have a life.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000213">The scale of the challenge confronting us is truly enormous, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. According to UNICEF, more than 1 billion people drink unsafe water and more than 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation facilities. Those factors alone are the world&#146;s single biggest cause of disease. Disruption of water supplies in disaster and conflict zones, or because of climate change, is the most immediate and dangerous aftermath of catastrophe, and is a real killer, especially of children and older people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000214">It is greatly to Oxfam&#146;s credit, and to that of all who support it, that its single most distinctive competence in disaster relief and emergency assistance&#151;of course, it has experience in a wide range of areas&#151;is its expertise in assessing and addressing risks to public health, where clean water supply, along with sanitation and hand washing, is absolutely crucial. Of course, to wash hands, enough water is needed to drink first. Oxfam rapid deployment kits&#151;with water tanks, tap stands, buckets and latrine kits, all designed for rapid distribution and easy construction&#151;are saving hundreds of thousands of lives by getting quick help on water and sanitation to the victims of disaster. I congratulate all those involved in that vital work and the public support that makes it possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000215">The big challenge for the future is to make better and faster progress towards the millennium development goal&#151;I know that Department for International Development programmes are working on that&#151;and towards installing, improving and replacing permanent water supply systems in poor countries, so that the revolution in public health that Britain enjoyed thanks to Victorian engineers can at last reach everybody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000216">What assessment have the Minister and his Department made of the effectiveness of aid and loans on infrastructure investment in water supply in poor countries? I was minded to ask that question in light of recent news about the disastrous electricity supply in Nigeria and the way in which investment there seems to have disappeared&#151;some of it through fraud and corruption, no doubt. Are there similar problems elsewhere? Situations will vary enormously from country to country, of course, and we are all aware of instances in which it has proved much more effective to give direct assistance at a Community level or through NGOs, rather than through incompetent or corrupt Governments or local administrations. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend responds to that because we must ensure that the aid and loans which are intended to provide that most basic essential of clean water do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000218">I shall focus part of my remarks on the catastrophic situation in Gaza. Before I go any further, however, let me underline that yes, those people responsible should stop firing rockets or deploying suicide bombers against Israel, but that is not the issue in this debate. Before Hamas took over control of Gaza in June last year, Israel had already stopped spare parts for water and sanitation networks entering Gaza. Import restrictions on fuel and water equipment are leaving water-well and sewerage systems in a desperate state. Oxfam staff have visited communities that are flooded knee deep in sewage, with people marooned in upstairs rooms without water or sanitation. Although the overall situation fluctuates, in recent months the Palestinian water authority has estimated that at times as many as 40 per cent. of Gaza&#146;s population has been without a water supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000219">That effective collective punishment is in breach of the Geneva convention and Israel&#146;s obligations under the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend, whom I was also pleased to accompany to Oxfam recently, could tell us what action the Government are taking to relieve that humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, and specifically whether he and his colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are intervening to secure entry for &#163;10,000 worth of electrical and mechanical equipment that Oxfam has been trying to get into Gaza for several weeks as a first instalment on hundreds of thousands of pounds&#146; worth of water and sanitation equipment, which Oxfam, the World Bank, UNICEF and other humanitarian agencies are desperate to supply. Despite the equipment having been presented for transfer by the Israeli authorities, and apparently having met the transfer requirements, I am told that it keeps getting turned back by the Israeli forces at the border. I ask him and our Government to do all they can to help get that equipment through, and more generally&#151;whether in Gaza, Darfur or anywhere else&#151;to make it clear that water and sanitation must not be deployed as weapons of war.</p>

Gentleman said, the supply of water is not a matter for political division. As a nation, we&#151;the Government, the people, charities, faith groups and everyone who is concerned about the problem&#151;must pull together to ensure that what really is a basic necessity of life reaches all citizens throughout the world, whatever their circumstances or situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000222">Every good student of British social history knows about the Rev. Thomas Malthus, who famously predicted in the late 18th century that we would all starve and run out of clean water by the mid-19th century, because, from his standpoint, we were growing geometrically population-wise, but, I think, growing arithmetically in terms of our ability to provide additional food, clean water and sanitation. The poor guy has been held up as a laughing stock for the past 230 years by A-level tutors throughout the country, and with no offence to the memory of Mr. Malthus, I should not like to see him rehabilitated in the coming years on the subject of access to clean water throughout the world. I want him to continue to be proved wrong, but I have my fears, because over the next 40 years, the world&#146;s population will increase by 50 per cent. and demand for water will increase by more than that. The sad fact is that Malthus may be proven right if we cannot find ways to ensure that all the world&#146;s people have access to that basic human right&#151;clean and safe water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para22"><a name="08031958000223">Currently, more than 1 billion people do not have access to enough clean water to meet those basic needs&#151;not the extravagancies that we assume we need, but their basic needs. The consequences are dire, because as the hon. Gentleman said, there are 5 billion cases of diarrhoea each year among children in developing countries. That sickness is the second-biggest killer of children in those countries, and in total 2 million people, predominantly young children under five years old, die each year because they do not have access to clean water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para23"><a name="08031958000224">In this country, however, according to a recent BBC &#147;Panorama&#148; study, we spend &#163;2 billion a year on bottled water, despite having access to perfectly clean and safe water&#151;tap water. Dare I say it that in western society we have become so prissy and gullible that now we will buy water only in bottles? Although I am pleased to say that the bottled water before me is not imported, some is, and often it is even imported from developing countries. According to the BBC survey for &#147;Panorama&#148;, those countries include Fiji, where one third of the population do not have access to clean and safe drinking water. There is something obscene about that, as I am sure we all agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para24"><a name="08031958000225">The situation should make us ashamed. It made the world&#146;s leaders so ashamed that the millennium development goals were agreed to, including goal 7.3, which aims to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. Sadly, as the hon. Gentleman said, current trends show that we are off target in large parts of the world. Indeed, as things stand, we will miss it by a staggering 600 million people, and the tragedy is that in some parts of the developing world, we may even be going backwards. The United Nations millennium development goals report 2007 states that in the largest part of Africa, the absolute number of people without access to sanitation increased from 335 million at the beginning of the 1990s to 440 million just three years ago. That is outrageous, but it is not the only threat that we face, because climate change threatens access to clean water, too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para25"><a name="08031958000226">The UN estimates that as things stand, by 2080 an additional 1.8 billion could live in a water-scarce environment. The challenge is huge and it is not getting any easier. Of the 1.1 billion people who do not have  <br>

access to clean water, most cannot reach it because the provision simply does not exist. However, there is evidence, sadly, that a large minority of those 1.1 billion people do not have access to clean water because of financial constraints, and they are entirely avoidable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para26"><a name="08031958000227">To support the development of water infrastructure, many private companies have taken advantage of aid from western countries as water supplies have been extensively privatised. Hon. Members will, I hope, be reassured that I am not trying to make a gratuitously ideological point, merely a practical one. I contend that the privatisation of supply has on the whole been a failure. It has been a waste of aid money and a means of making profit from impoverished societies while denying the very poorest people access to clean and safe water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para27"><a name="08031958000228">The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, when he was the Secretary of State for International Development, made important steps forward last year when he ensured that additional support was given to enable public utilities to develop water and sanitation infrastructure on a not-for-profit basis in developing countries. However, the European Union continues to promote unfair market solutions, which can hardly be described as either fair trade or free trade. I say so as a strong supporter of that body. The Minister knows about the economic partnership agreements that would allow EU countries to have bilateral arrangements with countries that are essentially their former colonies, and which would formalise a trade-for-aid package that obligated the developing country in the partnership to open their markets to their rich European partner in return for aid. In many cases, the part of the developing country&#146;s economy that is of most interest to powerful European companies is its utilities. Therefore, water gets controlled by those aiming to make a profit from it and it is not supplied freely and safely to everybody in need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para28"><a name="08031958000229">To raise the spectre of Malthus again, the great fear is that increased world population will place even greater pressure on this precious resource, especially if it is controlled by self-interested bodies whose motivation is primarily profit. The tensions over water rights will increase. However, the tensions over the ownership of this most natural of resources have been building for many years; it is not a new thing. I suggest that these tensions are going to become worse unless we can ensure fair trade in water supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="80319h0006.htm_para29"><a name="08031958000230">A story was related to me recently of the old farmer from Colorado who, just after world war two, spoke about the local private water company that had effectively removed his water rights and the rights of others in his rural community. I will not attempt the accent, but the farmer said, &#147;Them folks in Denver, they&#146;ve reversed the laws of nature: they&#146;ve made water run uphill towards money.&#148;</p>

Like the Ministers to whom he referred, about a year or so ago, I visited Oxfam&#146;s headquarters, which is a truly spectacular set-up. It is a symbol, I suppose, of Oxfam&#146;s breadth and reach and, as the right hon. Member pointed out, of the important contribution that Oxfam makes in so many different areas.</p>

Although most of the comments today will be focused on the crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, the situation in Gaza is truly appalling, as we have said in so many debates in the House recently. It seems likely that the Minister will have a generous amount of time to reply to this debate, and I hope that he will take some time to address the points that have been made about Gaza. I have been pressing the Secretary of State for International Development and other Ministers in correspondence about the extent to which they regard Israel&#146;s response to the issues in Gaza as proportionate. I invite the Minister today to address that subject, including the comments of the right hon. Member for Oxford, East.</p>

For all the intellectual humour that there may have been at Mr. Malthus&#146;s expense over the centuries, my hon. Friend is right to remind us of the basic prediction that Malthus was making and the problems that we may yet have to laugh on the other side of our face about.</p>

initiative and input into tackling problems like the lack of access to safe water and sanitation, but we must not tie developing countries in such a way that they are beholden to the profit motive rather than what is absolutely their first priority: ensuring that they get the access to the water and other resources that they need. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000238">Like the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, I pay tribute to the staff of Samaritan&#146;s Purse, particularly Simon Barrington, Matt Bird and the many others who have been instrumental in bringing Parliament&#146;s attention to this issue. As you will know, Mr. Hood, MPs are inundated by invitations to meet groups and organisations, both small and large, from constituents and many others. It takes a special kind of organisation and a special kind of issue to create a stand-out moment that one remembers. Meeting the guys from Samaritan&#146;s Purse a few weeks ago, I was immediately impressed both by what they are trying to do as an organisation and, even more crucially, by the fact that they were not puffing their own organisation but focusing on this issue. Through speaking to them and subsequent research, I, for one, have learned a great deal more about the issue, and I am absolutely sure that they are right to expend so much energy on it.</p>

Member for North-East Bedfordshire, I pay tribute to those who joined us yesterday on what was thankfully a fairly modest walk. It took place in reasonably clement conditions; they were a bit chillier than we might have expected and a world away from the temperature that the people of sub-Saharan Africa must cope with day in, day out. The walk, from Parliament square to Hyde park, was a good opportunity for us to reflect on what is a daily responsibility for people in many parts of the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000240">MPs and Church leaders went on the walk, but I, too, was very impressed by the teachers and particularly the children of All Soul&#146;s primary school. It is clearly a school that has a very outward-looking focus. I asked the children about what was exciting them at the moment, and they were still full of happy memories of a recent visit to a farm in Wales, which had obviously opened their eyes to very early starts in the morning and to some different realities of life here in Britain. More broadly, however, they were very seized of the issue that we were highlighting yesterday by that walk. We were all grateful when we reached Hyde park that, although there were quite a lot of water containers, there was not one each, so we were able to understand a little of the issue without having to endure all the discomfort and physical pain that would go with making such a walk regularly. Perish the thought that we might have to carry what we as individuals use on this estate every day.</p>

conscious of this issue and do our bit, both to raise awareness and to make a material difference to the lives of people across the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000242">We have already heard many of the statistics. None the less, the fact that 1.1 billion people live without access to safe water is something that we should not tolerate. Parliamentary convention requires us to be moderate in our tone in how we conduct these debates, and quite right too, Mr. Hood; I do not intend to challenge that convention. However, the &#147;Turn on the Tap&#148; website quite rightly says that the fact that 1.1 billion people do not have access to safe water is an outrage. We need to get an element of that outrage into the way that we think about the problem that we are trying to tackle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000243">Hon. Members have already mentioned the millennium development goal, and I am sure that the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), who is the Conservative shadow Minister for International Development, and the Minister himself will reflect on that goal, too, in due course. Although, as others have said, we are in danger of failing to meet that target, we must remember that it is not to eradicate the problem or to ensure that everyone has access to clean water, but to halve the number of people without access to it. Even if we meet that target, therefore, we will still be only part of the way towards eradicating this terrible problem, and we must not lose sight of that. Not meeting that relatively modest target would therefore be a real failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000244">We are talking not just about one development goal; it is interlinked with many others. Indeed, I am sure that a case can be made for each of the millennium development goals to be linked to this issue, because if we are serious about reducing child mortality, promoting better maternal health and achieving universal primary education, we must ensure that people have access to safe water&#151;the issue must be right up there and it needs to be ticked off as having been achieved. As the kids yesterday showed us, taking a few hours out of the day to go and collect water means that people are in no position to study or to lift themselves out of poverty. We must therefore see the issue in the round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000245">At the same time that we are trying to tackle these issues, we are also fighting the huge problem of climate change. As we try to mitigate the worst effects of bad sanitation and poor access to water, global warming is making the problem more acute&#151;not just in the obvious sense that it is warmer, but because the weather is being disrupted, thus threatening what predictable sources exist. Sadly, water and access to it are increasingly a source of conflict, as we see in Gaza and parts of Africa. We can quickly get into a vicious spiral, moving further away from our goals, rather than closer to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000246">The developed world has of course pledged to meet the millennium development goals, which are a wonderful focus for us all, as we seek to reach a point where we are no longer ashamed by the fact that so many people go hungry and do without water and so much else. The European Union has had its water initiative in previous years, and the World Bank has been financing a huge range of projects across the globe through the International Development Association. In recognising the need to speed up our achievement of the development goals that we are talking about, the Government have been central to the call for action,  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000247">DFID has increased its funding in this area, and I, like others, pay tribute to the Government for that. How have they used the increased funding during the current year and how will they achieve their target of doubling expenditure by the end of 2011? Increasingly, particularly on health&#151;we debated the international health partnerships in this Chamber a couple of weeks ago&#151;we are looking at how we can focus different channels of aid and assistance through one programme or another to minimise the bureaucracy and ineffectiveness of some of the existing methods of delivery. Does the Minister see some scope for greater co-ordination and focus on the issue?</p>

Member for North-East Bedfordshire talked about how much we learned from yesterday&#146;s walk, and I repeat his point that it was a humbling experience not only to learn so much from the children who took part, but to reflect on why we were taking the trouble to walk four miles on just one day, as opposed to every day of our lives, and not in the conditions that so many others experience. Like the hon. Gentleman, I urge people in my constituency and in others up and down the land to support the &#147;Turn on the Tap&#148; initiative, not only on 10 May, but in the following weeks, months and years.

 It is a pleasure to be able to contribute to this important debate. If I achieve nothing else in my few remarks, I hope that I will underline the fact that sanitation and clean water must go hand in hand. All too often sanitation has been very much an afterthought, and it is vital that the two issues are considered in partnership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000250">I start, however, by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) on securing this important debate. He did a marvellous job of outlining the issues and opening the debate. I also compliment the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) on his excellent speech, which highlighted not only the good work of Oxfam in his constituency, but the contribution that other non-governmental organisations make. In addition, I congratulate the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron) on his informed speech, which highlighted the impact that not dealing with this problem can have on health. He also made some interesting remarks about the role of the private sector, to which I intend to return. Finally, the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) once again made a very good speech, and I take this opportunity to commend him on tabling early-day motion 897, which in recent weeks and in the run-up to today&#146;s debate has done much to highlight the concern about the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000251">This is a timely debate, not least because 2008 is the United Nations international year of sanitation. As we heard, yesterday saw the &#147;Turn on the Tap&#148; four-mile  <br>

walk, with my hon. Friend leading the way. That event highlighted the average distance that people have to walk every day to fetch clean water so that they and their families can drink that day. My hon. Friend and other hon. Members highlighted the fact that the distance travelled by such people&#151;the majority of them women&#151;is just one of the many negative impacts that the lack of access to clean water has on people in developing countries. Indeed, the impact on health of the lack of access to clean water and basic sanitation is staggering. Various statistics have been quoted, but the fact that every 20 seconds a child dies because of the lack of clean water and sanitation is frightening. That amounts to 1.6 million children under the age of five dying each year because of unsafe water and inadequate hygiene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000252">It could be argued that when the international community signed up to the millennium development goals, clean water and sanitation were not seen as sufficiently important to appear as one of the eight main headline goals. The issues before us are covered in MDG 7 on ensuring environmental stability&#151;in MDG 7.3 to be precise. Following the 2002 world summit on sustainable development, however, the world woke up to the crucial role that access to clean water and sanitation can play in helping us to reach the MDGs. In the same year, at the UN special summit on children and the second and third world water forums, three new goals were set for the international community. The first was to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. The second was to halve the proportion of people who do not have direct access to basic sanitation by 2015. The final goal was to equip all schools with sanitation and hand-washing facilities, also by 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000253">Unfortunately, it has been widely recognised, and DFID has been candid in admitting&#151;I therefore hope that the Minister will take this criticism on the chin; I assure him that it is the only criticism that I shall make of his Department today&#151;that just as the world was waking up to the importance of water and sanitation, DFID was, unfortunately, restructured and has been criticised for rather taking its eye off the ball. Dr. Darren Saywell of the International Water Association said:</p>
<a name="80319h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="08031958000418"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A major watershed, in my opinion, in 2002 occurred just after the World Summit on Sustainable Development when DFiD restructured itself and a lot of the impetus and momentum that went into water and sanitation was lost at that time.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000254">To be fair and balanced, however, it is clear for the 2006 White Paper that, having identified sanitation as one of the four essential public services for the MDGs, and having recently increased its financial commitment to water and sanitation, the Department has attempted, and continues to attempt, to re-establish its lead on this issue. I am convinced that, with continued effort, it will do that.</p>

improved water supplies, and 2.4 billion do not have access to any type of improved sanitation. I am sure that the Minister agrees that that simply is not good enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para24"><a name="08031958000257">It would cost an estimated $42 billion to achieve the goal of providing clean water to half of those who currently go without it, and $322 billion to maintain the current clean water system. Likewise, it would cost $142 billion to halve the number of people who do not have access to basic sanitation, and $216 billion to maintain the current sanitation systems in developing nations. That adds up to spending a staggering $72 billion a year up to 2015 to achieve those goals. Although I commend DFID&#146;s uplift in spending, with figures like those, it will take a combined effort from all the nations that have signed up to achieve those important goals. I hope that whichever party is in power, the UK will continue to take the lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para25"><a name="08031958000258">Last year&#146;s report by the Select Committee on International Development, however, highlighted the fact that money alone will neither provide toilets and taps for the billions of people who currently lack access, nor drive the demand and change of behaviour that are required to provide sustainable uptake. The rush to spend money can have unintended consequences, of which I have personal experience. In 2006, I spent some time as a military engineer in Helmand, where I worked alongside DFID to deliver quick impact projects. In our desire to deliver those projects, to show people on the ground how the Government were beginning to make a difference to their lives, we made mistakes. I have raised this issue before in the House. We dug so many new wells in Helmand province without conducting proper water surveys that we ended up lowering the water table, and as a result the ancient karazes that brought water off the mountains no longer flowed. That is a clear example of how we can rush in and spend money to help a community, but instead have a long-lasting negative impact on that community. I hope that we have learned from such lessons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para26"><a name="08031958000259">Last week, I was in Guatemala&#151;as an aside, I must tell the Minister that many non-governmental organisations there fear that DFID is turning its back on that country&#151;where I was fascinated by a water project there. A local community managed to raise enough money to bring a 35 km pipeline into its village. Unfortunately, however, it was forced to bring the water through surrounding communities, many of whom were jealous that the pipeline was going through their communities but not serving them. The project took three years to be established because communities along the pipeline were simply smashing the pipe out of jealousy because they were angry that they had no access to the water it carried, while other communities did.</p>

out to do. DFID is taking steps in the right direction: it has committed to increase its spending on essential public services such as water, sanitation, health, education and social protection in at least half of the UK&#146;s direct support programmes in developing countries. In addition, as I have said, it will double its support for the provision of water and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa to &#163;95 million a year by 2007-08, and more than double funding again to &#163;200 million by 2010-11. Perhaps the Minister will confirm those figures and give an update on our progress toward the 2010-11 figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para30"><a name="08031958000263">We must also consider carefully how the private sector can help in delivering essential services such as water. I return to the point that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale made. It might well be damaging for water supply to remain a monopoly of the state in countries where the state is manifestly failing to deliver adequate services to its citizens. Well managed privatisation could help to expand access to clean water and to save lives if&#151;I emphasise &#147;if&#148;&#151;there is proper supervision, regulatory bodies and contract enforcement. What is the Minister&#146;s assessment of the merits of greater private sector participation in service delivery in developing countries?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para31"><a name="08031958000264">Aid predictability is one concern that is repeatedly raised with me when I visit NGOs in the field, as in Guatemala last week. Of course, political situations change in countries, and that may affect funding streams. In Nepal, which I hope to visit next month to monitor the elections, the Department has cut its water and sanitation budget from &#163;4 million in 2003 to just &#163;1.9 million in 2007-08. Its failure to provide long-term, predictable and co-ordinated finance in those sectors is clearly detrimental to achieving success in such projects. What steps is the Minister taking to meet the criticisms of his Department in that regard?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="80319h0007.htm_para32"><a name="08031958000265">The Select Committee has made it clear that we must do more than improve the predictability of funding streams. The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale highlighted some of the problems of tackling killer diseases. Spending money effectively can achieve disproportionate results in the provision of access to clean water and sanitation in developing nations, but, as I have highlighted, money is not the solution to everything. Unfortunately there remain significant barriers to progress on sanitation. For example, access to clean water and basic sanitation seldom features prominently on national political agendas, and people still attach a higher priority to water than to sanitation, even though the two go hand in hand. Unfortunately, factors such as prestige and convenience rank above health as a motivation for people seeking improved sanitation.</p>

For example, we can do a huge amount towards MDGs 2 and 3&#151;achieving universal primary education and promoting gender equality and empowering women.

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000267">Finally, I want to touch on the links between water and agriculture, which is the biggest consumer of water in developing countries, accounting for 70 to 90 per cent. of water consumption. As water availability becomes increasingly constrained, perhaps as a result of climate change or population growth, countries will have to make increasingly difficult decisions on how much water they can afford to use for agriculture. However, as several NGOs have pointed out, this appears to be the one area that DFID&#146;s water strategy still does not address adequately. When he winds up the debate, will the Minister touch on that important matter and, in particular, say how his Department&#146;s water strategy links with helping to achieving MDG 1, which seeks to halve the number of people who suffer from hunger?</p>

The population of Sana&#146;a continues to grow ever greater and engineers are having to dig ever deeper to find water resources for the people of the capital.

He spoke of the importance of making progress on water and sanitation if we are to ensure that much of the discrimination that girls and women face in developing countries is addressed so that girls, for examples, get access to school. From one of my visits to northern Malawi, I remember the experience of a grandmother who looked after a series of AIDS orphans in her village. She had to walk or organise the children to walk over a mile each way to get water from the nearest river. He also rightly raised the importance of the international year of sanitation in giving focus to the need for change to the current shocking lack of access to good sanitation for people in developing countries.</p>

He set out five key targets for progress on water and sanitation across the developing world. I will come on to say where we have got to on those five elements.</p>

We share the view of all hon. Members who have spoken of the essential truth that access to safe, affordable water is a human right. We share the outrage of the House that in this day and age, more than 1 billion people still do not have safe water to drink. Indeed, half of the populations in developing countries do not have access to even a basic toilet. I share the resolve of hon. Members that we simply cannot allow that to continue.</p>

Based on current estimates, we will meet that target. The hon. Gentleman alluded to the fact that we also said that we would double that spending by 2010-11 to achieve a figure of &#163;200 million.

of money that is being spent; that is not the issue. The issue is whether there is evidence&#151;bearing in mind the progress report on the millennium development goals&#151;that the money is being spent effectively and whether we are moving towards our targets. The good will and the intentions of the world community cannot be doubted, but we must ensure that progress is made, and in view of the progress report, there is a query about that. For all the money being spent, is the Minister confident that enough change has been made in how it is being spent and in the processes of providing water, so that there will be better progress towards meeting the target and we do not fall short of it?</p>

 I cannot currently give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. We are barely on track to meet the millennium development goal on water and we are certainly off track in achieving the target on sanitation. As the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes alluded to, sub-Saharan Africa is seriously off track against the water and sanitation targets. It is that lack of progress that my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State sought to challenge in setting out the case for more global action on water and sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000280">To give the House hope that the situation will continue to change, I give the example that in the 15 years from 1990 to 2005, more than 1.2 billion people gained access to water supply and sanitation services. We know that progress has happened and that it is achievable when the Governments of developing countries, international donors and a variety of other players in developing countries work together to accelerate progress. I hope to say a little about how some of the resources that we are spending in developing countries have made progress and will make further progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000281">I will briefly dwell on some of the broader points that have been raised by hon. Members in noting that simply providing safe drinking water and better sanitation would drastically cut the needless loss of life in poor countries. As I said, the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale was right to highlight that poor people are the least able to deal with the ill health that is caused by unsafe water and how a vicious circle is often created. The water used by poor people is too often contaminated or polluted. That can result in sickness and the medical costs increase the level of debt that they experience, making them less likely to be able to work or send their children to school. Improved access to water and sanitation breaks that cycle. Indeed, hon. Members alluded to the huge economic benefits of access to safe water. Millions of working days are saved and can be achieved, and millions of children, particularly girls, can attend school, with all the resulting economic benefits for the country, as well as the individual. As I said, it is women and girls who have the biggest responsibilities for providing water for drinking and cooking, and for ensuring family hygiene. We need to continue to tackle that implicit discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000282">It is worth noting a point which I do not believe has surfaced in the debate thus far. By 2025, more than two thirds of the world&#146;s population will live in water-stressed countries, so the way in which water is shared  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Mar 2008">

and used will be critical. The importance of that will be further heightened by an increasing population, by the urbanisation that is taking place, by the increased economic growth that is needed and by the growing challenge of climate change. All those factors will combine to make stress around access to water all the more important. Therefore, we must work with countries to help them strike the right balance between water for growth, for people to live healthy and productive lives, and, crucially, for keeping ecosystems in good shape. If people cannot do that, their long-term development will be threatened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000283">In order to do that, change is needed, not just within the international community but within developing countries as well. Some developing country Governments, but by no means all, do not pay enough attention to what poor people in their country say, or respond to their needs. As a result, they do not provide enough finance for water or ensure that it is not just the wealthy, the influential and the privileged who are well served in respect of access to water and good sanitation. All too often, we see in some developing countries that the funds to maintain water and sanitation systems and to keep them operating are simply not in place. Forty per cent. of the boreholes in Africa are not working simply because they need to be repaired. They could provide access to water, but they do not because they have not been repaired. That speaks to a broader point about the lack of good governance in water sectors in developing countries. That is a key point on which we are working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000284">I alluded to the call that my right hon. Friend the former Secretary of State made in November 2006. In essence, he called for five key elements&#151;five &#147;ones&#148;&#151;to change. At the international level, he called for one international monitoring report and for one international meeting to chart progress on access to water and sanitation, and to explore what else needed doing. In developing countries, he called for one national water and sanitation plan&#151;not a plan for how each donor would spend their money, but one clear national water and sanitation plan that everybody would get behind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000285">My right hon. Friend also made clear the need for all the different donors in country to come behind the leadership of one clearly designated UN agency, be it UNICEF, the World Health Organisation or something else, and support the water plan. One UN agency would take the lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000286">In country, there should be one water and sanitation monitoring group of donors&#151;not groups of donors deciding what they thought needed to happen, but all donors coming together. That may seem like common sense to hon. Member, but the sad reality is that it has not happened in many countries to date. There has often been a series of international meetings and a series of reports, and, in some years, no report. We are funding the first international monitoring report, which should be published shortly. We expect to have an opportunity to debate its implications at an international meeting that will take place in September.</p>

In addition, we have identified three critical areas for progress over the next 12 months.  <br>

Sanitation has been a taboo issue for too long. That point was made by the UN Secretary-General and was repeated yesterday at the water resources forum. International donors need to do more about sanitation both internationally and in developing countries directly. We are directly supporting the international year of sanitation to make that happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000288">We need to do more to manage water resources better, and we will prioritise resources and time to achieve that purpose.

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000289">I shall give some examples of the progress that we are making and the benefits that are being achieved with British development assistance, provided by my Department. We have approved new funding of some &#163;75 million over five years for water and sanitation in Ethiopia. We are confident that some 3.2 million Ethiopians will benefit from that spend, but between now and 2015, 300,000 more people need to get clean water and 450,000 more people need to get basic sanitation every day if we are to meet the millennium development goals. That is a huge challenge for the international community, and it is why, when the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire intervened on me, I could not give him complete confidence that we would meet the targets. However, we seek to do everything that we can to raise the importance of these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000290">A new global sanitation fund has been launched, in part as a result of the leadership of the WHO, to try to help communities build toilets and improve hygiene, and we have committed &#163;1.5 million over the next three years to that fund. Other donors have pledged funding as well, and we will work on maximising the impact of the fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para22"><a name="08031958000291">I mentioned that we need to do more about water resources. Yesterday, at the water resources forum, I was able to confirm our continuing support for the Nile basin initiative, which is an example of co-operation to manage shared waters, and to encourage the peace and stability that underpin economic growth in the region. The countries that are part of the Nile basin have a combined population of some 300 million, and they are among the poorest and most water-starved people in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80319h0008.htm_para23"><a name="08031958000292">Hon. Members who know a little about the Nile basin will recognise that there is a history of tension between the countries in the area and that water has been the source of some of that tension. Good water-basin management in the region is essential, given the importance of climate change, to ensure that those countries continue to work together. We have committed &#163;6 million to date to the Nile basin initiative, and yesterday, I was able to pledge a further &#163;8 million to ensure that the initiative continues.</p>

 May I pick up a matter that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes and the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale raised? Do the Government have an ideological position on the privatisation and liberalisation of water resources, or do they take a pragmatic view? I am aware that there are ideological extremes on both sides. Some NGOs and others categorically refuse to accept any privatisation, and some on the free market side propound that at every step. I have been convinced by neither political extreme, and I hope that the Minister takes a practical view. Do the Government have an ideological position on the increasingly important question of how, with all the money and projects, those resources are managed between the public and private sectors to deliver supplies?</p>

 No, the Government do not have an ideological position on whether the private, public or third sector delivers water access. We work with all three sectors in different forums, from NGOs and public utilities to private water providers, as well as international and, much more at the moment, local private bodies. I perhaps take issue with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, because I believe that there is not enough financing for water supply and sanitation at the moment. We must galvanise much more interest from private and third sector organisations, such as NGOs and international organisations, as well as aid donors generally, if we are to maintain progress to achieve the target.</p>

The lesson that I draw from that is that we must look at what works, understand the lessons when things have gone wrong and ensure that they do not happen again.

All the trade Ministers to whom I spoke wanted to sign an economic partnership agreement. Some had specific concerns about particular issues, and we and the Commission are seeking to address those concerns in the run-up to the 31 December deadline. I believe that EPAs for those countries that do not have least developed country status will deliver significant benefits by allowing duty and quota-free access for goods from those countries into European markets, and the simplified rules of origin will make a substantial difference.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000310">Last summer, the Forestry Commission invited tenders for a contractor to extend the annual programme of forest concerts. It included reference to a potential new site in Moors valley in east Dorset. At Moors valley there is a very successful country park, run by the district council in partnership with the Forestry Commission. In January, however, it became apparent that the proposal was not to use the existing country park, but to create a completely new, purpose-built concert venue for 5,000 spectators and 2,000 cars by cutting down 15 acres of woodland in the heart of Ringwood forest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000311">Ringwood forest, unlike a lot of other concert venues used by the Forestry Commission, is surprisingly close to a residential neighbourhood. That is probably why there has been such reaction to the proposal, which is rather different to the reaction to similar Forestry Commission proposals. When local people heard about the proposal through their parish council, their reaction was one of horror and stunned disbelief. Lots of questions were asked, such as &#147;Why does the Forestry Commission wish to destroy the peace and tranquillity of Ringwood forest at summer weekends and subject local residents to the noise and nuisance generated by rock concerts?&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000312">The initial justification, gleaned from the Forestry Commission website, was a desire</p>
<a name="80319h0009.htm_brev1"><a name="08031958000424"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to take the importance of woodlands to new audiences and make them relevant to people in new ways.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000313">In the vicinity of Moors valley, Ringwood forest, Avon heath country park and the New Forest, there is no need to invite people to the forest to find new relevance in the importance of woodlands. People are already aware of that, and they have plenty of opportunities for public access and recreation. That comment on the website as a justification for the proposal was greeted with a lot of scepticism. Local people pointed out that Somerley park, which is less than two miles from the proposed venue, is an existing privately owned facility   <br>

at which concerts have been successfully held. It also has the advantage of better and safer vehicle access, without the need to cut down 15 acres of woodland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000314">In the past few weeks, the horror, disbelief and scepticism has turned to intense anger. It is impossible to overstate the extent to which local people are incensed by the proposed intrusion into their treasured local forest environment. The St. Leonards and St. Ives parish council convened an extraordinary general meeting, which was packed to overflowing, with more than 300 people inside the hall and others standing outside in the rain. The Forestry Commission representative failed to answer the concerns raised. At the end of the meeting, a vote was taken that overwhelmingly rejected the proposals. By overwhelming, I mean that two people supported the Forestry Commission proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000315">The Forestry Commission has manifestly failed to address the inconsistencies inherent in its proposal&#151;for example, the incompatibility of removing 15 acres of forest to create a car park for 2,000 cars with the Forestry Commission&#146;s climate change credentials. I am sure that the Minister is as concerned about that as I am. The Forestry Commission has said that no alternative venues are available, but we know that there are. The Forestry Commission has asserted that it wants to work closely with local people, yet it has made such an unpopular proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000316">On 6 March, the chairman of the Forestry Commission responded to a letter that I had sent to him on 13 February. He delayed his response to enable him to report the outcome of the meeting. However, it will not surprise you, Mr. Hood, to learn that I had already received an extensive report on that meeting. The chairman said that the public meeting</p>
<a name="80319h0009.htm_brev2"><a name="08031958000425"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;did confirm that there was considerable opposition to the proposal, but the issues raised were not unexpected.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000317">He said that other possible sites for a concert venue had been considered, but land tenure, among other things, was a problem. The problem was that the other sites for concerts, including ones to which I have already referred, were not owned by the Forestry Commission&#151;in other words, the Forestry Commission would not be able to profit from the activities that took place on those sites. The Minister smiles knowingly. Perhaps she recalls a time when, under a Conservative Government, there was discussion about the possibility of privatising the Forestry Commission. The strongest argument against such a privatisation was that it would lead to all sorts of undesirable commercial activities if the forests were taken into private ownership. Ironically, that is exactly what seems to be happening under the Forestry Commission while it still remains a nationalised body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000318">On the number of concerts, which was mentioned in my letter, the chairman of the Forestry Commission offered some reassurance, saying:</p>
<a name="80319h0009.htm_brev3"><a name="08031958000426"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Even on our most popular and longest established venues, they only host two weekends of concert events each year.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000319">He omitted to say that three venues&#151;Delamere, Thetford and Cannock Chase&#151;now have weekend festivals that go on for three days: Friday, Saturday and Sunday. That may not be so bad when people do not live close to a venue&#151;some of those forests, Thetford in particular, are very large and dense&#151;but a three-day festival at the Ringwood forest site would give local residents the prospect of a long weekend of hell.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000321">On examination, however, it appears that the only benefit to the wider community is the profit that the Forestry Commission will make. There is no benefit to the local people in providing them with a concert venue when they already have one. I do not know how familiar the Minister is with the location, but it is not too far to the Bournemouth International Centre, which hosts the largest rock concerts in the country, and it is very close to a lot of other open-air stadiums. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000322">If the only issue for the Forestry Commission is profit, how much will it make? Yesterday, a Forestry Commission staff member told a meeting in Verwood that for just one concert the gross income would be &#163;150,000&#151;from selling 5,000 tickets at &#163;30 each&#151;and that the net profit would be &#163;15,000. My constituents are not spoilsports. They are proud to host round 1 of the Pirelli Motor Sports Association National Gravel Rally championship, which took place over 40 miles of Forestry Commission roads largely in my constituency in February this year, as it has for the past 20 years. The commission benefits from the event because it charges &#163;600 per mile for the use of its forest roads, making a profit of &#163;24,000. The event is called the Rallye Sunseeker&#151;it is sponsored by Dorset&#146;s largest employer&#151;but it takes place in the winter and, in contrast to the proposal for Ringwood forest, it is designed to work with the needs and desires of local people. The money raised by the commission from the event is meant to be reinvested in the locality, although I have been unable to find any hard evidence that that has happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000323">The commission also profits from the Moors valley car park, the income from which is shared with East Dorset district council, so it is already making profits or income from commercial activities in my constituency, if indeed money is the root of the problem. At a meeting, Mr. Rothnie of the Forestry Commission said that it is all about money. He said that if he could not raise the money from the proposed project, he would have to raise it from somewhere else. The question is, is it worth alienating local people for the sake of &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000 per concert? I think not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000324">A letter sent to Mr. Rothnie by a local resident, Dr. Jonathan Edwards, who is a member of the parish council, asks:</p>

Cannock Chase. In the end, it cost the Forestry Commission &#163;50,000 and the local council &#163;25,000 in fees and generated a lot of animosity. We do not want that to happen in this case; instead, we want to get people talking to each other to find a common way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para23"><a name="08031958000327">The commission has discovered that there is a lot more money to be made out of promoting rock concerts than from planting and managing woodland. I am not surprised or concerned about that. However, one of the pop concerts being organised is Status Quo, and I was concerned to read that tickets for the Cannock Chase concert that were put on sale for around &#163;30 in January and February are now on sale on the web black market for &#163;80 or &#163;90. That sort of activity causes my constituents a lot of concern. If there is a concert that is so popular and over-subscribed that people will do anything to get into it, what is the point of having a concert in a venue that is not self-contained, as many venues are, and that will generate an enormous amount of traffic from all over the country, to the detriment of local amenities?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para24"><a name="08031958000328">There is stunned disbelief at the proposal and intense anger and frustration at the seeming intransigence of the Forestry Commission. I am going to see Mr. Seddon, the deputy surveyor of the New Forest next week. I hope, in the light of what the Minister says, that the meeting will be held in a constructive spirit and that there will be a desire to find an alternative way to raise funds for the commission locally, in addition to what it already raises. Otherwise, I fear that the prospects of the people of east Dorset working as closely with the commission in future as they have in past will be damaged. I look forward to hearing what the Minister is able to say to pour oil on troubled waters.</p>

It is not primarily a commercial enterprise; it carries out commercial activities, but it is also required to provide a wide range of public benefits. It might be helpful if I mention some examples of those benefits.</p>

through the removal of non-native conifers and the regeneration of native broadleaf trees. It restores open habitats, including lowland heath and upland mires, where that can make a greater contribution to enhancing biodiversity than the plantations that are being removed.</p>

As the hon. Gentleman knows, all Departments are required to maximise the return on their assets, consistent with their objectives. The commission is allowed to sell areas for development when that is in the public interest, the pursuit of which objective has resulted in income of &#163;30 million over the past 10 years, which is significant. The sale of sustainably harvested, independently certified timber, for example, is running at around 1.5 million cu m per year, which makes up around half of the commission&#146;s operational income, so it is not true that it has decided that it is more profitable to organise rock concerts than to deal with the proper business of the woodlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para28"><a name="08031958000333">The remainder of the commercial income comes from a wide variety of sources, as we would expect of any major landowner that seeks to make good use of the assets at its disposal.

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para29"><a name="08031958000334">That brings me to the heart of the debate: the proposal to create an events area in Ringwood forest, which is planned to be used on one weekend a year for live music and for the occasional community event. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there are no weekend festivals such he described at Forestry Commission venues. No facilities are provided for people staying overnight at any of the venues at which it holds concerts. In fact, the sites that he mentioned have three separate events; there is no continuous festival, and there are no plans for one.</p>

 Does the Minister accept that although there may not be a festival similar to the Glastonbury or Isle of Wight festivals, having three rock concerts on successive evenings means that the weekend becomes a festival?

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para31"><a name="08031958000338">It is not right to claim that Ringwood forest was chosen at random, as though proper consideration were not given to the decision. As the hon. Gentleman said, other sites were examined, including Moors valley.  <br>

<notus-date day="19" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>19 Mar 2008 : Column 284WH</b><br>
I understand that the decision about Moors valley was based on two factors: the country park is already extremely busy, so it would have been difficult to accommodate additional events, and it would be difficult to separate a concert event from the users going about their normal visits to the country park. For that reason, the consideration ended in the decision that that would not be an appropriate venue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para32"><a name="08031958000339">Ringwood forest, however, is entirely appropriate for many reasons. The final choice took into account the experiences of other venues and the planned future management of the forest. That is an important point, because there is always change in forests, and there are always management considerations. In the case of Ringwood, that includes moving from the existing plantations to a more diverse mixture of pines and native woodland, interspersed with open space, including swathes of heathland. In that forest, as in many others, trees are cut down for proper management reasons, to improve the status and condition of the forest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="80319h0009.htm_para33"><a name="08031958000340">The site also has particularly good road access, adequate drainage and natural orientation that will allow the stage to face away from the main residential areas. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is also space to accommodate the short-term parking of up to 2,000 cars. I examined the proposal carefully and had a map so that I could examine the major roads and connections in the area and consider how people arriving on the major roads would connect with roads into the forest. The vision is not of hundreds or thousands of cars passing through small villages. If people come from the neighbouring cities, as we anticipate, they will be able to come on a main road and enter the forest in ways that should be perfectly acceptable to people in the neighbourhood.</p>

 Does the Minister realise that in the summer, when it is proposed to hold the concerts, the A31 between Southampton and Ringwood is normally completely chock-a-block, as are most of the roads in the New Forest&#151;so much so that the New Forest show is not held at the weekend? What might look perfectly alright on the map is very different in reality. Why do we have to have a rock concert venue in Ringwood forest, given that the local people are so strongly against it?</p>

In the north-east, we have Kielder forest and Hamsterley forest, which are being run commercially through activities such as mountain biking. We are also trying to develop a Great North forest.

 I am grateful for that intervention, which fits well with what I have said to the hon. Member for Christchurch. We have to see the forest as a resource for people beyond the local area. Of course, we do not want the Forestry Commission to be a bad neighbour, and we want to talk to local people and try to convince them of what we have become convinced of through careful consideration: that the proposal will not cause the chaos and noise that the hon. Gentleman talked about when he referred to a long weekend of hell and to horror and stunned disbelief. Those are exaggerated expressions. Yes, live music causes noise, but woodland helps to absorb the noise, and sophisticated sound systems are used to minimise the risk of disturbance away from the site.

 We are more than open to involving local people, and of course I will re-examine the extent to which they can be involved, but as I have said, we cannot say that the decision is only for local people to take. &#147;Local&#148; must mean wider than the immediate vicinity, such as the people from the cities that surround the area, who might want to come. One of the most important things that we can do&#151;I ask the hon. Gentleman to take it seriously&#151;is bring in the people who do not know about the forest and have not lived locally and had the benefit of seeing the trees not too distant from where they live. The Forestry Commission&#146;s experience is that, where concerts have been held, they have brought in people who have not previously visited the forest, who may then make return visits. That is incredibly important and an added bonus.</p>

I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the parish council will see that that is how we can engage people and ensure that, even if the concerts are not what they would most want on that one weekend, they will have a facility that could bring more involvement and joy to their lives and to their use of the forest throughout the year.</p>

<h3 align="center">Licensing Act 2003 (Durham)</h3>
<a name="time_19"><a name="80319h0010.htm_time0"><a name="08031958000455"><h5 align="left">4.30 pm</h5>
<p><a name="st_65"><a name="08031958000352"><a name="80319h0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="08031958000521"><b>Dr. Roberta Blackman-Woods (City of Durham) (Lab):</b>
 I am pleased to have secured this debate on an issue that is so important to my constituency. I am grateful to the Minister for meeting me recently to discuss licensing issues in Durham. I found the meeting helpful and reassure him that the purpose of the debate is not necessarily to criticise the Licensing Act 2003 but to explore with him those instances in which the Act is perhaps not as effective as it could be and in which local communities are not being protected from inappropriate late licences. It is particularly an issue for Durham because the night-time economy area and local residents are in close proximity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para2"><a name="08031958000353">It might be helpful for me to start with some history of my communication on the issue with constituents and Ministers. I held an initial public meeting last year and invited my constituents to have their say on pub and club licensing in Durham. I raised many of the issues that emerged from that meeting with the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker), and he agreed to visit Durham to meet local people to discuss their concerns further. He also wrote me a detailed letter in response to many of the matters raised. Some of the outstanding issues were matters for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and were referred to my hon. Friend the Minister, who also offered to meet me and respond in writing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000354">I am grateful to both my hon. Friends for their helpfulness and willingness to listen to the problems that we have had in Durham. It has moved us on enormously, and some issues that involve local misunderstandings about the Act have been cleared up, but four issues remain. First, local authorities need better guidance, so that they feel confident monitoring and turning down licences that prevent them from promoting the four key licensing objectives. Secondly, is the current appeals system the right one, given its many challenges for local residents? Is the system not too onerous to allow local views to be heard and adequately represented? Thirdly, is better notification needed for residents of what comes before the licensing committee for licensing determination. Fourthly, the general view is that the Act contains a presumption in favour of allowing applications.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para4"><a name="08031958000355">On the first issue, Durham city centre has many late licences. I cannot state the exact number, because the city council has been unable to provide me with that information; it does not have it to hand. How can the council judge the effect of applications on the city overall if it does not monitor daily or weekly the number of late licences granted? I want to put it on record that this is not meant simply as a criticism of the council, but it clearly needs help and further guidance on how to turn down applications or operate the Act better. An example is the interpretation of the word &#147;vicinity&#148; in determining the effect of a licence and the area from which interested parties can be drawn. Current guidance under section 182 of the Act directs licensing committees to consider the vicinity to be about 100 m, but depending on local terrain, that can be too close. Local authorities should be able to set  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="19 Mar 2008">

<notus-date day="19" month="3" year="2008" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><b>19 Mar 2008 : Column 287WH</b><br>
their own definition of the vicinity. The Act allows that, but the guidance directs the use of 100 m. The issue should be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para5"><a name="08031958000356">How can one small city cope with the extensive night-time economy, so that it does not have a negative impact on city centre residents? No one is arguing that no late licences should be given; it is merely that the licensing committee does not adequately consider or reflect in its decisions the impact on public nuisance. People are woken up late at night&#151;or, more usually now, early in the morning&#151;or have their doors kicked in, their cars damaged and so on. It is my view that too many 2.30 am late licenses are being granted, but I do not have the exact numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000357">It appears that more late licenses have been granted in Durham than in Westminster. Surely, that cannot be right. The local authority, Durham city council, brought in consultants&#151;no doubt, because of the bad publicity that it has received&#151;to consider a cumulative impact policy for the city, but I understand that they are likely to argue against the city&#146;s adopting one. I am not sure why, although it appears that they feel that it might simply push the problem of granting licences elsewhere in the city. Again, giving local authorities more information about the matter would be helpful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000358">I wish to put on record that the statement of local licensing policy produced by Durham city council is good. If it were used properly, it would probably give the city reasonable protection. For example, the policy acknowledges that patrons leaving licensed premises at 2 am are likely to have an impact on residents&#146; sleep, and policy 8 seeks</p>
<a name="80319h0010.htm_brev0"><a name="08031958000430"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to strike a fair balance between the benefit to a community and the risk of disturbance to local residents of a licensed venue.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000359">Policy 15 states that</p>
<a name="80319h0010.htm_brev1"><a name="08031958000431"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the licensing authority will give careful consideration to licence applications that may result in adverse impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring population in the late evening/early morning&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000360">The problem is that those and other licensing policies are not being used sufficiently in determining licence applications. In fact, at times, it seems almost as though they are being completely ignored. What can the Government do to ensure that local policy is adhered to, given greater weight and linked specifically to the promotion of the licensing objectives? One simple modification to the 2003 Act that would give greater powers to reach decisions in keeping with local requirements would be the addition of a fifth licensing objective requiring that the granting of a licence must be consistent with locally determined policy, which must in turn reflect the local interpretation and application of the four licensing objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para10"><a name="08031958000361">Another issue is lap dancing. I contend that lap dancing clubs should not be licensed under the Act at all but, like sex shops, under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. I am working with the organisation Object, which seeks to achieve that end. We contend that the Licensing Act 2003 is not the appropriate measure for granting licences to lap dancing clubs. My experience of Durham in that respect highlights the Act&#146;s weaknesses most clearly. Durham received an application for a lap dancing licence to 2.30 am for a premises called the Loft. It is located on a street that acts as the main gateway to the city, adjacent to the bus station and on a main route to  <br>

the city centre from the railway station. It is also in close proximity to the world heritage site and city centre, across the road from a youth club and in the vicinity of three churches. Some 1,000 residents live within a 500 m radius. In the views of local people, the application contravened not only local licensing policies but a number of Government licensing objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para11"><a name="08031958000362">Again, the council&#146;s licensing policy 14 appears to be helpful. It states that the council</p>
<a name="80319h0010.htm_brev2"><a name="08031958000432"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will discourage applications for licenses which involve a sex related element near schools, places of worship, hospitals, youth clubs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08031958000363">In my submission to the council, I expressed clearly how local licensing policies 6, 8, 10, 11, 14 and 15, and no doubt others should prevent the licence from being granted. The application was heard at the beginning of August, when everyone was on holiday, and it was approved, despite policy 14 and other local policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para13"><a name="08031958000364">Thanks to some very brave residents, including Mrs. Kirsty Thomas and Dr. and Mrs. Evans, an appeal was launched with the magistrates courts. The group of local residents had to fundraise to employ a barrister, organise meetings, gather a lot of information and co-ordinate a large number of objectors. I cannot emphasise enough to the Minister the work required from local people, staff in my office and me in preparing for that appeal. It was disproportionate to the ease with which the decision was made in the first place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para14"><a name="08031958000365">I am sure that the Minister can imagine our delight when, in December, the magistrates court found in favour of the appeal. It had concerns about the application in respect of all four licensing objectives and serious concerns with three of them. It found that there was a serious risk of exacerbating problems of crime and disorder and compelling evidence that a lap dancing club on North road would aggravate existing public nuisance problems and, in respect of the protection of children, that the club could hardly be worse sited.</p>

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="08031958000366"><a name="80319h0010.htm_spnew6"><a name="08031958000522"><b>David Lepper (Brighton, Pavilion) (Lab/Co-op):</b>
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. I agree with what she said about the use of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 in relation to lap dancing clubs. I would welcome the Minister&#146;s comments on the fact that, in my local authority, we have controlled the number of sex shops by using that Act. The type of entertainment about which my hon. Friend has been talking should be included within the same remit.</p>

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="08031958000367"><a name="80319h0010.htm_spnew7"><a name="08031958000523"><b>Dr. Blackman-Woods:</b>
 I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention; that was exactly my point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para15"><a name="08031958000368">Our jubilation at winning the appeal was short-lived, because we learnt to our great sadness last week that Vimac, the company involved, has completely disregarded the views of local people and asked for permission to launch a judicial review application in the High Court. If that is granted, residents will once again be plunged into a legal process with no resources with which to argue their case. Our experience is totally at odds, therefore, with information sent to us by the Home Office in December 2007, when the Minister stated:</p>
<a name="80319h0010.htm_brev3"><a name="08031958000433"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;while the applicant would be a party to the appeal it is not the case that the residents would be taking on the industry.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para16"><a name="08031958000369">In Durham, we very much feel as though we are taking on the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para17"><a name="08031958000370">The Minister will say that he cannot comment on individual cases. I use that dreadful example simply to demonstrate a fundamental flaw in the Licensing Act. If local authorities make a wrong decision, it is terribly onerous for local residents to put it right. The whole system needs to be looked at, so that residents and other interested parties can object to the granting of a licence without becoming involved in onerous legal challenges.</p>

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="08031958000371"><a name="80319h0010.htm_spnew8"><a name="08031958000524"><b>Ms Celia Barlow (Hove) (Lab):</b>
 With previous legislation under the 2003 Act, it was possible for local authorities to cover a degree of sex and nudity. Does my hon. Friend see that as a possible way forward? For instance, could secondary legislation to the 2003 Act be an alternative?</p>

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="08031958000372"><a name="80319h0010.htm_spnew9"><a name="08031958000525"><b>Dr. Blackman-Woods:</b>
 My hon. Friend makes a very interesting point, and I am sure that that could be considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para18"><a name="08031958000373">One possible solution would be to fund an organisation like Planning Aid, which exists to help residents with planning licences. However, some of my constituents have suggested what might be a better way forward: in other cases where it is felt that a costly legal process is inappropriate, such as in industrial relations disputes, a tribunal system has worked well. Perhaps such a system is needed in this case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para19"><a name="08031958000374">My third point is that much better notification and advertising of licensing application is needed, so that local people, other interested parties and responsible authorities can get adequate notice. My fourth point is that both the city council and local residents say that the 2003 Act presumes in favour of the applicant. I do not necessarily agree, but there is a problem with licences being approved where no representations are made from interested parties and responsible authorities. There is also the contention&#151;I should like the Minister to comment on this in particular&#151;that a licence can be granted in the absence of objections regardless of the views of the licensing committee, which creates a climate where it is presumed that the 2003 Act operates in favour of licensing applicants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para20"><a name="08031958000375">I recently outlined to the Minister the case of a bus parking in a lay-by to sell alcohol. Other similar circumstances involve areas of transient populations where representations may not be made, but where the impact of the licence might be detrimental to the wider community, so that needs to be looked at. Some of the issues that we are dealing with do not primarily relate to licensing. The city council&#146;s decision to promote a night-time economy, at odds with the historical, spiritual and cultural heritage of the city, needs to be addressed. We need a proper plan for the city&#146;s development that seeks to achieve a more reasonable balance between the competing uses of the city centre. He will be relieved to hear that I do not think that it is his job to do that. However, it is something that I hope that the new unitary authority for Durham will take on board.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="80319h0010.htm_para21"><a name="08031958000376">In the meantime, however, attention needs to be paid to the four areas that I have mentioned today. I should  <br>

Friend the Member for Gedling for their very active interest in the problems being experienced in Durham&#151;it really is appreciated&#151;but we need action, and I would be most grateful if the Minister travelled to Durham to meet a delegation so that he can see, or at least hear about, the issues in Durham and explore with us how a more sensible licensing strategy could be achieved to enable people to have a good night out in Durham, while providing better protection for local residents and the city&#146;s heritage.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) on giving the Chamber the opportunity to discuss the impact of licensing reform in her area. I also congratulate her on the way she has looked after her constituents. I know that she has put a great deal of effort into that.</p>

Friend raises shortly, but it is important to put them into the context of the 2003 Act. Despite predictions of doom from some quarters, the Act has been successfully implemented, and the consensus among people I talk to who are using it on the ground is that it is a useful tool and working well. Of course, one of the key aims of the reform was to bring licensing decisions, particularly those relating to alcohol licences, closer to the people. I am therefore pleased that one of the key positive messages to come out of our recent evaluation of the impact of the Act was that it had delivered benefits to local democracy.</p>

established and fundamental part of our democratic and legal structure, not to mention human rights law, that there must be scope for independent review of court decisions. That must be the case no matter how much each party might think that it is in the right, and even if it is understandably frustrating to parties when appeals and reviews take time to be considered properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para1"><a name="08031958000383">I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hove, whom I met yesterday to discuss the concerns about lap-dancing clubs in her constituency and similar issues that have arisen in other parts of the country. Having reflected on those points and on the matters that have been raised today, I believe that the Licensing Act 2003 is able to control such premises when problems relate to the four licensing objectives. The examples that my hon. Friend gave me yesterday show that the Act has successfully been used in some areas to control lap-dancing premises when there have been problems with the protection of children from harm or with illegal activities being carried on there. The Act can also be used to apply conditions to protect the safety of those working and performing at such premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para2"><a name="08031958000384">Much can be legitimately done under the Licensing Act to control such premises, but I appreciate that there may be uncertainty among some local authorities, so I am happy to write to chief executives to clarify the position. It is important that we show some consistency and write to them about the position. The 2003 Act cannot, however, prevent such activities taking place because of concerns about public decency and obscenity, or the inappropriateness of that activity for a particular area. Although those may well be important and legitimate concerns, it is not appropriate to consider them under the Act. To do so would mean adding new licensing objectives that would then apply to all 200,000 premises licensed under the Act, and that would not be efficient or proportionate. It is also important to recognise that the Act is not about censorship and does not in itself regulate the content of entertainment. Those are much wider issues that relate to the balance between public sensibilities and the freedom of speech and artistic expression.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para3"><a name="08031958000385">I should add that the Court of Appeal has previously ruled that certain lewd sexual acts should not in any case be considered as public entertainment, so it is questionable whether entertainment licensing could ever cover all those activities. It is precisely because such exhibitions must be in tune with laws on indecency, obscenity, prostitution and pornography that the lead responsibility lies with the Home Office. If the regulation of those premises is inadequate, it might be that regulation akin to the licensing of sex shops under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 would be more appropriate, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said. Alternatively, it might be something that planning law could cover.</p>

Without commenting on individual cases, it seems to me that in most instances a satisfactory conclusion has been reached. It is important to remember that the Licensing Act brought in an important additional safeguard: it is possible to seek a licence review if problems occur at a premises. I know from going around with the police in Bradford that they have been very happy to be able to deal through the review process with problems that arise once the licence has been approved.</p>

 Some of my constituents have made the following point. They know that the provision exists for a review, but just as it is very onerous for local residents to take an appeal through the magistrates courts, and the higher courts if necessary, they say that as local residents, it is difficult for them to get organised in order to get a review carried out. If the Minister could offer some advice, that would be very helpful.</p>

 I am grateful for that point. It is certainly not our intention to make the process more difficult for local people; in fact, the Licensing Act&#146;s objective was to make it easier for local people to take a view. That is why it is important to consider other legislation that might be able to assist the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para6"><a name="08031958000390">One particular concern that has been raised is that the licensing authority has to grant a licence if no relevant representations are made against an application. That provision was fully discussed in Parliament during the passage of the Licensing Act, and I have seen no compelling evidence to warrant changing those arrangements, notwithstanding the examples that we have just discussed. It is difficult to argue that an application should be rejected if no relevant objections have been raised by local people, the police, the fire authority, trading standards, environmental health officers or other responsible authorities. Of course I realise that making representations and following them through can be, as my hon. Friend says, a daunting task to members of the public who are not familiar with the licensing process. but as the Licensing Act evaluation suggests, the new regime is much more accessible to the public, and as our guidance makes clear, there is no reason why a local resident cannot ask someone such as their local councillor or MP to make representations on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para7"><a name="08031958000391">We have also produced guidance to help local residents to participate in the licensing process, but I am very happy to review that guidance if there are points on which interested parties would appreciate more clarification. I do not want to comment on the performance of individual licensing authorities. Ultimately, the system is deliberately designed to be delegated to locally elected bodies. They have to take difficult decisions, balancing the sometimes conflicting interests of their local communities. A key finding of our evaluation was that some areas use the Licensing Act alongside other interventions much more effectively than other authorities. As a result, we will find ways of helping local authorities and their partners to ensure that they have effective measures in place to identify and tackle problem areas  <br>

and premises. We have also made the management of the night-time economy a beacon council theme, which will help to identify and disseminate best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para8"><a name="08031958000392">I am sure that we all want thriving leisure and night-time economies that bring in visitor revenue and offer all local people a safe, diverse and accessible mix of premises and attractions. Today&#146;s debate has highlighted some tensions, but I hope that I have been able to respond to my hon. Friend with the positive measures that we can introduce.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="08031958000393"><a name="80319h0011.htm_spnew2"><a name="08031958000529"><b>Dr. Blackman-Woods:</b>
 Before the Minister finishes his comments, I wonder whether he will say something about giving advice or information to local authorities on best practice, because I fear that one difficult aspect of the Licensing Act is that some local authorities do not have the confidence to use it very well. If they were able to learn from the way it is used effectively in other local authorities and apply those lessons in areas such as Durham, that would be very helpful.</p>

 I am happy to do what my hon. Friend suggests and give support to local authorities. Through the Local Government Association and the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services, there are opportunities for us to continue to get the message out. As I said, beacon council status can be used, too, which then helps us to disseminate best  <br>

practice. We continue to look at how we can improve. We are looking at how to improve the application processes and to ensure that we have clear rules about advertising type of application that my hon. Friend has discussed, but we must get the right balance and make sure that we have the right costs and burdens, so that we do not prevent people from making applications. We must also consider the effects on village halls, charities and so on. When dealing with applications, it is a question of balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80319h0011.htm_para9"><a name="08031958000395">My hon. Friend talked about &#147;vicinity&#148; being an issue. Last July we were advised that that was not a key element, and that the impacts or the licensable activities were more important. We continue to review what can be done. We have made the right move in delegating the matter to local government, because it is right that local councillors and local government have the right to determine what goes on in their area. It is important that we look at the planning process and its objectives, and I am particularly concerned to hear that in Brighton, six lap-dancing clubs have been established in a very short time. That problem will start to spread throughout the country, so I appreciate my hon. Friend raising the matter today. I will be happy to meet colleagues again to consider what can be done to ensure that local people get what they want in their local area.</p>
