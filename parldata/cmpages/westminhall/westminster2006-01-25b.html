<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60125h01_spnew0"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington)</b>  (Lab): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. First, I welcome you to the Chair. Secondly, may I raise with you the problem that we have this morning and the reasons why my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow), whose debate this is, is not present? The change of venue from Westminster Hall to this room has somewhat confused hon. Members&#151;indeed, several of us went to Westminster Hall this morning and arrived here out of breath because we had been trying to find the alternative venue. May I suggest through you that hon. Members are again given notice of the change of venue so that we do not have a problem with misunderstandings and with hon. Members going to Westminster Hall, which is no longer available?
</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60125h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  </b> (in the Chair): I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. It is a matter of fact and record, and has been for a considerable time, that sittings are being held in Committee Room 10, not Westminster Hall. That information appears regularly on the Order Paper, and it is up to hon. Members to make sure that they are present and correct when required.

<a name="60125h01_time1"><h5>9.31 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60125h01_spnew2"><b> Ms Celia Barlow  (Hove)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Mr. Gale. I am here to ask for consideration to be given to the regulations that were put in place after the inquiry into the King&#039;s Cross fire. As we know, 31 people were killed in that tragic event. Following the investigation, the regulations were amended. The changes were not completely implemented until after 1991, but during that period action was taken to make the railways far safer.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">The rail network is not my favourite organisation at the moment, given that I spent some considerable time on the Brighton to London train this morning. That explains my somewhat dishevelled appearance, for which I apologise to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Members. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue on behalf of hon. Members who have expressed concern about proposals to remove essential fire safety regulations.
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60125h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate. To enable her to get her breath back, may I draw her attention and yours, Mr. Gale, to the debate that took place in this very room yesterday? It was about rail services in the south-east and probably highlighted some of the experiences that she suffered this morning?
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60125h01_spnew4"><b> Ms Barlow </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, and I hope that there will be many more in the early part of my speech.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60125h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  </b> (in the Chair): Order. There will not be. I appreciate the courtesy that the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) has shown in seeking to assist the hon. Lady, but I have made it abundantly plain that it is up to hon. Members to be here on time. Although I understand that the hon. Lady needs to get her breath back, and I am sure that everybody will have some sympathy with her, given her experience of the public transport system, I do not propose to entertain any more interventions on the subject.
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60125h01_spnew6"><b> Ms Barlow </b> : Thank you, Mr. Gale. I stand corrected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">My concerns are shared by many constituents&#151;not my concerns about the slight slowness, on occasion, of trains between Brighton and Hove and London, but the concerns of those who travel through the underground system every day. The concerns raised by my constituents have also been raised by the TUC, the rail unions and the Fire Brigades Union.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">As a former firefighter and member of the FBU, the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), has a strong interest in and knowledge of these topics. He takes them very seriously and perhaps he will be able to provide reassurances today about the future of fire safety on the underground and on our railways.
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60125h01_spnew7"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): The Minister has a distinguished record in the fire service, but will he not argue that the 1989 regulations are too prescriptive and bureaucratic for the modern world? Is not the key problem the fact that the proposed guidance, which will accompany the fire safety order, will have no legal force? Will that not worry my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents in Hove, as well as other travellers in the underground system, particularly those who pass through King&#039;s Cross, where the disaster took place and through which I travel several times a week?
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60125h01_spnew8"><b> Ms Barlow </b> : I agree that there are concerns, although I would not say that they are as desperate as my hon. Friend suggests. In the present climate, however, every rail and underground safety issue is of desperate interest.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">Perhaps it would be useful at this point to remind ourselves of the history of the debate. The Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989, to which I shall simply refer as &quot;the regulations&quot; for the purposes of this debate, were introduced under section 12 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations were added on the recommendation of the Fennell report into the 1987 King&#039;s Cross fire, which claimed 31 lives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">I was on the BBC TV news desk that day, watching the terrible video rushes as they were fed in by satellite, and assessing the risks to camera crews and reporters at the scene. It is believed that the blaze began when a match was dropped through a wooden escalator&#151;such escalators have, of course, now been banned&#151;in a non-smoking area during the evening rush hour. An accumulation of grease and other debris under the tracks led to a fireball, which scorched up the escalator, trapping many people underground. Years later, one survivor, who ran from the upper concourse, said:

<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 423WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">Following the fire, the Fennell report called for changes, including minimum staffing standards and means of detecting, warning of and fighting fires. It also called for standards of fire-resistant construction, training and other precautions. There was a scandal in 1991, when a report found that only eight of the 26 safety recommendations made after the inquiry had been fully implemented. They were later complied with and provided a cushion of safety around staff, firefighters and customers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">It is important to remember that the regulations apply&nbsp;not only to London underground stations, but to sub-surface stations throughout Britain, including underground systems in Tyne and Wear and several national rail stations with sub-surface stations, such as New Street station in Birmingham.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">The regulations were introduced to help to prevent a repeat of the terrible events at King&#039;s Cross, and I think that all hon. Members would agree that they have stood the test of time. They set down essential minimum statutory requirements for safety, covering issues such&nbsp;as means of escape, means of fighting fire, means of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detection and giving warning, fire-resistant construction, instruction and training, and the keeping of records. Additional precautions covered in the regulations include practicable steps to prevent smoking and minimum staffing requirements, which are almost invariably exceeded in the railway network.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">No one doubts the Minister&#039;s strong commitment to fire safety. I hope that he will agree that the Government must not replace the current regulations lightly, and that they should do so only if they can guarantee at least the same statutory&#151;I stress, statutory&#151;level of safety for the public, rail staff and emergency services. As I understand it&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;the Government&#039;s view is that the current regulations and the protection that they provide will be adequately replaced by the provisions of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, associated guidance and the proposed Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations. For the purposes of this debate and for my hon. Friends&#039; sake, I shall refer to the legislation simply as &quot;the order&quot;.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">When the order comes into force, it will cover general fire precautions in different categories of workplace and public place and abolish the use of fire certificates. It will signal a move to a risk assessment-based approach to fire safety&#151;that is one of the key issues. In addition, a series of guides will be produced to assist those preparing risk assessments. Although my hon. Friends, the trade unions and I do not necessarily have difficulty with the principles of the order, we are concerned about the proposition that it will remove the regulations for sub-surface stations. That is a really important point. We feel that sub-surface rail stations are a special case and require an assured minimum standard of protection, which cannot be afforded by risk assessment and guidance alone.
</p>






<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60125h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I have the privilege of being a member of the all-party group on lighting, which discussed that very issue at a meeting earlier this week. Making third-party approval for personal safety equipment

&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 424WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
mandatory is an important issue for the lighting and security industry, which favours a proper system of accreditation for those conducting the inspections.
</p>






<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60125h01_spnew10"><b> Ms Barlow </b> : I thank the hon. Gentleman. The issue was also considered by the Regulatory Reform Committee in July 2004, following representations by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who had a strong interest as secretary of the FBU parliamentary group. The Committee also had strong reservations about the Government&#039;s proposals. It argued that given the nature of sub-surface railway stations and the substantial number of people who use them every day, there was a strong public interest in ensuring their safety from fire. I am sure that the Minister agrees with that. Importantly, the Committee did not accept the Government&#039;s view that the regulations placed a disproportionate burden on the management of sub-surface railway stations. It also argued that it had not been demonstrated that fire safety in such stations would be improved by the removal of the regulations in favour of the risk-based approach contemplated in the order.
</p>






<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60125h01_spnew11"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree that the enforcement activity of fire authorities when the new approach is in place will be crucial to the success of the order? Does she hope that the Minister will announce that the Deputy Prime Minister will have powers to direct fire authorities in their enforcement activity to provide information and to report to him on particularly sensitive installations or networks?
</p>






<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60125h01_spnew12"><b> Ms Barlow </b> : That is certainly an interesting idea that I hope the Minister will take on board.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">The Committee concluded that sub-surface railway stations were indeed a special case and that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister had not yet made a convincing case for removing the regulations. The Committee recommended that the regulations should remain, but that if they were removed, any guidance issued could include all elements of the protection prescribed in the regulations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">I understand that the Minister&#039;s predecessor considered the report following the recommendations, along with representations from other interested parties. Stakeholders were then informed that the Government accepted the need not only for protections to continue, but for them to be clearly seen to continue. The Department advised that it intended to retain the regulations until substantive guidance on fire precautions for sub-surface railway stations had been published. Stakeholders are now being consulted on the guidance. I welcome that move, but it remains my view and that of many others that the guidance and the order will not offer the same level of protection as the regulations. There are a number of compelling reasons for a rethink.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">First, it is self-evident that the protections will be lessened, because nowhere does the order specify minimum standards that equate to the current regulations. Furthermore, unlike the regulations, the proposed guidance to accompany the order will have no legal force. There is also concern that the guidance being 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 425WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
developed could be too general in respect of transport premises and not specific enough to take account of the unique needs and dangers of sub-surface stations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">Secondly, removing the regulations will change the burden of proof and might make it easier for unscrupulous rail operators to reduce the current standards below those specified in the regulations. Now, the fire authority must be satisfied with a specific requirement at a particular location, or unhappy that the standard is inappropriate, unnecessary or not reasonably practical. However, I believe that under the Government&#039;s proposal it will be for the fire authority to show that the rail industry has failed to carry out a sufficient risk assessment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">Thirdly, there is the question of whether the regulations are too prescriptive and bureaucratic. However, the current arrangements are flexible enough to allow rail operators to seek exemptions from the regulations if they can satisfy the fire authority that a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimum standard at a particular location is inappropriate, unnecessary or not reasonably practical. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the fact that the regulations are not necessarily a blunt instrument, as they have been described, that imposes disproportionate requirements on the rail industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">I note from an answer to a written question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington that the Department does not keep records of requests for exemptions to regulations and does not require fire and rescue authorities to supply them. Whatever the reasons for that&#151;I will not go into whether it is the correct approach or not&#151;I hope that the Minister will forgive my bluntness in saying that it is difficult to see how we can conclude that the regulations are too prescriptive and bureaucratic if the Department has no record of when requests for exemptions are made or even whether any ever have been made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">Fourthly, I hope that the Minister accepts that the need for minimum standards is arguably greater now than at the time of the King&#039;s Cross fire. One reason is that the number of passengers using the railways has increased significantly since then, in line with the Department&#039;s policy and for many other, ecological reasons. Also, management of the various systems has unfortunately been fragmented.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">Finally, I know that the Minister will agree that the need for the public to have confidence in railway fire safety is greater than ever following the appalling terrorist attacks on London in July. The views of rail workers and those in the emergency services, who performed so honourably, professionally and bravely, need to be taken very seriously indeed. Anyone who was a passenger on the underground on the morning of 7 July, as I and many of my constituents were, must be grateful to the emergency services for their prompt and heroic response, and we must listen to their undoubted expertise. Owing to the implementation of the Fennell report, passengers travel with greater regulatory safety than ever before. I urge the Minister to retain the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">The Minister has sought to address some of the concerns that I have raised by stating that when the order is introduced its provisions and associated guidance will run concurrently with those of the regulations for six to 12 months. It is argued that that will allow the Department to compare the effectiveness 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 426WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
of the new arrangements with the regulations. At the end of that period the need to remove the regulations can be assessed. I welcome that as a sign that the Government take our representations seriously, but I am not sure how that process will be the most effective way of informing the Department&#039;s thinking, because it is not clear whether the regulations or the order will take priority during that six to 12-month period. In any event, will there not be a temptation for the rail operators not to act so as to test the new arrangements during that period, thereby leaving the Department none the wiser about the order&#039;s effectiveness?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">The Government have stated that they will allow more time for business and fire safety experts to get ready for the order, which would probably not be implemented until later this year or even in 2007. I hope that the Minister will use that time to reflect on the arguments for retaining the regulations and positively consider the representations that he receives from hon. Members and stakeholders, as he has been doing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">I am hopeful that a solution can be found that will allay our concerns. Perhaps the basis of such a solution is an acceptance that the regulations should be modified to take into account the need for any changes that has arisen since their introduction, coupled with support for the principle that sub-surface stations are a special case and that that fact needs to be reflected in a statutory approach. I sincerely hope that, at a time when the threats have never been greater, we can all work together to find the right solution and ensure that the terrible events at King&#039;s Cross are never repeated.

<a name="60125h01_time2"><h5>9.49 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60125h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Andrew Dismore  (Hendon)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow) on making it here today and commiserate with her on her rather rushed introduction; I was pleased that she got into her stride. Her presentation was excellent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">I must declare an interest as the chairman of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group. Perhaps more importantly, before coming to this place I was the FBU&#039;s solicitor for 17 years. I would like to bring that experience to today&#039;s debate, although not by a legal analysis; my hon. Friend gave a good analysis of the regulations, the order and the interrelationship between them, and gave a detailed argument regarding the problems that they cause.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">I also bring a more direct experience through my involvement with the inquiry into the King&#039;s Cross fire. At that time, I represented the family of the fire officer who was killed at the fire, who was later posthumously awarded the George medal for bravery, other firefighters who were physically and mentally injured by the fire, and railway workers. I sat through most of the 93 days of the public inquiry into the fire held by Sir Desmond Fennell, as I was representing those victims, the FBU, ASLEF and their members. Indeed, I gave evidence to the inquiry on various aspects of fire safety. I remember dealing with my hon. Friend the Minister at that time in his then capacity as an FBU official representing London, so I know that he has a lot of experience of the issues relating to King&#039;s Cross.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">I visited King&#039;s Cross station on the Sunday after the fire, three days later. The sights that I saw then will haunt me for ever. The blackened debris and wreckage 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 427WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and the utter destruction caused by the flashover were indescribable. A flashover is terrible at any time, but particularly so in the circumstances at that station. It is not just the physical things that one sees; the horrible smell stays in one&#039;s nostrils for days afterwards and remains in the memory. The smells of fire are appalling, particularly when one knows what happened.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">I still get a shiver when I use the Northern line escalator in King&#039;s Cross station, which I have to do from time to time as the Northern line serves my constituency, because I know that that is where the fire started; I know the point on the escalator where it started. I still get a shiver when I use the underpass toward St. Pancras, where many people died so tragically and horrifically, including Station Officer Townsley, who tried&#151;in vain, unfortunately&#151;to rescue members of the public who faced such a horrible death, and when I walk past the memorial to the 31 victims who died in one of the underpasses under Euston road.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">The statements that I took from firefighters and railway workers after the fire were some of the easiest that I ever took. All I had to do, more or less, was to switch on my dictating machine and let them talk. The tales they told of what happened and what they saw and experienced were some of the most horrific I have heard. When those statements were presented at the inquiry, little cross-examination was necessary because it was all there. Everybody used those statements as the primary evidence of what happened. I never want such a thing to happen again.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">That is the stage at which I became a lawyer who campaigned on issues such as fire safety and corporate manslaughter, on which I hope my Government will deliver in the not-too-distant future. The young, campaigning lawyer of 20 years ago has ended up being the now rather more cynical, but still campaigning, Member of Parliament for Hendon you see before you today, Mr. Gale. I never thought that I would see the day when my Government would consider watering down fire safety protection as the regulations will. The recommendations made by Sir Desmond Fennell in his report are still valid, if not more so given the current situation with London Underground.
</p>






<p><a name="st_14"><a name="60125h01_spnew14"><b> David Taylor </b> : The fire certification system that has been in place since 1972, I think, has widely been seen by travellers in London and elsewhere as a public safety net in which they broadly have confidence. The order that might replace it would mean that the safety net will have a rather wider mesh through which people might fall. Does my hon. Friend agree that we need more detail on how it will be enforced before there is a switchover? As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, running the changes in parallel for six or 12 months is fine, but let us have the detail on how the order will be enforced.
</p>






<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60125h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : My hon. Friend makes an important point. The difficulty with guidance notes is that they are not legally enforceable. They do not even have the force of a code of practice, which would be rather more useful than mere guidance notes. I have nothing particular against safety assessments, but they should go hand in hand with the underpinning of the detailed regulations that we are debating. It is not either/or; let us have both. I am concerned that there will be a watering down.

<p>
<a name="60125h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">There have been many improvements on the tube since the King&#039;s Cross fire. The fact that we now have steel escalators rather than the old wooden ones that caught fire is the most visible and obvious example, which everyone can see. However many other underpinnings are important. The tube is used so much; there are, on average, 3 million passengers a day&#151;far more than at the time of the King&#039;s Cross fire&#151;and use is growing. That puts greater pressure on the underground system and staff and means that there are greater safety risks.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">A key element of the Fennell report was his criticism of the fragmentation of the management, which was then operating under one company, London Underground Ltd. He also criticised the inability of the management to communicate within itself and the lack of clear lines of responsibility. Through the public-private partnership, of which I was not a great advocate&#151;although I recognise that it is bringing investment to the tube&#151;there is fragmentation within London Underground. Although residual responsibilities lie ultimately, I suppose, with the Mayor of London, several companies are now involved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">For the Northern line, the infrastructure company responsible for the track, tunnels and signalling is Tube Lines; a separate company, Alstom, runs the train maintenance contract; and London Underground has overarching responsibilities. That fragmentation has the potential to create the sort of gaps that the Fennell inquiry identified, and the situation could be made worse if the proposed safety regime is introduced.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">We must be sure that there is seamless management of safety. The recent problems on the Northern line in particular with the failure of brake systems that was identified in autumn, are an example of where such gaps arise&#151;obviously not in the context of fire, but with train maintenance. That highlights some of the potential problems with gaps. It is a case not of &quot;Mind the gap between the platform and the train&quot;, but of mind the gap within the management. That is one of the key criticisms in the Fennell report, and it is not answered by the proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">There was also some criticism of the lack of record keeping. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove identified that as a problem when she so ably opened the debate. We must recognise that one product of the PPP is the huge investment that there will be in the underground to modernise tracks, signalling and stations. Huge, large-scale engineering works will affect the network for years to come. They are welcome and long overdue, but engineering works are hazardous and might give rise to fire risks. That is an inevitable consequence of major engineering works, but, in those circumstances, now is not the time to start downgrading fire protection.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">Those engineering works are necessary because of the long-term neglect of the underground over many years and under successive Governments. Until those works are complete, the underground will remain subject to various safety risks or problems, such as the problem with the signalling system that was identified at Camden Town last year. Therefore, until the underground is running properly and modernised, and until we deal with some of the core management problems, we should not start messing around with safety regulations.

Their ability to function through the correct levels of staffing, skill and co-ordination enabled them to deal so effectively with the consequences of that day. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner warned us of the inevitability of further terrorist attacks; we must be prepared for the risk of further attacks on the underground. In those circumstances, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to think again.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">Would my hon. Friend the Minister like to be responsible were there to be another terrorist attack and the London underground system was not able to cope because of the effect of the changes that he is proposing? I ask the Government to postpone their move to bring in the new arrangements, at least until the modernisation works to the tube are completed. We can then review safety in the round with a new modernised tube until we have seen some progress towards dealing with the appalling terrorist threat that bedevils our country in general, and our capital city in particular, which is served so well by our transport workers.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60125h01_spnew16"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington)</b>  (Lab): Let me declare an interest as the chair of the National Union&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers parliamentary group and the secretary of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group, as noted in the Register of Members&#039; Interests. I too congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow) not only on securing the debate, but on her superb detailed exposition of the argument. I shall not go over the ground that she covered, but I just want to make a few comments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">As has been explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), we all bring to the debate our personal experiences as does the Minister. In my earlier career, I was chief executive of the then Association of London Authorities and on the evening of the King&#039;s Cross fire I had a meeting at Camden town hall. Instead of travelling by tube as I usually would do to King&#039;s Cross, alighting and going to the town hall, I walked and missed the fire. I would have been on the train at the time. I was attending the social services committee at Camden town hall and that night we had to suspend the committee to enable officers and members to prepare emergency morgues for the bodies coming from King&#039;s Cross.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">The debate is of personal concern to several hon. Members, especially those who represent London constituencies and had any experience of the King&#039;s Cross tragedy. That concern has now been replicated on several occasions by accidents on the tube, of which Chancery Lane is an example. We come to the debate as a result of the King&#039;s Cross fire on the basis of a strict precautionary principle: that we do not do anything that undermines or may undermine the safety of the travelling public; that we will not take any measure that may enhance the risk and that we will do everything we possibly can to reduce the risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">The Fennell inquiry was a model of an inquiry. It took evidence in detail from front-line workers. It arrived at several conclusions, which, on a consensual basis, were accepted by those on all sides of industry&#151;
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
management, front-line workers on the London underground, firefighters and the Fire Brigades Union. On the basis of a precautionary principle and the combined consensual wisdom of the various authorities at the time, the inquiry behoves the Government to have a strong justification for moving forward or moving away from the Fennell recommendations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">Many arguments have been advanced this morning, but when the proposals were brought forward, they were reviewed by the Regulatory Reform Committee. Although I was not a member of that Committee, I spoke at the meeting. It is important to remind ourselves that a Select Committee said to the Government at the time&#151;clearly it did not endorse the introduction of the order&#151;that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;On the evidence presently before us, we are not convinced that the provisions will be adequately carried forward under the general provisions of the draft Order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We consider that the provisions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should remain in force.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">The Minister responded by saying,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Having considered the Committee reports, together with other representations received .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we do accept that there is a need not only for this protection to continue but also that it can be clearly seen to be continued.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">The Committee expressed its worries about any change and the Minister responded accordingly. At the time, I thought that we would have a more fundamental review of the order itself. Instead, all we have experienced is delay and the order&#039;s reintroduction with virtually no amendment to the original proposals. The debate is taking place today on that basis.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">There is confusion about the Government&#039;s real intentions. As a result of the delays, some consultation has commenced on guidance but, as has already been said, it will have no legal basis or any firm use whereby it can be used to secure safety on the London underground. Instead of having more detailed consultation of the order and considering a fundamental amendment, all we have had is limited consultation on the guidance. That goes against the spirit of what the Regulatory Reform Committee was arguing for at the time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">The Committee had firm views. At paragraph 126 of its report, it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;In our view the Department has not yet made a convincing case for the revocation&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">of the existing regulations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">Since then, the Government have not put forward a subsequent case. They have certainly not reported back to the Regulatory Reform Committee with a case that could change the Committee&#039;s mind. The first step that the Government should have undertaken&#151;it is not too late to undertake it now&#151;is to have gone back first to the Regulatory Reform Committee to see whether it could be convinced of the need for change. The Committee set out its arguments as to why the order should not go ahead in one of the strongest reports that it has produced. Such matters should be considered by the Government and there should be a proper debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">As my hon. Friends the Members for Hove and for Hendon have said, time has moved on in respect of the practices of the London underground. More than 700&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million people use the underground each year. There has been a 20 per cent. increase in passenger traffic. Management systems are now dramatically different, even within the past two years because of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 431WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
fragmentation of London Underground&#039;s management. The proposals need to be reviewed in the light of the day-to-day practices of the London underground now as against two years ago. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, the Government should go back to all the stakeholders about the detail of the order, not only the guidance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">People are becoming confused by the different orders that have been issued. The latest statement made by the Government on 12 January advised us that they had put back the date of the implementation of the order. I believe that there is an attempt to coincide that with regulations in Scotland, too. We are told that the change is to allow businesses and fire safety experts more time to get ready for the new regulations, not to consult on the detail of them or to secure amendments to them. We are now in a state of absolute confusion about when the regulations will come into effect.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para47"><a name="stpa_48">A carry-over period between six and 12 months when both systems will run in tandem will cause even greater confusion. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove said, it will hardly be a realistic trial of the new order because companies will fail to act on it and will put off any changes until the 12 months are over to avoid the onus being placed on increased investment or any change of practice desired as a result of the new system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para48"><a name="stpa_49">The Government need to give us clarity on where we are going. What is the status of the order? What is the time scale for its introduction? What consultations will take place? In the light of discussions that have taken place so far, we need to step back again and have a more fundamental consultation with the stakeholders. We need to go back to the Regulatory Reform Committee and discuss matters to see whether it would be satisfied with any new proposals coming forward after that consultation. In addition, we must recognise that things have moved on within the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon mentioned the fact that, as a result of the Government&#039;s significant investment via the public-private partnership&#151;although some of the investment has been diverted&#151;we are now seeing major infrastructure projects on the system. I am not talking about the result of the PPP, as that is a waste of resources. Is now the time to confuse matters with the establishment of new orders, new systems and new regulatory principles in such a sensitive part of the system itself?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">This is a special case. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove has it exactly right. As experts will tell us, underground fires and underground risks are so much more difficult and hazardous than they are on the surface, purely because of access and other arrangements. That is a key lesson of Fennell. If the access arrangements and the problems of underground working will be made worse as a result of the current significant investment and works, the last thing that we will want to do is to interfere with existing practices that have served us well over the past 20 years or so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">The Government have delayed again, so it is not too late to think again, to put the matter out to consultation again, to take on board the expert advice or to take into account changes. I dread us introducing such measures as a result of what is almost a stubborn belligerence 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 432WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about not taking other views into account. Sometimes there is almost a sense of bloody-mindedness, and a sense that Governments will not change their mind once the wheels of Government mechanisms start in motion. I just thank God for the Regulatory Reform Committee, which halted that process over a year ago.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">I hope that this debate will contribute towards our telling the Government that just because an element of momentum has built up around the order, they do not inevitably have to proceed to make a mistake that we will live to regret, and that some people may not live to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regret. The key element is consultation and involvement.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">The process involves a step change; there is a change in the onus of responsibility. At the moment, it is clear in law where responsibility lies; we rely on those providing the service to ensure that they meet the regulation requirements. The proposal will mean that the onus shifts to the fire authorities, who will have to prove that the providers are not meeting the requirements. That is a significant principle change and, in practice, will be a dramatic change to what went before. It would undermine the practices of the fire authorities, which will have to cope in that way. In addition, it would undermine the confidence of the travelling public and those who work on the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">There is an element of trust involved in this issue, too. Why are the Government making the proposals at this point in time, and what pressures are on the Government to move in this way? What reason is there for the haste with which the Government tried to introduce the regulations previously, with, we believe, inadequate consultation? I am at a loss to see why that change in principle needs to take place at this moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">Finally, I ask the Minister to clarify where we are and where we are going. More importantly, I appeal to the Government to step back from this hazardous measure, which will put lives at risk and undermine the confidence of the travelling public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">I am pleased that the hon.

Of course, the proposals come at a time when Members do not need reminding of possible threats in the places concerned.

<p>
<a name="60125h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">The regulations made under section 12 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971, which were inspired by the Fennell report, have been a key part of safety on the underground for a number of years, so I would appreciate any assurances that can be given today on those regulations, and indeed on the wider issue of fire safety on the underground and on subterranean railway stations. Also, can we assume from the delay that the Government are in the mood to compromise on the wider issue of fire safety regulations? Will the Minister tell us this morning whether that mood extends to the specific regulations to which I, and others, have referred?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">On the new fire safety order, I wholeheartedly agree with the Minister&#039;s statement of 12 January that we should not seek to impose new regulations on stakeholders without giving them the necessary time to implement them, so I suppose that the announcement is to be welcomed. However, I should be grateful if the Minister told us why the guidance documents are apparently not yet available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">As I said, I did not intend to make a long contribution. It is obvious that I am not alone in seeking assurances not just on the future of fire safety on the underground, but on the future of the wider regulations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">It is important that we get this matter right. On occasions, I felt that I was more in sympathy with the Minister than some of his own Back-Benchers were; I do not get the impression that the Government are rushing the proposal. They have put the decision off and they seem to be consulting. We do not know exactly what the final package will be, but it seems to me that they have taken a very sensible approach to complex regulations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">Broadly speaking, Her Majesty&#039;s Opposition support the review of fire safety regulations. Moving a system to risk assessment is sensible. Clearly, one has to look at the guidance, and some sensible points were made about the force of that guidance in determining how successful the system will be when implemented. Earlier, the matter of the accreditation of inspectors was raised, and that, too, was a sensible point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">I know that the private sector, in particular, has raised the issue of cost. There have been some concerns on that point, so we have to keep an eye on whether there is to be a transfer of resources. The difficulty with such regulations, particularly on subjects such as fire, is that things can be very much set in stone, and there can always be arguments for no change. There is an argument for change, but it is a question of getting it right. This is a useful opportunity for the Minister to stand up and give some assurances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">I noticed earlier in the week that the Government have announced further fire prevention grants&#151;another &#163;11.4 million. Under the Housing Act 1996, we dealt with houses in multiple occupation and aspects of their rating to do with fire. Quite a lot has been happening across the piece in terms of fire prevention and fire reform.

<a name="60125h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) said and was interested to hear his comments about the King&#039;s Cross disaster. Clearly, if one had to encapsulate the matter and say which one area gave concern, it would be sub-surface regulations. I hope that the Minister can give reassurances on that subject today. When the hon. Gentleman was a young, thrusting, campaigning lawyer, I was perhaps not quite so young, but I was certainly on Wiltshire county council&#039;s public protection committee, which dealt with the fire brigade. Our concern, post-King&#039;s Cross, was that there were major underground workings underneath Corsham and Box in Wiltshire, where the Ministry of Defence has major stores. Although the principal people dealing with the fire would have been the MOD fire service, the Wiltshire fire brigade would have been asked to support it. The key problem that the chief fire officer found was the issue of command and control underground, because radio equipment does not work as effectively there. So there are certainly special issues to do with sub-surface working and disasters; I hope that the Minister can give some reassurances on that subject.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) asked some very challenging questions, in his customary way. He pointed out the Regulatory Reform Committee&#039;s concerns about that aspect of the regulations. I hope that, at the end of the debate, we will have a little bit more sketched in about Government proposals on this subject.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">We need to know a little more about the time scale&#151;that is one issue that has come out today&#151;and when the order will be implemented. We have already heard that both systems will run in tandem. What will be the cost of that? One hon. Member asked whether it would be fair to run the new system with the old regulations still, effectively, in force. We need to hear a little bit more about time scales. Certainly, if the private sector and public corporations are going to have to take on a larger role, it is right and proper that we should at least give them a reasonable warning and a reasonable opportunity to adjust their working practices to carry out the new regulations. The key issue, which was raised by the hon. Member for Hendon, is management&#151;including line management and joined-up management&#151;particularly when it comes to major organisations, such as the tube.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">We need a somewhat clearer view than we have had from the Government over recent weeks. I hope that the Minister is able to reassure us today about the time scale and the sub-surface regulations, about which there is general concern and that he will, perhaps, say a little bit more about the guidance, and the force of the guidance, and how it will effectively underpin the new system that the Government wish to implement.

Friend opened the debate by asking about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the use of guidance to demonstrate necessary protections for sub-surface railway stations. I particularly want to set the record straight on that, but if you will allow me, Mr. Gale, I should first like to place two important references on the record.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">On the fire safety order, the Regulatory Reform Committee said in its 11th report of the 2003&#150;04 Session:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;We consider that the provisions of the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989 constitute necessary protections. On the evidence presently before us, we are not convinced that the provisions will be adequately carried forward under the general provisions of the draft Order and the Railway (Safety Case) Regulations 2000, as amended. We consider that the provisions of the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989 should remain in force. We therefore recommend that Schedule 5 to the draft Order be amended to remove the references to the Fire Precautions (Subsurface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989, the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 1991 and the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 1994.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">We note that once the Order is in force the Secretary of State may make regulations under article 24 which would revoke the 1989 Regulations. Any decision to keep the 1989 Regulations, as amended, in force beyond the entry into force of the draft Order is therefore by no means irrevocable.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">Another solution might be the provision of guidance by the Secretary of State on the operation of fire safety requirements in sub-surface railway stations. We note that London Underground Limited, in its response to the consultation on the proposal, stressed the need for guidance on implementation of the proposed Order. Such guidance could include all the elements of protection prescribed in the 1989 Regulations.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">That last point is particularly important in relation to what has been said today and to the comments that I am about to make.
</p>






<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60125h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : The key difference, of course, is that guidance is not in any way, shape, or form binding, as regulations are. If there were a code of practice, at least that could be taken into account, if that were necessary, before a court if the issue ever arose&#151;I hope that it would not. Will my hon. Friend consider providing at least a code of practice instead of guidance? That would have greater force in supporting the new regime.

<a name="60125h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">We agreed with the Committees involved and made a statement on bringing the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 before the House for scrutiny the second time:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;However, to ensure public certainty and confidence, the Department accepts the view expressed by both Committees that if the highly prescriptive 1989 regulations are to be revoked then substantive guidance must be in place so that the protection can clearly be seen to be maintained. Consequently, the regulations will be retained on a temporary basis and only removed once guidance has been produced in consultation with all parties. We have therefore removed reference to the regulations from Schedule 5.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60125h01_spnew23"><b> John McDonnell </b> : Just to clarify the process, does that mean that at this point in time the Government&#039;s proposals will be going back to the Regulatory Reform Committee for consideration and report?

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60125h01_spnew24"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : If my hon. Friends will allow me to develop my answer we will get to an explanation, at least partly, if not in full.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">Some confusion seems to have arisen about what was meant by the statement that I have just quoted. It is our view that the fire safety order maintains all necessary protections, particularly when taken with other safety legislation, which will continue to apply. However, it is essential not only that these protections should exist, but that they can clearly be seen to exist. We are producing guidance to do that.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">I want to make it absolutely clear that we have no intention of using guidance instead of legislation. We are using guidance to show how the law&#151;the 2005 order&#151;provides, and in our view enhances, the necessary protections currently provided by the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989. For example, the 1989 regulations do not cover the protection of firefighters, contractors or modern suppression systems. The new regulations enhance the old regulations. We think that doing that is more straightforward, simpler and more in keeping with all the legislation that we have passed recently than having a choice between the new regulations or upgrading the old ones. I will try to emphasise that later. The law, not the guidance, provides the protections. The guidance will just explain the protections, so that they can be clearly seen.

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60125h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : I am sorry to keep badgering the Minister on this point, but there is a significant difference in law between the effect of guidance as opposed to a code of practice. Whatever he may say about the guidance referring to how the law will be enforced or taken into account, guidance notes do not have legal force. Codes of practice have some legal force. Will he consider ensuring that guidance notes are issued in the form of a code of practice, to give effect&nbsp;&nbsp;to what he has said he wants to achieve?
</p>






<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60125h01_spnew26"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) also raised the point about the guidance not being statutory. We consulted on making the guidance statutory, but there was no clear majority in favour of that. We consider that statutory guidance that could effectively impose a list of requirements does not fit with the risk-based regime that we are trying to introduce.

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60125h01_spnew27"><b> John McDonnell </b> : It would be useful if the Minister could comment today, at least in a note, on the views expressed by the individual parties consulted on whether there should be guidance.
</p>






<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60125h01_spnew28"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I shall be happy to write to my hon. Friend, if I do not cover the point in due course. I shall deal with his question on consultation a few pages further on in my speech.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">The secondary point about the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 is that it requires a fire and rescue service to have due regard to the national framework that we have set up, which includes producing integrated risk management plans for the protection of the community and encompasses enforcement of fire safety. The 2004 Act also provides powers for the Secretary of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State to intervene, where the integrated risk management plan that has been prepared does not come up to scratch.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">As I was explaining, we are using the guidance to show how the law and the fire safety order provides, and in our view enhances, the existing provisions. I have said before, and I am happy to repeat now, that we will not remove the 1989 regulations until and unless it can be clearly shown that all necessary protections are continued under the new regime. I will come in a few moments to the points about the timing and how we will demonstrate why running the two systems in tandem will improve on safety.
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60125h01_spnew29"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I just want to put this matter on the record so we are not confused in any future debates, because this one might run and run. The Minister talked about areas where the existing orders did not apply, or where the Government thought that they did not cover things adequately in terms of the consultation that has taken place. That is why the consultation with the Fire Brigades Union and others has been on the basis of strengthening the existing orders rather than relating things to guidance. The issues could be addressed under the existing system without that being transformed into something based simply on guidance that has no statutory effect.
</p>






<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60125h01_spnew30"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I hear what my hon. Friend says, but the guidance being drafted will cover other transport premises and facilities as well as sub-surface stations. The stakeholders working with us on that include representatives of the operators, through London Underground, of the enforcers, through the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, and&#151;most importantly for my hon. Friends&#151;of the trade unions, through the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. The guidance needs to be, and will be, clear about the protections and how they apply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">In response to the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) about the thoroughness of the consultation in the previous instance, I should say that the regulatory reform order was developed with stakeholders after a lengthy period. Subsequently, we consulted formally for four months, sending out more than 10,000 consultation documents. We received 257 responses, and the final

&nbsp;<br>

order was developed on the basis of that consultation. On the guidance, a working party including London Underground, the RMT&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60125h01_spnew31"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I should like to be clear for the sake of the record. There is consultation, and there is consultation and listening. The RMT position was set out clearly yet again on 20 January. It clearly stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;The Section 12 regulations lay down fire-safety measures that are simply not specified in the new Fire Safety Order, and RMT, alongside the Fire Brigades Union and Aslef, has been campaigning hard to keep them in place. We hope the government will now use the delay to think again about the wisdom of abolishing specific fire-safety measures in favour of what amounts to a discretionary approach. Relying on employers not to cut corners is simply not good enough, as far too many people&#151;transport workers and passengers&#151;already know only too well.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">I would not want the Minister&#039;s statement about consultation with the RMT to be construed in any way as meaning that the RMT had supported the Government&#039;s approach on this matter.
</p>






<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60125h01_spnew32"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I was not trying to mislead the Committee in any way. During my last meeting with the RMT only a couple of months ago, we discussed and decided to run the new reform order in tandem with the 1989 sub-surface regulations. The RMT put its points clearly across the table and we responded clearly with the details of why there will be enhanced protection for subcontractors on the underground and for firefighters, who may have to attend emergency incidents; neither group is covered at the moment. We also gave details on the two other issues that I mentioned and several others that we put across the table at the same time.
</p>






<p><a name="st_34"><a name="60125h01_spnew33"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : Nobody is suggesting that the groups to which the Minister has referred&#151;firefighters and others&#151;should not be protected. Personally, I would have no problem if the two regulations ran in parallel and indefinitely. My concern is that once the regime is set up, the original regulations will quickly fall by the wayside and we will be left with the subsequent regime, which in our view will weaken protection for people who work and travel on the underground.
</p>






<p><a name="st_35"><a name="60125h01_spnew34"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : If I make some progress, I shall be able to answer some of the other points made. Looking at the clock, I am sure that we shall have time towards the end of my contribution for colleagues to make further interventions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">On the point about the burden of proof, I believe, with the greatest respect, that my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington has the position wrong. Under the fire safety order, it is not for the enforcer to prove that the requirements have not been met, but for the person responsible to prove that they have been met. Article 34 of the fire safety order is clear on that; it is what is known as the reversal of the burden of proof, and changes the position established under the Fire Precautions Act 1971.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">With regard to the point about flexibility, the enforcer currently has the power to allow a lesser standard if the case is made by the person running the sub-surface railway station concerned. The case that needs to be made is an assessment of the risk, and there is no reason 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 439WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to suppose that a case could be made under the fire safety order if it cannot be made under the 1989 regulations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">In any event, the body that has to be satisfied that the premises are safe under either regime is the local fire and rescue authority, and the lead enforcer for that sector&#151;the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority&#151;has already confirmed that the fire safety order provides it with adequate powers to ensure safety at least of the level provided now.
</p>






<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60125h01_spnew35"><b> John McDonnell </b> : With the greatest respect, there is a role for the Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove pointed out clearly that even under the existing system, when there is potential for the use of discretion with exemptions so that the system can operate flexibly on the ground, there is a role for the Government in monitoring how that should operate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">When, to clarify the Government&#039;s role in monitoring the existing system, I asked the Minister how many exemptions had been applied for, I got the response that the Government did not know. How can we be confident that the Government will have a leading role in monitoring the new system when the new regulations come in? So far, they have not involved themselves even in the basic monitoring of the existing system.
</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60125h01_spnew36"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : My hon. Friend is anticipating a later section of my speech, when I shall talk about exemptions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">I was saying that the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority had already confirmed that it considered that the fire safety order provided it with adequate powers to ensure safety at least at the level provided now. I must add that the LFEPA view remains current following a review that it conducted after the appalling events of 7 July, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hove referred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">Hon. Members will have noticed that the underground station officer will have to convince the same enforcing authority&#151;the fire and rescue authority&#151;about the adequacy of the fire precautions, regardless of whether the 1989 regulations or the fire safety order are being used. In addition, the lead authority for the enforcement of fire safety in sub-surface stations has already informed us that it expects to serve alteration notices on all sub-surface stations under article 29 of the fire safety order. That means that the station operator will have to tell the enforcer if it proposes to make any changes to the premises or the use of them, or to the services, fixtures, fittings or dangerous substances used or stored. That extra protection will allow the enforcer to consider any changes proposed and the ongoing adequacy of the fire precautions, including the availability of staff to put into effect the emergency plan that the fire safety order requires in respect of action to be taken in the case of fire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">In common with the other requirements of the order, failure to comply with an alterations notice is an offence. The penalties are a fine up to the statutory maximum&#151;currently, &#163;5,000 on summary conviction&#151;up to two years&#039; imprisonment or an unlimited fine or both on conviction or indictment.

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60125h01_spnew37"><b> John McDonnell </b> : It would be useful if the Minister described the layers of management, the number of companies and the tiers of operation in which that line of communication will have to take effect. As my hon. Friends the Members for Hendon and for Hove have said, times have moved on. With the PPP system and the infraco management systems, we now have an immensely complicated structure and line of communication. Will the Minister describe what that line of communication would look like?
</p>






<p><a name="st_39"><a name="60125h01_spnew38"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall write to him on that point as well, rather than go into the detail this morning. I should like to get through the rest of my contribution. I am sure that we can clarify that for him in due course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">I hope that what I have said clarifies the position, but we are always open to further discussions about safety and we are maintaining an open dialogue on the issue with the RMT and hon. Members. I shall take away with me the suggestions made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove as well as other points made by hon. Members today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">The fire safety order is perhaps the last significant piece of the legislative jigsaw that makes up a much broader reform. When, as a new junior Minister in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, I was asked to sign the regulatory reform order that involved the technical withdrawal of the Fire Precautions Act 1971, which had been the fire services&#039; bible for some decades, I assure hon. Members that I took&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington is being very flippant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">I took considerable time to make sure that the order would not in any way reduce public safety, but would enhance it, before being persuaded and convinced by the experts to whom I spoke. In the cut and thrust of debate, the suggestion that one is signing a reduction in public safety could be taken as mildly offensive.
</p>






<p><a name="st_40"><a name="60125h01_spnew39"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I just want to reassure the Minister that none of us taking part in the debate has in any way impugned his intent. We understand his commitment to safety, particularly bearing in mind his background as a firefighter. What we are concerned about is his judgment, which we believe is incorrect in this instance.
</p>






<p><a name="st_41"><a name="60125h01_spnew40"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I am not sure whether that was a compliment or not, but I will accept the reassurance offered by my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">The fire safety order underpins the move of the fire and rescue services to prevention-based services, but, in turn, that move underpins the order. I can assure hon. Members that that is a solid foundation. The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 created a new statutory duty on fire and rescue authorities to promote fire safety, which places fire prevention at the heart of fire and rescue services activity. That is a cultural change for the service and we are working with the service to achieve it. It has been long in the arrival. In future, the fire and rescue service will be focused on prevention. The Government are committed to helping the fire and rescue service prevent fires: for example, we are introducing a new system of fire and rescue cover based on risk to life. Historically, the system was based on the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 441WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
density of buildings in an area. We are delegating responsibility to the local fire and rescue authority, its elected members, the communities and chief fire officers to ensure that things are decided in the most effective way at a local level.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">The fire safety order is a key element in the move to a prevention-based service. It provides prevention-based tools for business and promotes prevention-based enforcement. In turn, the Fire and Rescue Services Act promotes and provides a prevention-based service to enforce the law.
</p>






<p><a name="st_42"><a name="60125h01_spnew41"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : The Minister seems to be suggesting that there is an either/or situation, but that is not the case. If one considers recent developments in health and safety law more generally, one can see the trend, particularly in Europe, towards risk assessments and so forth. Risk assessments are more general and are aimed at prevention, but in certain key industries, such as construction, they are underpinned by basic regulations, which set out the detail. The case that we are putting to the Minister is quite simple: let us have both. Let us have the preventive approach and the more general duties, but, in this particular case, let us also have the underpinning of detailed regulations.
</p>






<p><a name="st_43"><a name="60125h01_spnew42"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I have been trying to reassure my hon. Friends that we are trying to have the best of both worlds, that we have a solid basis of law and that the guidance is enhancing the protection. I will come on to the points made by Opposition Members about the guidance, its implementation and the delay.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">The two regimes are part of one and the same thing and they will benefit our society whether taken together&#151;as they should be&#151;or separately. During the passage of the order, the House was concerned that business and enforcers should have adequate time to familiarise themselves with the new regime and the guidance that will accompany it and that the coming-into-force date should, as far as practicable, be timed to coincide as closely as possible with reform of the fire safety law in Scotland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) asked why the guidance was not yet available. When we took the regulatory reform order through the House, we said that it might not be possible to get the guidance drafted for 1 April 2006&#151;the coming-into-force date. It has turned out that the task of producing a suite of 11 sets of guidance documents could not be completed in that time. If we are to get the application right&#151;and it will be right&#151;we need to ensure that there is adequate time for business and organisations to gain that familiarity. Despite extensive work with stakeholders, it is clear that all the guidance documents will not be ready in time to have a full 12-week gap between publication and coming into force on 1 April 2006, as was hoped.
</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60125h01_spnew43"><b> Mr. Dismore </b> : I am sorry to keep nipping at the Minister&#039;s ankles about this, but he is still talking about guidance. It is quite clear that the Government are talking about producing a suite of guidance notes. I return to the basic question about a code of practice. Will he give us a clear answer today? Will he say whether the Government will consider turning the guidance notes into a code of practice, which would have a much greater legal effect?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 442WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60125h01_spnew44"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I am not in a position today to give my hon. Friend that assurance, but I undertake to take his request away and write to him in due course about the point that he has just raised.
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60125h01_spnew45"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I wonder whether the Minister will help us by enhancing that response. It would be invaluable if he would meet Members to discuss this point in more detail, and possibly meet an element of the stakeholders as well, to talk about the transference of the guidance into a code of practice.
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60125h01_spnew46"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I think that my hon. Friend knows that, when it comes to safety issues, my door is generally open. As I have indicated, I have accepted requests from the RMT for meetings and I have met with the Fire Brigades Union on a number occasions. I think that I have already written this week accepting a request to meet with officers of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group and that I have acceded to a request to meet members of the all-party fire safety and rescue group.
</p>






<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60125h01_spnew47"><b> John McDonnell </b> : Is that a yes?
</p>






<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60125h01_spnew48"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I would be slightly hurt if my hon. Friend thought that my door was closed to any request from Members in respect of fire safety, given the changes that are being undertaken, which are fundamental to the fire service and to the way in which we try to protect the public. We want to ensure that we have given the best possible reassurances to ensure that people understand what we are trying to achieve.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">In the light of the commitments that we have given to the House and our commitment to ensuring that the reform is properly backed, I announced on 12 January that the coming into force of the substantive provisions of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 should be put back, as was mentioned by the hon. Member for Cheadle. Recently, as he also mentioned, the Scottish authorities announced that more time should be allowed for reform north of the border, and the new rules in Scotland are now expected to come into force in October 2006 at the earliest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">There will be further discussion with colleagues in Scotland and I hope, following that, to announce the revised coming-into-force date very shortly. However, as the point of delaying is to give more time, the publicity campaign to promote the regulatory reform order has started, with seminars taking place around England and Wales between January and March. They have been well attended so far and all sectors of business and the enforcing authorities have been well represented. The feedback from the seminars so far has been positive. Many share the general opinion that more time is needed for stakeholders to familiarise themselves with the new fire safety regime and accompanying guidance. We are agreed that it is important that the guidance is not rushed and that we must get it right.
</p>






<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60125h01_spnew49"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I can see that the Minister may be running out of notes. Before he concludes, I would like him to clarify the parliamentary process from here on in. Will the Regulatory Reform Committee be consulted again? Will there be some reference back to it and will there be any engagement with its members, given the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 443WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
significance that they have attached to this matter in the past and their recommendations? In addition, are there any elements that will require a parliamentary process to be employed&#151;using either the affirmative or negative procedure&#151;in relation to the order, which Members may be able to come to a view on? Are there any further elements in the parliamentary process?
</p>






<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60125h01_spnew50"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I will have to research that and respond to my hon. Friend in due course. My understanding at this point is that we have concluded the parliamentary procedures, but that we have obviously not announced the date for the implementation of the guidance notes. I am advised that the order to change the coming-into-force date will go to the Regulatory Reform Committee, so there will be additional scope. I have given a commitment to my hon. Friend that we can certainly have a meeting. I have done exactly the same to representatives from the RMT. Hopefully, I have demonstrated to their satisfaction that by running the two procedures in tandem, we will be able to demonstrate that improvements and enhancements are being used under the new system that could not have been used under the old system. In that instance, they remain to be convinced. I understand that scepticism; I do not underestimate it or regard it as offensive. I take the point that my hon. Friend made earlier; I was not suggesting that he was being offensive. There is some way to go before we fully convince all partners. We may not get to that point, but I hope that we do.
</p>






<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60125h01_spnew51"><b> John McDonnell </b> : Now that the matter will be referred back to the Regulatory Reform Committee, it would be invaluable if the difference between the Government&#039;s approach to guidance and that recommended by a number of Members here today in relation to the construction and installation of a code of practice were pointed out to the Committee and addressed by it. A helpful note to the Committee on the Government&#039;s arguments would be invaluable.
</p>






<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60125h01_spnew52"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I am sure that that will form part of the course. Given the nature of the business and the fact that this debate has taken place and even if we were not to produce such documentation, members of the Regulatory Reform Committee may well have done 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 444WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
their own research and identified that issues have been raised which it would be appropriate for them to consider, prior to the order being laid before them.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60125h01_spnew53"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I apologise to the Minister for continuing to intervene. Will he clarify the timetable? It is an issue that we have all raised. Will he provide an indicative timetable for the process, including if and when matters will be referred back to the Regulatory Reform Committee; whether any further orders will lie before us; whether there will be any conclusion on the points about consultation on guidance and implementation; and when the contiguous six-month and 12-month periods will take place?
</p>






<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60125h01_spnew54"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : We are not in a position today to identify a definitive date. As I mentioned, the Scottish Executive expect the new regulations to come into force in Scotland from 1 October. We have undertaken to try to ensure that the timing is parallel. I cannot give a commitment to that now, but we will make an announcement shortly. The parallel running cannot take place until the guidance notes are produced. I have no problem with hon. Members intervening as they have, given that we have had the opportunity to respond to the serious points that have been made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">My hon. Friend the Member for Hove asked that the necessary regulations be updated from 1989. I have said that we believe we have done more than that: we have not only updated but reinforced them. We are monitoring carefully and listening to representations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">I have given several commitments about taking further representations. I hope that when the new guidance notes are published and implemented, colleagues in the House and the wider community will be reassured that the changes that we are introducing not only in this narrow regard but generally, in respect of the fire community and the public&#039;s protection from fire and other risks, will be enhanced by the cultural changes being made through the modernisation process that the fire service is going through as a result of the Bain inquiry and the 2004 Act.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">Those modernisation proposals go back to the 1960s and &#039;70s, as hon. Friends on the Government Benches and, I am sure, hon.

Having said that, the Government must be given credit, because the shortfall in resources is being corrected with a substantial uplift in the three-year allocation, beginning this year. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCT has complex relationships with partner organisations, but an excellent record of performance against nationally set health service targets. The financial allocation awarded to the PCT for 2006 to 2008 will enable it to achieve improved performance, including implementation of &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot; and performance targets. The allocation will facilitate the development of local services, which will result in a radical difference to residents and enable the PCT, with local partners, to tackle the health inequalities experienced by people in the district of Easington.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para1"><a name="stpa_101">At this time of change for PCTs, it is critical that the particular characteristics of Easington are understood in any future configuration. Sir Nigel Crisp visited my constituency in September to open officially the new urgent care centre in Peterlee, and he gave generous praise to Easington PCT for its record of improving the service infrastructure and the health of the local population. A strong locality focus is clearly required to retain the emphasis on tackling the health inequalities that are adversely affecting my constituents if we are to ensure continued health improvement and service development.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para2"><a name="stpa_102">The purpose of this debate, for which I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for allocating me time, is to highlight the position of Easington PCT in terms of health experiences, financial allocation and complex relationships with partner organisations. I also intend to draw Ministers&#039; attention to the excellent record of performance against key national targets achieved by the PCT, and to put the case for retaining Easington PCT, at least in the short to medium term, in the reconfigured structure of primary care trusts in the county of Durham and the Tees valley.

<p>
<a name="60125h02_para3"><a name="stpa_103">The health and disability domain of the index of deprivation 2004 identified areas with high numbers of people who die prematurely, whose quality of life is impaired by poor health or who are disabled. All but one super-output area in the district are ranked in the 20 per cent. most deprived nationally. Easington is the most deprived local authority district in a shire county. Its population suffers lower average incomes, high levels of worklessness and lower educational attainment at age 16.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para4"><a name="stpa_104">Easington suffers some of the poorest health and worst deprivation in the country. Life expectancy for men and women in Easington falls below the national average. The PCT area has one of the highest rates of smoking in the region and nationally. It has one of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 446WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
highest conception rates in girls under the age of 18 in the region. The two major causes of death in Easington are circulatory diseases, including coronary heart disease, and cancer. The death rate for circulatory disease is one of the highest in the northern region, and the population has one of the highest lung cancer rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para5"><a name="stpa_105">A study undertaken by the Sainsbury centre in 1999 highlighted the fact that the prevalence of mental health problems was greater in Easington than anywhere else in the country outside inner London, and that the need for mental health services in Easington was 30 per cent. higher than the national average.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para6"><a name="stpa_106">Easington is the most underfunded PCT in the country, at 86 per cent. of target. Historically, the PCT has been significantly underfunded against its fair share&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of national funding available to the national health service. I am talking about a shortfall of about &#163;26 million per annum. The January 2005 announcement of allocations to the PCT from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2008 appreciably addressed the underfunding. Even at that stage, Easington will be 3.5&nbsp;per cent. below capitation, but it has been promised an additional &#163;43 million.
</p>






<p><a name="st_57"><a name="60125h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on the work that he has done to ensure that his local PCT receives funding to fight the deprivation that he has outlined. The position is similar in my constituency. Does he agree that one fear that our constituents have about the proposals for a single county-wide PCT is that that money, which has been targeted at the worst deprivation, is likely to be disbursed to more affluent parts of County Durham?
</p>






<p><a name="st_58"><a name="60125h02_spnew2"><b> John Cummings </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. Only too well do we know that in the past moneys that should have been directed to Easington were subsumed into the old County Durham, and I certainly have similar fears for the future. One reason why Easington PCT has inherited a very low capitation is that each time there has been a change or reconfiguration of boundaries or commissioning arrangements, Easington has lost out because of the complexity of provider relationships and the relative smallness of our population compared with the populations of major urban centres.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para7"><a name="stpa_107">In respect of commissioning for acute services, there are relationships with North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust, City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and County Durham and Darlington Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. There are also commissioning relationships with South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust for tertiary services. For mental health and substance misuse services, there are partnerships with Tees and North East Yorkshire NHS Trust, South of Tyne and Wearside Mental Health NHS Trust and County Durham and Darlington Priority Services NHS Trust.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para8"><a name="stpa_108">Easington PCT is a member of both the County Durham and Darlington and the Tees emergency care networks. It is a member of the Northern Cancer Network, covering the north of Durham, and of the Cancer Care Alliance, covering south Durham and Teesside. Whereas other networks are split in the same way based on patient flows, the PCT is a member of both.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para9"><a name="stpa_109">In developing local integrated services, particularly for older people, children, people with mental health problems and people with learning disabilities, effective partnerships with Durham county council and Easington district council have been critical. The PCT has strong relationships with the councils in developing services and tackling health inequalities. There is no forum that spans all those areas, so to ensure that the health needs of the residents of Easington district are not marginalised or viewed by the major players as peripheral, Easington needs a strong, locality-focused PCT to prevent regression to former times, when Easington lost out substantially on resource allocation and local service developments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para10"><a name="stpa_110">As regards performance against targets, Easington PCT has strengthened considerably its approach to performance over the past year and has in place robust arrangements to deliver the performance targets, &quot;Standards for Better Health&quot; and financial balance in 2005&#150;06. Easington PCT has an excellent record of recent success. It is working in partnership to develop children&#039;s centres across the district, with 11 to be in place by April next year. Two are already open, and two are about to open. An urgent care centre in Peterlee opened in October 2004 on an appointment-only basis; it has been open 24 hours, seven days a week since March 2005. More than 22,000 patients have been seen to date. At Christmas, more patients attended the urgent care centre than the accident and emergency department. Furthermore, 1,254 smokers have successfully quit after four weeks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para11"><a name="stpa_111">With a 52 per cent. success rate, the PCT is the second best performing service in the country. On 31 March 2005, 1,512 patients were waiting for an in-patient appointment, representing a 21 per cent. reduction in the year from April 2004. The PCT has appointed four dentists since April 2005, including a vocational trainee. GPs with specialised interests have been accredited by the Deanery in substance misuse services, and there are plans this year to establish and accredit four new areas&#151;in dermatology, coronary heart disease, emergency care, and sexual health and contraceptive services. A new door-to-door transport scheme funded by the PCT is now available in the district of Easington for people with mobility problems. The scheme can be used only for appointments with hospitals and primary care providers. There have therefore been substantial improvements in service delivery, which are a testament to the valuable work being carried out by Easington PCT.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para12"><a name="stpa_112">In shaping up for the future and addressing the proposed changes to PCT boundaries, there seems to be considerable pressure from the centre and at strategic health authority level to accept a single PCT for County Durham. Although I fully understand and support the overall philosophy of delivering primary health care and, indeed, all health services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, with savings from a reduction in management and administration costs being reinvested in front-line services, there is a danger that the improvements in local services and infrastructure that Easington PCT has made to date will be put at risk unless the necessary safeguards on resource allocations are put in place.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 448WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para13"><a name="stpa_113">There is also the issue of the loss of local accountability, which causes me grave concern. The non-executive directors of Easington PCT are drawn from a range of local people with differing backgrounds and experiences. They have done an excellent job in consulting patient user groups and stakeholders to determine a set of local priorities within the overall NHS Plan. Who will act as champions for Easington&#039;s primary health care services in a County Durham-wide PCT, and what assurances will we have that resources earmarked for Easington will not be redirected to other, perhaps less needy areas?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para14"><a name="stpa_114">In conclusion, there are six key points that I would like the Minister to note and comment on. First, health experience in Easington is worse overall than in most other areas of England. Secondly, the financial allocation to support interventions to tackle that poor health experience was, until this year, the lowest in the country, with Easington ranking 302 out of 302 PCTs, although that position will improve significantly over the next two years, with an additional &#163;43.6 million on top of the baseline allocation promised by the Department of Health from 1 April 2006 until 31 March 2008. Thirdly, Easington has complex relationships with partner organisations because of patient flows.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para15"><a name="stpa_115">Fourthly, Easington has a good record of performance against nationally set health service targets. Given the funding allocation to Easington for the years 2006 to 2008, there is a real opportunity to make a difference to the health experience of the people of Easington. Fifthly, if that funding is diluted or lost to Easington, there is a serious risk that the progress that has been made in recent years will be stopped in its tracks or even reversed. Finally, a unique case can be made for the retention of Easington PCT in the short to medium term, with Easington PCT coming under the umbrella of a merged County Durham PCT at some point in future, but only when the glaring problems of health inequality have been properly addressed. It is critical to ensure that Easington&#039;s unique position is fully understood and recognised and that a strong locality focus is maintained to ensure continued progress in improving health and health services in Easington in the future configuration of PCTs in County Durham and the Tees valley.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para16"><a name="stpa_116">I am grateful for having had the opportunity to raise these issues, and I await the Minister&#039;s comments with great interest.

<p><a name="st_59"><a name="60125h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Mr. Liam Byrne) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Easington (John Cummings) on securing this debate on the future of Easington PCT. I also express my thanks, as well as those of my right hon. and hon. Friends at the Department of Health, for his counsel and advice since we were appointed last May. He has ensured that Easington&#039;s voice has been heard at the highest levels in the debates over the reforms that we have made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para17"><a name="stpa_117">The level of investment in the NHS is rising rapidly, as my hon. Friend said, from &#163;33 billion in 1997&#150;98 to more than &#163;92 billion in 2007&#150;08. That increased investment, along with the hard work of 1.3 million NHS staff, is transforming our hospitals, reducing waiting lists and lowering mortality rates for some of the diseases that afflict my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para18"><a name="stpa_118">There can be no resting on our laurels, however. Over the weeks to come we shall be explaining how the next phase of health reform needs to take the health service forward. The vast majority of patient contact with the NHS&#151;90 per cent.&#151;takes place in a primary care setting. Having spent seven years reducing waiting lists to record lows, we now face the challenge of strengthening primary and community services as well. We need to meet the needs of patients with long-term conditions far better, which my hon. Friend will welcome because it is such a priority in his constituency. There are still too many people waiting far too long for treatment.
</p>






<p><a name="st_60"><a name="60125h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  </b> (in the Chair): Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but could he address the Chair? He is off microphone and <i>Hansard</i> is finding it difficult to hear.
</p>






<p><a name="st_61"><a name="60125h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> : Of course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para19"><a name="stpa_119">We have debated the need to bring down waiting lists, particularly for diagnostic scans. Too many people, especially in disadvantaged areas such as Easington, cannot find a GP, or when they have a family doctor they cannot get an appointment at a time that suits them. Too many patients are admitted to hospital because the care that they could have received or which they might have preferred to receive at home is not available in the right way at the right time. Patients want far more control over their own care. They want to make choices about where and when to use services and that is exactly what we will address in the forthcoming White Paper.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para20"><a name="stpa_120">I was pleased that my hon. Friend rooted so much of his argument in the need to tackle health inequalities. He commented on low life expectancy in his constituency, which is a problem that afflicts many of our poorer communities. As we move into the next phase of health reform we must surely focus on a much broader mission for the NHS and our social care system, which is not just about delivering a service that helps people when they are ill. We must bring the health service much closer to local government, so that together they can get down to the business of transforming health inequalities in some of our poorest communities. I do not think that there can be any community where that mission is more important than in Easington.
</p>






<p><a name="st_62"><a name="60125h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I am listening carefully to the Minister, but that is exactly what is happening in the county of Durham. Local PCTs work closely with district councils and others to tackle some of the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Easington (John Cummings) raised, so why does the Department want to break up what has been a successful partnership in my constituency and his?
</p>






<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60125h02_spnew6"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention, as I want to address that point directly in the last third of my remarks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para21"><a name="stpa_121">To add a few facts to the analysis that my hon. Friend the Member for Easington gave, almost 29,000 adults in Easington consider themselves to have a long-term limiting illness. That is 30.8 per cent. of the population, which is the highest in England and Wales. More than 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 450WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
16,000 adults in Easington describe their health as not good. At 17.3 per cent. of the population, that is the second highest figure in England and Wales. Some 11,000 people in Easington would describe themselves as permanently sick or disabled, which is the highest rate in England and Wales. The north-east is classified in the index of multiple deprivation as the most deprived region in the country, and Easington is the most deprived area in the north-east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para22"><a name="stpa_122">Against that background, my hon. Friend has raised three important points. The first is about money: how do we ensure that Easington continues to receive the resources that it needs to tackle deprivation and health inequality? The second is about services: how do we ensure that the boost to resources in Easington delivers world-class health services to his constituents? The third and final point, which was the subject of the intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones), is about structures: how do we ensure a PCT structure that delivers those benefits, working in partnership with local government and other players?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para23"><a name="stpa_123">First, I shall talk about money, because money is often the route to so much progress in health. Following the sustained lobbying campaign in which my hon. Friend the Member for Easington played a vital part, Easington PCT is to receive another &#163;43.5 million in funding for the two-year period to 2008. He is therefore entitled to an assurance that, should Easington PCT be merged with any other PCTs, its funding allocation for the period up to 2008 will reach the areas for which it was originally intended.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para24"><a name="stpa_124">It will be for strategic health authorities and the newly formed PCTs to manage and to continue to use in the best possible ways the funding available to them in order to deliver Government targets and make service improvements. We expect those organisations to continue to direct funding towards areas of greatest need. The reconfiguration exercise should not be used locally to move resources from high-performing areas to underperforming areas and vice versa.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para25"><a name="stpa_125">There are two important policies that will strengthen the process. The first is practice-based commissioning, which places far bigger budgets under the control of local doctors&#039; services, working in local wards. It supports the allocation of resources according to the movement of PCTs towards target &quot;fair share&quot; budgets for practices, based on the health needs of the local population. Further, practices will be able to re-allocate freed-up resources to services that better meet the needs of the patient. That will allow GPs to focus more health services on tackling health inequalities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para26"><a name="stpa_126">The second policy involves retaining the high priority that has been given to tackling health inequalities in 2006 and 2007. That policy is important. We expect PCTs to focus their work on meeting locally agreed delivery plans that make the most progress towards reducing health inequalities by 10 per cent. by 2010&#151;concentrating on life expectancy at birth. The focus on tackling health inequalities will be at the centre of the forthcoming health and social care White Paper.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para27"><a name="stpa_127">Secondly, I want to talk about how the money will be turned into services to help my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents. Several important initiatives are already under way in his constituency. He mentioned some of them: the two urgent care centres in the district; the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 451WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
young people&#039;s centre, which provides a new focus on the treatment of substance misuse and sexual health; and the PCT-run, second most successful quit-smoking programme in England.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para28"><a name="stpa_128">In the PCT&#039;s business plan for the next three years, there are new ambitions, including the improvement of life chances for children, new access to high-quality services and the creation of more opportunities for good health. The PCT has already made much progress, with some key headline indicators already moving in the right direction.
</p>






<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60125h02_spnew7"><b> John Cummings </b> : Is the Minister able to assure me that the three-year plan will be adopted and carried out by any future reconfiguration of primary care trusts in County Durham?
</p>






<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60125h02_spnew8"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> : If I may, I shall check the guidance being issued around the consultation process, so that I can give my hon. Friend chapter and verse on how those local delivery plans will be taken forward. I do not want to give him a glib answer now. The matter is of such importance that I shall write to him with as full an answer as possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para29"><a name="stpa_129">The final point about structures is important to this debate. Primary care trusts need to earn the trust of the people whom they serve every single day. That means that they need to get better every day at securing the best possible services, representing good value, from a growing range and diversity of health care providers. The creation of foundation trusts and the planned introduction of payment by results will mean that the hospital sector gets stronger in relation to primary and community services. That new hospital sector might well tend to suck resources towards it unless it is counterbalanced by an equally strong organisation that buys services for the community and represents patients&#039; interests in designing and locating services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para30"><a name="stpa_130">We need strong PCTs to design, plan and develop better services for patients, to work more closely with local government, and, in some cases, to hold GPs to account for the services that they deliver. As my hon. Friend will know, SHAs were invited to submit reconfiguration proposals to the Department of Health by 15 October last year. An external panel, representing a wide range of stakeholder interests, was established to advise Ministers on whether the proposals for reconfiguration submitted by SHAs adequately engaged local stakeholders and met the criteria set out in &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;. Following debate and, where necessary, some reworking by Ministers, we forwarded proposals for the reconfiguration of PCTs, which were fit to go forward for a 14-week consultation period starting on 14 December. With some PCTs, that included a wider range of proposals for reconfiguration than was originally put forward, because our objective was to ensure that the consultation on PCTs covered the broadest and most appropriate range of options for reconfiguration.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 452WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para31"><a name="stpa_131">My hon. Friend is concerned about the two reconfiguration options that are currently out to consultation in County Durham and Tees valley, both of which propose the merger of Easington with Derwentside, Durham Dales, Sedgefield, and Durham and Chester-le-Street PCTs to form a single organisation for County Durham. Those options are out to consultation until 22 March, and no decisions on the future of any PCT will be taken until those local consultations are complete.
</p>






<p><a name="st_66"><a name="60125h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : Is that not a bit of a sham? Why has Darlington, which was part of the original merger in County Durham, been taken out? Is it because the former Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), has been lobbying hard? If that can be done for Darlington, why can it not be done for Easington and other PCTs in Durham?
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60125h02_spnew10"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> : Ministers felt that the two options on the table for County Durham would adequately reflect the criteria that were put forward. We felt that those options warranted going out to public consultation. There can be no pre-judgment of that consultation. Ministers will need to be satisfied, when consultation responses come forward and the SHAs finalise their proposals, that there are reassurances on the way in which local delivery plans will be taken forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para32"><a name="stpa_132">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham made an important point about the way in which the current structure puts in place a range of successful relationships with local partners&#151;I have seen how that works in my constituency in east Birmingham. Those relationships will be extremely important&#151;particularly those with social care departments. In a health economy in which we seek to put care far closer to home and to give people the opportunity to live in their homes for longer, which is what most people want, the relationship between primary care organisations and local social services departments is absolutely critical. We have talked about the Berlin wall that has separated the NHS and social care departments for many years. We need to start taking that wall down, so if Ministers think that certain reconfiguration options take that process backwards, they cannot be approved. We have asked the SHAs which have proposed options to explain how they will ensure that the range of local partnerships in place will continue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h02_para33"><a name="stpa_133">My hon. Friend the Member for Easington also asked how we can ensure that champions for Easington are intimately involved in the new organisation. That has to be part of the advice that comes back. Unless there is specific advice about how champions for his local health economy are to be kept involved, we cannot be satisfied that any new arrangements will take health and social care forward in his constituency.

That crisis is affecting not only Shropshire, but its neighbouring counties, and that is indicative of a systemic problem; one that has only just started to reach the public consciousness. That problem is the chronic mismanagement of the NHS, which stems from a sustained period in which the Government have imposed targets, interfered in clinical priorities and introduced new cost structures, while at the same time seeking to abdicate any responsibility for the financial management of health care at the local level.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para0"><a name="stpa_135">The consequence of that crisis, and the reason why I have called this debate, is that all three community hospitals in my constituency&#151;in Bridgnorth, Ludlow and Bishop&#039;s Castle&#151;are under imminent threat of closure, along with the community hospital in Whitchurch, in the constituency of my hon.

CHANT has evidence that 80 of the 322 community hospitals in England are at risk of closure or are threatened with substantial cuts in services, and I cannot overstate the impact that such closures would have on my constituents. With no hospital in an area of more than 600 square miles, and no hospital near the boundary of my constituency, many of my constituents would have to travel more than 30 miles to reach an acute hospital. The Minister may not know this, but given the lack of public transport infrastructure in much of Shropshire, it could take the best part of a day to make the round trip for an out-patient appointment or to visit a relative.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para2"><a name="stpa_137">That is but one of a host of reasons why, on the first Saturday in January, more than 10,000 people marched through sleet and rain in all four of the towns where Shropshire community hospitals are at risk to support the continued provision of services at those hospitals. I addressed crowds of more than 4,000 people in both Bridgnorth and Ludlow that day and I am glad for the Minister&#039;s sake that it was me who addressed those crowds, not her, such was the clear strength of feeling. I do not know whether she has ever faced a crowd of that many people who were determined to preserve their hospital, but if she has not, I would be very happy to arrange a meeting&#151;she would get the message soon enough.

everyone who responded confirmed their full support for our community hospitals. The League of Friends of Ludlow Hospital has received letters in support of maintaining all existing services at Ludlow community hospital from all nine of the consultants who hold periodic clinics there.

<a name="60125h03_para4"><a name="stpa_139">Let me set the funding crisis in Shropshire in context by explaining the scale of the problem that our health care services face under the Government&#039;s funding rules for the NHS. Between them, the four NHS trusts in Shropshire and the unitary authority of Telford have a historic debt that is currently estimated at &#163;36 million and are running a collective annual deficit of &#163;25&nbsp;million. Under the Government&#039;s current funding rules for the NHS, that historic debt must be repaid over the next three financial years and the annual deficit must be eliminated in the financial year starting in April. That means that the Government have tasked local health care managers with finding cuts of &#163;37 million from the health care budget for the area of more than &#163;400&nbsp;million, which represents a cut of nearly 10 per cent. in the amount spent on health care in Shropshire effectively for each of the next three years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para5"><a name="stpa_140">I wish to ask the Minister three main questions. What went wrong? What does it mean to our local communities and, on a more positive note, what can be done? Two decisions affect Shropshire specifically, when the Government have to accept some responsibility over and above the overall impact of their so-called management of the NHS nationally. I refer first to the decision back in 2003 when the two trusts that ran the acute hospitals, the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and the&nbsp;Princess Royal hospital in Telford, were merged into a single NHS trust. At the time, the trusts had debts in the order of &#163;6 million.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para6"><a name="stpa_141">I understand from the new chief executive of the combined trust that it is clear from his review of the merger agreements and the drafts, in particular, of the&nbsp;agreements that part of the political price for securing public acceptance of the merger, which was controversial at the time, was for the debts to be assumed by the Government. At the last minute, that did not happen so, in my view, the Government shoulder direct responsibility for at least part of the historic debt, which has now compounded considerably.

<p>
<a name="60125h03_para7"><a name="stpa_142">The second issue that I hold at the Government&#039;s door is that there has clearly been chronic financial mismanagement within the acute trust since its formation. The scale of the financial difficulties of the trust only became apparent last year. Those directly responsible were finally found out and fired. It transpired that the chief executive of the trust had got his job on or around the time of the merger on the basis of a fake CV. The whole appointment process for senior administration and board positions within the trust was at fault. There was inadequate monitoring of the financial performance and control. Nothing was done about the mounting debt and deficit until they had escalated last year into the present crisis management. The whole sorry saga raises fundamental questions about the Government&#039;s failure to impose proper oversight of board appointment decisions, financial monitoring and the governance of NHS trusts.

In other words, to compound the developing financial crisis, there was also a cover-up; a cover-up that has now been terminated by the much more effective and transparent management who have taken over the trust&#039;s operations, and for whom I am very thankful.

Last week, I received a copy of a letter that had been sent to one of my constituents, not from a Minister but from an official in the Department of Health. The letter made it crystal clear that the Department has abrogated any management responsibility for the provision of services at a local level. The buck certainly does not appear to stop with Ministers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para8"><a name="stpa_143">I should like to address some questions about what the crisis means for health care in Shropshire. If the Government insist on forcing through those cuts, local health care managers have some unenviable decisions to make in the next couple of weeks. Management consultants have been drafted in to help present those choices in purely financial terms, which they set out in a report that was published in November.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para9"><a name="stpa_144">Those are the same consultants who were responsible a few years ago for the report on neighbouring Worcestershire which led to the closure of Kidderminster hospital&#039;s accident and emergency department and thus to the arrival in this place of the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), who I am delighted to see has joined us for this debate. I am sure that the Minister will have been briefed on the report. It has been the subject of much comment in Shropshire, very little of it positive, since many of the comparisons that the report seeks to draw do not reflect the health care realities on the ground.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para10"><a name="stpa_145">Shropshire is very rural. My constituency is the most sparsely populated of all constituencies in the county. The sheer geography and demography of the area inevitably creates higher costs to provide acceptable health care services than the national average, especially in primary and community care.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para11"><a name="stpa_146">For several years, Shropshire has not received funding settlements that reflect those cost pressures. Much of the report&#039;s analysis ignores rural costs, too. It ignores also the significance of Shropshire hospitals to the residents of mid-Wales, where many thousands rely on the Royal Shrewsbury hospital, in particular.
</p>






<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60125h03_spnew11"><b> Lembit &#214;pik </b> : That is the reason why I am present in this debate. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we depend on the Royal Shrewsbury hospital more than on any other for our accident and emergency care and substantial services. Does he agree that the debate is about not only the people in Shropshire, but the more than 100,000 people who depend directly on the services of the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and cottage hospitals that he describes? We are looking for a response from the Minister to assure our constituents that their quality of life will not diminish as a result of a debt caused by no fault of the citizens themselves.
</p>






<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60125h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Dunne </b> : I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman. In fact, I should go further: as I said at the

&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 457WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
outset, the crisis in Shropshire is indicative of a general malaise that is affecting the entire NHS. We have seen reports of deficits of &#163;620 million anticipated for the current year, a figure that the Department of Health acknowledges. The most recent figure I saw was from the Royal College of Nursing, which estimates the deficits at &#163;1.2 billion, a sum that will escalate in the future. The issue will have resonance well beyond this Chamber and our constituencies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para12"><a name="stpa_147">I want to concentrate on what some of the cost-cutting choices would mean to my constituents. I will touch briefly on each of the three community hospitals that I know well. Bridgnorth hospital serves the south-east of Shropshire. It has 25 beds and four theatre beds and employs 110 people. Last year, 700 in-patients, 11,000 out-patients and 13,500 minor injuries were treated at Bridgnorth hospital. After many years of hard-fought campaigning, Shropshire county primary care trust last year started a flagship redevelopment of the hospital to bring all health care services in the area on to a single site. That is very welcome in the community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para13"><a name="stpa_148">Construction is mid-way through on this &#163;6.5 million project. Ironically, it is celebrated by an enormous sign on the hospital wall that proudly proclaims:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Department of Health: Building for the Future&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para14"><a name="stpa_149">Underneath, it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;Bridgnorth Hospital Redevelopment, Investing for Improvements to Buildings and Standards&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para15"><a name="stpa_150">There are uncomfortable parallels with what happened in Kidderminster immediately after a substantial capital investment under this Government&#039;s stewardship. According to the management consultants, closure of the hospital would &quot;save&quot; a mere &#163;600,000 a year. The hospital in Telford is nearly 20 miles from Bridgnorth, which has a population of 11,891. Last week, the petition that I have referred to was signed by 11,871 residents, who objected in the strongest possible terms to the closure of Bridgnorth hospital or a cut in services there.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para16"><a name="stpa_151">The community hospital in Ludlow serves most of the district of South Shropshire. It has 72 beds and treats 810 in-patients annually, including those in the mental health ward and the maternity unit. The maternity unit is housed in a building that was originally the town&#039;s workhouse. It may even be one of those places often cited, although not by name, by the Secretary of State to justify the modernisation programme. Last year, the hospital treated 11,000 out-patients, including X-ray and physiotherapy patients. Doctors and other health professionals in the town and the surrounding area would like to see services at the hospital maximised to consolidate their activities on the site, as is happening in Bridgnorth. Instead, it is threatened with closure because that would save &#163;1 million, according to the same management consultants&#039; report.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para17"><a name="stpa_152">The hospital is one of the largest employers in the town, with some 150 jobs at stake. The Royal Shrewsbury hospital is 25 miles from Ludlow, up a busy and dangerous road. According to the 2001 census, Ludlow has a population of 9,250. Last week, I presented a petition signed by 10,220 residents who were protesting at the threatened closure of Ludlow hospital or a cut in services there. Perhaps some people signed twice, such is their anger. I could hardly blame them.

<p>
<a name="60125h03_para18"><a name="stpa_153">The community hospital at Bishop&#039;s Castle serves the south-west of my constituency and the area across the Welsh border. No savings have been assumed in the management consultants&#039; report since Shropshire county primary care trust has advanced plans to close the hospital anyway, to offer its site to the neighbouring residential home operator and to commission nursing home beds, under the supervision of local doctors, from a redevelopment of the enlarged site. This time last year, there were 24 beds in Bishops Castle hospital; today only 18 are being commissioned. The threat posed by the review is that the number of beds will be reduced further, with the loss of up to 35 skilled staff. I am concerned to ensure that this proposal does not fall victim to the same cost-cutting mantra afflicting other services in the county. I will seek reassurance that the number of PCT-commissioned beds will not fall further and that the contract offered will be a genuine, long-term one so that rehabilitation beds with proper nursing care under doctors&#039; supervision are maintained in Bishop&#039;s Castle in the long term.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para19"><a name="stpa_154">The precedents are not encouraging. The old cottage hospitals in Broseley and Much Wenlock&#151;both in my constituency&#151;were turned into residential care homes some years ago. Each retained PCT-commissioned beds, but the number of beds the PCT committed to fund has gradually been whittled away over the years so that all remaining beds are once more threatened with termination, at the end of the financial year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para20"><a name="stpa_155">The so-called saving that will come from the closure of the three community hospitals amounts to &#163;1.6 million. In my view, that is not a saving, but a mirage. It is a short-term quick fix with much longer-term and higher cost implications. It completely ignores the cost to the community of having to travel miles to visit their loved ones or an outpatient clinic; these are just some of the challenges posed by distance and rurality to health care outcomes. I have received many letters from constituents detailing the problems that closure of the hospitals would pose to asthmatics, diabetics, pregnant mums and the mentally ill, to mention a few.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para21"><a name="stpa_156">People who live in those communities will still get ill, unfortunately. If community hospitals are closed, the acute hospitals will come under intense pressure. Admissions will rise and discharges will slow because the vital rehabilitation role of the community hospitals will have gone. That will reduce productivity in acute hospitals at a time when management consultants require significant improvements in productivity. The acute hospitals do not have the capacity to cope, especially not in winter. They are already operating at above optimal occupancy rates. I have hard evidence of that in an e-mail, dated 19 December 2005, from a senior manager at the acute trust:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust are under acute pressure from emergency admissions and in the night were on the verge of declaring a major incident. I should be grateful therefore if you would consider all possible options before taking the decision to refer a patient for admission. The options will vary in the different areas and as the community hospitals will be endeavouring to accept as many transfers as possible from the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and Princess Royal hospital it would be preferable if you would consider intermediate care and rapid response as a first line although these services also have a limit on how many patients they can care for at any one time.&quot;</p>

Friend&#039;s argument closely and&#151;before he moves on to the ambulance service&#151;he quoted the expected saving from the threatened closure of the three cottage hospitals in his constituency as &#163;1.6 million. According to my own research that appears somewhat illusory. I could not establish whether that was cited in the Finnamore report as a net figure, after taking into account all consequential ramifications and losses, or whether it was an estimate of the cash-flow saving, which is a year-on-year management issue, rather than one of true patient care delivery.
</p>






<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60125h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Dunne </b> : My hon. Friend makes a characteristically strong point. I posed the same question to the author of that report, and I was assured that it was an estimate of a net saving. However, as I shall go on to say, there are many other ramifications for the acute trusts&#151;including additional costs for the ambulance service&#151;of having to cope with the extra bed-blocking and so on that would arise. The estimate is clearly based on very flimsy data; I shall return to that point presently.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para25"><a name="stpa_160">The ambulance service is very concerned about the closure of community hospitals, because closure will place it under additional pressures. A letter to me from the ambulance service says that closure

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;may produce an increase in demand and as Shropshire ambulance service resource configuration is finely balanced and matched to available resources, i.e. Acute Trust and Community Hospital facilities, this potential increase in demand may require additional funding&quot;.</p>

<a name="60125h03_para27"><a name="stpa_162">Personally, I believe that the costs of patient stays at community hospitals are less than at acute hospitals. When I sought a breakdown of costs for Shropshire hospitals in order to prove that point, I received the following reply last week in the name of the Minister, which I hope that she will not mind my repeating:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;There is no data collected centrally at individual patient per bed level. Data is collected on a finished consultant episode basis and at National Health Service trust level, within which one or more hospitals will operate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para28"><a name="stpa_163">The fact that those data cannot be given does not inspire confidence that such critical decisions for our community hospitals are made on the basis of proper information.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para29"><a name="stpa_164">Our community hospitals are vital to deliver key Government health care priorities. In urban areas, care in the community may work without hospitals, but rural Shropshire does not have the pool of nursing talent that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 460WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is needed to deliver such care. The community hospitals provide a hub around which community nursing services can be delivered. The management consultants&#039; report seeks to reduce the cost of the district nursing skill mix within the Shropshire county primary care trust to the same skill-mix cost as Telford district nurses, who provide what is essentially an urban service. That entirely ignores the extra time and cost involved in serving a widespread rural area. Moreover, the current hiring freeze in Shropshire raises a host of questions about how the services will be provided in the coming years without trained nursing staff coming through the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para30"><a name="stpa_165">The review has other implications, and I do not have time to go in detail into them all. However, I shall just mention the impact on mental health services in the county. Shropshire performs very well in financial terms. Its mental health team operates without deficit at substantially less than the national average cost of such provision&#151;21 per cent. less, in fact. That is partly because most beds are in Shelton hospital in Shrewsbury, which is one of the last two Victorian asylums left operating in England. Much work has gone into developing advanced plans to replace it with a modern facility, but all of that is now on hold, so Shropshire now looks set to have the unique distinction of operating the very last Victorian asylum in the country.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60125h03_spnew15"><b> Lembit &#214;pik </b> : I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that mid-Wales depends on the facilities in Shropshire for its mental health provision. Does he agree that we are jeopardising not just the welfare of individuals but their families and relatives as well, as a direct result of the under-investment in this absolutely essential service?
</p>






<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60125h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. Dunne </b> : The hon. Gentleman anticipates what I am going to say. It is absolutely true that the families of these most vulnerable people are those who will suffer from having to travel such long distances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para31"><a name="stpa_166">That has not stopped health chiefs insisting on finding savings of between &#163;1.2 million and &#163;2.2. million from next year&#039;s mental health budget, despite current efficiency. There are advanced plans for closure of the two remaining mental health wards, both at Ludlow and Whitchurch hospitals, placing further pressure on their viability, and presenting the families of existing patients and staff with enormous stress, not to mention the patients themselves, who, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire was saying, are some of the most vulnerable people in our community. In my recent survey of the GPs in my constituency, 87 per cent. regarded closure of mental health wards in our community hospitals as short-sighted, given the ageing demographics that apply particularly to Shropshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para32"><a name="stpa_167">So what can be done? To try to adopt a slightly more positive note for the Minister, I shall set out three areas in which she could help local health chiefs in making such critical decisions. The first would be to acknowledge that the historic debts are a Government responsibility. Returning those debts to the NHS would clearly be the first choice, but a second best would be to provide a substantially longer period for their repayment. A 10-year repayment term would reduce the annual cuts by &#163;8 million.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para33"><a name="stpa_168">The second way in which savings could be made without compromising the community hospitals is through prescription charges. I have discussed this with several doctors in my constituency. The recommendation in the management consultants&#039; report gives rise to hope that significant savings could be made from reducing prescription charges, and many of the doctors believe that that could be achieved over time at no cost to health care quality and at relatively little cost to the community. Those savings would dwarf the notional savings from closing community hospitals.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para34"><a name="stpa_169">Thirdly, I draw to the Minister&#039;s attention the fact that there is no mention of administrative savings in the management consultants&#039; report. Given that the current reconfiguration consultations are under way for both the strategic health authority and primary care trusts in Shropshire, surely any review of health care spending in the county should take account of what savings can be made from those administrative reconfigurations before cuts in patient services are actioned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para35"><a name="stpa_170">I appreciate that I have been given a great deal of time, although there have been some interruptions. I conclude my remarks by saying that the Minister will doubtless give us in her winding-up speech a litany of how much has been invested and how many more doctors and nurses are now working in Shropshire than in 1997. Well before she embarks on that journey, I must tell her that the people of Shropshire will not wear it, especially when they see savage cuts in services or, God forbid, hospital closures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para36"><a name="stpa_171">The Prime Minister, we are led to believe, is looking to his legacy. In Shropshire, he risks being remembered as the axe man who has closed community hospitals, slashed hospital beds and cut off rural communities from local access to health care. I look to the Minister to ride to his rescue, and to offer my constituents and the people of Shropshire concrete evidence that the NHS is indeed safe in his hands.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para37"><a name="stpa_172">In closing, I have a simple question for the Minister, to which I, and I suspect the many people in Shropshire who are listening to the debate, would be grateful for an answer in her closing remarks: will she instruct the strategic health authority to rule out the closures of Bridgnorth and Ludlow community hospitals as options for formal consultation? If she did so, she would make many thousands of people in Shropshire sleep easier tonight, and she would absolve the Prime Minister of blame for his legacy to Ludlow.

services in Shropshire? It is also important to note that we are joined by hon. Members from the Welsh borders and by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), who obviously has had some experience in these matters in recent years.
</p>






<p><a name="st_88"><a name="60125h03_spnew19"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien </b> : And by MPs from Cheshire.
</p>






<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60125h03_spnew20"><b> David Wright </b> : Indeed, my apologies. I start by saying that I agree with the hon. Member for Ludlow that Shropshire has a unique rural structure, but it is also important to note that health care services were originally designed very much with that rural status in mind. There is a large hospital in Shrewsbury, as well as smaller community-based hospitals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para39"><a name="stpa_174">The advent of Telford new town in the 1960s placed greater pressures on the health economy in Shropshire; that is just a fact. Telford is now the largest town in Shropshire, and several of its wards exhibit significant deprivation. The community in Telford fought extremely hard throughout the &#039;70s and &#039;80s to secure a district general hospital, and it very much wants to protect it and ensure that it provides comprehensive services for the largest population centre in the county. That throws up significant challenges; that, too, is just a fact.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para40"><a name="stpa_175">Because Telford is new and continues to grow, the challenge facing us is how to provide health services for a growing population. Telford is a regional housing growth point. According to the regional planning guidance and the local development framework, between 2001 and 2021 a net increase in housing provision of 20,300 dwellings is envisaged in the Telford and the Wrekin area. That is a significant number of new homes in the county, based in Telford. It is crucial that any design of services acknowledges that point. It is also fair to say, and I think I would get agreement throughout the House, that both Shrewsbury and Telford deserve full, district and general hospital services&#151;the services that they have enjoyed for some years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para41"><a name="stpa_176">In setting the scene for this debate, it is important that we remember that staff are working hard in our hospitals throughout Shropshire and in Telford and the Wrekin; they do an incredible job and I pay tribute to them today. It is important that we manage this debate carefully, so we can sustain their morale and ensure that they continue to provide high-quality services to people at the front line. They deserve our thanks and I am sure that colleagues will join me in passing those on today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para42"><a name="stpa_177">It is also important to say that the two main acute hospitals are meeting six of the seven national targets laid down by the Government. They are meeting their access targets on in-patients and out-patients, 98 per cent. of people visiting accident and emergency are seen within four hours, and they are on-target in terms of beating MRSA. On cancer, they are meeting the 14, 31 and 62-day targets. They are following the Government&#039;s agenda on booking and they are signed up for &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;. The only area in which they are failing is financial balance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para43"><a name="stpa_178">The hon. Member for Ludlow outlined in some detail a story&#151;it almost sounded like fiction&#151;about the management, and the financial mismanagement, of the health economy in Shropshire in recent years. I am 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 463WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
delighted that we have a new chief executive and management team. Tom Taylor is a dynamic individual with whom all Shropshire Members can do business. He takes a constructive approach to what is happening in the local health economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para44"><a name="stpa_179">It is important to consider some of the conclusions that the strategic review document has come up with. That document was produced on behalf of all the health trusts in the county. It concluded that the primary care trusts spend &#163;20 million less than the national average on general acute and accident and emergency services, and &#163;20 million more than the national average on community services and primary care. That is a real challenge. In examining the wider health economy, we must ensure both that primary care services and community based services are extremely efficient, and that our general acute and accident and emergency services are receiving the funding that they deserve. That is important in the context of the community hospitals debate, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I am concerned that if community hospitals close, we will not be able to deal with some of the bed-blocking problems that will arise in the acute sector. I hope we will not pursue that false economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para45"><a name="stpa_180">The other conclusions of the strategic review of the two acute hospitals are that they are low-cost providers per patient, above-average performers in terms of patient activity, and their commissioners are driving down acute sector income. Interestingly, however, the hospitalisation rate in the county is still rising. Too many people are coming into the acute hospitals and not being dealt with in the community. That is a real challenge for us in terms of primary care.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para46"><a name="stpa_181">It is also true to say that the two acute hospitals do not recover all the income for the work that they do. Under payment by results, our local hospitals would gain significantly, but we have a problem because we cannot wait for full implementation of payment by results. We have to sort out the financial issues as they are presented to us now.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para47"><a name="stpa_182">The hon. Member for Ludlow went through a series of options produced by Finnamore, the financial consultants, in relation to the health economy in Shropshire and in Telford and the Wrekin. The options referred to a range of issues, including reconfiguration, rationalisation of sites and referral management&#151;there is a raft of proposals. Finnamore produced what it called an abacus of options&nbsp;&nbsp;between lower and upper quartile levels of savings from each of those options. We need to pursue those options, but we have to bear several points in mind. Patient services must come first. There must be a more open dialogue within the county about what is happening in the health service in Shropshire&#151;clearly there has not been the openness with elected representatives, officials and the public that we deserve and that would help us to understand what is happening.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para48"><a name="stpa_183">The county must retain two district general hospitals with A and E services. I am delighted to say that, a week last Monday, at a meeting I attended with the Telford and Wrekin senior citizens forum, Tom Taylor, the chief executive of the acute hospital trust, made it clear that he is committed to trying to ensure that we retain those 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
two hospitals with their A and E services. That is crucial. I should particularly like to hear the Minister&#039;s comments on that in her winding-up speech.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para49"><a name="stpa_184">In any examination of the county&#039;s health economy, it is important that there is an understanding of the population trends that I outlined at the beginning of my speech. Telford people should receive the services that they deserve because it is a growing town and the largest population centre in the county.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para50"><a name="stpa_185">We should focus on the points made by the hon. Member for Ludlow about options for resolving the financial crisis. I hope that the Minister will say something about historic debt, which we should reconsider. We must have greater brokerage on the time scale for the repayment of debt on which the acute hospital sector and, indeed, the PCT are working.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para51"><a name="stpa_186">The hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about prescription charges is also important. We must get the maximum level of efficiencies and administration savings out of the system if we are to protect our acute and community hospitals and our primary care services. All five of the Shropshire Members want to achieve that.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60125h03_spnew22"><b> Mark Pritchard  (The Wrekin)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) on securing the debate. I shall have to make my 10-minute speech in four minutes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para52"><a name="stpa_187">I shall address directly some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright). He talked about sustaining staff morale. I suggest that one of the best ways of doing that is to retain existing services and allow staff to retain their jobs. We know that 280 jobs are under threat, including those of front-line staff such as doctors and nurses. That would, of course, affect front-line patient care. He also said that patient services must come first. Of course, both back-office support and front-line staff such as doctors and nurses are needed to ensure that patients continue to come first.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para53"><a name="stpa_188">I do not believe that Health Ministers lie awake at night wondering how they can make life more difficult for patients or our constituents in Shropshire. The Government have introduced many well intentioned reforms to the health service, but unfortunately things have gone badly wrong across the country. There is no doubt that changes are needed to health care provision and the way in which customers, consumers and clients of health care view and receive it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para54"><a name="stpa_189">We have discussed increasing primary care and care in the community, or community care, and about having super-GP surgeries and a beefed up and thriving independent sector. That is fine in principle, but only if those things are in place before services at the acute hospitals are reduced. In my constituency, in which the Princess Royal hospital is located, we do not have super-GP surgeries or a thriving independent sector and&#151;unlike Ludlow&#151;we do not have community hospitals, although some of my Albrighton constituents use the community hospital in Bridgnorth.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 465WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para55"><a name="stpa_190">It would be easy for Members to say that we should have one or the other, but given the sparsity of the population and the size of Shropshire, which is the largest inland county in England, I think that we need both. One might say that that is unreasonable, but is it? Every week we hear the Prime Minister remind Members from the Dispatch Box that all the money from tax rises has gone to improve health and public services, particularly education and the health service. A lot of my constituents are saying, &quot;Where has all the money gone? We have paid the taxes. We deserve the health services.&quot; Now, they are being asked to accept that they will have to pay more taxes over a long period but get fewer health services in return. It is a massive swindle of the taxpayers of Shropshire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para56"><a name="stpa_191">The changes will affect patient care. I should like to ask the Minister some brief questions. Can she guarantee that the accident and emergency unit at the Princess Royal hospital will remain consultant-led, not nurse-led? The hon. Member for Telford supported the principle of an accident and emergency unit and referred to the comments of the trust&#039;s chief executive that one will be retained at the Princess Royal, but nowhere has it been said that there is a cast iron guarantee that that unit will be consultant-led. It is no good people in the most densely populated part of the county&#151;Telford and Wrekin&#151;only having a nurse to patch them up, when for very serious incidents people have to be rushed by blue-light ambulance down to Shrewsbury. In extremis that will cost lives. If someone has a heart attack in Shifnal, Newport or Wellington in my constituency, by the time they get to Shrewsbury they may well be dead. That is hardly patient care.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para57"><a name="stpa_192">Will the Government consider a debate on whether the two hospital trusts should de-merge? Has it worked? If it has not, let us have a mature debate about it. Let us de-merge the hospital trusts. It is a large county as hon. Members have said. We are a large county and we deserve a full district general hospital in both Telford and Shrewsbury and the other hospitals too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para58"><a name="stpa_193">Finally, can the Minister give a guarantee that there will be no land disposals at the Princess Royal hospital that would jeopardise plans for the new Severn hospice or the mental health unit that may well be placed on the site of the hospital? In conclusion, the Government&#039;s plans to rationalise, which is a euphemism for cutting services at the Princess Royal, are flawed. They will cost lives. I humbly ask the Government to rethink in the interests of patients and, indeed, their own interests, given that Telford is now a marginal seat.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60125h03_spnew23"><b> Daniel Kawczynski  (Shrewsbury and Atcham)</b>  (Con): I feel extremely passionately about this issue, but the length of the debate has obviously forced me to shorten my speech. The Minister will know that I always treat Ministers with respect and courtesy, but I find it very difficult to do so today because of the way the situation is developing in Shrewsbury. We have excellent clinical efficiency at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital. Last week I brought Tom Taylor, the chief executive, to a meeting with the Secretary of State, who was delighted and surprised that the Royal Shrewsbury hospital had met the target of 62 days for cancer treatment because, as she admitted, it is an extremely difficult target to meet.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 466WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para59"><a name="stpa_194">Our problem is the hospital&#039;s &#163;36 million debt, to which my hon. Friends have referred. I believe&#151;I put this point as strongly as I can to the Minister&#151;that a former chief executive got the job with a fake CV. The finance director covered up the losses, and he has had to go as well. Where are the checks and balances, if such a major hospital can be run by people who have fake CVs, and people who cover up debts? It is truly astounding. Surely the Minister must take some responsibility for the situation at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital. We would benefit to the tune of &#163;15.3 million every year if we had foundation trust status&#151;and the only thing preventing us from securing that status is our debts. I lay the blame for those on the Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para60"><a name="stpa_195">I should like to raise two more points. Some specialist nurses came to see me at my surgery on Saturday. I shall not reveal what type of specialist nurses they are, for fear of revealing their identities. Many people who work for the NHS and come to speak to MPs are petrified of telling us about their experiences, because of the culture in which, if someone dares to criticise the Government, the Government will come down on them like a ton of bricks and they will lose their jobs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para61"><a name="stpa_196">The nurses who came to see me said, &quot;Look, we&#039;re being paid on band 6 for our job, but if we go 15 miles down the road to Wolverhampton the same job is band 7.&quot; Therefore, they would be paid an extra &#163;5,000 a year if they made a 15-mile journey every day, left the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and went to work in Wolverhampton. That is a huge threat to us in Shrewsbury, because if those people can be paid &#163;5,000 a year more for doing the same job in Wolverhampton, they are likely to be poached, leave the Royal Shrewsbury hospital and go to Wolverhampton. That is all part and parcel of the regionalisation of health care provision.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para62"><a name="stpa_197">In Shrewsbury a cancer clinical review is under way, and the talk is that although we are brilliant at cancer provision in Shrewsbury, the services could be moved to Stoke or Wolverhampton because the Government want larger catchment areas for those services. That is a tremendous threat, and I should like the Minister to look into it. I shall, of course, fight any proposals to move cancer services away from the Royal Shrewsbury hospital to Stoke and Wolverhampton. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) knows, it is not just my constituents who use the hospital. People all the way to Aberystwyth, on the Irish sea, come across the border to use it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para63"><a name="stpa_198">I want to keep my remarks within the time that you specified, Mr. Gale, so this will be my final point; it is for members of the public as well as hon. Members. I have just been visited by representatives of the Parkinson&#039;s Disease Society and other organisations. There are two neurologists in our two hospitals, for the whole of Shropshire&#151;an area covering 750,000 people, if mid-Wales is included. In Germany an area of that size would have 20 neurologists, and in France it would have nine. I should like the Minister to take that point on board. Shropshire cannot survive long term with two neurologists to cover such a large area.

<a name="60125h03_para64"><a name="stpa_199">Before Christmas I went to a public meeting in Whitchurch, the town where I was born. There were 500 in the hall and at least 100 outside, standing in the cold. We had a petition, which my hon. Friend and I handed in last week, with 10,000 signatures&#151;and it is growing, so I have not put it behind the Speaker&#039;s Chair. We had a march, with more than 2,000 people, on a freezing cold Saturday morning. That is an expression of feeling about the importance of primary care to my constituents, which cannot be ignored. We had representatives from Market Drayton, Wem, Ellesmere and Audlem, over the border in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#039;Brien).

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para65"><a name="stpa_200">Those people are not just nimbys who want to hang on to their services. They have a real case. To bring the subject down to earth, I shall outline the example of Mrs. Schofield. She had a near fatal accident and was in an acute hospital for three months. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;If I had had to stay in my acute bed for a further three months, this would have cost double the amount for my bed alone and added to the hospital waiting lists; I cannot see how, on this basis, closing our Community Hospital will save money. The local hospitals in this area i.e .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Royal Shrewsbury and The Princess Royal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will end up with dozens of &#039;bed blockers&#039; because once the small community hospitals have been closed there will be nowhere to send the patients for rehabilitation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para66"><a name="stpa_201">Rehabilitation is vital. Mrs. Schofield had four months more rehabilitation in Whitchurch community hospital, and as she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;I could not physically have undertaken this journey&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para67"><a name="stpa_202">to Shrewsbury&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;as my muscles were weak from four months inactivity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para68"><a name="stpa_203">That is a quick glimpse of the sort of service that those primary care hospitals offer. They take the pressure off the district general hospitals about which other hon. Members have spoken so eloquently.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para69"><a name="stpa_204">That is flagged up in the famous Finnamore report, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;An alternative approach to the community hospitals has been discussed that maximises the utilisation of community hospitals.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para70"><a name="stpa_205">But, incredibly, it then says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;The financial implication of this approach has not been modelled at this stage but this could be carried out at the detailed option development stage.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para71"><a name="stpa_206">May we have a cast-iron guarantee that there will be a real study of the value of the community hospitals? My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow flushed out the fact that the Minister does not have a clue what the comparative costs of running primary care and acute care are. Will she take up my suggestion, which was proposed by doctors whom I met over Christmas, that social services should run the hospitals? We know that the PCTs will not be able to be providers and that there is already 93 per cent., and sometimes 99 per cent., bed occupancy in Whitchurch. If there was better liaison with social services and better co-ordination, the needs of someone who has had a fall, or who wants a lift, a commode or another piece of equipment could be met more efficiently by the community hospitals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para72"><a name="stpa_207">I hope that the Minister gets the message. It is absolutely out of the question to consider the option of saving &#163;800,000 a year, which is a completely bogus 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 468WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
figure in my opinion. It is politically a non-starter, and I would like the Minister to say today that she accepts that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para73"><a name="stpa_208">The Minister knows about my patch. She kindly met doctors from Ellesmere and Wem in July, who told her that with better primary care centres they could reduce referrals to the expensive acute hospitals, where costs are running up, by 20 per cent. The doctors gave her a telling example: diabetes will double in the next 20 to 30 years, and whereas 75 per cent. of diabetics in Shropshire are treated by GPs, in Birmingham 75 per cent. of diabetics are treated in district general hospitals. It is impossible to imagine the impact on the two main acute hospitals if the ratio for treating diabetes, let alone any other ailment, were the same as that in Birmingham.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para74"><a name="stpa_209">As for the financial position, we touched on savings, which were flagged up in the report and show possible productivity gains of &#163;10 million; the possible figure for prescribing is &#163;10 million, for referral management &#163;2.5 million, and for reconfiguration &#163;2.1 million. My deal is that for enhanced primary care, and an absolute guarantee not to touch the community hospitals, I would go along with any sensible efficiency savings within the two main acute sites, so long as they did not reduce services. To my constituents it would not matter which of those sites provided the services, because in either case it is a 15-mile drive.

<p>
<a name="60125h03_para75"><a name="stpa_210">I was alarmed by a report in <i>The Sun</i> by George Pascoe-Watson, under the headline &quot;Blitz on NHS big spenders&quot;. It stated:

It is laughable that we had a chief executive who had faked getting a first at Nottingham university. We may not like what we hear from Tom Taylor, but he tells it to us as it is, because he has had time to get a grip on the problems. The last thing we want now is a lot of expensive busybodies from KPMG muddling around with yet more meetings. If anybody understands how to sort out the mess it is Tom Taylor and his team.

<a name="60125h03_para79"><a name="stpa_214">Finally, the picture is not all gloom. There is a world-class hospital in my constituency at Gobowen, which is in the top tier for cleanliness and already has three-star status. There were only two MRSA cases per 10,000 patients at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt hospital, which is going for foundation status. However, one of the brakes on gaining that status is the fact that it needs

clarification of the tariff for work done to put right mistakes made in other orthopaedic hospitals. Only four orthopaedic hospitals in the country can do that work, and my local hospital needs to know the details. May I bring the chairman and the chief executive to see the relevant Minister to discuss this matter so that they can push on and get foundation status? I invite the Minister to come to Shropshire at any time, and we will show her the value of primary care, and how to take pressure off the expensive acute hospitals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para80"><a name="stpa_215">First, may I ask the Minister about the credentials and experience of Finnamore consultants? For Worcestershire they have suggested some quite ridiculous changes, which the acute trust immediately threw out and will not include in its paper. Their suggestions for community hospitals are completely ridiculous: they are not common sense, they do not make economic sense and they do not fit in with Government guidelines on keeping the NHS local, which are well worth referring to.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para81"><a name="stpa_216">The only other thing that I shall say in the brief time available to me is how pleased I was to hear that the hon. Members representing the acute hospitals in Shrewsbury and Telford did not try to paint a picture suggesting that we should protect acute services at the cost of closing community hospitals&#151;something that was tried in Worcestershire.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para82"><a name="stpa_217">I should also like to tell the hon. Members for Telford (David Wright) and for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) about an article by Andy Black, the well-known hospital management consultant, which appeared in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>in January 2004. In it, he said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;If the price of moving the complex emergency to an appropriate centre of expertise is that this patient is accompanied by another nine or 10 patients who are not complex acute cases then another set of problems is launched.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="60125h03_para85"><a name="stpa_220">On 13 April 1998, the Royal Shrewsbury hospital saved my life. I had a very serious paragliding accident, in which I fell about 30 m, broke my back in 12 places and smashed my ribs, sternum and jaw. It was a 64-mile journey to the Royal Shrewsbury, partly by car, but primarily by ambulance, and there is no doubt that the hospital&#039;s quick, expedient and highly professional service prevented me from dying that day. As a result, I am forever in its debt. It so happens that it was me who had that experience, but thousands of other individuals in Shropshire could have a similar one. I am sure that such people would testify to the benefits and importance of community hospitals. Indeed, it was Llanidloes hospital that initially stabilised my condition so that I could travel the remaining 48 miles in the ambulance to Shrewsbury.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para86"><a name="stpa_221">Hon. Members are therefore completely right to talk about the essential nature of what could be described as a hub-and-spokes infrastructure. The district general hospitals provide certain facilities&#151;they have been accurately described, so I do not need to repeat them&#151;while the community hospitals play an essential supporting role. It is little wonder, then, that so many thousands of people marched&#151;once again, on a cross-party basis&#151;to defend the facilities in Shropshire, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ludlow for working with Matthew Green and Labour representatives on those marches to show that this is not a party political issue, but a people political issue. In that sense, the Minister can be in no doubt that no one is trying to score points off the Government&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> To be precise, I am not trying to score points off the Government. People are, however, working hard in the interests of those whom we all represent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para87"><a name="stpa_222">On the specifics, there is no question but that there was a cover-up. Members of Parliament and others were misled about the financial circumstances in the trust and in Shropshire, to such an extent that one would not need parliamentary privilege to say so. Indeed, it was a scandal, and the individuals concerned would not dare to sue anyone who condemned them unreservedly for playing roulette with the services in the area. As has been said, Tom Taylor has already secured the trust and recognition of hon. Members from all parties in a way that his predecessor did not. I have a slight difference of opinion about who is to blame for that, but the Minister will be delighted to know that I do not blame her. It would be difficult for her to keep such a detailed eye on various appointments throughout the country that she or, indeed, many of the rest of us, would spot a fake CV or someone who was utterly hell bent on getting a job through false means.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para88"><a name="stpa_223">However, as the body politic, it is our responsibility to make sure that the citizens who evidently were not responsible for the debt problems do not end up being the victims of those debts. Others have already described the consequences of the debts and I hope that the Minister will take seriously our worries that, in Tom Taylor&#039;s efforts to resolve the enormous eight-figure debt, he is not forced to compromise the services that have so eloquently been described by others today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para89"><a name="stpa_224">Will the Minister respond to the suggestions either to write off the debt or to renegotiate the repayment period for the reasons that have been given? Secondly, will she comment on the hub-and-spokes arrangement that is so important in rural areas and which has done so much 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
good for individuals? I wish to highlight the importance of recognising that it is cheaper to put people into a community hospital bed to recuperate than it is to force them to go to a district general hospital because of the lack of community hospital spaces. Moreover, maternity units themselves are highly treasured by the communities and, once again, ease a further burden on the district general hospitals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para90"><a name="stpa_225">In non-technical language, community hospitals do lots of bits that do not have to go to the big hospitals. That is one reason why they are cheaper, why they are loved by local people and why I believe that they aid convalescence, especially for the elderly. They find it easier and less stressful to be in the more homely environment of a community hospital where their relatives and friends can visit them more easily than being transported many tens of miles on occasion to a hospital that, by its nature, will tend to be a less personal and slightly more sterile environment in which to recover.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para91"><a name="stpa_226">My third and final point concerns the various alternatives to save money, one of which is productivity savings. The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) estimates that &#163;10 million could be saved. I consider that perhaps &#163;7.5 million could be saved, but let us recognise that we are to some extent splitting hairs on the detail because, if the Minister cannot provide us with an assurance that the Government will be amenable to helping us resolve such a crushing debt problem in other ways, services will necessarily need to be cut. It is not Tom Taylor&#039;s fault. His only crime is to be honest with the public and the politicians. It is not the public&#039;s fault. Their only crime is to live in an area that has had its health services mishandled to some extent and, by virtue of rurality, they pay more for health services because there is no other way in rural areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para92"><a name="stpa_227">As we hear the Minister&#039;s response, we will be listening to see if she is willing to debate the facilities with us. There is no downside for the hon. Lady in working with us on a cross-party basis. There is an enormous downside for the local population if she does not. I think that she can show that the Government are serious about the promises that they have made repeatedly on the Floor of the House to work in the interests of the public and to ensure that the significant investments that they have made in the health service are actually used to enhance it, a situation that is the antithesis of what faces Shropshire at the moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para93"><a name="stpa_228">In thanking the Minister in advance for acceding to every request that we make today, I also invite her to visit the facilities that we are discussing. She would perhaps be whinged at a little bit, but she would also be praised a lot for being willing to go and see what we are discussing. She could be a heroine and if she takes that route, we will be the first to sing her praises.

Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne), who secured this important debate. All four of my Shropshire hon. Friends, as well as the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)&#151;together they represent all the constituencies in

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Shropshire&#151;have championed and campaigned for their constituents and local health services without fear or favour. I should declare that I am a patron of CHANT, which was referred to earlier.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para94"><a name="stpa_229">As we heard in the outstandingly powerful speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, there are four trusts responsible for health care in Shropshire, under the umbrella of the Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority: the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, covering the two hospitals; Shropshire County primary care trust; Telford and Wrekin PCT; and the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust, Oswestry&#039;s world-famous orthopaedic hospital.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para95"><a name="stpa_230">Shropshire&#039;s financial problems, which arose across those four trusts, consist of a &#163;36 million accumulated debt, which, by Government edict, must be paid off over the next three years. That will necessitate instalments of &#163;12 million per annum, and a current annual running loss of &#163;25 million. That will be &#163;18 million from the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust&#151;today announced as being one of the 18 that needs urgent intervention, alongside my local PCT in west Cheshire&#151;and &#163;7 million from the Shropshire County PCT, which the Government requires to be in balance by April 2007. On those figures, the trust needs to find &#163;37 million a year after current spending.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para96"><a name="stpa_231">Finnamore Management Consultants, already rightly doubted in an interesting contribution by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), has put together a report on how to achieve those savings from a current total budget of &#163;400 million. Its findings would amount to a cut in Shropshire&#039;s health funding of an eye-watering 10 per cent. in each of the next three years. Whatever the Minister says, not one Member of this House&#151;let alone one citizen of Shropshire, south Cheshire in my constituency or mid-Wales&#151;will believe that a cut of that size will not lead directly to deep, harsh cuts in patient services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para97"><a name="stpa_232">So why is it the Government&#039;s fault and liability that the beleaguered patients of Shropshire have to suffer that bill and lost patient and health services? As we heard, the chief executive of the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust was sacked for incompetence, and was subsequently found to be a fraud. The financial director has gone, too, as he was complicit, and the Labour crony chairman has also chosen to resign. That, to start with, is pretty damning evidence when looking for where liability lies. That is all the more important as it is in that trust that the vast bulk of the deficits were allowed to balloon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para98"><a name="stpa_233">The two PCTs are running at a deficit of &#163;2 million, the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust is running at a deficit of &#163;5 million, but the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust is running at a deficit of &#163;29 million. The largest debt in Shropshire comes from the trust that was administered by a fraud. In substance, the position is not changed by the Government&#039;s new payment-by-results regime, which shifts &#163;15 million per annum of the acute trust&#039;s annual running costs to the PCTs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para99"><a name="stpa_234">Who, it is fair to ask, designed the structure? Who set up the processes and the standards for the appointment of the key people at the top of the very organisation that incurred the debt, people who have now all gone? Who 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 473WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
set the targets by which those people were judged and had to manage? The answer to all those questions is clear: we need look no further than the Department of Health, the Minister and her predecessors under this Government. In addition, in the light of the confused expectations that the historical debt would be assumed by central Government, why should the people of Shropshire and the dedicated front-line staff&#151;doctors, nurses and many others, including some of the managers&#151;have to pick up the tab of Government and Whitehall failings?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para100"><a name="stpa_235">The Government must own up to their serious failings in respect of the people of Shropshire, and they must recognise that the contingency fund is there as a Government self-insurance policy&#151;albeit that it uses taxpayers&#039; money, centrally&#151;to fund its contingent liabilities. This is a contingency, as it would be in any walk of life. There has been a manifest failure of Government policy, and of the processes ensuring the provision of adequately managed patient services for the people of Shropshire, my constituents in south-west Cheshire, and people across the border in Wales, notwithstanding the incredible confusion that devolution throws up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para101"><a name="stpa_236">There is a clear line of responsibility, but this Government seek instead to duck their liability, and to pressure the local trusts and force them to look in on themselves. Thus to save &#163;37 million per annum, Finnamore has suggested various cuts. One is to close or to threaten the community hospitals at Bishop&#039;s Castle, Ludlow, Bridgnorth and Whitchurch. Whitchurch serves hundreds if not thousands of my constituents in Marbury, Malpas, Tushingham, Cholmondeley and the whole southern district of Eddisbury.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para102"><a name="stpa_237">Will the Minister say whether she is aware of the enormous public outcry and the outrage at the idea of closing those hospitals? Using the very apt analogy of the hub and spoke that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) just used, has the Minister noticed that the whole wheel comes off if one takes away the spokes?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para103"><a name="stpa_238">Given the petitions of more than 10,000 names being presented to the Secretary of State, crowded public meetings and huge marches&#151;I pay tribute to my colleagues and others for their campaigning&#151;this simply does not make political sense. Nor does it make financial sense. It saves only a notional and, as we have heard, largely illusory &#163;2.4 million a year of the total amount required, despite an estimated net figure, but excluding the intended consequences, let alone the unintended ones that we can all predict and which were very ably outlined earlier in this important debate. That will put even more pressure on the already hard-pressed acute trust.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para104"><a name="stpa_239">The proposal certainly does not make medical sense. The long-term rehabilitation and mental health units lost will exacerbate, not reduce, the problem. As we know, because of the misdirection and the mismanagement engendered by this Government, their agencies, their quangos and other creatures, 80 of the 322 community hospitals in this country are under threat of closure so that trusts throughout England can meet their financial deficits. That is a direct hit on patient services, and is laid firmly at the Government&#039;s door.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 474WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para105"><a name="stpa_240">So far as Shropshire is concerned, if the Minister feels that she cannot, without the Chancellor&#039;s sanction, access the contingent fund to meet the Government&#039;s own liabilities&#151;I have outlined the chain of causation&#151;at the very least will she now stand up and undertake to extend the payback period to 10 years? In the best-case scenario, &#163;25 million of annual savings can be attained without closing these valuable community hospitals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para106"><a name="stpa_241">Increasing efficiency to improve performance to the upper quartile level in the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt trust and in the acute trust will yield savings of about &#163;5 million in the former and up to &#163;7.5 million in the latter. An additional &#163;2.5 million could be saved by improving efficiency in the operating theatres of the acute trust. Further, a reduction in over-prescribing, in the light of a survey of GPs in Shropshire who recognise the extent of this inefficiency, would lead to a saving of approximately &#163;10 million a year. I am very grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow for conducting that survey.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para107"><a name="stpa_242">There is the &#163;25 million. The Government could then write off the &#163;12 million in historic debt for which they are responsible, and the job would be done. Patient services and community hospitals would be saved, thanks to the support of all the Shropshire MPs of all parties. There just may be a chance of making good the ills of the Government&#039;s own making without inflicting real cuts on the front-line patient services for the people of Shropshire, all of whom have been so ably represented in the Chamber today in this crucial and urgent debate. We just have to hope that the Minister has both listened and learned.

That, frankly, is why the Government make the national health service such a high priority.

<a name="60125h03_para108"><a name="stpa_243">My hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright) paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of NHS staff in the local area. I certainly add my thanks to those staff for their hard work. I totally reject the allegation made by the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) that we would go around attacking people if they complained about conditions. Indeed, the introduction of the whistleblowers charter has indicated our view that that attitude is not the right one at all. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik) brought his own experiences to the debate to illustrate the importance of our health services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para109"><a name="stpa_244">I certainly recognise that the health community in Shropshire faces a challenging financial situation; there is no doubt about that. I am not going to reel off figures on doctors and nurses as the hon. Member for Ludlow said I might, but I point out that the increases in funding in recent years have meant that the two PCTs&#151;Shropshire County and Telford and Wrekin&#151;are receiving record levels of resources.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para110"><a name="stpa_245">This year, Shropshire County primary care trust has been allocated &#163;276 million, a cash increase of &#163;23&nbsp;million on the previous year. That kind of increase

<br>&nbsp;<br>
has been made available locally and will continue, to reach something like 19 per cent. over the two years within the local area. I think that Telford and Wrekin&#039;s percentage increase was the eleventh largest in the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para111"><a name="stpa_246">That is some of the background to the new investment. I hope hon. Members accept that; the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire was kind enough to acknowledge it. However, there is still a grave difficulty with the financial challenges faced locally. One of the major factors in the financial position is the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, whose end-of-financial-year deficit could be something like &#163;29&nbsp;million.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para112"><a name="stpa_247">As the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O&#039;Brien) said, there has been poor financial governance at that trust. That view was backed up by the external auditors&#039; investigation and the strategic health authority&#039;s own independent report, published on 27 October last year, that made 35 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the SHA and the trust. I am glad to see that the trust has put together an action plan to meet the recommendations. As many hon. Members said, a new management team is in place. It was heartening to hear hon. Members praise the new chief executive, who has taken over in what are obviously difficult circumstances.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para113"><a name="stpa_248">Beyond that financial report, as hon. Members have said, a current review is taking place that has been commissioned jointly by Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust, Shropshire County PCT and Telford and Wrekin PCT. Hon. Members have talked about local interest in the services, and that indicates the importance of the decisions being taken at local level.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para114"><a name="stpa_249">It is important that people should be consulted about the options available and able to make their views known without some idea that, as some hon. Members have in a sense suggested, we from Whitehall and Westminster then overrule them. The whole principle is to make sure that transparent decisions are made at local level and that the priorities reflect the needs of the local community. In its initial work, to which many hon. Members have referred, Finnamore advanced a series of options for the future of health services in the county. The purpose of the report was to look at the baseline provision of services in the area, consider the options for long-term provision of quality services and financial balance, and look at the implications for each organisation and consider acute service provision, as well as community services. The work is being developed further. Some of the options may not be practical, but they have been included in the report for pre-consultation, to which hon. Members are responding. However, beyond that, the options can then be further developed with key stakeholders.

For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Telford and the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard) said that the chief executive of the PCT has, as I understand it, said publicly that he would like the accident and emergency departments at both hospitals to be retained. If that suggestion went forward, it would go through the public consultation process. My hon. Friend has had a long-standing dialogue with the chief executive on that matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para117"><a name="stpa_252">The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr.&nbsp;Paterson) mentioned community hospitals being handed over, perhaps, to local authority control. Under &quot;Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot;, we will make it possible for local authorities, acute trusts or the voluntary sector to manage community hospitals. However, I have to emphasise again that that would be a local decision. I understand, from the strategic health authority, that the current review is considering that as a possible option.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para118"><a name="stpa_253">I should like briefly to move on to the historic deficit and the idea that the Government should meet it. I hope that hon.

Simply to hand money over means that somewhere else in the NHS has to find it; there is no other place that it can come from. It is important to be honest when we are discussing that matter. That money would have to come from other areas.

<p>
<a name="60125h03_para119"><a name="stpa_254">Hon. Members talked about the period of paying back. The SHA has to consider the local health economy and look at ways to meet the financial balances. In some instances they can be extended, but that would be an SHA decision.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h03_para120"><a name="stpa_255">Finally, the turnaround teams that hon. Members have mentioned will be important in helping local trusts to manage some of the problems. I have visited places where teams have been working with staff and managers and I should like to reassure hon. Members that that should not be seen as a threat; that arrangement is to give assistance to sort out some of the problems about which hon. Members have talked.

<a name="60125h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Traffic Congestion (Manchester, Withington)</h3>


<a name="time_19">
<a name="60125h04_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_103"><a name="60125h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Leech  (Manchester, Withington)</b>  (LD): I thank Mr. Speaker for giving me the opportunity to raise the important issue of traffic congestion in my constituency. I also thank the Minister&#039;s office for contacting my office before the debate, so that the Minister could get a feel of what I wanted to say and respond to the issues that I shall raise. I accept that some of my points will be outside her area of responsibility, but I ask her to pass on my comments on issues beyond the subject of traffic.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para0"><a name="stpa_256">For the benefit of the Minister, it is worth my explaining briefly the geography of Manchester, Withington&#151;I could not tell the Minister the geography of her constituency, and I doubt whether she could tell me the geography of mine. The River Mersey forms a boundary to the south of Withington. That means that commuter traffic coming through my constituency towards central Manchester is channelled along a number of heavily congested roads throughout the constituency. One of those is Princess road, some stretches of which are also known as Princess parkway. It runs from the M56 all the way into the city centre. I have never seen this proved, but I am told that it is the busiest road outside the M25.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para1"><a name="stpa_257">All the main routes through my constituency to Manchester are heavily congested with cars, which has resulted in significant displacement of traffic from those major routes on to the more minor roads, such as Parrs Wood road in Didsbury. That has had a major effect on the safety of those roads, including for pedestrians and schoolchildren, because the roads simply were not designed to take the level of traffic that they now do.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para2"><a name="stpa_258">The problem is not confined to north to south routes, from the constituency to the city centre; there is also a major problem with traffic flow across the constituency. Many people not only live in south Manchester but work there, and they travel from east to west, to places such as Salford Quays, Stockport or Cheadle. That has resulted in a major strain on traffic flow, especially from Didsbury to Chorlton along Wilmslow road and Barlow Moor road. That has created gridlock through the district centre of Chorlton.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para3"><a name="stpa_259">The congestion has had a knock-on effect on the reliability of bus services, as they struggle to stick to timetables. That has dented public confidence in bus services in the constituency, so people have stopped using buses. It has also had a worrying effect on Chorlton district centre. Shop owners complain about losing business as shoppers actively avoid going through the district centre because of the congestion. That has quickened the decline of local shops, which are being replaced by evening trade businesses, such as bars, restaurants and takeaways, because traffic congestion does not have the same impact at night, and they can make money.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para4"><a name="stpa_260">It would be easy for me to argue that poor public transport and lack of investment is responsible for too many cars being on our roads, and all the congestion. The situation is not as straightforward as that, however. Deregulation of buses has certainly had a negative effect by creating more congestion, as gaps in the bus network 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 478WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have to be filled by people using cars, but it is also true that deregulation has increased bus services in parts of the constituency&#151;for instance, the Wilmslow road corridor, where people can get a bus every 10 seconds. That is an example of deregulation working. Unfortunately, the bus companies are not prepared to run decent bus services across the constituency, because it is far more cost-effective just to pile all their buses on to the routes that make them money. They expect to receive significant subsidies from the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority before running services east to west, and the PTA just does not have the funds available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para5"><a name="stpa_261">I shall give a couple of examples of deregulation clearly not working. The No. 46/47 circular service that runs through my constituency and into the city centre was profitable during the day, but in the end the bus company decided to cut the evening part of the service because it was not making any money. Of course, the knock-on effect of that is that people using the bus service in the morning to get across the constituency cannot get the bus back, so they have to make alternative arrangements for both journeys, which makes the bus less profitable in the morning as well. That has had an impact on passenger numbers, and the knock-on effect is that more people use cars.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para6"><a name="stpa_262">The other example is the No. 86 bus service, which ran from one of the most deprived estates in the whole of my constituency, through Chorlton and into the city centre. The section of the service from the estate to the centre of Chorlton was not profitable, because congestion meant that it was not running to time, so fewer people used it. That meant that over time the bus company just decided to reduce the level of service and run the vast majority of the services from the bus station, which meant that the few people who still wanted to use the bus from Arrowfield road&#151;from the estate&#151;lost confidence in the bus service. Rather than arriving every five or six minutes, the buses were supposed to arrive every 20 minutes; in fact, it was every half an hour, if people were lucky.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para7"><a name="stpa_263">Moving on from buses, I do not think that I could discuss congestion in my constituency without briefly mentioning the delays to phase 3 of Metrolink. In the past few years, lots of people have moved to Manchester, Withington because they genuinely believe that they are moving to an area where they will be close to a Metrolink station in the near future. Indeed, developers have been actively promoting property for sale on that basis. However, due to the recent uncertainty about funding and how long it is likely to be before we see Metrolink running through the constituency, one particular developer, as an alternative to promoting Metrolink as a reason to buy a property, is now offering a free car as part of the package when someone buys a flat in that development. Clearly, that will increase congestion.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para8"><a name="stpa_264">My final point on the causes of congestion is about overdevelopment in south Manchester. I accept that that is not within the Minister&#039;s area of responsibility, but my constituency has become a victim of its own success. People quite rightly want to live in south Manchester, because it is a great place to live and work. As the Member of Parliament for the area, I do not think that you would expect me to say anything else, Mr. Gale, but it really is a great place to live. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 479WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Unfortunately, because it has become so popular, every developer wants to build a block of flats on a postage stamp of land.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para9"><a name="stpa_265">Both the Government and the local council must bear some of the responsibility. For example, the council, in its wisdom, decided to sell a piece of land on Beech road, a heavily congested local road with serious parking problems. The council decided to sell off a car park and allow an additional block of flats to be built on a road that was already suffering from congestion and traffic problems. Similarly, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently approved the council&#039;s decision to redevelop an old school playing field and build yet more houses and flats.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para10"><a name="stpa_266">The problem is not just about the council selling off land, and the situation is not just the council&#039;s fault. It is also about developers taking advantage of weak planning laws that do not really protect local communities. In the Parrs Wood area of my constituency, a new entertainment complex was built a few years ago. That new development was undertaken in an already congested area, without first devising any sort of plan to deal with the traffic implications. When the council finally brought forward a scheme, we were told by the traffic officers that they could not come up with a scheme that solved the problem, but that the one that they had come up with was about as near as they could get. So it was a half-baked measure that annoyed all the local residents and did not deal with the traffic problem. More recently, just across the road from that same development, two further blocks of flats have been approved. The council&#039;s traffic office has already said that it cannot deal with the congestion problem in that area, yet two further blocks of flats and houses have been approved there, and they will cause extra traffic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para11"><a name="stpa_267">Those developments have been approved despite massive opposition locally. The planners argued that there was no justification for refusal, because the extra traffic would not significantly increase the amount of traffic already on the road. If traffic is at a standstill, however, any increase in traffic is unacceptable.
</p>






<p><a name="st_104"><a name="60125h04_spnew1"><b> Mark Hunter  (Cheadle)</b>  (LD): I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and I apologise for not being in my place when he started his speech. Does he accept that the knock-on effect of traffic congestion in surrounding constituencies such as my own also has a negative impact on the traffic problems suffered by constituents in his constituency of Manchester, Withington? Does he further accept that the completion of the A555 relief road, which heavily impacts on the neighbouring Cheadle and Hazel Grove constituencies, would help residents not only in those areas but in his area?
</p>






<p><a name="st_105"><a name="60125h04_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leech </b> : I agree with my hon. Friend, and it would have been useful if that link road had been completed one or two months ago when I was spending time travelling to Cheadle during the recent by-election there. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend heard my remarks about a number of people who live in south Manchester and travel to Stockport and Cheadle and back again. The relief road would have a significant impact on the traffic that goes along the residential streets between Cheadle and Didsbury.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 480WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para12"><a name="stpa_268">What is the solution? That is the million dollar question. The response to traffic congestion in my constituency has been the QBC&#151;the quality bus corridor. In theory, it is a good idea: encouraging bus companies to improve services and local people to use them by improving bus reliability and prioritising buses along Wilmslow road and Barlow Moor road. Unfortunately, the QBC alterations have resulted in more congestion on minor roads, where cars have been forced on to alternative routes. At Chorlton Cross, for instance, cars have been banned from turning right on to Barlow Moor road from Wilbraham road, to make it easier for buses to turn right. That has resulted in additional traffic on High lane, as cars use it as the alternative route.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para13"><a name="stpa_269">There has been no significant increase in bus services along the QBC route; in fact, later this week, the No. 46/47 Sunday service will be discontinued. The reality is that there is little incentive for bus companies to run services more frequently and to provide new routes, when those routes will never be as profitable as the north to south routes on the Wilmslow road corridor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para14"><a name="stpa_270">People and passenger transport authorities throughout the country require and support a level of regulatory control, so that transport authorities can decide what bus services will be provided. The current system of subsidised services is inadequate for the provision of a comprehensive bus network. In order to get more people on to buses, we must consider how to make bus travel more attractive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para15"><a name="stpa_271">I do not always agree with Brian Souter, the head of Stagecoach, but he rightly points out that we should consider bus park-and-ride schemes, which were very successful in my constituency during the Christmas period. However, outside that period there is not one single scheme. We must consider permanent park-and-ride schemes, so that people park outside Manchester and take the bus into the centre.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para16"><a name="stpa_272">The Government must also acknowledge that the best solution for south Manchester is Metrolink. Although the start-up costs can be high, time and again such a scheme has proved to be the most successful way of bringing about a significant modal shift away from the car. The fact that people move to be near to the Metrolink is testament to that, and the success of the Altrincham to Bury line proves it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para17"><a name="stpa_273">Unfortunately, I have serious reservations about current Government policy, in that it will not deliver Metrolink through to Chorlton and out to Didsbury without a commitment to road-user pricing. I seek further assurance from the Minister that additional Government money would not be dependent on road-user pricing. Manchester cannot go down that route until a decent network is in place to begin with.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para18"><a name="stpa_274">Finally, tighter regulation of buses and the investment of more money in Metrolink would help the situation but not completely solve the problem. The Government must accept that unless steps are taken to deal with the problem of overdevelopment and its effect on congestion, the problem will remain. Councils need to be given more powers to tackle areas of congestion, and I propose that local authorities should be given the option to introduce congestion zones in their development plans. Where congestion zones are set up, a developer would have to demonstrate that a proposed 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 481WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
development would not significantly increase traffic congestion, either through increased volume of traffic or as a result of additional traffic measures required to facilitate the development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para19"><a name="stpa_275">I trust that the Minister will pass on my comments to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on that point, and I look forward to her response.

<a name="60125h04_time1"><h5>4.16 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_106"><a name="60125h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Ms Karen Buck) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech) on securing the debate and on making some important points, a number of which I agree with, as I hope I shall make clear in my contribution. I shall raise with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister any issues that he has flagged up today that do not fall within the remit of the Department for Transport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para20"><a name="stpa_276">My Department worked closely with Greater Manchester in the development of the Greater Manchester integrated transport strategy. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that his constituency is in one of four priority corridor partnerships, which are being developed through work on the strategy with the transport innovation fund and through the local transport plan process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para21"><a name="stpa_277">Since 1997, we have more than doubled spending on transport infrastructure and invested substantially in public transport to provide greater choice. Greater Manchester has received a total transport allocation of &#163;823 million during this period and we need to ensure that this substantial investment is converted into real improvements that deliver real value for money. For 2006&#150;07, Greater Manchester received total block funding of &#163;68.62 million in the local transport capital settlement, with an additional &#163;7.358 million for major schemes and &#163;3.5 million through the transport infrastructure fund. That included &#163;6.744 million for the south-east Manchester multi-modal study. That investment reflects our recognition of the important role played by the Greater Manchester authorities. We will work closely with them in supporting improvements in services for all those who live and work in Greater Manchester.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para22"><a name="stpa_278">As the hon. Gentleman has said, in Manchester and in many towns and cities throughout the country, congestion is a growing problem. It is important that in developing strategies, whether they relate to public transport or the management of roads, we must consider not just the situation in 2006, but that of 10, 15 or 20 years in the future. The reliability of journeys in the context of increasingly congested roads is a growing problem. Manchester city suffers the second highest average delay time for drivers in the whole of the UK&#151;second only to London.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para23"><a name="stpa_279">It is a complex problem, varying from place to place, and with time of day. Although it is important that we increase capacity on some roads, we cannot solve the problem of congestion by simply building more and more roads. There is not the space to do it, especially in urban areas such as Manchester.
</p>






<p><a name="st_107"><a name="60125h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leech </b> : The Minister makes a valid point; in certain areas it is impossible to build extra roads, and I would not advocate the building of extra roads through 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 482WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
my constituency. The difficulty with the current infrastructure is that money may be spent on the quality bus corridor, but it is physically impossible to implement a scheme and create a lane in which buses can travel at reasonable speed without bringing everything else to a standstill. Houses would have to be knocked down to put in extra lanes so that buses could run freely. Money has been spent on the quality bus corridor but it has been pretty ineffective because there is not the space to provide the sort of scheme that is necessary.
</p>






<p><a name="st_108"><a name="60125h04_spnew4"><b> Ms Buck </b> : Without wishing to comment on the specific problem in that area, I accept that that can be the case. We are working in a very constrained space in Manchester as in other urban environments. That is why we need to look at these policies in the round.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para24"><a name="stpa_280">We are looking at a range of measures to tackle the problem, including the introduction of new congestion targets for urban areas, including Manchester, and for strategic roads. The targets are about improving journey time reliability and managing the impact of growing demand. There are a number of different approaches. One is the investment in technology to improve road management, particularly on the strategic roads where we are investing &#163;2 billion over the next three years. Technology can help to tackle congestion by increasing capacity during the times of day that it is most needed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para25"><a name="stpa_281">The Traffic Management Act 2004 has given local authorities powers to keep traffic flowing and to co-ordinate roadworks to minimise disruption on local roads. Since November, local authorities who have decriminalised parking powers, such as Manchester city council, have also been given powers to enforce bus lanes. That should give them a further incentive to provide bus priorities and ensure that they are working effectively.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para26"><a name="stpa_282">As a medium to longer-term solution, we have started a debate on road pricing. We have established the transport innovation fund to develop and pioneer smarter, innovative, transport strategies. In order to support work on scheme development by local transport authorities, we have earmarked &#163;18 million during the period 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. That is &#163;3 million in the current year, &#163;5 million next year and &#163;10 million in the third.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para27"><a name="stpa_283">We very much welcome the recent bid for TIF development funding from the Greater Manchester authorities and the recognition in Greater Manchester that bold approaches will be needed to tackle the future impacts of traffic congestion on the well-being of the city. They have been awarded &#163;1.25 million funding over three years to support the development of an innovative package to tackle congestion in the conurbation through a combination of hard-edged demand management and investment in public transport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para28"><a name="stpa_284">In any package of measures to tackle congestion, improved public transport is absolutely essential. As the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington emphasised, buses are the most used public transport option. They make up nearly two thirds of all public transport journeys in England.
</p>






<p><a name="st_109"><a name="60125h04_spnew5"><b> Mark Hunter </b> : I am sure that the Minister recognises that although the continued investment in bus services, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 483WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
and quality bus corridors in particular, is more than useful, the magnitude of the problem in Manchester requires seismic change if we are to get people out of their cars and on to public transport. To many of us coming from and representing constituencies in that area, that means investment in the Metrolink expansion. I wondered whether the Minister, in her response to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech), was going to say something more about the funding for Metrolink, on which so many of these solutions depend.
</p>






<p><a name="st_110"><a name="60125h04_spnew6"><b> Ms Buck </b> : I will comment briefly on Metrolink, but let me concentrate for a moment on buses. Compared with rail and light rail, buses are a flexible, low-cost option. They can contribute to tackling congestion, especially in conjunction with policies to restrain car use. We recognise that some conurbations such as Greater Manchester and others are experiencing difficulties with bus services. There are issues of bus quality; standards of reliability, frequency and cleanliness are not always met by some providers. I accept completely that we need to get that right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para29"><a name="stpa_285">We have no plans to return to the regulatory regime of the 1980s. Current options available to local authorities include voluntary and statutory partnerships, and there are a number of examples of good partnership working across the country. However, if local authorities are prepared to propose a comprehensive system for managing traffic demand, such as road pricing, we are prepared to consider introducing further measures to control bus services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para30"><a name="stpa_286">The current statutory framework for bus services gives local authorities a number of options to suit their local circumstances. One option is quality partnerships. Those cover both the provision of facilities by the local authority, such as bus priority measures, and improved standards of service by the bus operators. In a PTE area such as Manchester, the involvement of the city or borough authorities that manage the highways is crucial to the success of a quality partnership. Their participation is essential if traffic regulation orders are needed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para31"><a name="stpa_287">The quality bus corridor, which both hon. Gentlemen mentioned, is the main thrust behind the Greater Manchester bus strategy, as improvements in bus journey times have been recognised. I understand that there is a commitment to address quality bus corridor enforcement in 2006. On the Chorlton and Didsbury bus corridor, there has been some local opposition to the scheme, which is part of the south Manchester scheme being rolled out across that part of the conurbation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para32"><a name="stpa_288">In recognition of recent newspaper coverage and some of the residential concerns that were raised with local councillors, Manchester city council has undertaken a full review of the scheme by a team independent of those involved in the design. The report of that study has been presented to Councillor Neil Swannick, who is the executive member for highways and transportation. The scheme has addressed a wide range of transport issues including improving pedestrian facilities, defining parking and loading bays, reducing the impact of congestion and introducing the bus lane. Those using sustainable modes of transport will be better served as a result.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 484WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para33"><a name="stpa_289">Generally, non-statutory partnership agreements between operators and local authorities have proved successful in many areas, but there is room for improvement in bus services in other places. We are therefore discussing with bus operators and local authority representatives a range of options to make bus services more effective within the partnership framework.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para34"><a name="stpa_290">A more radical option is the quality contracts scheme, which can be approved only if it is the only practicable way of implementing bus strategy policies and is economic, efficient, effective and in the public interest. We recognise that those are exacting tests, but they are not impossible to meet. A guidance document was published in February last year for English local authorities. The range of measures, including legislation and other options being considered as part of a broader package of demand-met management measures, will give PTEs such as Greater Manchester a range of tools with which to ensure that their bus services in particular, as one strand of the public transport model, are developed effectively and complement other measures that may be necessary to deal with demand management.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para35"><a name="stpa_291">The Department and I recognise that buses are not the sole means of public transport to be promoted, and I echo the commitment of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to work with the Greater Manchester authority to ensure that light rail will continue to be a major part of the solution for Manchester, particularly for congestion. We recognise the achievements of Metrolink&#151;which has played an important role in supporting Manchester&#039;s economic success, carrying more than 19 million passengers a year&#151;and that it suffers from overcrowding. We have recently approved a scheme to renew and enhance the capacity of existing tram lines, and have committed &#163;520 million of public sector funds to Greater Manchester, subject to the development of a satisfactory plan for the areas covered by Metrolink phase 3. We will continue to work with Manchester on the proposals for tram extensions, which could be a major part of the solution for Manchester as part of the overall package of transport improvements, which includes other measures recognised by the Greater Manchester transport authorities, such as better buses and trains and better management of traffic levels.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para36"><a name="stpa_292">I hope that I have gone some way toward reassuring the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington that we recognise the seriousness of the issues that he has raised today, and that past, present and future investment, together with the innovative thinking that is going on at a national level, which we are encouraging local and passenger transport authorities to develop with the support of the innovation fund, give us a real opportunity to make what the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) rightly described as a seismic change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h04_para37"><a name="stpa_293">We need a change in thinking and investment. We need investment to be supported by choices that are sometimes difficult and involve brave political leadership to ensure that demand management plays its part alongside investment in additional public transport. We are working closely with a range of stakeholders nationally and regionally to address the problems that the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington outlined and will continue to do so.

<a name="time_21">
<a name="60125h05_time0"><h5>4.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_111"><a name="60125h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Iain Wright  (Hartlepool)</b>  (Lab): It is a real honour to secure an Adjournment debate on what I believe is a quality industry and one that is becoming increasingly so, especially in the area in which my constituency is located. I am also extremely pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) have joined me to discuss the important process industries on Teesside. I intend to cut short my speech to allow them to make contributions if they so wish.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para0"><a name="stpa_294">I want to do two things today. First, I wish to showcase the growing significance of the process industries to the regeneration of the Tees valley and the wider north-east and United Kingdom economy. Secondly, I wish to raise with my right hon. Friend the Minister several matters that the process industries on Teesside fear may hinder their ability to succeed and grow, and provide further prosperity in my constituency and elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para1"><a name="stpa_295">I outlined in a previous Adjournment debate how the north-east economy is still in the process of recovering from the seismic shocks of the decline of its heavy manufacturing base. A failure to innovate and an abandonment of the region and of manufacturing industry by central Government in the 1980s led to the rapid decline of much of what had made Teesside and the north-east prosperous since the Victorian era. It led to mass structural unemployment in the region. Between 1981 and 1997, some 110,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing&#151;90,000 of them in the Tees valley. That has contributed to the fact that the Tees valley economy now lags significantly behind the UK economy. As a sub-region, we have to grow much faster to catch up with the rest of the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para2"><a name="stpa_296">Yet, amid such a depressing tale, there is much to be positive about. Despite the massive knocks that the area received in the 1980s and 1990s, we still have a resilient manufacturing industry, of which firms such as Corus are a leading part. What has struck me recently is how, in a quiet way, a modern manufacturing sector has emerged from the Tees valley that is leading the world. The process industries are by far the single biggest wealth-generating industrial sector in the north-east, and certainly in the Tees valley. The sector employs directly about 14,000 people in the Tees valley, with an estimated 140,000 indirect jobs in the sub-region that are reliant on the process industries. Some 60 per cent. of the contribution to the regional economy made by the north-east process industries comes from the Tees valley and, bearing in mind the importance of the sector to the regional economy, some 15 per cent. of the entire north-east gross domestic product is derived from process industries in the Tees valley.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para3"><a name="stpa_297">The area has a range of firms that specialise in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and renewable energy. Firms such as Huntsman Petrochemicals provide high-quality chemicals and polyurethanes. Hart Biologicals in my constituency, led by Alby Pattison, is at the cutting edge of clinical diagnostic tools for hospital pathology laboratories. Firms such as Petroplus 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 486WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
manufacture petrochemicals and push the boundaries of the future application of biodiesel. Those firms are providing high-quality, well-paid jobs to the people of the Tees valley. In the process, they are producing high value-added goods that improve our quality of life and help to redress the environmental damage that has occurred over the past century, and which can be exported throughout the world, improving the wealth of this country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para4"><a name="stpa_298">The nature of the industry means that innovation has to be a constant part of life. Research and development is a major part of process industries and I hope that the Government continue to ensure that an appropriate environment is provided for in that sector. Thankfully, I think that that is happening. The Centre for Process Innovation has been established in the Tees valley, with the support of the regional development agency, One NorthEast, as a major UK national resource that is designed to stimulate innovation within the chemistry process sector. The CPI employs 50 researchers and has close links with universities and businesses to ensure that the process industry has the best chance of succeeding. After only 18 months in operation, it has developed innovation projects that are worth &#163;36 million for the Tees valley.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para5"><a name="stpa_299">New processes that are being developed include the continuous oscillatory baffle reactor. I am sure that that is the first time that that phrase has been used in Parliament, so I am proud of having said it. I have no idea what it does, so &quot;baffle&quot; is an appropriate word, but I know that the process quickens chemical reactions and makes industries on Teesside more efficient, and therefore more able to retain our competitive advantage over the rest of the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para6"><a name="stpa_300">The area of innovation about which I am the most excited is the development of renewable energy. Long-established skills in the region from the chemicals and oil industries make the Tees valley the best possible area to develop cutting-edge technology. Teesside is leading the way in the use of hydrogen to help to produce environmentally friendly energy, either through fuel cells producing lighting or as a substitute for petrol. Biomass technology is also being developed. SembCorp Utilities is building a &#163;60 million power station on the River Tees, which will use surplus timber from forests and recycled wood to generate carbon-neutral electricity, and Biofuels Corporation, with One NorthEast funding, is building a new facility at Seal sands on the Tees estuary to produce alternative fuel from rape seed oil.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para7"><a name="stpa_301">I have no doubt that with appropriate Government support the Tees valley will become in the next few years the most developed area for green energy not just in the UK, but in the world. I passionately hope that that status will produce well paid green jobs for the Tees valley, bringing the same prosperity to my area that Aberdeen saw from oil in the 1970s and 1980s, or that Teesside itself saw from heavy manufacturing in Victorian times.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para8"><a name="stpa_302">Despite all that good news, the sector hid its light under a bushel somewhat until recently. There appeared to be reticence about promoting the good work being undertaken. Thank goodness that is no longer the case. About 200 companies in the sector in the Tees valley have come together to form the north-east process industries cluster&#151;NEPIC. Under the chairmanship of Bob Coxon and with Dr. Stan Higgins as chief 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 487WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
executive, that group is promoting the sector and pursuing initiatives such as raising investment in overseas trade, productivity improvement, raising skill levels and closing the GDP gap between the north-east and the rest of the UK. Those activities are designed to ensure the sector&#039;s continuing development and worldwide status.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para9"><a name="stpa_303">I was lucky enough to attend the annual dinner of the north-east process industries cluster group last Friday in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. Some 420 people from the process industries attended the event. There was a positive buzz and a great deal of confidence about the future of the industry on Teesside, and a recognition that what is being done is world class and will make a growing contribution to the continuing economic renaissance of the Tees valley.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para10"><a name="stpa_304">Despite that, there are concerns that may hinder the process industry&#039;s progress. In winding up, will my right hon. Friend the Minister respond to those concerns, to ensure that the sector has the maximum opportunity to grow? The key concern relates to energy pricing. To me, that seems ironic given that a key pillar of the future of the process industries is indigenous energy regeneration. Many companies have seen gas and electricity prices double in the past 12 months. I understand that one company in the process industry on Teesside has seen its energy costs increase by &#163;12 million, putting part of its business operations into loss and thereby questioning its continuing viability. The firm has some 500 employees in Hartlepool and is a vital concern to me and to the economy of my constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para11"><a name="stpa_305">Energy costs have resulted in the closure of plants such as that owned by Terra Nitrogen in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South, which is next door to mine. That plant employed a large number of people from Hartlepool, who have written to me to express their concern. I am worried about the domino effect of Terra&#039;s closure. The firm supplied basic raw materials to a large number of other companies in the Tees valley and elsewhere. Those companies now rely on foreign supplies and tell me that if we experience a bad spell of weather, meaning that North sea tankers are unable to supply, a number of Teesside plants will shut down and might not reopen. The situation is unsustainable and detrimental to the prospects of development for the process industries on Teesside. Firms on Teesside hope to see a concerted effort by the Government to achieve forward price stability and equitable energy pricing with competitors in Europe. I urge my right hon. Friend to do what he can to ensure that companies in Teesside are competing on a level playing field with overseas firms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para12"><a name="stpa_306">Another concern is skills. The demographic profile of the process industry is not encouraging. Although the legacy of the old ICI plants at Billingham and Wilton provides an unprecedented degree of experience, it means that the average age of scientists and engineers is over 50. The industry has been unable to underpin its recent growth with an appropriate number of trainees.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para13"><a name="stpa_307">The news is not all bad. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Leanne Hart, a constituent of mine working for AMEC who is the chair of the north-east and Yorkshire young persons network. The aims of that network are to share good practice, promote skills in the industry and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 488WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
act as ambassadors for the sector. Despite her good work, and that of others, we still need to improve the attractiveness of modern apprenticeships. As a country, we also need to do more to help to steer young people contemplating university into science and engineering courses. Will my right hon. Friend respond to that point?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para14"><a name="stpa_308">Most crucially, to address the gap, I urge the establishment of a process industries national skills academy. Given that the Tees valley is the premier area for process industries in the UK, I ask that such an academy be based in the north-east, and of course I add that Hartlepool has a wide and attractive range of business premises where it could be located.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para15"><a name="stpa_309">My third and final point, which companies have raised with me, is the impact of European legislation, particularly the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals, known as REACH. Firms are concerned that the cost of implementing REACH will far outweigh the benefits. It is having a particular impact on a leading company in my constituency, Oxford Chemicals, led by Dr. Richard Smith. I have been told that the UK authorities are particularly zealous in ensuring compliance with REACH, in contrast, perhaps, with some of our European neighbours. I should be grateful if the Minister explained how he and his Department are working with the European Union to ensure a level playing field for our companies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para16"><a name="stpa_310">The process industries in the Tees valley are examples of how the UK is leading the global economy. Such products will become increasingly important in modern life, and the fact that Teesside is leading the way should produce enormous and sorely needed benefits to prosperity for our region. To fly to its maximum height, however, the sector requires Government assistance and facilitation, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will set out in his reply how that assistance will be provided.

<a name="60125h05_time1"><h5>4.41 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60125h05_spnew1"><b> Ms Dari Taylor  (Stockton, South)</b>  (Lab): It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright), and I congratulate him on securing the debate, which is both timely and valued.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para17"><a name="stpa_311">I wish to talk for a few moments about the north-east process industries cluster, which is an important group for us in the north-east. It employs in excess of 300,000 people, and produces more than 25 per cent. of the region&#039;s gross domestic product, which in effect is more than &#163;8 billion of the United Kingdom&#039;s GDP. Those figures show just how important that group of industries is. As my hon. Friend stated, it is a crucial part of the regeneration of the Tees valley, most significantly in my constituency. Like him, I should like to hear how the Minister proposes to support the continued development of the process industries cluster in the north-east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para18"><a name="stpa_312">Critically, the group not only employs well, but pays well. The Tees valley has the biggest petrochemical industry in the UK and the second biggest in Europe, and that is crucially valuable to us. Development and investment in that industry in the area demonstrate a growth in confidence, and the spiralling effect of that investment is seen across the whole of industry in the Tees valley.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para19"><a name="stpa_313">Teesport is an incredibly valuable port&#151;the second biggest in the UK. It is in the constituency of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
(Vera Baird), although its headquarters is in Middlesbrough. It is another very valuable piece of the whole kit of developing and delivering a new industrial structure for the north-east. I would greatly appreciate it if my right hon. Friend the Minister acknowledged that leaving Teesport out of the development of a national port strategy is profoundly wrong and very damaging for the north-east.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para20"><a name="stpa_314">In only three years, more than &#163;1 billion has been invested in the process industries cluster, and we have seen what that investment has achieved: the creation of 1,600 jobs. This is powerful and it needs to be appreciated. We need to acknowledge the risks that are being taken by the industrialists who deliver such things.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para21"><a name="stpa_315">I have so much more to say, but my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool has said it for us. There are concerns about energy and the age profile of our skilled engineers, which is over 50&#151;I personally think that that is a golden age, but I understand that we must have a younger profile for industry development&#151;and REACH is problematic, not because it is a regulatory document, but because in Britain we will put it together in terms of dots and commas and we are not confident that people in Europe will.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para22"><a name="stpa_316">We have a growing, vibrant, new tomorrow for the 21st century. We want that to be supported. I hope that the Minister, who is hearing the plea from all of us, will accept our statements. With a little support, we will move into the 21st century as we ended the 19th, and as we went through much of the 20th century&#151;with a vibrant region.


</p>



<a name="time_23">
<a name="60125h05_time2"><h5>4.45 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_113"><a name="60125h05_spnew2"><b> Vera Baird  (Redcar)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) for allowing me to express my support for the north-east process industry. I congratulate him on securing this debate and thank him for his generosity in being prepared to share it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para23"><a name="stpa_317">I attended the north-east process industries cluster&#151;NEPIC&#151;in London on 17 November, to which both my colleagues referred, which was launched by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Government Chief Whip. That body is intended to support the whole process industry, a major base of which is the Teesside chemical industry, and a large part of which, although by no means all of it, is based at the Wilton International complex in Redcar. I was pleased when NEPIC decided that it was going to put its headquarters at Wilton International as well. I have to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool that I am sure that we have one of those battle zones in Redcar, if he has one in Hartlepool, and I am sure that we are working it very hard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para24"><a name="stpa_318">Setting up NEPIC was an excellent move, because it merged the Teesside chemical initiative, which had been the Teesside chemical representative group, with the pharmaceutical groups and other related groups from further north in the county, around Tyneside and Northumberland, thereby potentially generating good links between industries that obviously have a commonality and providing them with an opportunity to help each other. I hope that that is a precursor of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2006 : Column 490WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
better links, generally, between Teesside and Tyneside, which have not always given each other the mutual support that they should.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para25"><a name="stpa_319">I want to speak briefly about a key partner for NEPIC in its endeavour to bring us a golden future. A major instrument of its future success is Teesport, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor), and which has recently been taken over by a consortium of investors called Endeavour Ports. It is the second largest port by volume and is&#151;it goes without saying&#151;in Redcar, where all good things are. Its new owners will support and continue the effort that has been commenced to establish and develop a deep sea container terminal at Teesport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para26"><a name="stpa_320">NEPIC estimates that between &#163;8 billion and &#163;10 billion of investment should be pumped into the process industries in the north-east in the next 10 years. Teesport is crucial. It handles 65 per cent. of the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors&#039; goods for export, which is more than &#163;5 billion of the total investment, and NEPIC fears that it could be threatened if it does not develop as we hope it will.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para27"><a name="stpa_321">One NorthEast and ourselves had campaigned for the Government to halt expansion at ports in the south&#151;Felixstowe, Harwich and Shellhaven, on the Thames&#151;and instead allow investment to flow into Teesside. The fear was that if Shellhaven, Felixstowe and Harwich all developed, or if most of them did, it would be difficult to persuade shipping lines to move to Teesport with their container cargo. Two of the three consents have now been granted; none the less Teesport, with its new ownership, has resolved to move as fast as it can to apply for a harbour revision order to develop the deep sea container port.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para28"><a name="stpa_322">Teesport is renewed in its confidence, because it has recently obtained an Asda import centre, through which a large proportion&#151;90 per cent., I think&#151;of all Asda&#039;s clothing line will be imported into the UK through Teesport. That indicates that it is practical to make shipping lines reroute to Teesport, because of the calibre of its facilities, the labour available and so on. Presumably, those shipping lines already appreciate that the climate-friendly elements of a shorter distribution network to the north-east, north-west and Scotland also stand them in good stead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para29"><a name="stpa_323">The whole community backs the development of Teesport, and I understand that the conservation bodies are not likely to cause any difficulties. All the politicians back the development of Teesport, too.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para30"><a name="stpa_324">The way in which the process industry does business these days is changing. The industries are more and more specialised, and goods are shipped out not by tanker but by container&#151;a large percentage of them through Teesport, so it is crucial that it should develop.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para31"><a name="stpa_325">The chief executive officer of north-east process industries cluster, Professor Higgins, has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">&quot;Teesport, of any European port, is the best located for the expansion of Europe. If we are going to take goods to and from Poland, Lithuania, Russia, we would take it though the Baltic or take it across to Rotterdam and drive it across Europe. Which is the best located port for those areas? Teesport.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para32"><a name="stpa_326">I hope that the Government appreciate the strategic advantage for the port and for the process industries. It is the view of One NorthEast that the successful development of Teesport as a deep sea container terminal is also of national significance.

<a name="60125h05_para33"><a name="stpa_327">If it is feasible for him to do so, I should be pleased if my right hon. Friend would undertake to do his best to ensure that there are no obstacles in the way of the development so that our golden future in the Tees valley will not be held back.

<p><a name="st_114"><a name="60125h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Alun Michael) </b> : I will answer as fully as I can within the limited time available. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) for inspiring the debate and being assiduous, as ever, in promoting the interests of his constituency. I am pleased that he endorsed the excellent work of the north-east process industries cluster, which I shall try to avoid referring to by its acronym. It is an unexpected pleasure to have the presence of the well-known parliamentary songbird my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird). I shall try to cover briefly some of the most important points, but as many issues were mentioned I will also write to my hon. Friends and expand on some of those matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para34"><a name="stpa_328">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool about the important role that the process industry in Tees valley plays in our wider economy now and will play in the future. My hon. Friend&#039;s remarks are a testament to the fact that it is not a sunset industry; the sector itself is grasping the opportunities of increasing skills, of taking its place in the knowledge-based economy and of making genuine strides in commercialising new technologies and ways of working.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para35"><a name="stpa_329">My hon. Friend rightly said that the industry has responded to the need to operate in a cleaner environment and to avoid the damage that was done in the past. Times have changed; this country can be very proud indeed of our success in getting the REACH proposals agreed in December during the British presidency. The initiative started in the previous British presidency in the late 1990s and came to fulfilment during our latest presidency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para36"><a name="stpa_330">The reason why we should be so proud of REACH is that it was amended from a very bureaucratic set of proposals by the Commission as a result of the UK-Hungarian suggestion of a one substance, one registration proposal. Initially, it had no other supporters, and the new member state worked very closely with us.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para37"><a name="stpa_331">I pay tribute to the Chemical Industries Association, especially Judith Hackett, who is about to move on from her role, for the way in which it engaged with environmental campaigners, animal rights organisations and a variety of industries from Ford to Marks and Spencer, the chemical industry itself and downstream users, in putting forward practical proposals. That is why I am slightly surprised by the reference to excessive administration. The proposals were agreed as recently as December, so the company in Hartlepool may have sounded a note of unjustified pessimism.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para38"><a name="stpa_332">I believe it was in this room that I introduced the regulations on paint, and Opposition Members&#151;there were Opposition Members present on that occasion&#151;

<br>&nbsp;<br>
said that they would put fresh burdens on British industry. They had to change their stance when scribbled notes from the industry representatives down at the end of the room pointed out that consistent regulations would be applied across Europe, and that the UK industry, which was already operating to high environmental and health protection standards, would benefit from similar burdens being placed on their competitors in other countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para39"><a name="stpa_333">I should point out that REACH will replace more than 40 pieces of legislation, and one regulation means better regulation; it will help to reduce the overall bureaucratic burden. As a result of our initiatives, much has been done to streamline REACH and make it more cost-effective. I will happily lay out some of the other benefits of the proposal for my hon. Friend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para40"><a name="stpa_334">My hon. Friend also referred to the importance of skills development within the industry, and I agree with him on that. Service industries in particular have to operate on improving their processes and increasing skills. On Monday I went to see another process industry, a printing plant. I was really impressed by how specific manufacturers and producers in the industry are working to squeeze every last benefit from the improvement of skills, and how they are engaging the work force in how the processes are undertaken. That is why the employer-led sector skills council and the regional skills partnership are so important in starting to deliver; they cover so much of the work force.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para41"><a name="stpa_335">I agree with my hon. Friend about the importance of supporting young people in modern apprenticeships. One of the challenges for a region such as the north-east is encouraging young people to be ambitious about their skills and qualifications and, in many cases, about the entrepreneurship that they can bring to bear, either individually by setting up their own business, or as entrepreneurs within large industries such as the process industry. I would be happy to talk to my hon. Friend about that, because the issue of how we get that message across in the north-east is important to young people in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Hartlepool and for Stockton, South, and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para42"><a name="stpa_336">My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool rightly referred to the impact of energy prices, and we certainly understand the tough conditions that high energy users are experiencing. He will be aware that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has, at the request of the Prime Minister, promoted an energy review that looks to the long term. We are carefully looking into the surprising prices spike, and the impression that perhaps not all supplies were as readily available in the UK as they should have been towards the end of last year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60125h05_para43"><a name="stpa_337">My hon. Friend will also be aware that steps taken by Government mean that supplies will be increased considerably in the coming year, what with the new terminals, and what is happening in Pembrokeshire. Also, a variety of other approaches that have been a long time in preparation are coming to fulfilment; that will help us to deal with the faster than expected decrease in availability of North sea gas, other pressures on the energy industry, and the knock-on effect on industry. So steps are being taken to help industry to compete.

If one or more objection is received, an inquiry has to be set up. It would not be appropriate for the Government to speculate on the merits of the application before it is received, nor once it is under consideration. However, I assure my hon. Friends that careful consideration would be given, and the importance of the port and location of Teesport is fully recognised by the Government.

The process industry represents 25 per cent. of the whole economy of the north-east; that demonstrates its importance. So I understand why my hon. Friends are so keen to make sure that the Government understand and respond to its interests.
