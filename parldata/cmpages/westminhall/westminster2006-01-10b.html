<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60110h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): Thank you, Mrs. Humble, and a happy new year to you and other hon. Members. I thank Mr. Speaker for granting us permission to hold this important debate on NHS dentistry, the Minister for attending and those hon.&nbsp;Members who intend to contribute. I thank also Dr. Alisdair McKendrick, a local dentist in Kettering and the Northamptonshire representative of the British Dental Association, with whom I have had many discussions during recent months. I wish also to thank all the dentists in my constituency of Kettering who provide an extremely professional and enthusiastic service to many thousands of local residents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">There is a major crisis in NHS dentistry not only in Kettering, but throughout the country. That is a particular shame because in 2000, just over five years ago, the Prime Minister promised that everyone would have access to an NHS dentist within two years. I regret to say that that was all talk. Throughout the country, particularly in Kettering, fewer people are registered with an NHS dentist than was the case seven years ago. According to Government figures published in response to a parliamentary question that I tabled, since 2002,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;almost 7,000 local residents in the Kettering constituency have been thrown off the list of NHS dentists. Fewer people are registered with an NHS dentist in the constituency than at any time since the Government came to power.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">Indeed, throughout the county of Northamptonshire, only 47 per cent. of local residents are registered with an NHS dentist.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60110h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I will, after I have read out a letter from a constituent&#151;one of the victims who has been thrown off the NHS list. Last September, Katherine Clay from Channing street, Kettering, wrote:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Dear Mr Hollobone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am writing to make you aware of the appalling situation where it is impossible to get an NHS Dentist.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">I have been registered with my dentist for a while as an NHS patient and have kept up my regular appointments. This week I&nbsp;received a letter saying that I was now being removed from their list and if I still wanted to receive NHS treatment I would have to find another dentist.&quot;</p>

<a name="60110h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">Mrs. Clay goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;As far as I was aware Britain has a National Health Service&#151;that is a free, or subsidised medical service. Increasingly this is no longer the case. People are being forced into paying for medical insurance out of the fear of not being able to get treatment when they need it, or the frustration of having to wait for long periods of time, often in pain, for routine or vital operations.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">I am a single person on a reasonable income but with having to pay a mortgage etc I find that I would be in a difficult position had I to pay a monthly premium for dental treatment that I would perhaps never need (and pay on top when I did actually visit the dentist).&quot;</p>

<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">Sadly, Katherine Clay&#039;s experiences are all too typical in the Kettering constituency.
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60110h01_spnew4"><b> David Taylor </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. That was indeed a long extract from the letter of a constituent. In North-West Leicestershire and the county of Leicestershire, about half the people are not registered with NHS dentists, but Labour Members are fed up to the back teeth with being held responsible for all of what has happened in relation to NHS dentistry. In 1992, less than 10 per cent. of dentists&#039; income came from private patients, but now more than 50 per cent. does, so the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party bears some responsibility. Yes, we are almost in our 10th year of government, but it takes time to train dentists and his party closed a number of courses.
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60110h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I do not know whether he heard my introductory remarks, but I quoted his own Prime Minister as pledging to the people of this nation that everyone would have access to an NHS dentist within two years. Three years on from the pledge, that is patently not the case.
</p>






<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60110h01_spnew6"><b> Tony Baldry  (Banbury)</b>  (Con): The previous intervention demonstrates the complacency of Labour Members, who are trying to shuffle the blame on to something that happened 10 years ago.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">My hon. Friend said that nearly half the people in Northamptonshire have access to NHS dentists, but in Oxfordshire the situation is considerably worse. Only a third of NHS dentists&#151;43 out of 121&#151;are accepting new children on to the lists. Worse than that, many other dentists are accepting children who are entitled to free NHS dental care only if their parents join their list but pay to go privately. That is monstrous. Large numbers of our constituents can get NHS dental care for their children only if they themselves are obliged to pay a monthly private subscription. NHS dentistry, under this Government, is dead.
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60110h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I am most grateful for that intervention, which is similar to the point that Dr. Alisdair McKendrick was making on BBC Radio Northampton this morning. Adults not being able to find an NHS dentist is distressing enough, but it is particularly distressing when children do not have access to the free dental care that all of us would want them to receive. Of course, most dental decay is preventable and especially so in young children. Sadly, under the current regime, thousands of children are not getting the dental service that they deserve.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">The organisation <i>Which?</i>, which has done a lot of survey work on dentistry, published a survey in January 2005 that questioned 2,000 adults across Great 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Britain. The findings are extremely interesting: nine out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 10 people believe that the Government should ensure NHS dental treatment for everyone whenever they need it; 55 per cent. of people who tried to register with an NHS dentist in the last two years said that they had found that difficult; two thirds of people think it is harder now to register with an NHS dentist for regular care and check-ups than five years ago; only 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. of people think that the Government are taking enough action to improve NHS dentistry provision; only 13 per cent. believe that the Government are giving enough funding to NHS dentistry; and 58 per cent. agree that dental care costs too much even when provided by the NHS.

</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60110h01_spnew8"><b> David Taylor </b> : The Chamber would benefit from a more complete quote from the <i>Which?</i> survey, which at least reported with approval that some action was being taken to improve access to dentistry: the recruitment of more dentists from overseas, expanding the number of training places for dentists and providing dental access centres. The report was not entirely doom and gloom, even a year ago, was it?
</p>






<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60110h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : No, it is not all doom and gloom, but it is pretty gloomy out there. I would suggest that the hon. Gentleman might like to spend rather more time talking to thousands of his constituents who are suffering from a lack of access to NHS dental care. He and his colleagues ought to take the issue far more seriously than the interventions heretofore suggest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">There are two fundamental problems with NHS dentistry. The first is an appalling lack of Government investment. To be fair, that is not entirely down to this Government, as the trend has gone on for far too long, although it is accelerating under the current regime. According to the National Audit Office, since 1990&#150;91, overall spending on the NHS has gone up by 75 per cent., but overall spending on NHS dentistry has gone up by just 9 per cent. I am afraid that we are beginning to see the result of that lack of investment, which is being accelerated under this Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">The other problem is that the contracts offered by the Department of Health to dentists for working as NHS employees are not attractive enough to retain them. This is a question not just of remuneration, but of the work load with which dentists have to struggle and the amount of quality time they can offer their patients.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">One of the big myths is that dentists&#039; main motivation for staying in the private sector is that they can earn more. That is certainly not the motivation for dentists in Kettering who leave the NHS. They are leaving because the new contracts offered to them do not reward them for the work, and the quality of work, that they want to offer their patients. I am afraid that as a result, despite the pledges, an important part of the health service is being privatised. There is no getting away from that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">The Government need to consider different ways to encourage the establishment of new dental practices. A gentleman from my constituency has approached me with a very innovative scheme to set up a new dental

<br>&nbsp;<br>
practice in Kettering, but because he is not a dentist he is finding it very difficult to get the appropriate funding and permission.
</p>






<p><a name="st_10"><a name="60110h01_spnew10"><b> Philip Davies  (Shipley)</b>  (Con): I am incredibly grateful to my hon. Friend, who is being generous in giving way. He is summing up the problems of NHS dentistry in an articulate and expert manner.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">The point that my hon. Friend has just made is perfectly good. In Shipley, I have the same problem. Mr.&nbsp;Bostock, a local man, wants to set up an NHS dental practice and import dentists from other countries to run it, yet is unable to do so because he is not a dentist. He does not want to put his equipment into people&#039;s mouths&#151;he is happy to employ experts to do that&#151;but he is prevented from setting up the practice because he is not a dentist. Surely that anomaly should be addressed immediately. I have written to the Government about the issue, which provides a perfect example of what could be done quickly to help resolve the crisis in NHS dentistry.
</p>






<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60110h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s intervention and distressed to learn that his constituent in Shipley is suffering from the same problems as my constituent in Kettering. I urge the Government and the Minister to give us some hope that the regulations on establishing new dental practices will be changed forthwith.
</p>






<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60110h01_spnew12"><b> John Bercow  (Buckingham)</b>  (Con): I can tell my hon. Friend that his concern about the prospects of retaining skilled dentists in the national health service will resonate with large numbers of professionals in constituencies urban and rural across the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">I am a relatively near neighbour of my hon. Friend, and in my constituency a prominent and respected dentist, Lynda Raybould, is anxious that the combination of the rigidities of the new contract, the work load envisaged and the remuneration promised will cumulatively cause her to have to reconsider her position as an NHS dentist unless the Government, at the 59th minute after the eleventh hour, are humble and wise enough to think again.
</p>






<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60110h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I am most grateful for that illuminating intervention, although I am sorry to learn of the experiences of my hon. Friend&#039;s constituent. He will realise that, under this Government, that situation, sadly, is all too typical for many of our local hard-working dentists, who want to work for the NHS, but find that the contracts offered by the Government are simply not attractive enough.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">In highlighting the problem of the lack of NHS dentists in Kettering, I urge the Minister to look favourably on proposals for a new dental school in the Leicestershire-Northamptonshire area and on the bid made by the university of Leicester and the local strategic health authority, which are keen to set up a new facility for training dentists in the local area. I believe that a decision on that is due this month. One never knows; perhaps the Minister will give us some good news today.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 5WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="st_14"><a name="60110h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Russell Brown  (Dumfries and Galloway)</b>  (Lab): I&nbsp;apologise for arriving late, Mrs. Humble. The hon. Gentleman makes a plea for another dental school to be opened. Is he saying that a mistake was made under the Conservative Government when dental schools across the country were closed?
</p>






<p><a name="st_15"><a name="60110h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Hollobone </b> : I am simply trying to hold the Government to account for the pledge that they made five years ago to ensure that everyone has access to an NHS dentist&#151;a pledge that remains unfulfilled three years on from the target date.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">A new dental school in the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire area would go a long way to relieving the local NHS dental crisis. Under the proposals, up to 80 students a year would go to the new dental school. Four oral health academies would be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established, two of which would be in Northamptonshire, and each one would treat up to 10,000 patients. In view of the crisis in dentistry in Northamptonshire, I hope that the Government will look favourably on that bid.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">I stress that unless urgent measures are taken to support new dental schools and new NHS dental practices in Northamptonshire, the problem will get far worse. That is because, under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s housing expansion scheme for Kettering and Northamptonshire, there will be a growth in local population of between 30 and 50 per cent. by 2031. I do not claim to be an expert in mathematics, but if the population numbers go up by between 30 and 50&nbsp;per cent., we will need at least 30 to 50 per cent. more dentists. Under the proposed contract arrangements, that simply will not happen in Kettering or Northamptonshire.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">Finally, I make a plea to Health Ministers to visit Kettering to talk to local dentists&#039; patients, dentists and&nbsp;the primary care trust about the dental crisis there. I&nbsp;invited the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), to Kettering, and she wrote back:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Unfortunately, because of my diary commitments, I will not be able to accept your invitation to visit Kettering to discuss these issues further.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">That was at the end of September. I have since learned that she will indeed come to Kettering on another matter on 7 March. I very much hope that she can spare us an hour of her valuable time to talk about the extent of this real problem in Kettering. My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) and I also wrote to her asking to talk to her about dentists and other health service issues in Kettering and Wellingborough. A meeting was set up for 15 December, but was cancelled with three days&#039; notice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">People in Kettering want the Government to take their concerns about the NHS seriously. Today&#039;s debate is an opportunity for the Government to show that they are listening to what local people have to say. I look forward to the Minister providing reassurance that he understands the scale of the problem in Kettering, and I&nbsp;hope that he will give concrete answers that provide the solutions that local people want.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60110h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I am delighted to be here at the start of the new year, and happy new year to you, Mrs. Humble. I am not sure whether this Chamber will change the nature of these debates, but I fear that we have started with a slightly more adversarial issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">I should tell the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr.&nbsp;Hollobone) that I share many of his worries. We Labour Members are not complacent about the issue. I&nbsp;wrote to a dentist in my constituency yesterday, and this is probably the most difficult issue that I face there. I am largely an optimist, and always try to look at the best side of things, but in my eight years as MP for Stroud, the most difficult meeting that I have had was with my dentists in the town of Stroud. However, that does not necessarily reflect the situation in the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constituency. In that meeting, I was completely disabused of what I went into the meeting thinking would come out of it&#151;that is, reaffirmation of a belief in NHS dentistry. Most of those dentists had gone private, some entirely so, and they made things clear to me.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne), and I will be gentle with him because this matter is not part of his brief. I have already raised it with the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms&nbsp;Winterton). Those dentists made it clear that they did not really see any future in NHS dentistry, certainly not NHS dentistry as I take it to be. The meeting took place two years ago, at the start of the negotiations on the new contract, and the dentists saw the negotiations as setting a benchmark in relation to which they would improve their conditions. I got depressed as a result of that meeting. It is always a delight to see the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford), and no doubt he will give us his view as a practitioner.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">I will give an overview of my area. I live in a constituency that could be parodied as including this country&#039;s Berlin wall, in that it is divided. In the south of my constituency, most dentists are NHS. They believe in NHS dentistry and want to stay in the NHS. Those in the north, who are mainly based in and around the town of Stroud, have gone private. I do not know how we can bring them back. I have to hope that the new contract will assist with that, but there are difficult times ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">One of my dentists, Mr. Richard Gwyer, wrote to me and raised an issue, which I will raise in a series of questions to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, concerning the three new bands and what my constituent sees as a tax, although I do not see it that way. He thinks that there is an inflation of charges&#151;a dramatic inflation of some charges. There has been a conflation of the different charges in this system, which I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not think anyone, including dentists, can understand because there are so many. Charges for some operations that dentists undertake will go up and some will go down, but some increases will be dramatic.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">The other thing that utterly depressed me was the way that some dentists used the threat of deregistering children as an inducement to the parents to stay with them and to sign up to their particular private plan, whether it be Denplan or something else. I do not think that that approach is acceptable. One of the depressing 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 7WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
things about the issue is that it involves people who were trained and paid for by the NHS, because in those days there were no tuition fees. Such people have an obligation to the NHS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">One thing that I would lay down&#151;this has not yet been formally proposed&#151;is that anyone who goes through dental school as a UK citizen should have an obligation, whether in the form of a contract or not, to do a number of years for the NHS come what may. That should be laid down to recoup some of the substantial investment that is made in training dentists. I hope that the Government take the issue forward.
</p>






<p><a name="st_17"><a name="60110h01_spnew17"><b> Sir Paul Beresford  (Mole Valley)</b>  (Con): If the hon. Gentleman wants a brain drain and an exodus of dentists, following his suggestion is the way to do it.
</p>






<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60110h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : We always have the threat of people going, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman is a good example of people who come here from different parts of the world. The reality is that something must be given back, at least in the early days of the training. For that, I would commute fees and give substantial help during the training period, so there would be some inducement. There is an obligation on people who work within the state to pay something back to it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">As one who takes a keen interest in this matter, I am somewhat confused as to where the contractual negotiations have got to. I have some sympathy with Health Ministers, inasmuch as I do not know where the British Dental Association has got to. Having welcomed the proposals initially, it has become increasingly critical of them. There do not seem to be any face-to-face negotiations at the moment, although those are vital. I agree with the hon. Member for Kettering that this crisis cannot be resolved only by inducement or by Government heavy-handedness.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">We went along the inducement line with regard to GP contracts. Anyone who knows anything about the financial problems faced by primary care trusts knows that a lot of them have to do with how we have bought out GPs&#151;lock, stock and barrel&#151;who are doing incredibly well out of the new contractual arrangements. I put my hands up and say that perhaps it had to be that way, because the same threat of people leaving the NHS would have been advanced if we had not been very generous, but we have been more than very generous. My friends who are GPs are telling me, somewhat guardedly, that they have done well out of those arrangements. We must be careful not to make some of the same mistakes.
</p>






<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60110h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart  (Beverley and Holderness)</b>  (Con): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the GP contract has been a failure because of the massive cost? The contract has been overly generous and helps explain how the Government have managed to increase NHS expenditure enormously, yet deliver no more for it. Does he not think that that has also happened with GPs?
</p>






<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60110h01_spnew20"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : Expenditure on GPs is relatively small, compared with the overall NHS budget, but I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says. Learning from history and hindsight, the changes could have been made differently.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 8WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">The problem is that GPs look at people such as dentists: the hon. Gentleman is right&#151;this is not just about money, it is about the quality of life&#151;but those two things go together. If people get more money, they can to some extent determine their quality of life and quality of working patterns much more easily. I am afraid that GPs have considered dentists and there was, among some, a view that there was life outside the NHS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">I shall return to my questions, although I do not want to speak for long because other hon. Members want to contribute to this important debate. It would be helpful if the Department ran a briefing session on charges with MPs&#151;or at least made it clear what the three bands consist of&#151;and justified the enormous operation inflation, where that has happened. Dentists raised with me the additional costs of dentures, which seem to have led to a dramatic increase. Likewise, it would be helpful if the Department gave some proof of which charges have decreased, given that the overall sum involved seems to have been reduced.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">There is also the issue of those who have taken part in personal dental services contracts. There does not seem to have been a seamless move from the old contract to the new. We are changing the nature of the contract in respect of units of dental activity, but if we are to gain anything from the dental service contracts, we need to recognise those loyal servants of the NHS in dentistry, who have worked hard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">I name, among others, Steve Clarke, who runs a big practice in Dursley in my constituency and who has made clear his commitment not just to stay in the NHS, but to train new NHS dentists. He wants to build his practice and see NHS dentistry flourish there. The question is, how is someone who has been on a professional dental service contract, worked through with the PCT, to do that? I also need to mention Chris Morton, the operative in the PCT with whom I have had a lot of dealings. I am thankful to the Minister of State, because we got an additional dentist into the practice through the work of Chris Morton, but I am not sure how PDS translates into the new contract.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">There is also the issue of list sizes, which relates to one of the sticking points in getting some help for my dentist, David Rees. There was a problem with how the Department defines list sizes. With the best will in the world, particularly if someone joins a new practice from abroad, the idea that a dentist can immediately step up to some of these numbers is not necessarily a good one. I know that there is a notion that dentists can have a list of about 2,000, but the Department was somewhat unrealistic in considering how quickly a dentist, particularly one from abroad, could take on the numbers necessary to make the figures balance.

<p>
<a name="60110h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will take up those issues, although, as I said, this is not his brief. The issue is crucial, however, and I hope that all sides will work together. I hope that the BDA comes back to the negotiating table and, in a sense, becomes more representative of dentists. I am having a go not at the BDA, but at what has happened to dentistry. Dentistry has moved away from being represented by a collective body because many dentists have chosen to go along the private route. I want them back in the NHS.

Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who made some important points. I am thinking particularly of his questions, especially those relating to charges, which I will touch on later. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing the debate. As usual, his diligence and hard work shone through in his comments. Yet again, he is campaigning on an issue that is vital to his constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">As a fellow Northamptonshire Member of Parliament, I recognise and agree with the points that my hon. Friend made. NHS dentistry has reached crisis point. That is never more apparent than in my constituency. If my constituents want an NHS dentist, they have to travel outside the county, to Bedfordshire. In effect, dentistry in Wellingborough has been privatised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">Rushden is one of the major towns in my constituency, and 20 years ago there were eight dentists serving the town and surrounding villages. Now there is only one NHS dentist. In that particular dental surgery, there used to be four practising NHS dentists, with more than 10,000 NHS patients. Now there is only one, and his practice is full to capacity with 4,000 NHS patients. He is not taking on any new NHS patients. How can that be called progress? Yesterday, I did a survey of dental practices in my constituency. Of the 11 contacted, how many do Members think are taking on new NHS patients? None.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">What is to blame for the privatisation of dentistry? In my constituency, and countrywide, it is not the dentists themselves. Dentists who have practised under the NHS find themselves drowned in bureaucracy and red tape. One dentist I spoke to told me that he felt more like an administrator than a practising dentist. Is that any wonder when we look at the long-winded, bureaucratic contract that NHS dentists have to sign up to and abide by? NHS dentists are frustrated that they are forced to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use outdated equipment and techniques on NHS patients. I repeat that, in Wellingborough, dentistry has effectively been privatised. That has happened for a reason. The Government are unable to trust people. They are unable to trust trained professionals, who are hindered in carrying out the jobs that they know so well by being drowned in bureaucracy and central control.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">The Government&#039;s need to micro-manage and control everything has led to that crisis in NHS dentistry. Their control and state planning have more in common with Stalin&#039;s Russia than a democratic, free-enterprise country in the 21st century. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Labour Members may laugh, but it is true.

<a name="60110h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">From April 2006, the Government shall give primary care trusts a ring-fenced dentistry budget that represents the intended minimum investment in primary dental care services. That minimum investment will be subject to Government conditions on how the money can be spent; it will not be left to the professionals to decide. The Government show all the worst aspects of state planning. They give to dentistry the least amount that they think they can get away with, and then decide that they must know every single detail about how the money will be spent. The Government&#039;s need to know everything, without trusting the professionals, has led to the privatisation of dentistry in Wellingborough.

<p>
<a name="60110h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">I am concerned that the people who are hit worst by the change are those on low incomes. Hard-working families who have paid their taxes and national insurance find that they are unable to receive NHS dental treatment. They have to find the money for private treatment or go without.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">Many dentists require families to take out dental insurance, and an average family has to pay about &#163;60&nbsp;a month. The money has to come out of taxed income. For better-off families, that is an irritation and yet another stealth tax, but for those on low incomes, of whom there are many in my constituency, an additional &#163;60 out of taxed income is a colossal cost and it causes real hardship. I am afraid that this is just another example of new Labour&#039;s agenda: its stealth taxes hit the poorest and most vulnerable in the community the hardest, which is a disgrace. It probably would not have happened under old Labour, and it certainly would not have happened under the Conservatives.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">The situation is about to get much, much worse, not only for those who are unable to get an NHS dentist, but for existing NHS patients, as the hon. Member for Stroud mentioned. From April, NHS patients who pay &#163;6.20 for a filling will have to pay &#163;42.40 for the same filling. The cost, which comes from my local dentist, is seven times more expensive than at present, or, if one likes, a 684 per cent. increase. I hope the Minister tells me that my dentist has got it wrong, but somehow I&nbsp;doubt it. That is even more expensive than having the filling done privately. If that is not privatisation on a huge scale, I do not know what is.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">I have another example. The cost of a partial denture will go up from &#163;49 to &#163;189&#151;a 382 per cent. increase. That is unacceptable and it defies belief, yet the situation is set to get much worse. For many people, going to a dentist will become a luxury, not a necessity.

will suffer the most under the new system. Owing to the Government&#039;s obsessive need to micro-manage NHS dentistry, the service is practically non-existent in my constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">I have come to the conclusion that the only way to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rectify the situation is to have a Conservative Government. The Conservatives ran NHS dentistry for many years while in government, and my constituents never had a problem finding an NHS dentist. This Government have destroyed NHS dentistry in Wellingborough, which has hit vulnerable families the most. They should be ashamed of themselves. They should admit their mistakes, scrap the new dental contract and go back to providing proper NHS dentistry for the people of Wellingborough and the people of this country.

It is important and, as several other hon. Members have said, NHS dentistry is certainly in crisis. While NHS issues have come and gone under this Government, the problems of dentistry have got worse. I fear that despite the new contracts&#151;I hope the Minister will give us some assurance on those&#151;things will not get any better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">The issue of expenditure has been raised. NHS dentistry accounts for only 3 per cent. of the NHS bill and its cost has risen a lot less in real terms than that of other areas of the health service. Unless the Government are prepared to offer commitment to and investment in NHS dentistry, there will continue to be a drift away from the NHS to privatisation. That is shown clearly in my constituency, where 58 per cent. of the population were registered with an NHS dentist in 1997. In March last year, the figure had fallen to 38 per cent. During the last-but-one Health questions, I asked whether the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), considered that progress. She admitted that it was not good progress. I wrote to her requesting a meeting, but have yet to receive an answer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">The situation is getting worse. This year, not in Rochdale, but in Langley in the constituency of Heywood and Middleton, and in the Radcliffe area of the Bury, North constituency, my constituents queued from 4 am to get on a registered list. That is not acceptable; it is completely deplorable. The body blow came over Christmas when the Balderstone practice, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last remaining NHS-only dentist in Rochdale, announced that it will withdraw completely from NHS dentistry from 1 April&#151;the same day that the Government&#039;s newfangled contract starts. Every one of those four dentists&#039; patients received a letter over Christmas informing them that they must look elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">I shall quote from one of the dentists at that practice because, as the hon.

We have worked with local constituents to find an alternative NHS dentist, but we have yet to record a single success in finding them an opportunity to register with a new NHS dentist. This is a withdrawal of services, not even a shift from one dentist to another.

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60110h01_spnew28"><b> Paul Rowen </b> : I agree&#151;not one dentist in my constituency has opened its list for NHS patients. The dentist at the Balderstone surgery, John Booth, who has been a dentist for 14 years, said that

<a name="60110h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">I would like the Minister to consider three issues, and I am surprised that new Labour is not considering the first. It seems that there can be privatisation everywhere else in the NHS. My mother, a 73-year-old pensioner, no longer has a dentist, and many people do not see a dentist regularly. Why cannot the Government, on a short-term basis, buy in the services of some private dentists to cope with the problem?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">The amount of money under the new contracts was announced before Christmas, and, as the regulations have been prayed against, we shall be discussing the figures. I am concerned about whether the money allocated will be historical and whether it will do something to address areas such as Rochdale and Wigan, which the Minister has admitted are black spots for dental provision. Will more money be allocated to those areas to ensure that local PCTs can provide more dentists?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">In July last year, the Greater Manchester strategic health authority stopped allowing new personal dental services contracts, which meant that three dentists in my constituency who wanted to open a practice were not able to do so. I want assurances from the Minister that there will be not just this contract, but long-term investment in dentistry and, as the hon. Member for Stroud said, real commitment to NHS dentistry. If the Government will not provide that, they may as well admit to doing what the Conservatives would do anyway and privatise things. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I&nbsp;am sorry, but the Conservatives&#039; record is not one that I can condone.

Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) for securing this debate. We all look back to the good old days of dentistry, but dentistry has moved on. I have heard the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) refer to that. Cosmetic dentistry is only one additional aspect of dentistry, which has gone way beyond the drill-and-fill and extractions of the past.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">As colleagues are aware, dentistry, like all other NHS matters, is devolved in Scotland, and as far as I am concerned this issue rests with the Scottish Parliament, but it is just as well to share with hon. Members exactly what is happening north of the border. I take no consolation from the fact that my area is the second worst in this respect in the whole of Scotland. Only Aberdeenshire fares worse than Dumfries and Galloway.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">It is right to say that not all dentists are the same. People&#039;s hearts lie in different areas, and some people still work hard within the NHS. I have never been one who has advocated that the NHS system that we have all grown to love over many years is in any shape or form right for today. In each of the last three weeks before the general election, a dental practice in my constituency went private, and I had to ask whether something political was going on. The Scottish Parliament&#039;s Minister with responsibility for dentistry was to visit a dental practice on the Tuesday. On the Saturday morning, the patients of that dental practice received a letter stating that a new, exciting and innovative service was being introduced for them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">Many people whose dental practices have gone private have received such a letter. This was a long letter containing complaints about everything that was wrong. There were complaints about Governments&#151;not just this Government&#151;and at the end of the letter the patients were informed that if they wanted to sign up to the new service that the practice would be running, they should bring their bank details with them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">This is all about the laws of economics&#151;about supply and demand. Some people have seized upon that. I have been condemned in my local press by certain individuals for calling dentists greedy, but I stand by those comments as some dentists have become too greedy. If we were to ask some retired dentists about what is going on across the country, they would shudder. They would never have carried out their business&#151;we must keep it in mind that these are private businesses&#151;in such a manner. People are being turned on to the street and asked to queue.
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60110h01_spnew30"><b> Mr. Graham Stuart </b> : Is it not typical of this Government that, having made unequivocal promises to the British people on NHS dentistry, they turn around and try to blame independent contractors&#151;dentists?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 14WH</b>

a framework that encourages those professionals to do what they all train to do. They are all committed to helping the people of this country.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60110h01_spnew31"><b> Mr. Brown </b> : I am not sure whether I was right to take that intervention, but I will back up my claim about greed to the hon. Gentleman. It is only of late&#151;and with some reluctance, I think&#151;that the British Dental Association has condemned the practice of some dentists of turning people out on to the street and asking them to queue for hours to sign up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">I appreciate that this is not part of the Minister&#039;s brief, but I am not convinced that the new NHS dental contract will provide solutions to the problems that we face. Dumfries and Galloway health board has turned to an organisation called Integrated Dental Holdings to provide NHS dentists for the area I represent, albeit those dentists will come from overseas. The board turned to IDH because it has operated in Shropshire for the past seven or eight years. In seeking information on IDH, I turned to two of the four Conservative Members whose constituencies are served by Shropshire county primary care trust. They told me that they had a problem in 1997, and the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) said that he got a significant haranguing in the run-up to the general election of that year. IDH came along and provided a service that meets the needs of the people of the area, and I hope that it will provide answers to some problems that my area faces.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) asked why the Government do not buy into what is happening. Dumfries and Galloway health board approached some dental practices that have gone private, and it would take a king&#039;s ransom to get any of them to do any NHS work. The cost would be exorbitant in the extreme&#151;almost a waste of money in trying to get them back on board.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">I use the word &quot;greed&quot; because this matter boils down to the fact that different dental practices in different parts of the country operate different payment systems. I have spoken to colleagues in the House. Some said, &quot;Yes, I am with a private dental practice, and I pay for my treatment when I receive it.&quot; Others are signed up to a dental plan, which they pay for monthly. They do not have to pay for treatment when they receive it. However, I have to tell you, Mrs. Humble, that in my area the vast majority of dentists ask people to make a monthly payment of between &#163;12 and &#163;22, and they are then asked to pay for their dental treatment on top.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">I ask the Minister to consider a simple calculation: if a dental practice asks people to pay &#163;12 a month and takes on 1,000 patients, that equates to more than &#163;140,000 a year. Even if the best part of a third of that is offset, that dentist will receive &#163;100,000 per annum on top of what he earns. That is why I have made my point.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">I am not convinced that any NHS dental contract will bring those people back into the fold. Regrettably, the answer comes back to the law of supply and demand. Flooding areas with dentists&#151;albeit, I suspect, most will come from overseas&#151;is the only way in which dentists will suffer pain. I discovered from Shropshire primary care trust that private dentists were not happy when IDH arrived on the scene. I suspect, and to some degree hope, that the same will happen when IDH arrives in my area.

<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60110h01_spnew32"><b> Mr. Nick Hurd  (Ruislip-Northwood)</b>  (Con): I respect your desire for brevity, Mrs. Humble.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">Last Friday, all three Members of Parliament who represent the London borough of Hillingdon met members of the local dental community and the message could not have been clearer: in the words of the chairman of the local dental committee, the contract as it stands is a disaster. Many of the themes will be all too familiar to the Minister, and I am sure that they will be elaborated on in Front-Bench exchanges.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">I would like to focus on three issues that particularly concern local dentists. The first is chronic underfunding of dentistry; the second, to pick up the comments made by the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), is the ability of the local primary care trust to handle new responsibilities; and the third, to pick up the comments made by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan&nbsp;Kramer), is the future of orthodontics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">On funding, a 46-year-old dentist made the point that his fee for fitting a crown on a posterior tooth was higher when he qualified than it is now. The point was also made that there is no London weighting in the contract. I would be grateful if the Minister explained whether consideration was given to London weighting and the reason for the apparent dismissal of that option.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">Another major concern over funding is the loss of the ability to charge for failed appointments. I have read the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister&#039;s response on that and have not been convinced. If payment is to continue on the basis of payment for units of dental activity and if dentists do not have the opportunity to deliver a UDA because a patient does not turn up, dentists lose UDA points and income through no fault of their own.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">I note the Minister&#039;s willingness to review the situation in the event of what is described as a sudden and dramatic change in the pattern of appointments and cancellations. It would be helpful to have some clearer parameters of what constitutes sudden and dramatic change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">The second area of major concern in Hillingdon lies in the PCT&#039;s ability to manage the change. That concern is reinforced by the PCT&#039;s announcement in August that no new orthodontic referrals to Hillingdon hospital would be paid for. The background of that decision&#151;if that is what it is&#151;is the severe financial difficulties of the PCT. It is not alone in that and is wrestling with a &#163;31&nbsp;million deficit. Cuts are the order of the day, and orthodontic referrals come first because they are deemed to be low priority and are lumped together with treatments such as homeopathy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">There was no consultation on the announcement, nor any apparent effort to understand the true nature of such referrals. Around 250 people are involved and we are not talking about cosmetic orthodontics. They are referred to Victor Crow because he does work that no one else in Hillingdon can do. I have seen pictures of the burdens that his patients must carry around and they are horrific, involving terrible facial deformities, clefts and so on. The message to those patients from Hillingdon PCT and the system it fronts seems to be to put up or pay up. That could be an irreversible decision if Hillingdon hospital responds to the drop in funding by closing a department that is recognised as doing unique and excellent work in the area. When it has gone, it is unlikely that we will get it back.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 16WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">What is the saving to justify that loss of service? An estimated net &#163;40,000 a year. That is false economics in the context of a &#163;31 million deficit. This is not a local, parochial point. Hillingdon MPs have received representations from outside Hillingdon expressing concern that this is setting an alarming precedent for cash-strapped PCTs throughout the system, thereby doing irreversible damage to the future of orthodontics in this country. I urge the Minister to make inquiries about that initiative to ensure that any decision is fully informed, supported by cost-benefit analysis and taken with due regard to statutory procedure.

<a name="60110h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">The wider point is that the initiative by Hillingdon PCT reinforces concerns about the ability of the PCT to handle new dental responses in just three or four months from now. If it can make such a mess over the &#163;80,000 for which it is responsible today, what will it do with &#163;10 million and what will happen to that money once the three-year ring fence is over? Just three or four months away from implementing new contracts, the leadership of the PCT is distracted by financial problems and has a short-term outlook, governed by uncertainty as to its own future. It appears not to have taken steps to access the expert advice needed to help it to shoulder that responsibility.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">For my constituents who rely on NHS dentistry, the implication is bleak. The problem here is that the discontent is not the voice of Government employees. Dentists are independent agents over whom Government have few levers in a market with so much private provision. In truth, they will continue to migrate from the NHS. National statistics bear that out&#151;dentists are leaving the NHS in roughly the same numbers as the Government are recruiting them. We are running very hard to stand still, but for me the local evidence is building.

<p>
<a name="60110h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">The chairman of the Hillingdon local dental committee recently took a straw poll of 10 surgeons in my constituency who provide NHS care for patients. Seven of the 10 stated that, as of 1 April, they would be withdrawing from the NHS, leaving just three surgeries to cope with all the pressure from the PCT. How long before those three are also forced to go private? I expect the voice of my constituents to be raised then, asking exactly what the Government meant in saying that they were

<a name="60110h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">The vast majority of people here concede that NHS dentistry is in crisis and that the beginning of that story happened under the Conservatives, with the closure of two dental schools and the creation of the drill-and-fill

treadmill. Yet, after eight years under a Labour Government, while there is some acceptance of a crisis&#151;there have been plenty of strategy documents and reviews&#151;there has been no significant or even discernible change in the percentage of the population registered with an NHS dentist, nor any change in emphasis toward more preventive dental health care.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">We have heard about the Prime Minister&#039;s 1999 promise&#151;anyone wanting to see an NHS dentist would be able to do so within two years, simply by calling NHS Direct. I tried to do that recently, to see whether the claim stood up in 2005. The information I was given was inaccurate; only one dentist was available to accept new NHS patients on his list. When I called to see whether I&nbsp;could make an appointment, I was told that the wait would be several months at least, or, possibly, as long as a piece of string. The practice did not really know. Even if I had emergency requirements, I would have to be triaged on the phone to see whether they really constituted an emergency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">The latest answers to parliamentary questions show that only 36 per cent. of practices are taking on any new patients. Despite celebrating the success of recruiting an extra 1,000 new dentists in the last year, the feedback I&nbsp;have had from those on the ground has been different. Cornwall has taken many overseas dentists to try to fill an acute shortage down there, but more than one practice has contacted me to say that it will have to lose them in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">Again, parliamentary questions show that 10,000 dentists have left the NHS since Labour came to government. That takes no account of the number of dentists who have scaled back their NHS work. I have spoken to a dentist in my constituency who was on the NHS books. He has two NHS patients&#151;his wife and his daughter. The Government do not measure dentists by full-time equivalents, so we have no real idea how dentists who do NHS work split their time between that and private work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">We know that the shortfall could exceed 6,500 dentists by 2021, so even with the 1,000 extra dentists we are not, as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) said, even running to stand still.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">An extra dentistry school would have some impact, but only over a long period, given the time it takes to train dentists, and only if the Government could employ the necessary academic staff and convince graduates to take on NHS work. As we have heard from many hon.&nbsp;Members, there is massive unmet demand. If that is combined with the projected fall in the number of dentists, we can see that the problem will only get worse. Clearly, dramatic change is needed if there is to be any serious attempt to meet this unmet demand. Training more dentists is not enough. Existing dentists must be attracted back to the NHS, although it is not clear that the new contracts will do that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">The new personal dental services contract will dramatically change how dentistry is structured. It will mean a shift towards units of dental activity, rather than a per item fee, but every dentist to whom I have spoken is concerned that it will result in a replacement treadmill. It will mean a move away from drill and fill, but it certainly will not be an end to treadmill dentistry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para82"><a name="stpa_83">The other concern voiced about the scheme is that, within units of dental activity, insufficient allocation is given to preventive work. Where is the shift towards 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 18WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
preventive oral care that is talked about? Like other hon. Members who have contributed, I have spoken to a practice manager. The practice has 6,000 NHS patients on its books. The manager is desperately trying to negotiate a system under which the practice can keep all those people on its books as NHS patients, but it is facing up to the reality that not every single one of them will be able to seek treatment from that practice under the NHS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">All dentists in Cornwall have been surveyed, and 75&nbsp;per cent. of those who responded plan to scale back their NHS work as a result of the new contract. If just a small proportion of those dentists go ahead with that threat, there will be a massive impact in an area where access to NHS dentistry is already very low. One dentist commented that the new contract is the best advert for Denplan he has ever seen.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">The problem is that we do not know what impact the contractual changes will have, because the system is untested. Under the PDS pilot, some elements were tested, but huge aspects have not been piloted at all, including the patient charging structure. The problem is the impact that the charging structure could have not only on dentists&#039; behaviour, but on patient behaviour.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">Band 1, which is a check-up and preventive treatment, will effectively mean an increase in the price of a check-up. How will it encourage people to go for regular check-ups if it costs them more? Surely the incentive will be for them to store up their problems and wait until they need not one filling, but four or five, or until there is an emergency, when they can have those fillings for a much lower price. The higher band will undoubtedly save money for the people seeking the most expensive treatments, but as Lord Warner said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Around 42 per cent of patients fall into Band 2. We expect three-quarters of these patients to pay more than previously&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>15 December 2005; Vol. 676, c.1488.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">How will the Government ensure that patients understand the new pricing structure, which comes into force in April? The negations have only now been finalised, and the matter was debated in Parliament before Christmas. How will the Government ensure that patients seeking treatment from 1 April understand what is going on? Those are fundamental questions that are yet to be resolved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">To conclude&#151;I am keeping my remarks as brief as possible&#151;there are lots of unknowns as to what will be put in place in April. We do not know what impact the&nbsp;changes will have on patient and dentist behaviour. The chief concern is that they could result in a negative impact on the oral health of our nation. Regular, preventive work is most important; this is not just about toothache and cavities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">To give a brief example, a friend of a friend&#151;a nightclub singer&#151;found out, at a regular check-up with her dentist, that she had the early stages of mouth cancer. That routine check-up, and going to the dentist regularly, saved her life. Incidentally, if smoking in all workplaces were banned, that might help to prevent such cancer, but perhaps that is a matter for another debate.

</p>


<p>

He rightly said that he was not only speaking for his constituents, which he did very effectively, but that right across the country people are having the same experiences.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para92"><a name="stpa_93">The steps the Government have taken to recruit and train more dentists will count for nothing without a sensible approach to the new dental contract.

Rather, as the Dental Practitioners Association has correctly identified,


</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para93"><a name="stpa_94">The ill-thought-out and untested regulations that we are discussing will only exacerbate the shift away from the NHS. The Government&#039;s record on NHS dentistry has been one of abject failure. I will not chide the Under-Secretary too often, not least because the Minister of State in his Department with real responsibility for this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue&#151;the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms&nbsp;Winterton)&#151;has chosen not to attend; he is here in her place and we welcome him. However, I remind him 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 20WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that on 28 September 1999 the Prime Minister, as has been mentioned, promised that everyone would have access to an NHS dentist within two years. I should say for the record that that promise expired in 2001. The Government&#039;s failure to address the issue since then is a damning indictment of a succession of Ministers who never took the initiative to make the Prime Minister&#039;s wish a reality.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">The new contract should have been in operation for almost a year, but it has twice been delayed&#151;first until October last year, and now until April this year. In December 2004, the British Dental Association walked out of negotiations in disgust. The Government&#039;s response was to publish the new contractual arrangements last year for information only; there was no consultation and no negotiation. The Under-Secretary may seek to chastise the previous Government for the 1990 general dental services contract, but he should remember that that was at least agreed by the profession, and that, after all, it was a generation ago. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the Under-Secretary acknowledges that being in office for eight and a half years brings certain responsibilities for the present situation.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">We are now faced with the miserable situation of dentists being unable to negotiate a contract because of departmental intransigence and with the prospect of dentists walking out in disgust at what they are being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offered. Responses to the dental charges consultation&#151;dentists were at least consulted on those proposals&#151;were negative in the extreme: 56 per cent. of respondents felt that the proposed charging system was unfair and 41 per cent. thought them unworkable.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;Uncertainty surrounding the start date of the new contract&#151;not to mention the contract&#039;s terms and conditions&#151;has created a climate where dentists have been unable to plan for their practices in the long-term&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">Those are not my words, but the words of the Dental Practitioners Association. The business uncertainty created by the Department of Health is worthy of the Treasury. Maybe the Under-Secretary is lining up for preferment under the Chancellor&#039;s leadership. How else will he defend the Government&#039;s treatment of our dental practitioners? We should remember that dentists are business men and women as well. It is appalling that the Government encouraged dentists to negotiate new PDS contracts as late as eight months before they are scrapped and without making dentists aware of their intentions. What little goodwill that dentists had towards the Government has surely now been squandered. After all, they have to live in the real world. Like the rest of us, they have bank managers, who will demand that they have a business model that looks sustainable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">The Government&#039;s penchant for constant meddling is reflected in the Department&#039;s &quot;pile it on&quot; attitude to PCTs. In the last three years PCTs have been given primary care medical services, out-of-hours services and community pharmacies. They will shortly be given responsibility for general ophthalmic services, whilst having to juggle the implementation of the choose-and-book system, practise-based commissioning and payment by results. At present, and in addition, virtually every single PCT in the country is set to be merged. Into this mix is thrown the commissioning of primary care dental services. PCTs are even now attempting to juggle responsibility for GP out-of-hours 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 21WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
care and pharmacies alongside their other obligations. I&nbsp;wonder whether PCTs will be able to keep all these balls in the air at once. Before the Under-Secretary demands to know whether we would slow the pace of reform, I remind him that he put so much on to PCTs&#039; plates by delaying the implementation of the contract not once, but twice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">It is not as though the Government have not been warned. The NAO previously cast doubt on the ability of PCTs to commission dental services, saying in its report of 25 November 2004:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Primary Care Trusts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have little experience of high street dentistry.&quot;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;have limited capacity and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will need to develop new expertise in dentistry.&quot;</p>

<p>

<a name="60110h01_para100"><a name="stpa_101">They


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;will need to ensure that priority is given to delivering appropriate contracting arrangements, including providing sufficient expertise and resources.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para101"><a name="stpa_102">As far as I can tell, Ministers have not heeded the warnings, as highlighted in the helpful and important contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd). Perhaps the Under-Secretary would explain how he expects PCTs to manage the commissioning of primary care dental services without any acceptance of the NAO&#039;s conclusions and without offering PCTs any idea of how the system might work in practice. The Government have no idea of how the system will work because they did not pilot it. The NAO explained that no other country in the world had attempted to structure primary care dental services in the way that the Government have proposed and perhaps&#151;just perhaps&#151;piloting would have been advisable, as we urged.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">The basis of the new contract is the meta-currency of NHS dentistry, the unit of dental activity or UDA. Like the new charging system, which according to the BDA seems little more than a cynical revenue-generating exercise, UDAs will be awarded in bands. As with the charging system, that results in a number of anomalies. For example, a dentist will get the same number of UDAs for taking a tooth out&#151;20 minutes of surgery time&#151;as for saving the tooth by root filling it&#151;one to one and a half hours of surgery time. I can see how dentists may want to offer preventive advice&#151;the avowed aim of the new contract&#151;in the former case, but I have difficulty seeing how any dentist would choose to offer it in the latter. That simply costs too much in terms of chair time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para103"><a name="stpa_104">UDAs do not have a fixed price attached to them. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had assumed, like my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), another member of the shadow health team, that UDAs would have a fixed national price attached to them. This would be consistent with operating a national tariff for other types of care. I was interested to learn that PCTs would have to determine the value of UDAs individually. Maybe setting a UDA price became too much of a headache for the Government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para104"><a name="stpa_105">I would be interested to learn the Under-Secretary&#039;s views on whether PCTs have the administrative capacity to negotiate their way around such a complex system. We should not forget that many of them are in deficit, with some, like Cheshire West PCT, having very big 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 22WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
deficits. Surely this will eventually result in some sort of postcode&#151;or PCT&#151;lottery, with the Government again deliberately building in unfairness.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para105"><a name="stpa_106">It is true that the Government&#039;s reforms seek to move away from the old so-called drill-and-fill culture engendered by having earnings fixed to the number of treatments provided, but the new system of UDAs will actually pave the way for a new drill-and-fill treadmill where dentists must chase a pre-agreed number of UDAs in a year. When the Minister of State was challenged last month, she said that it was inconceivable that a dentist would be able to achieve his or her number of UDAs in, say, nine months and then shut up shop for three months, because that would indicate serious flaws in the ability of PCTs to commission dental services. That is exactly the scenario that we and the National Audit Office have been trying to warn the Government about. It is surely conceivable, even possible, given that PCTs are novices at commissioning dentistry, that dentists may overperform against their contracts and shut up shop, or underperform. If either happens, where is the flexibility in the contract? Can dentists renegotiate their contract if they are likely to underperform? There is a tolerance figure of only 4 per cent. Admittedly, that has been doubled from the original 2 per cent., but it is still very narrow. Dentists are likely to overcompensate rather than risk a breach notice. Surely the Minister can see that, if dentists are not able to receive adequate payment for providing more treatment, that will hasten their exit from NHS dentistry. That would be a continuing disaster for the important matter of public health and public oral health in particular.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para106"><a name="stpa_107">The new regulations are unpopular, untested and unsound. They will solve neither the problem of falling NHS dental provision nor that of the drill-and-fill treadmill. Dentists and dental organisations have scorned them and the NAO has deep concerns about them. The Department appears to be seeking to wash its hands of the problem, shifting the responsibility and blame on to PCTs, which do not have the expertise, the resources or the time to deal with dentistry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">As we heard, five years ago the Prime Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;everyone within the next two years will be able once again to see an NHS dentist&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">I fear that the new contract will make NHS dentists an even rarer breed. Given the explicit warnings to the Government&#151;not least in this excellent debate&#151;whatever the Under-Secretary now says, he and the Government cannot disclaim full responsibility for the consequences of their actions.

We have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increased the number of adult NHS dentistry registrations since 1997, after a calamitous fall between 1992 and 1997, but by only 200,000. That is not enough. We need to do a lot more, which is precisely why the Government have put in place a three-point programme of action, which I shall explain this morning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">The first point relates to investment. The Government have increased investment in NHS primary care dentistry by about 20 per cent. or &#163;250 million. For 2006&#150;07, we are investing a further &#163;65 million, before taking account of the uplift for pay and prices. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who voiced concern about his poorest constituents, must support that investment. I know that the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) has thrown a great deal of Conservative policy up into the air and I hope that he will take the opportunity of that review to argue against the formula that says that the proceeds of economic activity over the next two or three years will be shared between tax cuts and public investment.

<p>
<a name="60110h01_para112"><a name="stpa_113">A programme of new investment is not enough. We must also increase the number of dentists who work in the NHS. In 2004, we set ourselves a target of recruiting the equivalent of an extra 1,000 dentists. I&nbsp;am glad to say that we exceeded that by about 40 per cent. and recruited 1,450 dentists. In addition, we established 53 dental access centres. We are solving the long-term problems of our inheritance by not closing two dental schools and by proposing to open new dental schools. I shall, of course, pass on the remarks of the hon. Member for Kettering to my hon. Friend the Minister of State. It is nice to be able to do so.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para113"><a name="stpa_114">What does the activity that I have described mean for&nbsp;the hon. Member for Kettering? In his primary care&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trust, Northampton Heartlands, there will be 20,000 extra NHS dentistry patients in the next year or two. Some 4,300 registrations have been made available already; set against the current number of NHS patients, that is an increase of 17 per cent. It is a significant increase and a clear indication that the programmes of reform we are implementing will make some difference. Those registrations will take the number of NHS patients to a level above that inherited in 1997, but we have to go further still.

<a name="60110h01_para114"><a name="stpa_115">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) highlighted the following point. We could discuss whether 80 grand a year is sufficient take-home pay to keep a dentist fully employed in the NHS&#151;it is more than most hon. Members take home, although many of us would argue that dentists do a greater service for their constituents&#151;but the fact is that we have to change the relationship between the NHS and dentists. That is the third element of reform. One of the key problems, which the hon. Gentleman did not point out, is that under the old system when an NHS dentist quit the NHS, the money went back not to the local community but to the Department of Health. That has to change. I should have thought that hon. Members from all parties would welcome our attempts to put commissioning for NHS dentistry back in the hands of local professionals.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para115"><a name="stpa_116">The hon. Member for Wellingborough calls the NHS Stalinesque, which was a nasty reminder of the remarks of the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) when he made his speeches in 1999 and 2000 advocating social insurance for the NHS. I hope that the Conservative party will absolutely rule that out during its forthcoming policy review. We have to make the changes so that NHS spending on dentistry can stay local. That is why the new contract is so important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para116"><a name="stpa_117">The new contract will bring a number of benefits to patients. New ways of working will reflect guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, whereby patients are no longer automatically recalled for a six-monthly check-up and the new system of patient charges will be simpler and fairer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para117"><a name="stpa_118">Several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), have talked about the complexity of the new bands. I think that having three bands is simpler than having 400 different units of charges. My hon. Friend asked for further briefing and I shall ask my hon. Friend the Minister of State how quickly that can be arranged because it will be valuable for all hon. Members.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h01_para119"><a name="stpa_120">We must have the humility to listen, but some of the concerns that have been expressed are based on misunderstandings. Dentists will have the security of a guaranteed income, which will enable them to plan ahead. An NHS dentist&#039;s salary is about &#163;80,000 a year. We have guaranteed that for the next three years, dentists&#039; annual contracts will be worth at least the value of their NHS earnings, but with a 5 per cent. reduction in the courses of treatment they have to carry out. We are taking dentists off the drill-and-fill treadmill of the current system. Instead of being paid separate fees for individual items of treatment, they will carry out an agreed number of courses of treatment during a 12-month arrangement. The key elements of the contract were piloted in a number of sites and those lessons have been taken into account in the new contract.

<a name="60110h01_para120"><a name="stpa_121">The hon. Members for Shipley (Philip Davies) and for Kettering asked whether non-dentists would be able to establish dental practices. That will indeed be possible from April 2006. I hope that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) was not attacking local professionals and managers in primary care trusts. I&nbsp;know that the hon. Member for Witney recently made great play of the need to celebrate local managers in the NHS.

<a name="60110h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_43"><a name="60110h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Chris Mullin  (Sunderland, South)</b>  (Lab): First, and with all due respect to the Minister present, may I say that I regret the absence of the Minister of State? I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that government is seamless, but over the years&nbsp;I have noticed that some Departments are more seamless than others. Secondly, I commend the debate pack prepared by the Library. It is relevant to the debate and contains a lot of information that hon. Members with an interest in this subject might find useful.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para0"><a name="stpa_122">I have taken an interest in asylum and immigration policy for some time, both during my four years as Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee and in my two years as entry clearance Minister, among other things, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I wish to make it clear from the outset that I am generally supportive of the Government&#039;s tougher stand. It cannot be right to leave decisions about who enters the country to people traffickers and other criminal networks. I support the measures that have been taken over the years to speed up the process, to reduce the number of fraudulent claims and, when practically possible, to remove those whose claims have failed. I&nbsp;welcome the fact that in the past few years, thanks to the efforts of the Prime Minister and successive Home Secretaries, we have begun to get to grips with what once seemed an intractable problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para1"><a name="stpa_123">I have said that to demonstrate that I am not a soft touch on asylum policy. However, I believe in combining a robust approach towards asylum with basic human decency, especially when young children are involved; that is the point of the debate. For some years I have been worried about the fact that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removing, to countries where they could face destitution, families with young children who, because of past failures in the processing system, have lived here for many years. I am referring not to children from countries where, although living standards might be low, there is a degree of stability, but to children from places such as Congo, Angola or southern Sudan, large parts of which have seen their social fabric disintegrate entirely.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para2"><a name="stpa_124">I am not talking about recent arrivals, either. I am talking about children who know no other life than ours&#151;children who, in some cases, were born here and have grown up alongside our children, played with them and shared the same classrooms. Whatever the sins of their parents, those children are entirely innocent and have no inkling of the fate that awaits them. They disappear from class without even a chance to say goodbye to their teachers and friends, and in many cases they are never heard of again. Sometimes the children reappear because of a hiccup in the removal system, only to disappear again a few months later. Who knows what becomes of them? On rare occasions there is a letter or a phone call about what happened next. Sometimes the news is good; at other times it is not. Usually, however, there is only silence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para3"><a name="stpa_125">To those of us who are&#151;or were&#151;members of the Government, the children tend to be only numbers. In a previous incarnation, I attended meetings at No. 10 and

the Home Office where there was talk of targets and tipping points. When it is sensible to do so, I have no problem with setting targets. Indeed, given the failures of the past, I am sure that it is necessary. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with human beings. Members of Parliament, especially those who represent areas such as mine, to which asylum seekers have been dispersed, have to look such people and their children in the eye, and to us they are not statistics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para4"><a name="stpa_126">I recall, as I expect we all can, some moving cases. Let us consider the little boy who was plucked from school in mid-term and who, in the hour that was left to him while his parents were hastily packing their meagre belongings and immigration officers were waiting to take them away, made out a will in which he wrote, &quot;I&nbsp;leave my Pok&#233;mon cards to so and so, and my Lego to so and so.&quot; It was found on his bed a few days later when friends came to find out why he had disappeared.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para5"><a name="stpa_127">I once successfully intervened on behalf of a young woman who was from southern Sudan originally, but who had come from a refugee camp in northern Kenya. She faced removal despite having been in the UK for some years and having given birth to a boy who was two years old by the time she was threatened with removal. As it correctly says on the Foreign Office website, the war in southern Sudan is over. However, anyone who has seen at first hand, as I have, the state of refugees returning to the south of Sudan, and the absence of facilities to cope with them, will know that to send there people who have tasted our lives here would be an act of great cruelty. I dread to think what would have become of that woman and her child had she been returned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para6"><a name="stpa_128">I am currently doing what I can to help a family who came from Angola in April 2001. The case prompted me to ask for this debate. The family have two boys. One is now aged eight, but he was three and a half when he came here. He is blind in one eye; according to his mother, that happened while she was being beaten with the buckle end of a belt by soldiers who were searching for his father. The boy was said by his teachers to be traumatised when first enrolled at a local school. The other son, who is now aged four, was born in the UK and knows no other life but ours.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para7"><a name="stpa_129">After years of delay, the parents&#039; claim for asylum has failed and they may now be returned to Angola at any time. They are well aware of the fate that awaits them there and are unlikely to be persuaded to return voluntarily. So far as I can see, the intention is just to drop them off at Luanda airport and wish them good luck. We are talking about people with few, if any, resources. The woman and the older boy were camped in a church when they were last in Angola, and the father was in hiding. What will become of them? Presumably they will join the millions of anonymous, displaced people in that tragic country.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para8"><a name="stpa_130">I know that it says on the Foreign Office website that the civil war in Angola is over, but it lasted for 27 years and much of the country is in ruins. The Angolan Government are unwilling or unable to provide even the most basic services for their citizens. Where such services do exist, they are mainly provided by foreign NGOs or United Nations agencies. Only about half of Angolan children receive any form of education, and

the country is ranked third in the world for infant mortality. Much of the population, including many people in the capital, is destitute or living on the edge of destitution. Violence and lawlessness are rampant, and justice is non-existent or arbitrary. The few functioning institutions are riddled with corruption.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para9"><a name="stpa_131">Sending there young children who have tasted our life and who, as in the case of the younger boy, know of no other life than ours, is an act of unpardonable cruelty. Needless to say, I have put all this to my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality&#151;and he is unmoved. In a letter dated 22&nbsp;November he wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;It would frustrate the proper and necessary object of immigration control in the more advanced states if people could not, save in the most exceptional circumstances, be returned to the less developed countries of the world.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para10"><a name="stpa_132">That is not, of course, what I am arguing, and I agree with what he says; I accept that just about all failed asylum seekers come from countries poorer than ours, and that it would be nonsense to argue that no one should be returned to such a country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para11"><a name="stpa_133">My point is a narrower one. First, I am talking about families with young children who have lived in the UK for years and who, in some cases, have been born here and know no other life. Secondly, I am talking about removals to a handful of the world&#039;s most dysfunctional countries, where living standards are not merely lower but catastrophically so, and where hunger and destitution awaits those children. As I have mentioned, child mortality in Angola is the third highest in the world.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para12"><a name="stpa_134">Thirdly, I am arguing that if we must return families to such countries, we should take some interest in what happens to them after they have disembarked. That might involve putting some money in their pockets, employing an NGO to see them safely through the airport and back to where they came from, and perhaps a little help with reintegrating. I do not argue that that should happen in every case, but only when young children are involved, and are at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para13"><a name="stpa_135">The Minister of State rejects that idea too. He wrote:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;We do not normally give returnees money, nor do we arrange for their reception in their country of nationality, or liaise with Non-Governmental Organisations as regards their future welfare.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para14"><a name="stpa_136">My question is: why not?
</p>






<p><a name="st_44"><a name="60110h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Neil Gerrard  (Walthamstow)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend recall that people who came to this country from Kosovo under the humanitarian evacuation programme were offered the opportunity to return to see what conditions were like? In many cases, that helped them decide that they could return.
</p>






<p><a name="st_45"><a name="60110h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : Yes, that was the case, and I am about to refer to one or two other exceptions. Perhaps they should form a model for what should be done in other cases. Is it really too much to ask that we should take some responsibility for the consequences of our actions, at least when young children are involved? It always strikes me as disingenuous that we go to enormous lengths to ensure that children are well treated in the distressing circumstances of immigration detention centres, yet do not take the slightest interest in what happens to them immediately afterwards.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 29WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para15"><a name="stpa_137">In any case, it would be misleading to suggest that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we never help returned asylum seekers. We do when it suits us. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) gave one example, and I&nbsp;am sure that the Minister will confirm that the first batch of failed asylum seekers returned to Afghanistan received help with reintegration&#151;and rightly so. Those were all single males. The same was true of the first batch of failed asylum seekers returned to northern Iraq; again, they were all single males.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para16"><a name="stpa_138">Let no one say that the Government have no powers: they do have powers. I draw the attention of the House to sections 58 and 59 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which were inserted partly at my suggestion&#151;at least, that is what the then Home Secretary told me in those far-off days when I had influence in the Home Office. Section 58 gives the Secretary of State power to provide assistance to those who leave voluntarily after they have exhausted their rights. Section 59 gives him power to provide funding to non-governmental organisations that assist with or ensure the return of migrants. In other words, there is no reason why the Home Office could not come to an arrangement with an NGO to help reintegrate families that are returned to countries such as Congo or Angola, whether or not they go back voluntarily. So far as I am aware, however, it has not done so, except in a handful of cases of failed asylum seekers&#151;all single males&#151;who were returned to Iraq and Afghanistan. Why is that?
</p>






<p><a name="st_46"><a name="60110h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alistair Carmichael  (Orkney and Shetland)</b>  (LD): May I tell the hon. Gentleman of an incident that was brought to my attention on Sunday afternoon by a constituent who is seeking asylum? She was offered a cash payment and financial assistance with flights if she returned to Burma, but she was worried about receiving such an offer, as she felt that she was in some way being bought off, and that she was coming under pressure. If such offers are to be made, they must be made with greater sensitivity than appears to be the case so far.
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60110h02_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : I certainly think that such offers should be made sensitively, but I cannot agree with the hon.&nbsp;Gentleman if he is suggesting that we should not make it clear to people that help can be given with voluntary passage home. Quite a few people opt to take that route, and others would if they were aware of it. It is a sensible approach to allow people to make up their minds about whether to take advantage of such an offer.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para17"><a name="stpa_139">I come back to my question. Given the existing powers, and given that we use them in some cases, why do we not use them in cases of the sort that I have outlined? What is stopping us? I entirely understand that Ministers are anxious to create an incentive for failed asylum seekers to return voluntarily, and there well may be a case for maintaining a differential between the assistance available to those who return voluntarily and those who are forcibly removed. However, I cannot accept that we should offer no help whatever to families who are forcibly removed to some of the world&#039;s most dysfunctional countries. My view is that in cases involving such countries, we should not remove children who have lived here for years and who are, for all practical purposes, British in all but name.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para18"><a name="stpa_140">I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the recent remarks of Professor Aynsley-Green, the Government-appointed Children&#039;s Commissioner for England, quoted in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 30WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>The&nbsp;Times</i> on 5 January, who described what is happening as outrageous in a civilised society. I stress again that the Professor is Government-appointed. He continued, saying that many of the children regarded themselves as English and could not understand why they were being treated as criminals.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para19"><a name="stpa_141">I put it to the Minister that where children are concerned, there is a case for tempering our new-found rigour towards asylum removals with a little basic humanity. Again, there is a precedent. In October 2003, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), the then Home Secretary, announced an amnesty for families who had been in this country for three years or more and


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;had suffered from historical delays in the system.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para20"><a name="stpa_142">The Angolan family to whom I referred earlier had the bad luck to fall six months short of that deadline. I&nbsp;do not argue that we should go as far as we did two years ago. I would be content for an amnesty on a case-by-case basis, applying only to long-staying families from the most dysfunctional countries&#151;and if the word &quot;amnesty&quot; offends the Minister, he need not even call it that. Far from being a sign of weakness, it would be evidence of a common humanity&nbsp;&nbsp;that would enjoy support across the political system. I look forward to hearing what hon. Members who speak for the other main parties have to say on that point. As we all know, it is much easier to make progress on asylum if there is cross-party consensus. We should not get ourselves into a position where one party is seeking to outbid the other for the favour of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Daily Express</i> or whatever.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para21"><a name="stpa_143">Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I repeat what I&nbsp;said at the outset. I am generally supportive of the Government&#039;s tough stand on asylum. Over the years I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have supported, in and out of government, all measures to speed up the process and eliminate abuses. As a Foreign Office Minister, I was involved in discussions about returns at the highest level to countries that are the source of many of our failed asylum seekers. I do not resile from that for one minute. All that I seek today is a little basic compassion when we are contemplating the return of families with young children to a handful of the world&#039;s most dysfunctional countries. We should not be returning to destitution children who have lived here so long that they know no other life than ours. Surely that is not too much to ask.

<a name="60110h02_para22"><a name="stpa_144">My hon. Friend spoke about Angola. I am chair of the all-party group on Angola, and last year I visited it with an Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation. What he says about the breakdown of civil society is correct. The problem is that, for whatever reasons, Angola has been through 30 years of the most appalling war, and there are an enormous number of orphan children. It is wrong to deport children back to that situation when there is no adequate follow-up, and no means by which the British embassy could find out what was happening to those children, even if it wanted to. My hon. Friend has drawn attention to that important point.

<p>
<a name="60110h02_para23"><a name="stpa_145">I represent an inner-London constituency with a large number of asylum seekers&#151;a place from which many people from all parts of the world have traditionally sought asylum over decades, stretching back for most of the last century. People have traditionally sought asylum from inner-London areas. Indeed, many later leaders of African countries have lived in that part of London.

<a name="60110h02_para24"><a name="stpa_146">My constituency asylum and immigration case load, like that of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and a number of other Members, is enormous. One is faced with families who have sought asylum in this country and have been here for a considerable time. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South correctly said, the children have grown up in this society and know nothing other than the multicultural society of inner London. For them suddenly to be told that they have got to go, and to be taken almost forcibly away and deported to a society that they have only heard about from their parents, is cruel in the extreme, heartless and damaging&#151;and they are then often placed in enormous danger. What kind of message does it send to other children in their school about justice, and about the society in which they are growing up, if it appears that such arbitrary justice can take place?

<a name="60110h02_para25"><a name="stpa_147">Although people who flee from places of danger and seek a place of safety in our country using the Geneva convention do so primarily for their own security, we should also remember that they are enormous contributors to our country. Asylum seekers want to work if they can, and those of them who have gained the right to work tend to work extremely hard and make an enormous contribution. We should be positive about that, as well as just saying that they are&#151;understandably&#151;seeking a place of safety.

<a name="60110h02_para26"><a name="stpa_148">I could cite many quotes from many bodies, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall refer to one organisation in particular.

<a name="60110h02_para29"><a name="stpa_151">Asylum applications are often dealt with entirely on the merits of the case for one or other&#151;or possibly both&#151;of the parents to remain in the country, but any understanding of the children&#039;s emotional needs, desires and wishes is completely forgotten. Some such children grow up in a frightened atmosphere. We in this House have a fairly secure existence; we know where we live and what we do, and where we will be next week and next year. All that many children of asylum-seeking families in this country hear their parents talking about is whether the Home Office will ever reply to their letter, whether they will be secure in this country, or whether their children will still be in school next month or next year. That has a debilitating effect on such children&#039;s lives; it is damaging to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para30"><a name="stpa_152">Something should be done about the speed and competence with which the Home Office deals with issues. I hold enormous advice bureau sessions, and I&nbsp;have lost count of the number of people who come along and ask, &quot;When is the Home Office ever going to reply to any letter that has been sent by anybody?&quot; A joke goes around about the letter that states that there will be a reply within 13 weeks: is that within 13 weeks this year, next year or the year after that? Such uncertainty has a grave effect on people. I look forward to the Minister assuring me that things are improving in that respect.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para31"><a name="stpa_153">The UK Government placed reservations on the UN convention on the rights of the child. I would be grateful if the Minister could say whether those reservations will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be withdrawn. The British Government are, understandably, determined to improve human rights around the world, and it is not good for them to keep a reservation in place in respect of that convention.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para32"><a name="stpa_154">My hon. Friend&#039;s debate is labelled as being about children, but I am not sure how one defines children. I&nbsp;suppose that the legal definition is people up to the age of 18. However, there is a serious problem to do with older children, such as young people in their late teens, or even in their early 20s&#151;almost adult children who, when their families are removed, may be able to stay. That too has a debilitating effect on them. I have watched the effects of family break-up in the Somali community and in others, when parents have been removed and older children have been left behind. That situation must be analysed as well, because it represents a serious problem in several cases and in several places.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para33"><a name="stpa_155">My hon. Friend mentioned the Children&#039;s Commissioner&#039;s statement, and it is important to quote from it. The commissioner calls on the Government


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;to make sure that asylum-seeking children and young people are treated as children by those involved at every stage of the asylum process&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para34"><a name="stpa_156">The statement goes on to raise specific concerns about

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para35"><a name="stpa_157">about detention, and about the way in which unannounced raids and other activities have taken place. I hope that when the Minister replies, he can provide us with some hope and reassurance about those matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para36"><a name="stpa_158">There are many disturbing stories in the papers about the fast-tracking of asylum decisions. I have complained about the delays in responding to inquiries and dealing with ongoing cases. I do that because I want the system 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 33WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to be seen to be working fairly and efficiently. At present, I do not think that it is. However, to try to get round the problem by suddenly introducing a fast-track system might create more injustices and dangers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para37"><a name="stpa_159">Maeve Sherlock, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, expressed her concerns, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;The casework system is good in principle, but justice and speed can pull in opposite directions. To work properly, the new asylum model will need well-trained staff, legal advice on the spot and a more open mindset. Asylum seekers need to know what&#039;s happening to them and why.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para38"><a name="stpa_160">Again, I look forward to hearing what the Minister says about that, because it appears that as many as one third of all asylum seekers could face detention under the fast-track procedure. That will undoubtedly have a serious effect on children.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para39"><a name="stpa_161">I presume that Barnardo&#039;s has sent many Members its report about the situation facing children. That report describes confusion and concern, and it is critical of how section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004 operates. If we want people to live decently in our society, children to achieve well in school and their parents to contribute, why on earth do we operate section 9, which is designed to leave numbers of people in destitution? It cannot be good for anybody.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para40"><a name="stpa_162">There is a big campaign concerning the Sukula family, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who live in Bolton. That is just one case in which a campaign is ongoing. Many other cases are ongoing at the same time on the same issue.
</p>






<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60110h02_spnew6"><b> Dr. Brian Iddon  (Bolton, South-East)</b>  (Lab): I apologise for being late, Mrs. Humble; I went to the wrong room. I am pleased that my hon. Friend mentioned the Sukula family, who came to Britain in early 2002 with four children and now have six children. Does he agree that in such cases it is difficult to return the family, as two of the children have not even known the Congo and the others, who came to Britain in early 2002, were probably too young to remember much about it? I hope that my hon. Friend agrees that it is unfair to return such families. Does he support my view that the Minister ought to consider extending the amnesty for families with children beyond its closing date, particularly for families who have been in this country for almost four years?
</p>






<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60110h02_spnew7"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I agree with him. There is a campaign surrounding that case, and I support the family and the campaign, as I am sure he does. They are not the only family and theirs is not the only case; there are others who unfortunately do not have the benefit of campaigns to support them. It is heartless, cruel and unfair to remove from this country, children who have known nothing other than being born and brought up here. It is damaging to them&#151;and, as I said earlier, to other children. The scheme in the north-west is a pilot, and I&nbsp;would be grateful if the Minister said something about its progress and whether it will end or be extended.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para41"><a name="stpa_163">My final general point&#151;I know that other hon. Members want to speak&#151;concerns countries to which families with children are deported. After an assertive campaign the Government finally stopped all deportations to Zimbabwe, and I understand that that is the current situation. My constituency includes people 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 34WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
from all parts of the world, and I am particularly concerned about two countries to which removals take place. The first is Congo and the second is Somalia.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para42"><a name="stpa_164">The war in Congo has had less coverage than almost any other conflict anywhere in the world, yet 3 million people have died there in the past decade. That is a level of casualties on a par with the first world war. Congo has a transitional Government, but the war is clearly continuing, particularly in the east of the country. There is a collapse of civil society and of any supportive environment, and it is impossible to follow what happens to any individual family that returns to Congo. I hope that the Minister recognises that it cannot be fair, right or just to deport anyone to Congo until there is some measure of peace there. Taking a child out of a school in Britain and dropping them in Congo with no follow-up whatever cannot be right, fair or just.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para43"><a name="stpa_165">Likewise, there is continuing grave instability in Mogadishu in south Somalia. I am not clear whether there are removals to Somalia and I would be grateful if the Minister could resolve that question one way or the other. I have objected when removals have been threatened against my constituents, but I am not clear whether there is a policy on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para44"><a name="stpa_166">My last point is about following up what happens to those who are removed from this country. The Home Office has its own in-country assessment unit, the Foreign Office makes a diplomatic assessment of the situation in any one country, and Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the United Nations and a number of other organisations make their own assessments of what goes on in various countries. Except in Kosovo, to which my hon. Friends the Members for Sunderland, South and for Walthamstow referred, I am not aware of any adequate follow-up in any other country when removals take place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para45"><a name="stpa_167">If someone has sought safety or asylum in this country and the application fails, for whatever reason, or a human rights application fails, for whatever reason, and a family is deported, we have at least a moral responsibility to ensure that they are in some degree of safety when they return to their society. If children who are growing up and attending school in this country are suddenly removed to a place of great danger, they deserve at least to be monitored so that we can try to help them and perhaps review deportation policy in specific cases. The way in which children are treated in many parts of the world is appalling and terrible. We contribute to much of that if we take children away from a place of safety in this country to a place of danger, and then pretend that it has nothing to do with us after that. It has everything to do with us, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South has done the House a service in securing this debate.

Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), who is a fine fellow, what I am most concerned about is the disappointing absence of the Minister of State responsible for policy in this area. I am sure that when my hon. Friend returns to the Home Office he will convey to him the sentiments expressed here today, but I would have liked to do that in person.
</p>






<p><a name="st_53"><a name="60110h02_spnew10"><b> John Robertson </b> : I agree, but in defence of the Minister of State, I must tell my hon. Friend that he has been to Glasgow on several occasions. On one prolonged recent visit he took considerable time to talk to Members of Parliament and the people most affected by the removals. I will commend him for doing that, while chastising him for not being here today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para46"><a name="stpa_168">It is pleasing to see the hon. Members for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) and for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) here today. It would be even more pleasing if those Members went back and asked their local councils to take on board the job that Glasgow city council took on in allowing asylum seekers to come to our friendly city, where I believe that they are looked after better than in any other city in the country. It would be more pleasing if the rest of Scotland, instead of getting on board the discussion on asylum, got on with trying to look after those people&#151; giving them a home and welcoming them into society. That is my little plea for Glasgow and against the rest of Scotland.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para47"><a name="stpa_169">A lot of press coverage north of the border, including the extracts in the excellent information pack that has been put together for today&#039;s debate, mentions Glasgow in particular. Yet some press statements that are emerging, by people who have been shouting the most against what has been happening to asylum seekers in the Glasgow area, are, unfortunately, from outside that area. Sad as it is, they have done very little to help alleviate the problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para48"><a name="stpa_170">There are many points on which we can agree. We all agree that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) said, we have a moral obligation to look after refugees&#151;genuine refugees, that is. We need to adjust the asylum process to establish who is entitled, and everybody undergoing that process must be treated fairly and have access to a full range of services. Everyone who meets the asylum criteria must be welcomed fully into our society. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North did not actually say those words, but I am sure that is what he meant in saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those people offer much to the multicultural development of the UK. They add many of their cultures to ours and will make the UK a better place in the long run. It is to be hoped that parties such as the British National party will then find no place in our society.

</p>

they be returned to their country of origin? Or, as some would say, should they be allowed to remain here no matter what the circumstances? Those are the questions that we must raise in this debate. They have already been raised in certain ways, and I hope to add to that debate in my short contribution.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para50"><a name="stpa_172">It is clear that the asylum system needs to be examined and improved. None the less, many people who come to this country to seek asylum make applications that are utterly unfounded. They seek to use the system to remain here, and eventually to benefit from an amnesty. I am against the amnesties that have been called for. As a result of amnesties&#151;which have caused me many problems as an MP trying to deal with asylum cases&#151;many people suddenly come out of the woodwork, as it were, and try to stay here when they should never have been allowed to stay in the first place. They had disappeared into the country, when they should probably have been removed at the outset.
</p>






<p><a name="st_54"><a name="60110h02_spnew11"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : I was not aware that there was an amnesty; I thought that 2,000 pre-existing family applications were to be reviewed, possibly with a more sympathetic approach than might be used in other cases. So far as I am aware, there is no general amnesty&#151;although there may well be a case for one, and I might well support such a scheme.
</p>






<p><a name="st_55"><a name="60110h02_spnew12"><b> John Robertson </b> : I thank my hon. Friend; he has put that much better than I did, and he is absolutely correct. There was no general amnesty as such, but there was certainly a slackening of the rules to allow people who have been here a long time to stay.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para51"><a name="stpa_173">I can understand the arguments of immigration officials. I have been to the immigration service in Glasgow with asylum seekers many times to talk to officials and try to alleviate the misunderstandings created&#151;in some cases, maliciously&#151;between people seeking asylum and the immigration service. Unfortunately, there are those in our society who seem to want to use the subject of asylum for their own political ends, and I find that totally abhorrent. Whenever I can, I denounce those parties. They know who they are; they are on the extreme right or extreme left of our society, and as far as I am concerned, they have no place in British politics. I hope that we shall weed them out. They do no service to people who genuinely seek asylum, and who ask their MPs to solve their problems and help them to remain in the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para52"><a name="stpa_174">By the time the media take control, they have totally distorted the actualities of the case. By the time the case gets to the Home Office, the Home Office has been put in an intolerable position. Eventually the people concerned are removed, although in some cases I know that I could probably have saved them if they had got to me first, and had not got involved in a series of lies and stories given to them by certain people. That has to be investigated&#151;but the Home Office and its officials, too, have to think seriously about the information that they give out.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para53"><a name="stpa_175">I appreciate that many of the details that the Home Office receives are personal and should not be revealed to the general public, but if someone goes to the press and gives their whole life story, as they see it, in support of their case for remaining here, I feel that the Home 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 37WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Office should be entitled to give the story as it sees it, too. It is also important that it should give the hows and whens of the enforced removals. We want to know why people have been removed at a particular time, after having been four, five or six years in this country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North has described.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para54"><a name="stpa_176">I commend Drumchapel high school in my constituency. The students there have won many awards, and many of them are from asylum-seeking families. They have done work to promote and campaign not just for themselves and their families but for other children from such families, and they should be commended. It is pleasant to see children taking an interest in what happens in everyday life, rather than just worrying about whether they will get the new PlayStation or Xbox or whatever, which is all that some young people care about. It is a pleasure to see that they care about each other and their fellow pupils. Long may it continue, and long may the students keep giving me a hard time. They come to my office and ask me why this happens and why that happens.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para55"><a name="stpa_177">We politicians need to look at ourselves, too. I have a quote from one of my colleagues from Glasgow who is a Member of the Scottish Parliament. In a statement about a family who were allegedly thrown out of their home in a so-called dawn raid, he said:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;They don&#039;t really understand the issue. We are asked to go along in these situations in order to assist immigration officers. The bottom line is that we don&#039;t know what we are walking into. It can go from being very quiet to a frantic affair within minutes and they therefore wear protecting clothing for that.&quot;</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para59"><a name="stpa_181">That is the kind of information that the Home Office should give us. They must tell us what happened when they removed a family. I want to know if the removal was easy or hard, what kind of force was needed and why, how many people were there, and what time it was. That is simple information, which any Member of Parliament would want to know about something that had happened in their constituency. If I found that something had gone wrong, that would give me the opportunity to try to do something about it. I would be grateful if the Minister would take that on board, talk to his officials and try to get something done about it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para60"><a name="stpa_182">Talk of children being handcuffed is very distressing. However, I have been to the immigration service and heard some of the horror stories from its side, of parents hurling children at officers who are there to remove them. The question would then be: should we take the children from the parents in the first place? Are those responsible parents? Sometimes such questions are addressed, and it does happen that children are removed from asylum-seeking parents. Those children are now part of our society, because the parents were incapable, or did not want to look after them in the first place.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60110h02_para61"><a name="stpa_183">We need to be told about such things. There are people in our society who are living and working, have been part of the system and are happy to be here. We may not want to know who they are, but we certainly want to know the numbers of such cases. The story is not always bad news.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para62"><a name="stpa_184">I would be grateful if the Minister, in describing the procedures, could put some more meat on the bones of the thought behind the removals&#151;although of course, he may not know about that. Why, after four and a half years, do we suddenly come to the decision that a family must be removed today?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para63"><a name="stpa_185">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland talked about a more responsible way of removing people. Surely there must be a more humane way. I do not think that there is a humane way of removing any family that has been here for such a long time, but there must be a better way. I understand why the early morning visits happen. They may not be dawn raids as such, but people certainly go early in the morning and, if they go back, I&nbsp;know that that is because they can be sure that the family is in situ in the house at the time. I understand that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para64"><a name="stpa_186">Part of the main problem is that&#151;as many have said here today&#151;children are the innocent bystanders. They just happen to be there, or happen to be born, yet they bear the brunt of the removals. We should show some kind of sympathy, but the parents have to take the responsibility. It is not the Government&#039;s fault that people are here illegally. They have been told, I am assured, on many occasions that they can have an assisted passage back to their country of origin or they can make their own way back. They are told almost from the moment that they arrive in the country that if they refuse to do so, at the end of the process they will be removed. It is unfair to say that those people&#151;those parents&#151;did not know that they would be removed. They did know.

<a name="60110h02_para66"><a name="stpa_188">Why has that suddenly happened? Is it just that we have better doctors and psychiatrists to examine the cases, and people are referred to them more? Or is it because the judicial system now sees such an approach as a good way of keeping people in the country, so people are schooled in how to talk to psychiatrists? I&nbsp;would be interested in examining the figures. Did we not have psychiatrists three or four years ago? Have they suddenly come on to the market in the past few years?

In every other case, however, the people have strong psychiatric problems, and for them to be removed and sent home would apparently do them and their family immeasurable harm.

Friend the Member for Islington, North made a good point about how long cases can take, so that people stay in the UK for years. We tell families whose kids have been in school for five years to take them out and go home. Has the Minister examined the judicial system in Scotland, where a judicial review takes 18 months? South of the border a judicial review takes about six weeks. Is it any wonder that people who may be trying to abuse the system would like to come to Scotland? If they obtain a judicial review, it will take 18 months not to finish that review but for them to be allowed to go for it. Then they can bring new evidence, and they suddenly find another reason why they should get another judicial review. Such an approach stretches out the process to many years.

Friend the Member for Islington, North about fast-tracking and the change in the system to make it quicker. We are talking about enforced removals, and in the case that has been mentioned we would expect things to be quicker. This is why we are getting the enforced removals now: we have caught up with the backlog. We are discussing the cases of people who were left to sit in the house all day, where the kids went to school and college, and got an education but could not do anything else in terms of work. In relation to enforcement, we are talking about people who have been here for a few years.

It is certainly not helpful to those of us in this place who have to work with the Home Office to defend people. It is difficult to defend a case when it has been in the press and everybody has already made up their mind about what should be done.

Should we separate children from their parents? Should we remove the whole family or let them all stay?

My worries about removals are similar to those of the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson). The process is causing great consternation in Scotland. One of the questions posed continually during the recent tranche of high-profile removals involving children to which reference has been made was about enhanced disclosure through Disclosure Scotland for the immigration and police officers. Obviously, enhanced disclosure is required from Disclosure Scotland for anyone who works closely with children or vulnerable adults categorised in a certain way&#151;and, in the case of asylum seekers with children, where there are the mental and psychiatric difficulties that have been described. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that the Minister can tell us whether the immigration and police officers in attendance were covered by enhanced disclosure from Disclosure Scotland.

<a name="60110h02_para72"><a name="stpa_194">Has the Minister been advised about the guidelines for the number of uniformed immigration and police officers required in such circumstances? I shall come to what Norrie Flowers of the Scottish Police Federation said about the use of body armour, but if the reports are to be believed, the number of immigration and police officers in attendance is in the high teens, which may seem excessive for a routine removal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para73"><a name="stpa_195">We can only imagine the trauma experienced by young children when woken in their own beds by a uniformed officer, not by their parents, and finding a large number of uniformed people in the bedroom. Will the Minister explain the rationale behind the removal of different family members in separate vehicles? Children see their fathers and perhaps older siblings being removed in separate vehicles. What about the use of handcuffs? I hope that he can contradict me, but the use of handcuffs for adult men and boys in their late teens appears to be routine; if he tells me that that is not the case, I shall be delighted.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para74"><a name="stpa_196">It would also be useful if the Minister could explain the procedures for the use of handcuffs in such circumstances. Has the Department done any assessment of the overall impact on children involved in the process? If so, could it be made available? The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West suggested that we needed more information from the Home Office about the procedures and protocols of the removal process&#151;concerning the separate vehicles, the body armour, the handcuffs and so forth. That would be helpful for us all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para75"><a name="stpa_197">The processes that I have described have been well documented and well reported, although in some cases with a little hyperbole in certain quarters. I shall not repeat the more hysterical remarks that have been printed in the press. None the less, the process and the removals have upset a great many people. They have led the children&#039;s commissioner for Scotland, Kathleen Marshall, to suggest that the process terrorises children. I mention that because she is a sane, rational, intelligent professional woman doing a particular job. This is her role. I am not quoting some of the maddies on the ultra-left, but someone in a very specific position.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para76"><a name="stpa_198">Dr. Marshall said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;I&#039;ve become increasingly distressed by the inhumane methods of removal of children and families from Scotland. What can happen is immigration officers and police, big groups of them, 11 to 14, go to a family&#039;s house at seven o&#039;clock in the morning, sometimes earlier, and waken the children in their beds. The officers in bullet proof vests&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>




</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para78"><a name="stpa_200">Those are genuine and legitimate concerns for the children&#039;s commissioner, and they led the Lib-Lab First Minister in Scotland, Jack McConnell, to seek an asylum protocol. The BBC reported that he had asked the Home Office to involve Scottish education and social services when it deports and removes the families from their homes. I would add that the children&#039;s commissioner should be involved in any discussions about the procedures and processes for the removal of families, particularly those with children.

He said that he broadly supported the immigration and asylum system, but that the issue was about specific countries. Like him, I would support a case-by-case review of certain cases in certain circumstances. I hope that the Minister will take on board the genuine anxieties felt by many people awaiting removal and deportation. Their Members of Parliament have anxieties, and many other people feel concerns about the process. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some of the questions that I have put to him.

Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) on securing this debate. He spoke not just with tremendous knowledge but with great compassion. He gave the example of his constituent&#039;s child writing a will and leaving his Pok&#233;mon cards. As a parent whose house is littered with those cards, I found that particularly poignant. The hon. Gentleman rightly presented a tightly focused argument in relation to highly dysfunctional countries such as Congo, Angola and southern Sudan&#151;to which I&nbsp;would add Burma, and other Members could add other countries. I hope that the Minister will address his specific concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para82"><a name="stpa_204">The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robertson) made an interesting contribution about the forced removal of children, particularly young children. He rightly put forward the concerns of immigration officers and police officers, and I do not argue with what he says about the difficulties facing those public servants in such situations. However, I&nbsp;cannot go along with his conclusion, because in creating policy that affects children, our primary consideration must always be the best interests of the child. That is the test that we apply for our own children, and I cannot countenance a different standard or approach being adopted for the children of others.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60110h02_spnew21"><b> John Robertson </b> : I understand what the hon.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60110h02_spnew22"><b> Mr. Carmichael </b> : There is an old expression about visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children, and that is perhaps the situation here. However, I am not in as direct a conflict with the hon. Gentleman as he might have thought from my introductory remarks, because I&nbsp;think that the fault lies with the system. That system was graphically described by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn). It seems not only to produce delays, but actively to encourage them, and there are often significant delays.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para83"><a name="stpa_205">I remember an earlier Westminster Hall debate when the present Chief Secretary to the Treasury was the Minister of State responsible for asylum matters; it took place back in the good old days when Ministers of State used to attend such debates. He said that delay was the asylum seekers&#039; best friend. In many ways he is right, because that can leave asylum applicants in a situation where they have an expanding family, with children who have never lived anywhere else, who feel themselves to be British in every respect, and who are well integrated with their local communities. Tackling that delay must be at the heart of addressing the problems that have been highlighted. We have so-called dawn raids, the enforced removal process and delays, and they are all products of a system that is dysfunctional and requires to be fundamentally examined.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para84"><a name="stpa_206">The hon. Member for Sunderland, South made a telling point about the need for what might be loosely called &quot;after care&quot; for those who have been returned, especially to highly dysfunctional countries such as Congo. That is an exceptionally sound suggestion; we have substantial overseas business even in those very different dysfunctional countries, and there should be no reason why the Government should not be prepared to provide that. If they have confidence in their decision-making process that has returned a person in the first place, they should be prepared to back that up by offering some sort of after care and review to ensure&#151;for quality control, if for no other reason&#151;that the correct decision has been taken.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para85"><a name="stpa_207">Several Members have spoken about their experiences as MPs, and I shall leave the Minister with a final matter that has caused me some difficulty. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) brought to my attention a case that came up in his constituency in the course of the general election campaign. Neither he nor Lorna Fitzsimons, his predecessor, was allowed to make representations, because neither of them was a Member of Parliament at the time; during the period of Dissolution there is no such thing. Can the Minister tell me that that was a one-off aberration, and that that sort of nicety will not be used routinely by the Home Office and the immigration and nationality directorate to ensure that representations are not heard?

Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) on illuminating this part of the asylum debate. I part company from him on the subject of feeling in any way slighted by the presence of the Minister that the Home Office has sent to answer the debate. In starting the debate, the hon. Gentleman made the good point that in some areas progress can be made only on a cross-party basis. He will understand that I am

in my early days as immigration spokesman for my party, but I can assure him, and the Chamber, that I see my role as helping to create a civilised and credible immigration and asylum policy for the Conservative party. That is what I will seek to work towards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para86"><a name="stpa_208">The debate has illuminated one corner of the tangled web that is the Government&#039;s asylum policy. To continue the metaphor, it is a corner where the web has holes through which innocent people&#151;young children&#151;can fall, and are falling. What has stood out in this debate, as well as in the research that I have done&#151;as others have done, I commend the debate pack prepared by the Library&#151;is the obvious emotive resonance of every case that comes up in this area. Every case is a hard case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para87"><a name="stpa_209">That is an observable fact from my constituency experience in east Kent, which for years has been at the sharp end of asylum cases involving people coming in to the country. A few years ago there was an overwhelming preponderance of hostility towards all kinds of asylum seekers, which over the years has been markedly tempered by the rise of cases of families who have become part of the community, and who have become liked and respected and, in particular, have put down roots with local schools. The temperature of the debate in that part of the world has significantly changed in recent years. The sort of problems that the hon. Gentleman illustrated with one family being deported to Angola apply to many families being deported to a number of countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para88"><a name="stpa_210">The debate has been gratifyingly devoid of the emotional grandstanding that has clearly gone on in some cases in Scotland. We have heard contributions from Scottish colleagues on both sides of the Chamber. The Library debate pack makes it clear that the debate on some cases in Scotland has contributed a lot more heat than light.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para89"><a name="stpa_211">It is possible coherently&#151;although I think wrongly&#151;to believe that no child should ever be removed. However, like the hon. Member for Sunderland, South, I do not agree with that belief&#151;for good humane reasons. If that became the case in this country, it might, among other things, encourage the human trafficking of children and encourage families who had no right to seek asylum here to do so. The second-order effects of taking that kind of radical policy position would be counter-productive for children.
</p>






<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60110h02_spnew24"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that although we all deplore human trafficking, there are occasions when parents are so desperate for the safety of their children in a war-torn society that they are prepared to do anything to get them to a place of safety, including paying bribes and giving money to traffickers to get the children to this country?
</p>






<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60110h02_spnew25"><b> Damian Green </b> : I recognise that, but it does not obviate my point that a blanket position that no child would ever be deported might do more harm than good.

<p>
<a name="60110h02_para90"><a name="stpa_212">So far, I have been rather sympathetic to the Government&#039;s position and the problems facing Ministers in policy making. I am indeed sympathetic to those who have to take decisions in every individual case, but there are legitimate questions to be asked and criticisms to be made of the Government&#039;s current

<br>&nbsp;<br>
position. I echo the point made by the hon. Member for Sunderland, South concerning the organisation in the host countries for those who are sent back. Common humanity should dictate that some kind of decent reception is organised as a matter of course, and clearly that does not happen at present, not only in the particularly dangerous countries the hon. Gentleman mentioned, but in many other places.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para91"><a name="stpa_213">I also echo a point made by Save the Children relating to the detention, rather than the removal, of children&#151;although it applies even more strongly if a child is to be removed. Decent pastoral care of the child should be organised before the removal happens. From a child&#039;s point of view, it would be even more inhumane if such a thing were to happen out of the blue than it would if they had some knowledge and explanation beforehand. That does not happen often enough.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para92"><a name="stpa_214">My third point concerns the length of time it takes the Home Office to respond to contact from families&#151;a point that was also raised by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn). I have seen no improvement in recent months and years, but I hope that the Minister can produce some figures to show that my anecdotal experience is wrong.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para93"><a name="stpa_215">My fourth and most general point concerns the time for which families are in this country before their case is decided. For a young child, every month that passes is a significant amount of time, during which normality is established. For such children, three or four years living in one town in one country is literally half a lifetime. That is why it is legitimate to criticise the Government for the administrative failures that still bedevil the asylum system, which forced them to introduce the amnesty&#151;if we can use that word&#151;to reduce the numbers of those here illegally to manageable proportions.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para94"><a name="stpa_216">In that context, I would like to ask the Minister some questions designed to inform us about the scale of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem that remains. The hon. Member for Sunderland, South has at times suggested extending the amnesty time beyond the three-year period. I am not sure whether I agree with the idea of individual case-by-case extensions because we need certainty in this area for the families.
</p>






<p><a name="st_69"><a name="60110h02_spnew26"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : Country by country, perhaps.
</p>






<p><a name="st_70"><a name="60110h02_spnew27"><b> Damian Green </b> : The hon. Gentleman specifically suggested doing that on the basis of countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para95"><a name="stpa_217">Will the Minister tell us how many children are covered by the amnesty in its current form? How many extra children would be covered if it were extended by one or two years? I appreciate that he may not have the exact figures to hand, but they could be provided for him.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para96"><a name="stpa_218">According to the Home Office press release of 22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November, the five nationalities accounting for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most removals are Serbia and Montenegro, Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan. Are those also the countries to which most children are being removed? If not, to which countries are children most likely to be removed? With which of those countries does the Minister think that we have satisfactory reception arrangements when children are returned? That is particularly important for unaccompanied children, but it applies to children as part of a family as well.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 46WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para97"><a name="stpa_219">The next question relates to those not covered by the amnesty. The Government&#039;s estimate of those living here illegally is a fairly elastic figure. The central figure is 430,000, but I understand that it could be 310,000 or 570,000. How many of those are children, according to the Government&#039;s best estimate? That is perhaps the most important number for all concerned with the issue, because without it we can have no real feel for the scale of the problem. We all agree that every individual forced removal of a child is a desperately hard case in which emotions will run very high, so it is vital that we develop policy on a factual basis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para98"><a name="stpa_220">The point at which the desire to run a properly managed asylum and immigration system runs directly into the natural instincts of common humanity and generosity of spirit is precisely the issue raised by this debate. I genuinely have sympathy for the Minister and his colleagues, who have to make the decisions, but the underlying problem will be solved only if the system works efficiently. It has not worked well enough in the past few years, and as long as it does not work, there will be more hard cases. Each hard case that involves the removal of children threatens to become an individual tragedy, so simply carrying on as before is not acceptable.

hyperbolic language is used at both extremes, whether to demonise those who come to this country to seek asylum or, at the other end of the spectrum, in comments about the nature of enforcement operations and the staff who carry them out.

<a name="60110h02_para102"><a name="stpa_224">Let me make it clear to my hon. Friend that Ministers&#151;including the Minister of State&#151;would prefer no enforced returns to any country, and particularly no enforced returns of children. We would prefer to persuade and encourage people with no basis of stay or leave to remain in the country to leave voluntarily. That would be better for all concerned. Clearly it would be better for the Home Office, but it would also allow people to leave with more dignity and at a time of their choosing. That is a preferable outcome for all concerned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para103"><a name="stpa_225">We must do more. Responding to the issues raised by the National Audit Office report on returns, we must do more to encourage people to return voluntarily. I draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South the fact that later this week my hon.&nbsp;Friend the Minister of State will put forward more proposals on precisely that subject. His statement will deal with helping reintegration in society and providing more assistance, and will address some of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para104"><a name="stpa_226">The broader picture relates to international development concerns that go beyond the remit of the Home Office. As my hon. Friend knows, the asylum system does not deal with the economic hardship, conditions or development of some of the most deprived countries in the world. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) said, the system must follow the terms of the 1951 convention on refugees. We do not forget about nor draw a veil over those conditions. They are important, and that is why we must work closely with the Department for International Development on these issues.

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60110h02_spnew29"><b> Andy Burnham </b> : I have taken that point in the course of the debate. As my hon. Friend probably knows from his experience in office, the numbers returning to those countries are by definition quite small, because of the dysfunctional nature of some states. We are talking about a small number of people.
</p>






<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60110h02_spnew30"><b> Mr. Mullin </b> : We are, indeed&#151;which makes the situation much easier to deal with.
</p>






<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60110h02_spnew31"><b> Andy Burnham </b> : I have heard the points that my hon. Friend has made, and I shall reflect on them with my hon. Friend the Minister of State.
</p>






<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60110h02_spnew32"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60110h02_spnew33"><b> Andy Burnham </b> : I do not have much time, but I will give way once.
</p>






<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60110h02_spnew34"><b> Jeremy Corbyn </b> : I recognise that the Minister has time problems, and if he cannot answer all the points in his 10 minutes, perhaps he could write to us about them. In specific terms, I should be interested to hear his views on the Congo, Somalia and the British Government&#039;s attitude to the way in which the convention on the rights of the child is operated.
</p>






<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60110h02_spnew35"><b> Andy Burnham </b> : I shall seek to explain that in the short time that I have left, but first let me draw together a few points that people have made. My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South talked about basic human decency. Of course, that is what we should all strive to achieve. No system is beyond improvement, and by visiting Scotland my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality is engaging in precisely that debate, to see how we can respond to the concerns that have been expressed and create a system in which we can all have confidence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para105"><a name="stpa_227">However, there is a choice. At the end of the day, if the system is based on a series of rules, at some point the rules must be enforced. If we accept that, the debate shifts to how we do that as humanely as possible, respecting the basic humanity of all citizens. I would argue that that is happening now. Much intemperate language is used about the operations of the immigration service. Some of its public servants are carrying out some of the most difficult responsibilities on our behalf. We do not have an open-door immigration system, and I have not heard that any party in this House favours such a system. If we accept that, it follows that we must support the people who in challenging circumstances implement the system on behalf of the citizens of this country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h02_para106"><a name="stpa_228">Those public servants deserve our support. That is not to say that we should not consider the practicalities of what they are doing on the ground; of course we should. We are sensitive to the points that have been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie); we certainly do not use handcuffs routinely, and we certainly do not use them on children. We assess the risks involved in each operation to try to ensure that the scale of the operation is proportionate to the risk presented. We balance all those issues and we seek to improve all the time, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that some of the scare stories are not backed up by the reality. I urge everyone to consider the reality.

That is a good suggestion, and I shall consider it. Every Member of this House should be given the information if they want particular facts about the way in which an enforcement operation was carried out, so that there can be a local debate on what actually happened, and we can debate such matters in an informed and considered way.

<a name="60110h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme</h3>

<a name="time_16">
<a name="60110h03_time0"><h5>12.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60110h03_spnew0"><b> Hugh Robertson  (Faversham and Mid-Kent)</b>  (Con): I&nbsp;welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale, for this debate on the Kentish fruit industry, about which you no doubt know a great deal. I also welcome the Minister and thank him for taking the time to respond to this short debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para0"><a name="stpa_230">By way of introduction, let me say that I represent what I believe is the only remaining constituency in Britain in which fruit farming is the predominant type of agriculture. The county of Kent owes its reputation as the garden of England to that industry. I made my maiden speech on the subject in July 2001, when the Minister and I entered the House together, and since then I have served as secretary of the all-party group on the fruit industry. I asked for this debate, in the tradition of Westminster Hall, on behalf of my constituents, but it deals with concerns affecting the entire fruit sector.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para1"><a name="stpa_231">Why is the seasonal agricultural workers scheme so important? To put it bluntly, without labour there is no means of picking the fruit that we grow. Labour accounts for between 40 and 60 per cent. of a fruit farmer&#039;s cost base and almost all the labour comes through SAWS. It follows that if the scheme is restricted in any way, the UK fruit industry will collapse. That will have enormous consequences for the wider local economy because there are jobs all over Kent in transport and marketing related to the fruit industry and in tourism. It will have enormous consequences for the environment, both locally, where orchards will be grubbed up, and nationally and internationally as alternative produce is sourced from abroad. It will have considerable consequences for Government policy, as well. The Government have launched schemes such as the healthy eating initiative, the five-a-day scheme and the fruit for schools scheme. Finally, it will have consequences for SAWS students, who benefit enormously financially and from the knowledge and experience that they gain of living and working in Britain. Almost none of them abscond at the end of the scheme.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para2"><a name="stpa_232">This debate takes place against a backdrop of a Home Office review and I believe that a decision is due at the end of January. My aim this morning is to convince the Minister of three key points, the first of which is that fruit farming needs to be encouraged. It is important for the local economy, it produces high-quality produce close to the marketplace that is vital to a healthier diet and so on, and it is good for the environment. It deserves our support. Secondly&#151;this is crucial&#151;SAWS is not an immigration or asylum issue and should not be confused with either. Finally, SAWS is a welcome success story. It is a well managed and trouble-free scheme, which brings enormous benefits to the United Kingdom and, critically, to the students who participate in it. It needs to be encouraged and improved in the years ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para3"><a name="stpa_233">SAWS was set up after world war two to encourage European workers to take up short-term employment in agriculture and horticulture. It has always been aimed primarily at students at agricultural colleges or who have experience of the agricultural sector. In 2004, 25,000 students from outside the EU visited the UK to work on our farms and to learn our language and about 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 51WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
our culture. Sadly, that number was reduced to only 16,000 in 2005 and the future of the scheme is now being reviewed as the Home Office launches a five-year plan to simplify the immigration system. The concern felt by many of my fruit farmers is that some people in government believe that the recent enlargement of the EU will provide a sufficient pool of low-skilled labour to replace SAWS students. That is emphatically not the case for the following five reasons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para4"><a name="stpa_234">First, SAWS is a well established and successful scheme. The model of students visiting the UK and gaining work experience and understanding of Britain has worked well for more than 40 years. SAWS is well managed, all operators are licensed by the Home Office and all participating farms are carefully monitored. The Home Office administers the scheme without difficulty and there is a simple fee to cover the costs. The fact that all the participants are students means that they have to return to their own country to complete their studies at the end of their time here. A parliamentary written answer tabled recently revealed that less than 1 per cent. of SAWS students ever abscond, so the scheme does not present any threat to immigration and asylum policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para5"><a name="stpa_235">Secondly, there is a proven need for exactly that type of temporary labour force. Quite apart from what I said about the need to encourage fruit farming, the Government recognise the importance of the scheme. In 2002, the Home Office White Paper on managed migration, &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain&quot;, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">&quot;There is a clear need for short-term casual labour. Although this comprises only a small proportion of all employment in the UK, it is important in industries such as agriculture. We will look again at the operation of the long-standing Seasonal Agricultural Workers&#039; Scheme (SAWS) to see how it might better meet the needs of the agricultural sector. We will build on its principles to meet the demand for short-term casual labour in other sectors of the United Kingdom economy.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para6"><a name="stpa_236">A couple of years ago, the Curry report recommended that the number of places on the scheme be increased to 50,000&#151;double the peak of 25,000 in 2004. The White Paper suggests a mechanism for any sector to prove the need for labour, entirely based on SAWS. SAWS is popular with farmers and workers alike. Demand from UK farmers for reliable, well motivated SAWS students continues unabated and applications from students wishing to participate in the scheme outstrip demand by a ratio of 2:1. In short, there is a proven need among UK farmers and the students for SAWS to continue in Government policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para7"><a name="stpa_237">Thirdly, developments in the EU labour market will increase the pressure on UK farmers and reinforce the need for SAWS. France, Germany and Italy have imposed restrictions on workers from the accession countries that are due to be lifted by 2007; indeed, by 2011 all restrictions of any sort will be lifted. Given that by then the UK is likely to be less favoured than some other EU countries as a work destination, due to its climate, geographical isolation and the resulting higher travel costs, it is premature to conclude that workers from the A8 accession countries will fill the demand 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 52WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
presented by SAWS. We need to retain SAWS until we are sure that our agricultural labour requirements can be met by other means. My view is that they never will be.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para8"><a name="stpa_238">Fourthly, it is most unlikely that EU workers will fill the void. Workers from elsewhere inside the EU want permanent jobs rather than the seasonal ones available in agriculture, and they will quickly move on to better paid opportunities here or in their own countries as their economies improve. If the Minister doubts that, he should consider the present lack of UK students working on farms during the summer vacation compared with 20 years ago, when I was at university. Most UK students would greatly prefer to work in, for example, the hospitality industry, and workers from other EU countries replicate that pattern precisely. In short, workers from the other EU countries cannot fill the void that is currently filled by SAWS students.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para9"><a name="stpa_239">Fifthly and finally, the cultural and educational elements of the SAWS scheme set it apart from immigration and asylum issues. It is a remarkable testament to the success of the scheme that the Polish&nbsp;Agriculture Minister, Mr. Kowalski, is a former SAWS student. The experience gained by students in production technology, food and retailing plays an important part in helping their own economies when they return home. Furthermore, while they are here they benefit the local economy in the UK, as many local shops and pubs know well. Some students even earn enough money while they are here to buy their own land and set themselves up when they return home. One student I met two summers ago on a farm in my constituency had been coming here for three years while doing his medical studies and reckoned that if he returned for a further two years he would be able to pay off the mortgage on his flat in Belgrade.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para10"><a name="stpa_240">In conclusion, I hope that I have convinced the Minister of the three key points that I set out at the start of my speech. First, fruit farming deserves our support. It produces high-quality produce, which accords with Government policy on healthy eating; it produces it close to the marketplace and it is good for the environment, particularly in areas such as the garden of England. However, the sector is under extreme pressure: costs are rising for farmers, which is set against the downward pressure on prices exerted by the supermarkets, while the demand for land in the south-east is growing fast. The availability of a capable seasonal labour force is a key issue. Without it, many fruit farms will sadly fold. Secondly&#151;the key point&#151;SAWS is not an asylum and immigration issue. It is a means for students from non-EU countries to visit Britain for up to six months and then return home. It has nothing to do with the immigration and asylum issues that cause so much public and political concern. Thirdly and finally, SAWS is a success story. Less than 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. of SAWS students ever abscond; the majority return home enriched by their experience of Britain and considerably wealthier. Put simply, there are no losers.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para11"><a name="stpa_241">It is apparent to me that SAWS has an obvious home in tier 4 of the new system proposed in the Home Office White Paper. Can the Minister reassure my constituents and the wider fruit sector that he understands the issue and is able to make the necessary recommendations and representations inside his Department?

<br>

<a name="60110h03_time1"><h5>12.41 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60110h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham) </b> : I congratulate the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh&nbsp;Robertson) on securing the debate. He is right to say that the fruit sector is important to our economy. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that the whole country is indebted to his constituency for the vast amount of fine produce that emerges from it. I am unsure how many people on the SAWS scheme are involved in hop picking, but if they are I certainly pay tribute to the fruits of their labour.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para12"><a name="stpa_242">The hon. Gentleman is also right to say that the industry depends upon seasonal labour and is under pressure. We all know from the debate we see in the media that pressure is being exerted on agricultural producers in this country by price competition among&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supermarkets. Although that has been good for consumers in that the prices they pay have come down, it has made the pressure on domestic agriculture more severe. While celebrating the lower prices, we must understand what that equation means. He is also right to say that we would like local produce to be used in schools in pursuit of the five-a-day initiative. We would all want to unite behind that; I am pleased that he made reference to it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para13"><a name="stpa_243">I listened carefully to the three key points that the hon. Gentleman outlined and the arguments that he used to substantiate them. I agree with two of the three and disagree with one, but that is not to say that there is an unbridgeable gulf between us. I hope that he will find some cause for comfort at the end of my remarks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para14"><a name="stpa_244">The hon. Gentleman&#039;s first point was that the industry deserves support. As I have said, I agree. There is a long tradition of fruit farming in his part of the world. We obviously listen to the industry&#039;s concerns, to ensure that it is supported and that the people who depend on it can continue to do so. Of course, the industry is operating in a changed market. I picked strawberries in my youth, between A-levels and university, and it is certainly not glamorous work. Such work is not on the increase among the domestic work force, so I understand that there are pressures on the industry. Since the economy has expanded in different ways, people have alternative ways to make money. We have to understand how the industry operates in a changed environment and we have to provide support.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para15"><a name="stpa_245">I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s third point, that SAWS has been well managed and is a success. In some senses it is a win, win scheme. SAWS has been successful and has provided great benefit to those who have taken part in it and to our domestic agricultural industry over a number of years. He is right about that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para16"><a name="stpa_246">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#039;s second point, however. He says that SAWS is not an asylum or immigration issue. True, it is not an asylum issue, but it is an immigration issue. That is why I am answering the debate today. I respect his point about the cultural exchange elements of the scheme; none the less, SAWS deals with people coming to this country to work. That makes it an immigration issue and we have to consider it as such within the broader context of the Government&#039;s immigration policy. I shall discuss how that context is changing and how SAWS is affected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para17"><a name="stpa_247">The hon. Gentleman made the reference himself, but let me emphasise that the debate takes place against the backdrop of the development of a points-based system 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for managed migration, the consultation on which finished last year. The Home Office has consulted extensively with industry on developing the new scheme. Our aim is to move away from myriad, complicated niche schemes for immigration towards a much clearer, transparent scheme, where the public can have clear information about who is allowed into this country and why. The points-based system is not about letting fewer people or more people in; it is about letting enough people in to help the economy of this country at any given time and, in so doing, allowing the public to see clearly the reasons why people have been allowed to enter. Central to the rationale for the points-based scheme is that it is not intended to run at the same time as the range of niche schemes, such as SAWS and the working holidaymakers scheme. The whole point is to move to a more transparent system. That is the basis of today&#039;s debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para18"><a name="stpa_248">The Government&#039;s five-year strategy on asylum and immigration stated that existing, quota-based, low-skilled migration schemes would be phased out over time. As I have said before, the basis of the decision in relation to SAWS is not that we think the scheme is flawed&#151;on the contrary, SAWS has been successful. What we question is whether it is still required, given that the expansion of the European Union has given growers access to a larger pool of workers who are free and, on the evidence, willing to meet seasonal labour needs in the agricultural sector.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para19"><a name="stpa_249">In July 2005 the Government published a consultation document, &quot;Selective Admission: Making Migration Work for Britain&quot;, which set out in more detail our proposals for a new system to regulate economic migration. Stakeholders in the agricultural sector have been fully involved in the consultation process. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that there has been detailed discussion with companies throughout the country, including in his own constituency. We are considering the responses to that document and we will publish our response, including what we intend in relation to SAWS, in due course. I am not in a position today to state precisely what we intend to do in relation to SAWS, but I will go through some of the issues that are shaping our thinking.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para20"><a name="stpa_250">In 2003 nationals of countries that have since acceded to the European Union accounted for 60 per cent. of the 20,430 workers admitted under the scheme in that year. Romania and Bulgaria, which should accede to the European Union in the near future, accounted for a further 12 per cent. In 2004 we decided to cut the SAWS quota from 25,000 to 16,250 in the light of levels of take-up of the scheme by nationals of the accession states. Since their accession, nationals of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new member states have taken up employment in the agricultural sector in significant numbers. Since 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 2004, some 36,621 nationals from the eight accession countries have registered as employed in the agricultural sector under the worker registration scheme. The distribution of applications suggest that many are coming to do seasonal work. I can tell the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Gentleman that in the second quarter of 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there were 9,283 registrations, compared with 3,996 in the first quarter. That suggests that the expansion of the European Union and granting the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 55WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
nationals of the eight accession countries access to our labour markets has resulted in people continuing to come to do agricultural work.

</p>






<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60110h03_spnew1"><b> Hugh Robertson </b> : I entirely accept what the Minister says, and I thank him for his earlier remarks. The problem, as many farmers will tell him, is that many students from the EU come to work for farmers at first, but quickly move on to other jobs in the UK economy&#151;they go to work in the hospitality industry, for example. In contrast, people who come to the country under SAWS can work only in the agricultural sector. They come, work on the farms for six months, and go back to their home countries, whereas those from inside the EU work on the farm for a month or so, then quickly get a better paid and more comfortable job in the local pub, for all the reasons to do with strawberry picking that the Minister mentioned. The retention of students from inside the EU is very small indeed.
</p>






<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60110h03_spnew2"><b> Andy Burnham </b> : I understand, and I take that point on board. I can understand the attractions for the agricultural sector of a scheme that is tied in that way. The figures that I gave suggest that people are coming to work in the agricultural sector. I know that the hon. Gentleman believes in the free market, in market enterprise, and in people being able to offer their labour where they can get most return for it, but if there is the pressure that he describes, people will have to look harder at how to retain the staff that they want, which is not necessarily a bad thing. One of the strengths of EU enlargement is that people can come and work in a range of sectors. The effect that the hon. Gentleman describes will be considered when the points-based system is developed, but it must be balanced against allowing people to contribute fully and to use all their skills, rather than being tied to a particular sector. That is particularly true of EU nationals, who should have that freedom.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para21"><a name="stpa_251">Let me pick up on a point that the hon. Gentleman made about the rest of the EU beginning to open its labour markets to nationals. He mentioned that there was greater competition to attract people to work here. That might be true, and we have to respond to that, which raises the issue of how easy we make it for people to come here and work. I do not accept his point about Britain not being an attractive place for students to gain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work experience. It is an extremely attractive destination and will continue to be so.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para22"><a name="stpa_252">There may be more A8 nationals employed in the agricultural sector than the worker registration scheme statistics suggest. The National Farmers Union and the Association of Labour Providers consistently tell us that the worker registration scheme under-records the number of accession state nationals employed in the agricultural sector. If so, one reason for the under-recording may be that the WRS requires workers to be registered only if they have worked for a particular employer for a month. Seasonal agricultural work is no doubt more transient than other types of work, and many workers&#151;research suggests almost half&#151;may stay with a particular employer for less than one month, so it is possible that those people are moving to other employers within the agricultural sector.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 56WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para23"><a name="stpa_253">The Government&#039;s view is that the availability of workers from an expanded EU calls into question the continued need for SAWS. It is not simply that an alternative source of labour is available; it is also a question of the robustness of the scheme. SAWS is a temporary migration scheme. Participants who are students are expected to return overseas at the end of their six-month stay. The evidence is that participants from eastern Europe have traditionally complied with that requirement. We are, however, responsible for upholding the integrity of the immigration system, and if SAWS were to continue alongside accession country migration, participants would necessarily be recruited from further afield and possibly from countries whose nationals have less incentive to return at the end of their stay. That is why this is an immigration matter&#151;I must take issue with the hon. Gentleman on that point. SAWS must be seen within the context of the changing picture of immigration more generally.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para24"><a name="stpa_254">There are two principal objections to a policy of relying on EU labour. The first is that employers in the agricultural sector have difficulty retaining workers who are free to take more attractive employment. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand and accept that point, although the evidence does not entirely bear that out. We have examined WRS applications and have found that 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. of those who initially registered as employed in the agricultural sector and then changed employment changed jobs within the sector. As I said, the hon. Gentleman&#039;s claim has some basis in fact, but it is not entirely accurate. Individual employers may have problems retaining workers, but that is not necessarily true of the sector as a whole. If the retention of workers in this sector is an issue, however, we must find long-term solutions other than temporary migration schemes.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para25"><a name="stpa_255">Secondly, as the new member states prosper, they will cease to provide a source of workers who are prepared to take unattractive jobs in the UK. That may well happen and we will need to monitor the situation, but there is little to suggest that it is happening now. Furthermore, the drying up of the new member states as a source of workers for low-skilled jobs may occur in tandem with the further expansion of the EU, which will compensate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para26"><a name="stpa_256">The role of temporary migration schemes in meeting the need for temporary workers in the agriculture industry needs to be put into context. SAWS is designed to meet a seasonal need for labour rather than any endemic labour need, but the evidence is that labour need in the agricultural sector is increasingly a year-round phenomenon. Research commissioned by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home Office suggests that demand for temporary workers, the majority of whom are engaged in packing and grading, peaks in the winter rather than in the picking season. If agriculture increasingly needs a year-round work force, it follows that that need is best met by relying on those with the freedom to enter the labour market rather than relying on seasonal immigration schemes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para27"><a name="stpa_257">We need to be realistic about how far migration, or at least specific low-skilled, temporary migration schemes, can or should meet the labour needs of the industry. The objection that removing such migration routes would lead to an increase in illegal working in the sector also needs to be put into perspective.

<br>

<p>
<a name="60110h03_para28"><a name="stpa_258">The research that I just mentioned suggested that the total number of temporary workers employed in agricultural, horticultural and collocated primary processing businesses was between 420,000 and 611,000. Only 3 per cent. of businesses in that sector that use temporary labour use the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. Some of those businesses may be concentrated in particular parts of the sector, but the seasonal agricultural workers scheme is quite marginal to the overall labour needs of the sector.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para29"><a name="stpa_259">The number of workers admitted under SAWS is also small compared with the total number of migrants admitted to the UK in other categories and who are free to work some or all of the time. The figure was approximately 450,000 in 2003, and no doubt some of those migrants work in the agricultural sector. One way forward where needs emerge may be to encourage those who enter under other categories, such as youth mobility schemes, to take work in the agricultural sector. We continue to consider those issues as we develop the points-based system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para30"><a name="stpa_260">The Government are taking measures to address illegal working in the agricultural sector. In particular, the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 will require the licensing of labour providers in the sector and compliance with conditions set by the Gangmaster Licensing Authority, including compliance with the law on illegal working.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h03_para31"><a name="stpa_261">As I have said, no decision on the timing of phasing out SAWS has been taken, and we will want to take account of the views of the industry in taking that decision. We will also take account of the views expressed by the hon. Gentleman today. It remains the Government&#039;s view that opening up our labour market to the new member states should remove the need for temporary migration schemes to meet labour shortages at low-skill levels. The Government hear what the hon.&nbsp;Gentleman says. We are working to develop a system that responds to the needs of the industry and gives us an immigration system in which we can all have confidence.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60110h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Roger Gale  </b> (in the Chair): I understand that the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) has arranged for other Members to participate in this debate. As she knows, this debate is strictly limited to 30&nbsp;minutes, so it is up to her to manage the time.

</p>



<a name="time_18">
<a name="60110h04_time0"><h5>1 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60110h04_spnew1"><b> Mary Creagh  (Wakefield)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Mr. Gale, for your flexibility in allowing colleagues from neighbouring constituencies to speak in this debate.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para0"><a name="stpa_262">Hon. Members may be asking why, as the Member for Wakefield, I am discussing Huddersfield health services. The reason is that my constituency contains two wards, Denby Dale and Kirkburton, that fall under the local authority area of Kirklees. The wards are large rural areas covering some 80 square miles with poor roads, and my constituents will be deeply affected by the proposed changes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford), in whose constituency the Huddersfield royal infirmary lies, and my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) for attending today, and I look forward to hearing their views on how the proposals will impact on their constituents.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para1"><a name="stpa_263">In October 2005, the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS trust and the local primary care trusts published proposals in the &quot;Looking to the Future&quot; consultation on the future of health provision in the area. The laudable aims are to move services closer to people and to provide safe high-quality hospital care. However, maternity care and gynaecology and obstetrics are to be transferred from Huddersfield royal infirmary to Calderdale royal infirmary five miles away in Halifax. The document states that the changes are being made because local people said that they wanted as much care as possible to be provided closer to their homes. The trust wants to provide local services, and local people want local services, but the changes in maternity services will have exactly the opposite effect. Obstetricians and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anaesthetists who are on call for childbirth at Huddersfield royal infirmary will no longer be available, and women who need specialist treatment during childbirth will have to travel to Halifax. Fewer services will be available locally and specialist care will be provided further from my constituents&#039; homes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para2"><a name="stpa_264">At present, women from Denby Dale or Kirkburton can give birth at Huddersfield royal infirmary, which offers the full range of back-up should the birth prove more difficult than expected. Under the new proposals, that option would no longer be available to any woman at risk of complications. The trust proposes a new midwife-led unit at the hospital for low-risk women, but the criteria by which women are judged to be high or low risk are fairly wide. I can understand the reason for that, as birth is a risky time for mother and baby. Women who are considered at risk include those who are having their first baby, those who are aged under 18 or over 35, and those who have a medical condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure. They also include women who need epidurals and caesarean sections, women with infections, users of class A drugs, those who have received in vitro fertilisation treatment, and women with a high or low body mass index. In short, a large percentage of pregnant women would be unable to give birth in the new midwife-led unit.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 59WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para3"><a name="stpa_265">Women from Denby Dale and Kirkburton and their partners would have to travel 25 miles to the Pontefract general infirmary in the Wakefield district, 15 miles to the Calderdale royal infirmary in Halifax, or 12 miles to Barnsley. At present, 2,700 women give birth at Huddersfield royal infirmary. It is expected that a maximum of 400 or 500 women will give birth at the midwife-led unit, so the remaining 2,200 will have to travel to the Calderdale royal in Halifax.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para4"><a name="stpa_266">There is a birth centre in Wakefield in the heart of my constituency. I wish to discuss some of the issues that have arisen there. Despite the excellent care provided by midwives, the number of women choosing to give birth in the birth centre has been much lower than expected. One of the consequences of that is that staff sometimes spend entire shifts without helping a woman give birth, so the centre has been downgraded from a 24-hour service to a 9-to-5 operation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para5"><a name="stpa_267">A woman at the proposed midwife-led unit at Huddersfield royal infirmary would be transferred if she developed unexpected complications during her labour to Calderdale royal infirmary. She would be moved out of the room that she was giving birth in, taken out of the building, put in an ambulance and transferred to a new hospital with a new set of carers. We must ask ourselves whether that will prepare the woman mentally to welcome her new baby.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para6"><a name="stpa_268">Carolyn Saville, a Royal College of Midwives steward, has written a consultation response, in which she highlights the concerns of midwives and ambulance services working in this area. The ambulance crews are concerned because they do not feel that they have a great deal of specialist maternity training to support midwives who are transferring labouring women. Both sets of professionals feel that they have not been properly consulted. She also talks about the figures from the Halifax midwife-led unit&#151;the Calderdale midwife-led unit&#151;where between one third and half of the women were transferred to the consultant-led unit during labour. That is just a transfer down a corridor, but women labouring in the Huddersfield royal infirmary would be transferred 5 miles.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para7"><a name="stpa_269">Women rightly have high expectations for a positive, safe and comfortable delivery of their child. The stresses that that type of transfer brings will not help their sense of being in control and of being in a positive frame of mind. Women with a retained placenta or extensive tearing after the birth will also be transferred. What will happen to the partner and the baby? Will they travel with them in the ambulance? How will the partner choose between caring for their new baby and supporting their sick partner?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para8"><a name="stpa_270">My hon. Friends the Members for Huddersfield and for Colne Valley and I have collected a petition and postcards as part of our campaign against the changes. We have spoken to our constituents, who want to keep a fully supported maternity service in Huddersfield. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley and I met Diane Whittingham, the chief executive of Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS trust, and her officers and colleagues last Friday to convey our constituents&#039; concerns. It is clear that the changes are driven not by a lack of funding but by the need to maintain specialist

<br>&nbsp;<br>
training of doctors and provide consultants with sufficient cases to ensure professional development. We want well trained specialists, but if it is necessary for them to undergo training, surely transport could be provided for the doctors to travel between the hospitals, rather than forcing labouring women to make the journey in an ambulance when they are giving birth?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para9"><a name="stpa_271">A woman who suffers the tragedy of her baby dying in the womb would have to leave the midwife who supported her during her pregnancy, travel to Calderdale and have a different midwife caring for her if she wished to have an induced labour or a caesarean. A woman who presented at accident and emergency in Huddersfield with an ectopic pregnancy would have to make the same journey or, if she was in extreme danger, would be operated on by a general surgeon in Huddersfield. All of those things happen, albeit rarely&#151;we might be talking about only 10 cases a year&#151;and they all matter.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para10"><a name="stpa_272">We believe that the trust should re-examine the proposals. We are grateful to the Minister for taking part in this debate. We want mothers to have confidence in the service and to know that they will be fully supported should anything go wrong. I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friends have to say.

<a name="time_19">
<a name="60110h04_time1"><h5>1.8 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_86"><a name="60110h04_spnew2"><b> Kali Mountford  (Colne Valley)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) for securing this important debate. It is important for three MPs present, because it affects our constituents so profoundly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para11"><a name="stpa_273">The changes date back to before I became an MP. Changes to local services were considered as long ago as 1996. Indeed, in 1999 a consultation took place in our constituencies whose findings were profoundly rejected by the local community. That set of proposals would have resulted in all the maternity services and many other services being transferred to Halifax. The health authority at that time rejected the proposals because the campaign against them in our communities was so strong.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para12"><a name="stpa_274">It is important to mention that, because the current consultation has to be real and has to be listened to. Local people have developed a certain cynicism about what lies behind it. They do not hear doctors&#039; concerns for their patients and for their own long-term development as clinicians; instead, they hear little more than, &quot;We have something that you want to take away.&quot; Some people were consulted before the so-called official phase of consultation took place, and I applaud the hospital trust for attempting to find out what women of birthing age who had recently had babies or were about to have them thought. What they thought was very interesting and must be considered. The key thing they wanted was to have midwife support throughout the pregnancy and up to the birth; they did not want to have a break in care at any point in between. They needed that confidence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para13"><a name="stpa_275">It is not that local women do not want a midwife-led centre, but that they want one in which they can have trust and faith. If the midwife-led centre is set up as proposed, there will be dangers and worries. The key worry for me is whether it would have the public confidence it needs to be set up successfully.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 61WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para14"><a name="stpa_276">I wish to discuss one or two issues other than the maternity services, so I shall try to make sure that I have time to mention them, but maternity services are the ones in the consultation that draw the most concern. Most other conditions mentioned in the report are special cases, for which people would travel anywhere to get the best treatment, but giving birth is seen as an ordinary, everyday event. It is not an illness, but an ordinary part of every family&#039;s life. People expect to have their babies at home or near home, and certainly in their home town. The idea that they may not be able to have their babies in Huddersfield causes the people I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mentioned great concern. Indeed, our local paper&#039;s last campaign was called the &quot;born in Huddersfield&quot; campaign.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para15"><a name="stpa_277">This is a serious issue for people. Some clinicians have turned their noses up at it, but it matters, not only because of the real concerns outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield about whether we can clinically support women during transfer, but because of questions about whether the women would have the confidence to use the midwife-led unit.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para16"><a name="stpa_278">I would like to see a successful midwife-led unit. The evidence is that if a midwife-led unit has a home-like setting, it produces a better birth experience and fewer clinical interventions&#151;certainly fewer unnecessary ones. We have seen a rise in unnecessary Caesarean sections and in all sorts of other procedures that some of us might have experienced but that the gentlemen here will certainly not have. For the sake of your stomach, Mr. Gale, and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman), I shall not go into a description of them, but a lot of them are now demanded by women when they are really not necessary. In a more home-like setting, such births and procedures would not be necessary. The proposals could, if handled properly, give women the confidence to give birth in a more natural way, and I applaud that idea.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para17"><a name="stpa_279">The problem is that even in the most natural and normal of settings, even if there is only a one in a thousand chance of something going wrong, people want to know that the moment it does, the person who can best help them will be there on site. The real dispute is about whether there are people on site who can help. On Friday, my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield outlined to our colleagues in the health service the particular case of an ectopic pregnancy. They said immediately, &quot;Yes, of course we would have general surgeons on site. We would be willing to come immediately ourselves; we would be good Samaritans. In such circumstances, we would obviously not transfer a woman, but help her there and then in the hospital where she had presented herself.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para18"><a name="stpa_280">If we can be good Samaritans, can we not build into the protocols a means by which women can be confident that when something that has not been sorted out by the sifting process goes tragically and unexpectedly wrong, they will be assured of giving birth with some surety that they will be safe? That is paramount. Otherwise, a midwife-led centre will not be successful because people will automatically choose the place where clinical interventions can be made immediately and where all the obstetricians, gynaecologists and paediatricians that women feel they need are already on site.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para19"><a name="stpa_281">I do not want a centre to be set up to fail. We need to be careful about how it is set up in the initial stages so that we can have the confidence and build up the number of births in that centre before making any other changes. I cannot see how removing services when the number of births is still about 200 a year can be a viable proposition. I want to see as many babies who can properly be born in Huddersfield to be born there; it is the right place for them to be.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para20"><a name="stpa_282">I should like briefly to mention breast cancer services. Public subscriptions were used to buy equipment and local people feel that they paid for it, but they fear that it will now be taken to Halifax. I want people to know that on Friday we received an assurance that the equipment will stay in Huddersfield and will be there for local people, who have paid for it. That part of the breast cancer service will stay there. It is important that that is known.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para21"><a name="stpa_283">It is important that the consultation takes account of all the public concerns and that the postcards and petitions that have been sent in do matter. The Socialist party petition, which unfortunately does not even mention these particular services has been signed by 1,700 people, who do not realise that they are not being counted. In my view, they believed that they were signing something that said that they did not want maternity services removed. Unfortunately, the petition refers to having no Government cuts to health services, so those people are not being counted. I want to put on record that those 1,700 people, with those who signed the petitions run by my hon. Friends and myself, want maternity services to stay in Huddersfield.

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60110h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Barry Sheerman  (Huddersfield)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be brief. Given the considerable expertise on these issues of my hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Colne Valley (Kali&nbsp;Mountford), who am I, a mere mortal man, to contribute to the debate? However, I have four children and a family history of using the excellent facilities of the excellent Huddersfield royal infirmary over many years. The service is great. We all know how much we appreciate a first-class service from a local hospital when&nbsp;our children are ill. A good general hospital is founded on two pillars: a good accident and emergency department and a good maternity department. If one of those pillars is taken away, it undermines the whole notion of a good, comprehensive general hospital.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para22"><a name="stpa_284">Let me give some background. Huddersfield is a much larger town than Halifax. The healthy Huddersfield trust&#151;it was financially healthy and well run&#151;merged with the Calderdale trust, which had been less well managed and faced an expensive overrun on a private finance initiative hospital. Huddersfield residents, taxpayers and council tax payers have a right to believe that they got the short end of the deal not only in terms of having rescued the other trust, but because, further down the line, it seems that some of the services to Huddersfield are threatened.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para23"><a name="stpa_285">There is an important issue at stake in the sense that we have been scrutinising midwife-led units throughout the country. There is no doubt that it will be some time before the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence inquiry reports. It seems strange to make a 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
big decision before there has been a full evaluation of how midwife-led units work. Some of the evidence that has come to the attention of my office and those of my colleagues suggests that there is a question mark over some of the units. They may be appropriate: certain women, usually those from more affluent backgrounds, consider that to be the sort of unit in which they want to deliver their children. That is perfectly all right, but most of the units are small, dealing with an estimated 400 or 500 births a year each. As my colleagues have said, there are 2,500 births a year in Huddersfield, so 2,000 women would have to go elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para24"><a name="stpa_286">Many people who look at the topography of our part of the world do not understand that the 5 or 6 miles between Huddersfield and Halifax is a hell of a long way, given the hills, valleys and traffic. If we build into that the experience that my constituents have had trying to park at the new Halifax PFI hospital, it is a daunting prospect indeed. It does no one any good if people estimate that it will take only 12 minutes to travel between Huddersfield and Halifax, when most of us who have travelled that way know that one would be a lucky man or woman to do it in that time. It is much more likely to take at least half an hour. There are real difficulties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para25"><a name="stpa_287">Do not let us dismiss&#151;I know that my colleagues have not&#151;a town that produced Harold Wilson, who was born in the local hospital. People feel that they should be able to be born in the hospital in their town&#151;born in Huddersfield. If you had seen the valiant display Huddersfield Town put on against Chelsea on Saturday, Mr. Gale, your heart would have swelled with pride in Huddersfield and you would know what we are talking about. Unfortunately, we were robbed of a draw, but the fact of the matter is that pride in one&#039;s local area and local town, especially when it is the larger town, is important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para26"><a name="stpa_288">I must make one party political point and I hope that it will not upset you, Mr. Gale. We ran a wonderful democratic campaign on the issue. In 1999, my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley and I fought and won the campaign. We were proud of that success and we have worked constantly for the hospital. It is a fine hospital that has delivered excellent care and usually obtains all the stars that are available to it. No one can take away my pride in its public servants, whether porters, consultants, administrators and so on. All are first class and I do not want to downgrade or do any disservice to them. However, the Liberal Democrats, without a majority, have overall control of Kirklees metropolitan council. They went on the attack and made the issue a party political one. That destroyed my faith in local democratic politics because it should not be a party political issue. It is about local people who want a local resource that is accessible. That is the strong message from Huddersfield and I hope that the Minister is listening.

this debate on an important local issue. I also congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Colne&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valley (Kali Mountford) and for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman) on the way in which all contributions have reflected their constituents&#039; needs. Their constituents will be extremely reassured to know that their views are being so eloquently voiced in this place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para27"><a name="stpa_289">I concur with much of what has been said about Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS trust being well resourced and well managed. I congratulate it on being awarded three stars this year by the Healthcare Commission, thanks to the hard work and dedication of local NHS staff. I am sure that they are pleased to have Members of Parliament who take up issues in the House and thank them for their hard work. Too often, we do not thank our NHS staff. However, the trust and local PCTs clearly feel that despite the stars awarded more changes need to be made to build on the improvements and to ensure that high-quality services continue to be offered.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para28"><a name="stpa_290">I reiterate that we are discussing proposals which are out for consultation. It is absolutely right that that consultation process should take account of all views expressed. I remind my hon. Friends that Kirklees metropolitan council will be able to refer any changes to the Secretary of State if it contests a substantial change to health services and feels that there has been inadequate consultation or that the proposals do not have merit. We are in the middle of a consultation process and it is right that local decisions are taken in that way. Local people know their priorities and the services that are available and it is important that they have the right to make their views known.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para29"><a name="stpa_291">I know that a number of the proposals are controversial and I shall explain the information that I&nbsp;have been given on why the PCTs and the trust feel that they need to make changes. I have been given an assurance that after the proposed changes the majority of women who currently give birth at Huddersfield will continue to do so. Most births will take place at the two new midwife-led units based at hospitals in Huddersfield and Halifax. The trust has planned for 500 births a year at the unit in Huddersfield initially, and hopes that this will rise over time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para30"><a name="stpa_292">The trust proposes that neonatal intensive care, paediatric in-patients and obstetric care all be centralised at the Calderdale royal site in Halifax. Let me be clear about this: I have been informed that there is real concern that without those changes the trust will lose its intensive care accreditation awarded by the Yorkshire Neonatal Network, because the trust is unable to provide senior medical staff cover on the labour ward from Monday to Friday. Withdrawal of intensive care accreditation would result in all local babies who require intensive care having to travel to Leeds. That is one of the clinical reasons the trust has given to explain why it does not believe that children&#039;s and maternity services can be maintained at both sites.

</p>






<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60110h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Sheerman </b> : Will my hon. Friend address the arithmetic? If there are 2,000 or 2,200 live births in Huddersfield per year and only 500 will be accommodated by the new unit, 1,700 mothers will have to go to Halifax. It is not just the more difficult cases, but most women who will have to travel. I think that she has been misinformed.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60110h04_spnew5"><b> Ms Winterton </b> : That is certainly one of the issues I&nbsp;would expect the trust to take into account. However, the concern is that the trust cannot provide the level of round-the-clock cover on children&#039;s wards it believes is needed. By centralising in-patient services, Calderdale will be able to have two consultant paediatricians available in an emergency at all times. It is also struggling to meet national clinical standards for obstetric services which state that an obstetrician should be present on labour wards for at least 40 hours a week. The trust is the only one in Yorkshire and Humberside that is unable to provide readily accessible senior medical cover to the labour wards from 9 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para31"><a name="stpa_293">I know that some people have expressed concern that patients will not be able to receive the best care from the midwife-led unit in Huddersfield, but I hope that I can give some reassurance following the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley. Research shows that for a healthy woman with a normal pregnancy, delivery at home or in a midwife-led unit is as safe as a hospital birth. There are already 100 such units across the country and the vast majority of women in a midwife-led unit have a problem-free labour.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para32"><a name="stpa_294">I return to a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield raised with me before, which is the capacity of the ambulance service to deal with increased transfers between Huddersfield and Halifax. I have followed her question up and I have been assured that the trust is already discussing the matter with the West Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service to ensure that a robust service is in place. I hope that that reassures her.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para33"><a name="stpa_295">My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley suggests that the changes should not go ahead until the midwife-led unit at Huddersfield is up and running. She has mentioned that to me before and I have some sympathy with that view. I have made inquiries and I am assured that the midwife-led unit will be up and running before consultant-led services are transferred to Calderdale.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h04_para34"><a name="stpa_296">Final decisions about the reorganisation of these services have not yet been made. The purpose of any consultation exercise is to seek out and listen to the views of the public on proposed changes. However, I felt it important to give some of the important reasons relating to the need for emergency services and so on for the proposed changes. It is important to have that intensive care accreditation, because there would be bigger problems without it&#151;

<a name="time_22">
<a name="60110h05_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60110h05_spnew0"><b> Dr. Evan Harris  (Oxford, West and Abingdon)</b>  (LD): I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss a matter of importance to the present and future success of the United Kingdom science base. I note that the <i>Hansard </i>record is not full of previous debates on the topic. I am pleased that you are in the Chair, Mr. Gale, as I know that you take an active interest in all matters relating to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the future of the UK science base. I also welcome the&nbsp;Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner). The Minister for Science and Innovation, Lord Sainsbury, sits in the House of Lords, so it is the role of the hon. Gentleman, who is also a Department of Trade and Industry Minister, to substitute for him in this place, which he does ably. It seems as though it was only the other day that we were discussing scientific publications and open access in another Adjournment debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para0"><a name="stpa_297">The people we are discussing&#151;post-doctoral researchers or post-doctoral students&#151;are scientists who have got a good result in their degree, which has enabled them to get funding for and then to complete a doctorate, and the majority of whom have gone on to work in what is called contract research. There are tens of thousands of them and they are some of the brightest people our higher education system has produced. They have the potential to help to make great discoveries through science, pure research and applied; through the application of experimental techniques and the basic knowledge taught to them at university during their degree courses and doctorates; through interactions with other people in their laboratories and work areas as well as internationally through collaborations and conferences; and through their reading. It is my contention that they feel undervalued and that we are not making the best use of them, because many of them are leaving.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para1"><a name="stpa_298">That is not a new concern. In fairness, it must be said that the Government have recognised the problem, as have the higher education funding councils, research funders, and the Wellcome Trust and other charities that are members of the Association of Medical Research Charities. The questions now are: has enough been done, are the initiatives working, and do the Government have mechanisms in place to determine whether the initiatives are working? I shall set out what post-doctoral researchers hold the problems to be, examine some of the initiatives that have been put in place, question how well we are measuring the outcomes, and then address what next steps the Government can take&#151;or help to catalyse, because responsibility in this area does not lie with Government alone, although the Government have an important role, as they are the major source of public funding for schemes and have a role in quality assurance in science and in personnel and human resource policies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para2"><a name="stpa_299">I am grateful to the individual post-doctoral researchers who have told me their views. In my roles as Liberal Democrat science spokesman and as a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I visit institutions and I take the opportunity to ask to meet with post-doctoral researchers on a group basis, without senior management or heads of department being 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 67WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
present. Heads of department usually provide excellent hospitality on such visits and they tell us about their strategies and the progress that is being made, but, speaking as one who is particularly interested in the careers of scientists, I believe that there is no substitute for asking them individually and in groups, and in the absence of their bosses, what they really think of their lot. One of the questions I wish to discuss is to what extent the high-level bodies that look at research careers are directly in touch with the views of the people who are affected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para3"><a name="stpa_300">Post-doctoral researchers, whether they have jobs in rigorously selective research departments of high reputation or in other research departments also doing excellent work, report their concerns to me. The concerns are not specific to the departments that may be seen to be struggling in terms of the research assessment exercise, or to those who feel that they are not the brightest and the best of a very bright and effective group of people. We are talking about some of the top people who are still not happy, who are leaving and who are encouraging people not to stay in this role.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para4"><a name="stpa_301">I am grateful to Cancer Research UK in particular, to Universities UK and to the British Heart Foundation for their briefings. I pay tribute to the work of people in the Wellcome Trust such as its director, Mark Walport, who has looked into this issue, and those who have served in the Research Careers Initiative, particularly Professor Sir Gareth Roberts, whom I was pleased to meet just last week at the Association for Science Education conference in Reading. He has gone beyond the call of duty in what he has sought to do. He has not only taken the thorny crown of dealing with the research assessment exercise which has a bearing on this subject, but, with his report &quot;SET for Success&quot;, he looked at the supply of scientists to the UK science base and then chaired the Research Careers Initiative and the Research Careers Committee of the Research Funders&#039; Forum, which flowed out of it. I pay tribute to his work and I was pleased to have the opportunity, albeit brief, to talk to him in advance of this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para5"><a name="stpa_302">Cancer Research UK describes the position well. It says that post-doctoral researchers are a valuable asset to UK research but that the lack of job security and clear career structure is a disincentive for scientists to stay in research. Let me explain what the real issue is. We are talking about people who have completed their undergraduate training, accumulating debt on the way. The Minister knows that I think that that is a flawed policy because it deters people who could benefit from it from going into higher education. In particular it deters those who graduate with debt, particularly those from debt-averse backgrounds, from going into less well-paid public sector jobs, which are highly valuable to this country&#039;s economy and certainly as valuable as better paid jobs in the City and in industry. Those people emerge from university with debts and they then do doctorates. I acknowledge that the stipend for doctorates has been increased, which I welcome, but it is also not sufficient to enable them even to think about living independently. They then go on to get three-year contracts which do not pay well compared with the earnings of people who are likely to be as bright as them, but who took their degrees in other subjects and are now 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 68WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
working in the private sector. The people we are discussing are often earning between &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000 three, four or five years after getting their doctorates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para6"><a name="stpa_303">We are talking about people in their late twenties and early thirties who may still be in debt from their student days and who have no prospect of being able to buy a house on their own or even with their partners. They are stuck with the prospect, particularly in high living cost areas such as my constituency, Cambridge and London, of sharing a house, just as they did in their student days. When people ask them whether they would encourage others to go into their career, they often reply, &quot;What career? There is no career. There is a job. There is a pretty poor salary. It has been improved recently and there are some career development opportunities. There may be sources of more advice but fundamentally things have not changed.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para7"><a name="stpa_304">Post-doctoral researchers play a crucial role in UK academic research and losing people of their valuable experience is a real problem. Let us consider what happens if someone with great experience of how a lab works and the experimental techniques in the broad area in which the work is being undertaken leaves because his funding runs out. The university cannot retain him because it has not been able to attract the grant that it requires to keep on an experienced person, or it is more likely to receive funding if within the grant application it substitutes an experienced post-doctoral salary for a more junior post-doctoral salary even though the junior person does not share the experience of the person who has done the good work that has enabled the university to renew the grant or explore new areas. In those circumstances, who will be left in the lab to supervise the students? As the Minister knows, the principal investigator is often not around to do the hands-on supervision and training of students. Often, the result will be either demoralised doctoral students or poorly less incisively done science. The role of the laboratory expert with experience must be recognised, cherished and nurtured. I fear that that is not happening at the moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para8"><a name="stpa_305">Despite the initiatives that the Minister will no doubt describe, the position is not getting better. Although I&nbsp;welcome the initiatives, in recent years the proportion of research funding that universities receive in the form of fixed-term grants has gradually increased. The type of funding that promotes short termism has increased, as a result of which the proportion of researchers on short-term contracts has also increased markedly. Currently, more than half of post-doctoral researchers in United Kingdom universities are funded through short-term contracts, and that proportion is increasing. We are now left with a growing number of people who have a lack of job security as a result of working on multiple short-term contracts, which is a strong disincentive for scientists to remain in academia. Researchers can end up spending many years on short-term contracts, each lasting for only two to three years, but as their experience grows they become more expensive to employ, and ultimately they may be priced out of the market in favour of young, less experienced scientists on a lower pay scale.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para9"><a name="stpa_306">It is a matter of chiefs and indians. I am not arguing that every post-doctoral researcher should be given a job for life and tenure. No one would argue that, but 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 69WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
there must be ways to enable the best of the post-doctoral researchers who are not in a position to take on lectureships or principal investigator roles to convert to open-ended contracts. Some people are simply not interested in doing that and are interested only in doing the work that they love. They recognise that that will limit their lifetime earnings, but there must be a way to allow them to convert to open-ended contracts.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para10"><a name="stpa_307">Another problem engendered by the present culture is that researchers are constantly moving every two to three years. Research projects have little continuity and suffer as a consequence, making it less likely that research goals can be reached. I accept that we cannot be too purist about such matters because it is necessary for researchers to be mobile at an early stage in their career if that suits the area that they are exploring. They must be able to look at different groups, try different techniques and have the opportunity to move around. I&nbsp;am not saying that there are no benefits in mobility, but it is not the case that those benefits cannot be achieved&#151;indeed, I believe that they can be best achieved&#151;from the basis of an open-ended contract that people can move from because they have the confidence to put everything into their scientific career without worrying about whether they ought to consider training in something else in order to have some form of career that will give them the job security that they need as they enter their 30s.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para11"><a name="stpa_308">There is also concern that the training received by post-doctoral researchers on short-term contracts does not meet all their development needs. It often relates specifically to their research fields and does not provide them with transferable skills. I am pleased that there are initiatives to provide a certain number of sessions and funding to go with that to tackle the problem, but has the evaluation been done?


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para12"><a name="stpa_309">I am not the first person to raise the issue. It has been raised in the main outside general parliamentary debate. It has certainly been investigated in Science and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology Committee reports&#151;there have been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lords and Commons reports into such issues. Sir&nbsp;Gareth Roberts&#039; report &quot;SET for Success: The supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills&quot; clearly stated several points. It said that research councils and other research sponsors should significantly increase starting salaries for post-doctoral researchers. Some of that has now been done through the initiative in the higher education sector to tackle issues of equal pay for work of equal value, which has generally tended to uplift salaries, but no one could argue that that solved the problem&#151;the difference between people of the same age in different jobs who are and are not clinically qualified is enormous&#151;or that that current post-doctoral research salaries are satisfactory. Sir Gareth also pointed out that unattractive career structures, including short-term contracts and low levels of responsibility, are responsible for deterring postgraduates from pursuing a career in science.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para13"><a name="stpa_310">The final report of the Research Careers Initiative, which stemmed from the work of Sir Gareth Roberts and his colleagues, recommended that various issues be taken forward by the Research Funders&#039; Forum and dealt with in the promulgation of a new protocol to renew the old protocol on setting higher standards for post-doctoral research. I should like to ask the Minister 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 70WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
what point that work has reached, because the timetable set in the report appears to have slipped drastically. No&nbsp;help is found in the minutes of the careers research sub-committee of the Research Funders&#039; Forum, because the only minutes available on the website are of what appears to be the first meeting, held on 1 October 2004. That talks about reporting to the Research Funders&#039; Forum in April 2005, and states that it is intended that work on the replacement for the concordat will be completed by July 2005 and presented to the Research Funders&#039; Forum in autumn 2005. I&nbsp;should like the Minister to tell me what has happened.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para14"><a name="stpa_311">Finally, I should like to touch on the European working time directive on short-term working. The EU fixed-term contract directive is designed to protect workers by preventing employers from using successive contracts as a means to avoid making employment permanent. To comply, Governments and the member states must introduce measures that specify


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;(a) objective reasons for justifying the renewal of such contracts and relationships;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">(b) the maximum total duration of successive fixed-time contracts or relationships;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para15"><a name="stpa_312">and&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">(c) the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para16"><a name="stpa_313">Crucially, the directive requires that fixed-term workers


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;shall not be treated in a less favourable manner .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they have a fixed-term contract or relation unless different treatment is justified on objective grounds.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para17"><a name="stpa_314">It is unclear what the impact of that has been in this country. I shall be grateful if the Minister clarifies what work is being done to identify whether&#151;in contrast to what we hear from Cancer Research UK&#151;there has been a move towards universities giving people open-ended contracts funded by the prospect and prediction of grant income, which is one of the key ways forward. Post-doctoral researchers tell me that that directive means only that they get a few hundred pounds in redundancy money; it does not change the situation on the ground.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para18"><a name="stpa_315">Finally&#151;recognising that we do not have time for a full debate about all the issues&#151;I remind the Minister that one of the key points about the treatment of this group of people is the differential and disproportionate affect that it has on women and ethnic minorities in science. That message runs throughout the reports&#151;it is not directly dealt with, but is certainly referred to in almost every report&#151;and the Government clearly recognise it. If the Government&#039;s commitment to promoting science as a career for women and promoting the careers of women in science is to mean anything, they must tackle the problems of short-term contract working, a demoralised work force, and the loss of expertise and the waste of talent and investment that results from people leaving science because of unsatisfactory career prospects for those who are good at science and who would otherwise want to continue. I&nbsp;look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.

<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60110h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Barry Gardiner) </b> : Mr. O&#039;Hara, anyone reading <i>Hansard </i>may be confused about why I address you in the Chair, but the quick change that was done in the hot seat while the hon.

and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) was speaking has brought you to it and I am glad to see you there supervising the remainder of this afternoon&#039;s debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para19"><a name="stpa_316">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the subject of post-doctoral scientific careers and for the way in which he based his contribution on the experience of conducting his own research among the researchers. He spoke with great candour and I shall try to respond in the same vein.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para20"><a name="stpa_317">The Government attach importance to this subject, which is particularly significant if we are to realise the UK-wide and European-wide targets that depend so much on having enough well trained scientists. If the UK is to have a supply of highly motivated and well trained post-doctoral scientists, it is essential that their career options are attractive. The Government&#039;s determination to achieve that has been evident in the last two spending review commitments. For example, one key theme of the 2004 spending review allocations was the importance of strengthening the health of the engineering and physical science disciplines. The &#163;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion allocation of funding for the period between 2005 and 2008 aims to lay the foundations by improving the health of key disciplines.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para21"><a name="stpa_318">The hon. Gentleman introduced one perhaps contentious note when he spoke about student fees and the legacy of debt that they leave. I trust that he acknowledges that whereas under the old regime post-doctoral students would face a requirement to pay back 9p in every pound that they earned over &#163;10,000, under the new regime the threshold is raised to &#163;15,000. Year on year, while they are doing their post-doctoral studies, the chances are that they will be at least &#163;450 better off and less likely to have to repay the debt in the first place. I shall not dwell on that point, because the hon. Gentleman made a great many important comments to which I want to respond.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para22"><a name="stpa_319">The Government have already taken steps to improve the attractiveness of careers in science and to maintain the future supply of skilled people by enthusing schoolchildren about science and careers in that field. In recent years we have made a number of changes that have improved the attractiveness of research careers generally and the conditions for those engaged in them. Those changes stem from the review, which the hon.&nbsp;Gentleman mentioned, carried out by Sir Gareth Roberts on the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills. The &quot;SET for Success&quot; review brought to wide attention the key issues that affect post-doctoral and other research staff in universities and their impact on the recruitment and retention of those individuals. Issues included a lack of a clear career structure, uncertain career prospects, unsatisfactory training and increasingly uncompetitive salaries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para23"><a name="stpa_320">Although universities and research organisations are the employers of post-doctoral scientists, the Government, through the research councils, have introduced a series of measures designed to encourage employers to improve the attractiveness of research careers and to support the training and development offered by universities and research organisations. The Government have provided &#163;185 million of new money up until 2007&#150;08 to introduce the so-called Roberts 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 72WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
measures. They are aimed at not only post-doctoral researchers, but at PhD students, who have benefited enormously from them. Specifically, research council PhD students, who comprise about one third of the total, receive a stipend of at least &#163;12,000, tax-free. That represents a tangible increase in their remuneration, which has almost doubled since 1998, and it improves the attractiveness of further study to those who have the capacity to go on with it. That is at least one way in which the Government have attempted to address the problem, on which the hon. Gentleman commented, of people feeling under-valued.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para24"><a name="stpa_321">Research council PhD students also receive two weeks of training in transferable skills every year&#151;another issue mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. That has already had an impact on attitudes to such training in UK universities, and universities are actively participating in the sharing of good practice. Measures are also being developed in consultation with the sector to evaluate the impact of that additional training on the employability of PhD graduates.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para25"><a name="stpa_322">For post-doctoral researchers, funding has increased research council salaries in areas that experience recruitment and retention difficulties. Research council researchers are also now provided with career development training through that funding. In addition, a new academic fellowship scheme has been developed to provide 1,000 new fellowships over five years. The schemes aim to provide more stable and attractive routes into academic careers, for which the hon. Gentleman was calling.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para26"><a name="stpa_323">As part of the process of assessing the effectiveness of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these measures, the research councils have commissioned a study to monitor the impact of increased funding for post-doctoral salaries on the higher education employment culture. They are particularly interested in the impact that that aspect of the funding has had on the employment practices of universities and research organisations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para27"><a name="stpa_324">With regard to the other measures aimed at post-doctoral researchers, the academic fellowships scheme has had a positive impact, and at least two universities have effectively cloned the scheme for the recruitment of their academic staff. The scheme has a clear structure that aims towards an academic career and includes outreach work into schools and teaching duties. That clear structure tackles the concern that the post-doctoral researcher has no identifiable career path. The scheme was launched in March 2004, and 398 fellows are now in place. If their performance is satisfactory, those fellows will be given a permanent academic post at the end of the five-year fellowship.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para28"><a name="stpa_325">The funding for skills training for post-doctoral researchers has enabled universities to expand considerably their training and support for post-doctoral researchers and to provide them with opportunities to develop broader professional skills. That step change in the training and support provided to post-doctoral researchers in universities allows them to explore the full range of their responsibilities as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientists, including commercial awareness and sensitivity to public concerns about the advancement of science. The training focuses on a researcher functioning in a variety of research environments and therefore equips them with broad experiences that they can apply to a range of research problems. In addition to that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 73WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
training, the research councils operate targeted schemes that provide researchers with broader training, including public engagement training, and grants for public engagement activities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para29"><a name="stpa_326">Further changes in recent years have had positive impacts on post-doctoral researchers in the university sector. One such change was the introduction of the fixed-term employee regulations in 2002, which the hon.&nbsp;Gentleman outlined. Under the regulations, from July 2006, when a researchers contract is renewed, those with more than four years&#039; fixed-term employment will have to be considered for permanent employment. The use of short-term contracts is a fundamental issue that affects the recruitment and retention of researchers in the university research sector. Placing the risks and uncertainties created by short-term funding on to the researchers makes it difficult for them to plan their lives and careers. It is not uncommon for researchers to work without pay while they are waiting for the outcome of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grant applications, yet such dedication to their profession is often taken for granted by their employees. The fixed-term regulations should deal with many of these issues by encouraging universities to move away from over-reliance on the use of fixed-term contracts. They will need to be far more proactive in the management and development of their post-doctoral researchers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60110h05_para30"><a name="stpa_327">Some employers have already taken steps to reduce the use of fixed-term contracts. Research council institutes, for example, have already introduced guidelines to ensure that fixed-term contracts are used only in very limited circumstances&#151;for example, when specialist skills are required in the short term. The 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>10 Jan 2006 : Column 74WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
reliance on fixed-term contracts in the higher education sector is also being challenged through other initiatives. For example, the introduction of the full economic costing of university research now means that universities can include so-called bridging funds as an indirect cost in grant applications to research councils. That allows them to continue the employment of a researcher while grant applications are pending, so although the fixed-term regulations require universities to provide proper redundancy procedures, full economic costing of research allows universities to build contingency funds to manage the redundancy of their permanent researchers should it become necessary.

At present, while such mobility is very beneficial generally to the development of research, it can also be viewed as being enforced in some instances. Those who are less mobile, perhaps because of family commitments, could be disadvantaged, as the hon. Gentleman described very succinctly. The regulations should, however, help in that researchers will be able to take control of their careers. They will be able to seek out further career moves as and when it suits them, rather than having relocations forced on them because a contract ends.

<a name="60110h05_para32"><a name="stpa_329">Salaries are also seen to affect the attractiveness of careers in research. Although most researchers often cite their interest in their subject area as the prime reason for undertaking such careers, the role of pay cannot be overlooked.
