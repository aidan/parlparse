<a name="50209h01_head1"><h3 align=center>Nottingham East Midlands Airport</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Gilliam Merron.]</i>
</p>



<a name="50209h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. Frank Cook): Before we start, I think it advisable to tell the Chamber that I am required today to apply a new ruling on procedure. We are debating today a local, rather than national, issue, although I am sure that national aspects to it will be mentioned. None the less, many Members will want to speak. The new ruling on such occasions is that the two Opposition spokesmen will have only five minutes each towards the end of the debate, leaving the Minister with 10 minutes. That will allow more Members with a local interest to make a contribution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para0">I understand that, at present, probably 10 Members will seek to catch my eye. I therefore ask all right hon. and hon. Members who seek to contribute to the debate to bear in mind the number of their colleagues who will be waiting to speak, not only in the contributions that they make, but in the interventions that they accept and the responses that they make.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Edward Garnier  (Harborough)</b>  (Con): I begin by thanking you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for chairing this morning&#039;s debate; I also ask you to pass on my thanks to the Speaker for granting it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para1">You were correct, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in saying that we are debating a matter of great local concern. However, it is local not only to north-west Leicestershire, where Nottingham East Midlands airport is situated; I am delighted to see the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) here today. It is also a matter of huge regional concern, and not only to those who represent Leicestershire seats. I see to my left my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell). The hon. Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) is present in the Chamber; but I also see other Members who have a regional interest; the hon. Members for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton), for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) and for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para2">I am pleased also to see the former leader of Manchester council, the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer). You may not know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that Nottingham East Midlands airport is owned by the Manchester Airport company, a company that is owned by 10 or so local government authorities from Manchester and Greater Manchester. Needless to say, I am delighted also that the new Aviation Minister is here. Although she not has not yet had the opportunity to visit Nottingham East Midlands airport, she had the benefit, when opening the Rearsby bypass, of learning at first hand what the people of east

&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 420WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Leicestershire think of the current state of affairs and of the proposals to expand the number of flights in and out of East Midlands airport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para3">My right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) is a former east midlands Member of Parliament and a Leicestershire resident, so he knows at first-hand about some of the issues that will be raised today. He is also the shadow Minister for Aviation, and I am delighted that he is present. We are also blessed with the presence of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). He has a more distant relationship with the east midlands but, on his weekly flights between Westminster and his constituency, he will have flown over our part of the country. Nevertheless, he is welcome, and I hope that he has an opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if only briefly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para4">I want to open up for discussion the subject of accountability. The three organisations that need to be held accountable to the people of Leicestershire, and particularly to my constituents, are the Department for Transport, the Civil Aviation Authority and the airport company. I suggest that the Department for Transport has been careless, to say the least, and recklessly disregardful of the interests of the people of Leicestershire and of my constituency in Harborough, insofar as it has a policy for expanding East Midlands airport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para5">I accept that the matter of East Midlands airport will have come across the desk of the present Minister and previous Ministers over the past few years. The Department for Transport produced a White Paper, &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; in December 2003 which, in part, dealt with East Midlands airport. At paragraph 9.23, it stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;East Midlands Airport has seen passenger traffic virtually double in 2002&#150;2003, with two &#039;no-frills&#039; carriers developing significant bases at the airport. It is now handling around 4.5mppa. Forecasts suggest that by 2030 it could attract between 12mppa and 14mppa.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para6">The White Paper goes on to say that the airport
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;is also the third largest freight airport in the UK, and is the leading UK airport for freight carried in all-cargo aircraft. It is the main centre of operations in the UK for two of the four major global express freight operators, and an important regional base for another. Forecasts indicate that East Midlands Airport could be handling as much as 2.5 million tonnes of freight a year, possibly more, by 2030.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para7">The White Paper also says that the airport
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;is situated away from the main centres of population, and a relatively small number of people live in the 57dBA noise contour. However, the projected growth of the airport would increase the size of the contour to include over 10,000 people. Moreover, the nature of the air-cargo operations means that many flights are at night, when background noise levels are lower. There is likely to be a large increase in the number of flights at night; our consultation document forecast that there could be over 60,000&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para8">the Government&#039;s figure&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;cargo flights a year by 2030, and a substantial proportion of these are likely to be in the late evening or the night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The airport owners foresee a need for a second runway at the airport around 2020, regardless of decisions about runways at other airports. They project that there will be a shortage of runway capacity during late evening hours, when the last inbound passenger flights overlap with the peak period of arrivals by cargo aircraft. However, this assessment is based on higher estimates of traffic 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</ul>



<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 421WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>during these critical hours than we currently forecast at the airport, which impacts on the economic benefits of a second runway.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew2"><b> Dr. Nick Palmer  (Broxtowe)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for giving way and apologise for the fact that I cannot stay for the entire debate. It is probably true that, at present, the airport impacts on relatively limited population areas, but that will change with the proposed new flight paths. In my constituency and others, significantly more people will be affected by them.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right. I shall deal in a moment with evidence that a larger proportion of the population, certainly in our county of Leicestershire, will be affected by the new flight paths. Moreover, the numbers and frequency of aircraft coming in and out of East Midlands airport will continue not only to affect those who are currently badly affected, which might include the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents, but to aggravate or produce a far worse situation for my constituents and those of my neighbours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para9">We must bear in mind that my constituency is between 20 and 50 miles from the airport. The Government have concentrated their thinking on those who live within a close area around the airport. They have, in my submission, failed to understand that the aircraft that take off from the airport and come into the airport will damage the quality of life, not only of those who live in the vicinity, but those who live, work and try to sleep further away from the airport. The two new flight paths that the airport wants introduced and which the CAA gave permission to be introduced last July will cause massive environmental and pollution damage to areas well beyond the current official noise pollution area. People do not have to live within a mile of the airport to be affected by aircraft noise, or within five miles of it to be affected by aviation fuel pollution. I wish to speak, and seek accountability, on behalf of people who live well away from the airport but still within the region of it. The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire will speak with great eloquence and force on behalf of his people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para10">The key to my argument against the Government is their failure to appreciate the needs of those who live that bit further away from the airport. The key to what we need and the protection we seek is to be provided by an existing remedy, which has existed since 1982, thanks to the Civil Aviation Act of that year. Under section 79, the Secretary of State has power to order the designation of an airport. So far, only three airports are designated under the Act; Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. In 1982, they did not generate as much night flight traffic as NEMA&#151;Nottingham East Midlands airport&#151;does now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para11">NEMA is the acronym by which the airport is known. However, I say in parenthesis, as it were, that should people be concerned that a Leicestershire Member of Parliament is arguing about an airport named &quot;Nottingham&quot;, Nottingham East Midlands airport is wholly within Leicestershire. My council tax payers pay for the policing of that airport. My local transport infrastructure is paid for by Leicestershire county council, in so far as that is the highways authority.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 422WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para12">It is called Nottingham East Midlands airport, and so be it. I will not delay the debate by worrying about that. Its postal address is in Derby. Already, one can see that this is a confused picture, but it is clear that the airport is generating a great deal of public concern. Neither the Department for Transport nor the airport company is fully on board in understanding the public responsibilities that they have to the victims of the airport, and the CAA is not either.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para13">That is not to say that the airport should not exist and that it does not bring economic benefits to the country as a whole, or even to the locality. Clearly, there are people who live in north-west Leicestershire, Loughborough, Charnwood and the city of Leicester who have jobs at the airport. The economic benefits of the airport are primarily for the wider economic benefit of the country; the freight-forwarding world and the wider economy. The economic and other disbenefits affect the people of Leicestershire. There is an imbalance of benefit and disbenefit. My constituents suffer the disbenefits without achieving the benefits.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b>  (Lab): The hon. and learned Gentleman touched on designation. I wonder whether he could answer a point that I have often raised. The various operators and the airport have operated within legitimate planning consents granted by North West Leicestershire district council&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew5"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): And others.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Todd </b> : And others, as my hon. Friend says. Should designation control activities move to a level below that operated by the existing operators at the airport, presumably they would seek compensation for interference in an entirely legal&#151;as it is now&#151;activity.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> : I do not want to make a flippant point, but this Government have not had a good record in providing compensation for those whose legitimate activities have been banned. At the moment there is an imbalance of power and no equality between those who wish noise and air pollution to be controlled and restricted, and those who are doing the polluting. The Environmental Audit Committee&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew8"><b> Mr. Todd </b> : That is not an answer.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> : I have not yet finished.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para14">Yesterday, the Environmental Audit Committee, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth), issued a very strong report; the Government and the hon. Member for South Derbyshire may care to read it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para15">Designation is the best idea that I can come up with that would provide the protection required by my constituents and those of my neighbours. At the minute, the only control over noise and air pollution are the powers of North West Leicestershire district council as a planning authority, and it cannot be suggested that that council has the same economic power as the airport company. I have made the point before, but I shall make it again; I very much suspect that the annual turnover of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 423WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the shop in East Midlands airport is better and bigger than the revenue budget of North West Leicestershire district council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para16">My own two local authorities&#151;Oadby and Wigston borough council and Harborough district council&#151;have revenue budgets of about &#163;7 million a year. I do not think that North West Leicestershire district council&#039;s budget is more than &#163;3 million or so more. Local authorities of that size simply do not have the financial or economic&#151;still less political&#151;clout to deal with the issue. More importantly, a planning authority can deal only with what is on the ground; it can control only the development of the buildings and the tarmac. It has no say on the amount of aeroplanes that fly above it; it has no say over the numbers of aeroplanes that chuck noise and filth from the back of their engines. Nor does the county council, whose government area includes the whole of East Midlands airport&#039;s real estate, have any say on such matters. It was not even consulted when the new flight paths were advertised and suggested about a year ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para17">Furthermore, I am not convinced that the voluntary agreement that NEMA has perfectly properly entered into&#151;its 10-point plan&#151;is enforceable in any way that my constituents would recognise. It is monitored by a thing called the independent consultative committee. As I understand it, and the Minister will correct me if I have it wrong, the chairman of that committee is paid a salary&#151;although not a huge one&#151;by the airport. I fully understand that it is possible to be independent and yet to receive a salary from the very person that one is supposed to be monitoring; it is intellectually possible to achieve that. However, it is difficult to overcome the perception that there may be an absence of independence if one happens to be the paid, salaried employee&#151;even on a part-time basis&#151;of the very organisation that one is trying to monitor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para18">The independent consultative committee does not include anybody from Leicestershire county council, the biggest local government authority and the nearest economic force of any size to the airport company. I see that the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) has joined us. As I understand it, although Leicester city council has a far bigger revenue budget than those of the district councils in my constituency and that of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire, its budget cannot come anywhere near the economic might of the organisation that I am discussing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para19">I want to see designation under the Civil Aviation Act, and I want to see that now. I want the Minister and her Secretary of State actively to engage their minds on the issue and come to understand what it is like to live in Leicestershire with a large, growing airport, whose specialisation is the movement of goods in and out at night; between the hours of 11 pm and 6 or 7 in the morning. You may not know this, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but the figures for 2003 demonstrate that there are more night flights in and out of East Midlands airport than at Stansted, Gatwick or Heathrow. Those airports were designated in 1982 or 1983, but ours has not been.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Andy Reed  (Loughborough)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will come to the point that I wanted to raise. What does he expect from designation? As he knows, I live under the flight path, so I declare an interest. It is fine to campaign for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 424WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
designation, but does he want a full night-time ban as a consequence? As part of an informed debate, we need to know exactly what we mean by designating the airport.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> : The hon. Gentleman knows full well that I am not asking for a total ban, which would be unrealistic and plain silly. The airport has a right to exist and to thrive, but it must do so only when it does so politely&#151;I say that deliberately&#151;and lives in harmony with its neighbours. The good neighbour principle applies not only to the law of negligence, but to the everyday work of any big business.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para20">Let us suppose that East Midlands airport was a factory, making valuable goods that benefited the nation, including my constituents and those of the hon. Member for Loughborough, but the manufacturing process required it to chuck volumes of pollution into the skies through its chimneys. Would the hon. Gentleman and I expect that nothing should be done to control the pollution? No. Would we expect that factory to be allowed to continue to pollute the atmosphere, whether in the form of noise, toxic gases or any other antisocial pollution, without some control? No.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para21">Would the hon. Member for Loughborough expect North West Leicestershire district council, a tiny financial organisation, to be able, on its own, to monitor and control that pollution? Would he expect an independent consultative committee, composed of people paid by that factory, to keep an eye on its 10-point plan? No, he would not. I ask the hon. Gentleman a simple question; why should not it be the same for an airport, especially one that already has twice the number of night flights that Gatwick has, twice the number at Heathrow and more than twice the number at Stansted?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para22">I am delighted to have received the Minister&#039;s thoughtful and polite answers in correspondence, but she merely repeated the arguments advanced by her predecessors; the Minister of State, Department for Transport, the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr.&nbsp;McNulty) and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson). They also wrote to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr.&nbsp;Clarke), who supports my case, saying that local matters of this sort must be decided locally. I hope that I have exposed the futility and unreality of that argument.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para23">As a Conservative Member of Parliament, I support the free movement of capital. I want a strong private sector and vibrant industry. I want my constituents to be able to travel abroad and I want this country&#039;s import and export system, by ship and by air, to work. I say that it is not reasonable to rely on North West Leicestershire district council&#039;s planning powers to control the growing leviathan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para24">So much for the Government. The Minister is also present to answer for the Civil Aviation Authority, but what is it? No one really knows. Is it a quango or a private company that is partly owned by the Government? Its nearest equivalent is the BBC. It is not part of the Government; it is funded by the &quot;licence fees&quot; of those who use the airspace. Its board and members are, to a large extent, peopled by those who come from the air industry, which is fair enough as they know what they are talking about. They know what is going on in the air, but they do not know what is going on in my

<br>&nbsp;<br>
constituency. They do not know what it is like to live in a village in rural Leicestershire and to have aeroplanes flying over their houses at night; all night, as the number of night flights will increase. They do not know what it is like to live in a part of the country where the ambient noise at night is more or less nil.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para25">A group of which I am a supporter, ELVAA&#151;East Leicestershire Villages Against Airspace&#151;and its sister organisation, DEMAND&#151;Demand East Midlands Airport is Now Designated&#151;have used consultants to investigate the noise levels. The noise levels in my constituency and in the constituency where I live are very low indeed at night.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para26">When a large freight aircraft is flown over these rural villages at night, the graph shoots up. The noise, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is the equivalent of someone using a vacuum cleaner by your ear as you sleep in your bedroom. I do not know what you get up to in your bedroom at night, but I dare say the prospect of having an aircraft flying over your head when you have been used to more or less total quiet would not amuse you. But it seems to pass by the people at East Midlands airport, the CAA and the Ministers at the Department for Transport. &quot;Bad luck,&quot; they say. &quot;This is called burden-sharing. Those who live in and around the airport have had to put up with the noise of the aircraft coming in and out over the last few years. Now it is your turn.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para27">It is an argument, but not a very attractive one and it is made all the less attractive when it is said that fewer people will be affected. The county council has done the analysis and says that 60 per cent. more acreage of Leicestershire and approximately 20 to 30 per cent more people will be affected by the two new flight paths in and out of NEMA. So when the Government, the CAA and NEMA say, &quot;This is a wonderful idea. We are going to damage the lives of fewer people, not more&quot; they are, on the analysis carried out by the county council, wrong.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para28">I would rather that the arguments were put forward on the basis of the truth than something short of that. Far be it from me to suggest that they are deliberately not telling the truth; I merely say that the facts suggest otherwise. It is inevitable that my constituents and those of my neighbours will be adversely affected. They are naturally and properly concerned that East Midlands airport, the CAA and the Department for Transport are running roughshod over their rights and interests.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew12"><b> Keith Vaz  (Leicester, East)</b>  (Lab): I was trying to see how the hon. and learned Gentleman would apply the principle of Donahue v. Stevenson to the operation of East Midlands airport. He raised the issue of neighbours and residents. Would he be surprised to know that although East Midlands airport held a consultation in Evington in my constituency, which borders on his, few people knew about that meeting and few attended until I had written to everybody? One of the problems with the consultation exercise is that people have not been consulted properly.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> : The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. Whereas two years ago East Midlands airport&#039;s attitude towards his constituents and mine was appalling, it is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 426WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
better now. The slope that it has to climb in order to get public acceptance of its case is so steep that I fear it will never recover or gain the reputation for good neighbourliness and for proper consultation that it should have had and it should have tried to have before it set out on this operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para29">Since the bad old days of last year there have been roadshows in his constituency, in mine and in others. There have been meetings at the office of the previous Minister with officials from NEMA and affected Members of Parliament. There has been a display in the presence of directors of the airport company in a Committee Room here in the House. I fully accept that the airport is now, at last, trying to do its best to come across as a more friendly neighbour. But why does it not produce maps showing the full extent of the proposed flight paths, both incoming and outgoing, which come straight over the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency and mine? Why does it not, unless pushed and pushed and pushed, provide us with the raw data that we need? Why do the airport, the CAA and the Department for Transport not insist on that? Why are they reluctant unless made to do it? Why do they not behave with great candour and with frankness? It is much easier to deal with a person who tells the truth voluntarily than to have to extract the facts and information, like pulling teeth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para30">Because of that, everything that those organisations now say is filtered through the sieve of disbelief that my constituents and I, and no doubt the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) and his constituents, feel. That is a pity, because I dare say that there is a case to be made for NEMA and for the Department for Transport&#039;s inaction. But we are not hearing it, and when we do hear it, we find it extremely difficult to believe. That is not my fault, but I think that the hon. Gentleman and I know whose fault it is. It is up to those organisations to understand that we, our constituents and our constituency neighbours are not just displaying a nimby attitude.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para31">This is a matter of national, regional and intimate local importance that the Government are failing to address, which the CAA, with all its imperfections and abilities, is failing to understand and which East Midlands airport&#151;wilfully, I suggest&#151;is being slow to comprehend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para32">I am acutely conscious that I have had the lion&#039;s share of the debate, but there is a host of other things that I should like to say that are critical of the Government, the CAA and National Air Traffic Services (En Route) Ltd or NERL. That is another strange body about which we know little and should know more and which should be accountable to us through this Chamber and the main Chamber of the House of Commons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para33">I should like to say much more about the quality control or noise control arrangements that East Midlands airport implements or does not implement. For example, in the last quarter of 2004, only one aircraft was fined for noise abuse, even though, as I understand it, there were about 170,000 air movements in and out of the airport either last year or the year before. Is it surprising that my constituents, and I on behalf of my constituents, are deeply sceptical that we will get justice from the Department for Transport, the CAA and NEMA, not least because all three 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 427WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
organisations are wholly unaccountable to the people of Harborough, Oadby and Wigston and wider Leicestershire?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para34">On that note, I urge the Minister to come back with concrete proposals to bring NEMA under some form of democratic control, and I urge all other right hon. and hon. Members present to try to understand the genuine concerns of the people of my part of Leicestershire, because those concerns will not go away until the issues are properly and adequately addressed by the three organisations that I have cited.
</p>

<p><a name="50209h01_spnew15"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I congratulate my county colleague, the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), on obtaining the debate and introducing an outline of the topic in such a detailed, comprehensive and exhaustive fashion. Although the keen interest in East Midlands airport of other Leicestershire MPs here today has come some years later than I would have liked, it is nevertheless most welcome.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para35">Understandably, many local organisations and people have long been happy to experience the airport&#039;s undoubted social and economic benefits. Low-cost holiday flights and 8,000 jobs certainly contribute to the regional standard of living, but what about the quality of life for communities around the airport and the people who live under its flight paths? They also have needs, rights and views.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para36">For too long, successive Governments have failed adequately to recognise the scale of unaddressed local problems. The voice of local villages has too often been drowned out by the noisy and powerful aviation lobby. Concern has turned to protest as night noise from the heavens has made East Midlands airport the neighbour from hell. Those of us who have been trying to hold the environmental fort for a decade or more welcome the recent reinforcements from the parliamentary cavalry in the east and the south of the county; they have not arrived a moment too soon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para37">At East Midlands airport, there are more than 80,000 aircraft movements per annum, of which more than 50,000 are scheduled air transport movements&#151;ATMs&#151;of passengers and freight. Approximately 17,000 of those take place at night, in the eight hours after 11 pm. That astonishing figure is set to quadruple by 2030.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para38">In the past, expansion at the airport has been approved by central or local government, with no specific controls being applied to flying activities. There is no lack of ideas about what an enforceable framework for the airport should contain if it is to ameliorate some of the environmental downsides. Four years ago, independent consultant Rupert Taylor&#151;no relation&#151;published a noise review after North West Leicestershire district council asked him to recommend appropriate controls. He suggested a minimum reasonable framework, with seven constraints, but I shall mention 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 428WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
just three; banning night movements by aircraft with high noise levels, limiting the annual number of night aircraft movements and a night noise quota.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para39">To local campaigners, and indeed the district council, that framework, including the four measures that I have not mentioned, seemed to be a reasonable compromise, which struck a balance between the needs of the various parties; the stakeholders, in new Labour parlance. In 2002, however, the Secretary of State refused to apply those controls as part of a request by the district council that the airport be designated under the Civil Aviation Act 1982. At the same time, the airport suggested a voluntary package of measures to control night-time noise, which the Secretary of State accepted. The district council and residents groups regarded that package as inadequate and did not agree to it. However, let us move on a year or so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para40">In December 2003, in the White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, the Government supported the growth of night freight flights at East Midlands airport, but stated: &quot;However this&quot;&#151;the expansion of air freight operations&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;would need to be accompanied by stringent controls on night noise in particular and increasingly generous noise insulation and other mitigation measures. These measures should build on those applying currently.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para41">The White Paper failed to quantify the possible increase in night flights, to define any acceptable level for night-time community noise, to estimate how many people may be affected or to suggest specific noise control or mitigation measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para42">Now that the Secretary of State has rejected the workable, moderate and reasonable operational and environmental controls proposed by the district council, we have been left with the voluntary measures suggested by East Midlands airport to control night-time noise, which are regarded locally as cosmetic and unchallenging. Those voluntary measures include no safeguards as regards future increases in night-time noise. In 2003, the night noise contour was estimated at 8.3 sq km, and there is a proposal to allow the night noise contour and night noise to double by 2011. It is no longer sufficient for the airport to follow other airports in implementing night-time controls or to rely on established industry standards, which have often been established for daytime noise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para43">If the Minister resists our call for airport designation, I would still urge her to use her powers and her influence with the airport considerably to toughen the present voluntary framework and to put it on a proper, enforceable footing. The first item in the voluntary code is to encourage the operation of aircraft during the day, instead of the night, but that is weak and inadequate. As Melbourne Civic Society&#151;it is not in north-west Leicestershire, but I commend its work&#151;and others have recommended, East Midlands airport must ensure that the minimum number of aircraft operate at night. It is wholly unacceptable for the airport to continue to allow flights at night for any reason and by any aircraft. There should be clear criteria to govern allowable reasons for night flights and they should be incorporated in the airport master plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para44">The definition of the quietest aircraft type should be based on absolute noise levels and should allow only the quietest aircraft on the quota count scale; that is, only 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 429WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
QC/0.5 and exempt. The Secretary of State has established that criterion for the daytime operation of a proposed new runway at Birmingham airport, but there is no justification for a more lax criterion to be applied to night-time operations at East Midlands airport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para45">I could cover ways of strengthening the other eight objectives of the East Midlands airport voluntary code, but others wish to speak and I can write to the Minister in more detail. All I say in closing is that local communities and those who represent them will not walk quietly away from the issue. Our clamour will eventually match and outdo that of the powerful aviation and airports industry, even though the Manchester Airport Group may be advertising today in <i>The Guardian</i> for someone who can schmooze parliamentarians.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para46">We want the industry to succeed; it is important socially and economically that it does so. However, the lack of environmental controls means that the industry is flying straight into trouble. It should recognise that, as should the Government. We must respond to the requests for help from airport communities. I hope that when the Minister winds up, she will bring fresh ministerial thinking to the topic, as it is long overdue.

<p><a name="50209h01_spnew17"><b> Mr. Stephen Dorrell  (Charnwood)</b>  (Con): I shall try to keep to the implied quota that your mathematics offers me, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para47">I want to focus my remarks exclusively on designation. I am not against the development of NEMA and I am not against air travel, either by passengers or by air freight. However, the core issue is that the Government&#151;this is not a party issue, because the previous Government pursued the same policy&#151;have, in effect if not in law, made a planning decision that East Midlands airport should be allowed to develop as both a passenger airport, which does not mark it out from other airports around the country, and a specialist centre for air freight, with the implied emphasis on night flying.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para48">What is the business purpose of air freight? It is to get next-day delivery of urgent commodities elsewhere in the world, which implies a disproportionate stress on night flying, as compared with the air passenger business. I support designation because I see it as balancing the Government&#039;s planning decision, which has been taken in favour of developing air freight, with implied night flying, at NEMA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para49">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), whom I congratulate on securing this debate, quoted from the White Paper on airports. Paragraph 9.28 of the White Paper encapsulates my argument:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we consider that the projected expansion of air freight operations at East Midlands should be permitted.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para50">If that is not an expression of a planning opinion, I do not know what it is. The paragraph continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;However, this would need to be accompanied by stringent controls on night noise in particular and increasingly generous noise insulation and other mitigation measures.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 430WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para51">I entirely agree with that line. However, when Ministers are asked whether they will designate the airport, to give the powers to act on the expressed opinion about the implications of developing night flying, they remind me somewhat of Pontius Pilate. Their response is to say that the issue ought to be dealt with by voluntarism, by the local planning authority or by someone else; anyone other than the Minister who made the decision to impose the noise constraints that are the subject of the discussion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para52">My pitch to the Minister is not to stand back from East Midlands airport, and certainly not to obstruct the development of air transport, which is an important part of a modern economy. Politicians make themselves look stupid when they appear to disapprove of something that the rest of the world regards as normal and probably desirable. Of course, the transport of air passengers and air freight has to be allowed to develop, but as my hon. and learned Friend said, that must happen within the principles of good neighbourliness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para53">In the context of a local planning decision, we regard it as entirely normal that the planning authority should make a decision about what is allowed to go ahead and, if necessary, impose conditions to make that planning decision as acceptable as possible to the surrounding community. The Government are making the fundamental planning decision on the development of East Midlands airport as a freight hub, but they are not engaging in the planning decisions that are intrinsic to the decision that they have made. The Government have made half a decision, but have not been prepared to face up to the consequences of the other half.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para54">My argument is simple. I support the development of NEMA. I am not against the Government making the decisions&#151; those are properly taken by Government, not the local planning authority&#151;but I encourage them to take the whole decision, not just half of it.
</p>



<a name="50209h01_time3"><h5>10.16 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Mark Todd  (South Derbyshire)</b>  (Lab): I have two declarations of interest. First, I live under the flight path of East Midlands airport, and a lot closer to it than some of the hon. Members who have contributed. Secondly, I have spoken on this subject at considerable length and although I will not repeat the points I made, one of my speeches on the air freight sector led to the Industry in Parliament Trust allowing me to spend some time with an air freight operator, one of which operates out of East Midlands airport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para55">We should put into context the argument over designation. We have had some useful historical analyses of what has happened and heard that, for whatever reason, East Midlands airport has been given planning consent for its growth, with various operators being given planning consent to carry on their activities, which are dependent on night flights. For reasons that are not entirely clear, no proper conditions were imposed on any of those activities at the time. The Government are being asked to act as goalkeeper in the designation and say, &quot;Well, someone&#039;s missed the ball several times in this exercise. Let&#039;s try to save it and put matters on to a better footing.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para56">It is not surprising that the Government are saying, &quot;Hold on, there is a bill to be attached to this activity, because if designation is to be meaningful&quot;&#151;the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 431WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
speeches to date have not suggested quite what that meaning is&#151;&quot;presumably it will imply constraints on planning consents that were previously thought to be exercisable without those constraints.&quot; If I were one of the companies involved, I would want to pursue that point with some vigour and associate costs to it. That is why I have always said that although designation would be nice, it is unrealistic and I cannot see the Government buying the argument.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para57">The alternative is to focus on the mechanism that has been touched on in the White Paper, which said that we should have stringent controls on the operations of the airport. How are we to arrive at that? The Government have so far suggested that the airport, like others, should produce a master plan for its growth. I would firmly criticise the Government and, to some extent, take some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), because they have not explained the meaning of a master plan and how it is to deliver the sort of things that are being discussed when we refer to the words &quot;stringent controls&quot;. What do they mean? How will they apply in law and how will they be used by those who may enforce those controls?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para58">So far, that has not been set out. I have read the template for the master plan and although it is a useful, interesting document, it does not tell us about its substance and meaning in planning or enforcement terms. The Minister could help us all by setting out more clearly what a master plan means and what it will do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para59">I should like the master plan to contain a mechanism for moving towards chapter 4 compliance for all aircraft operating at night. DHL, one of the major operators at the airport, has recently modernised its fleet, which has made some impact on the complaints my constituents send to me. However, it is still the case that people are disturbed by night flights; I received a complaint about that yesterday from a person in the village where I live, and the aircraft was a DHL aircraft. There is a long way to go on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para60">It is possible to narrow the flight paths. Modern aircraft can fly tighter tracks than those indicated by the airport, and we should try to make sure that they do so, because that might take them away from some of the population centres that are currently being disturbed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para61">We need a review mechanism of the voluntary code that is currently in place; that point has been taken up by others and was given ministerial endorsement, but what has not been addressed is how we say that that set of controls is now inadequate. We should have a mechanism that addresses the fact that, at a certain point, the growth should trigger a review of that set of controls and an acceptance that they are not adequate for the current purpose. I have attempted to get a response on that from previous Ministers, and I put it to this Minister now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para62">My next point is about a noise growth matrix, or a noise quota, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) said. We need some mechanism that deals with the question of those who ask, &quot;Look, if you&#039;re going to increase freight traffic through the night, how will that then link to the noise that that generates? You should get a score for that so that there is an amount that you are allowed to have.&quot;

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 432WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para63">We also need a surface transport plan for that airport. If it grows at the rate that is being discussed, its current means of delivery both in and out&#151;remembering that it is a freight airport&#151;is wholly inadequate and needs rethinking.
</p>



<a name="50209h01_time4"><h5>10.22 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Alan Duncan  (Rutland and Melton)</b>  (Con): First, I thank my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) for securing this debate. We are all grateful to him for that, and those of us who work closely with him know that he has worked the hardest of all of us on this issue. The voters of Harborough will appreciate his efforts, as do local organisations such as East Leicestershire Villages Against Airspace, or ELVAA. Although Mr. Charlish, the main organiser of ELVAA, is based in my constituency, I know that he has worked very closely with my hon. and learned Friend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para64">The basic fact is that none of us is against the airport as such. We are not against the business benefits. However, we are against its uncontrolled and unrestrained expansion, given that it has no proper planning process at present. There seems to be no planning control beyond the buildings that go on the ground, and what we need is an understanding of what is happening in the air. In the absence of that, it appears that the only credible solution to this problem is designation; it is essentially the old chant of, &quot;What do we want? Designation. When do we want it? Now.&quot; We do want it now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para65">Most of the relevant arguments have been covered, so I will focus on two allied and tangential points. The first of them is about the information that we are currently able to get on the state and pattern of existing flights, and the second is about policing. I look to the Minister for a constructive and helpful response today, because we were promised one before.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para66">At present, if one or our constituents is woken up at 4 o&#039;clock in the morning, they want to know where the plane was going. Was it going to or from NEMA, or was it unrelated to any flight patterns associated with NEMA? A former Transport Minister assured us that the facts would be given to us if ever we were to seek them. That has not happened. Let me explain what currently happens. If a constituent is disturbed, he will contact NEMA, whose normal response is, &quot;Not me, guv.&quot; Then there will be an attempt to get some definite information about radar or flight patterns or flight schedules, and if NEMA says that the plane was not its, usually any inquiry will hit a brick wall. If we go to the Civil Aviation Authority, it will say it is not really its responsibility, and we are then referred to the National Air Traffic Services, which I think is based in a business park in Fareham or somewhere. It tells us that it only keeps radar records for a month, which is not very helpful when it takes five weeks to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para67">Therefore, we as Members of Parliament face enormous difficulty in establishing the basic facts about what is actually happening now. If a constituent is disturbed, is NEMA to blame or not? Where are the flights coming from and going to? My plea to the Minister is, if I dare use the word again, to designate a specific civil servant who can be a focal point for genuine and proper inquiries, who knows the system and who can give us genuine and proper factual answers. At the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 433WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
moment, in trying to find out the basic facts, we are getting the runaround. We do not like it, it is getting very annoying, and it needs a simple administrative solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para68">Secondly, because NEMA is a growing airport, the police bill is growing with it. As my hon. and learned Friend explained, although the name suggests that it is a Nottingham airport, it is in fact a Leicestershire airport that also serves Derbyshire. It is something of a hydra-headed hybrid airport, serving the entire east midlands. Someone who sits on the Leicestershire police authority wrote to me saying that even after Home Office funding to cover anti-terrorist work, it still faces a bill of between &#163;500,000 and &#163;750,000 a year to police the airport. That figure is growing for reasons that we all understand. He also said that although his police authority has tried to get Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire police authorities to share the cost, they have not shown much interest. That is hardly surprising, but it places a disproportionate, unreasonable and growing bill on a hard-pressed police authority in Leicestershire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para69">So I have two specific points. The first is about finding out what is going on. There is a suspicion that aircraft personnel have a measure of discretion in the route that they take, and may choose to put their flight path over rural areas. At the moment, everyone thinks that NEMA is to blame, but let us have the facts. Secondly, designation would mean that the entire police bill would be covered on a national basis, as it should be for such an enormous airport as NEMA, rather than by one poor county where the airport happens to be based.
</p>

<a name="50209h01_time5"><h5>10.27 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Bob Laxton  (Derby, North)</b>  (Lab): First, I do not have any comments to make about a particular local interest or complaint. The only interest I have is that I live probably as close as my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) to the airport. It is approximately five miles away from where I live in the south of the city, and I have been disturbed on occasions by night flights at the airport. However, I am not under any political pressure from my constituents. I receive a small number of complaints from constituents living in the north-east of the city, and I am well aware that my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett) receives a considerable number of complaints from her constituents living in south-west Derby.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para70">However, although I do not have any specific complaints, I do not support the case that has been made for designation of the airport, and let me explain why. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) used the phrase, &quot;That is not to say that NEMA does not bring economic benefits to the area.&quot; That is a gross understatement. There are huge economic benefits, not only for Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, but for the east midlands as well as the regional and national economy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para71">If right hon. and hon. Members have not already done so, they may find it an illuminating experience to visit Royal Mail&#039;s night-time operation out of NEMA. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 434WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
They may find it even more illuminating to visit DHL&#039;s huge complex at the airport, where they will get a good idea of the amount of small, high-value parcel traffic passing through that operation. Everything from parts coming in from around the world for cars that have broken down, to body parts&#151;attached or unattached&#151;and body fluids have passed through its operation. It is fascinating to see; anyone who visited DHL would be astounded by the level of activity. That activity is a job-creator and a regional economic regenerator, and will continue to grow as the airport grows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para72">As I said, I have some personal sympathy with the calls for the airport to be a better neighbour than it has been hitherto. There are clear signs that it wants to be a better neighbour. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that his local authority was not consulted. That is true, but the airport realised that and chose not to introduce the new flight path arrangements, although it could have. Instead, it recognised its omission and sought wider and further consultation. I welcome that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para73">My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire spoke about DHL&#039;s relatively modern, new generation aircraft, which should be welcomed. There are, sometimes, particularly noisy flights out of the airport in the early hours. It is claimed that they may be generated by Rolls-Royce in Derby using noisy Antonov aircraft to haul huge engines out of East Midlands airport. I do not know how accurate that is, but there are, occasionally, exceptionally heavy and noisy aircraft leaving and arriving at the airport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para74">I say to right hon. and hon. Members, especially those who have not yet had the impact of aircraft noise fall too heavily across their constituencies, that those who use the sort of language used by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)&#151;phrases such as, &quot;We want it now&quot;&#151;are, perhaps, squealing before they have been stuck. It will be interesting to see whether the new flight path arrangements are introduced after the consultation process. Frankly, I hope that they are, and that noise levels will be minimised because of the continuing arrival patterns. That should make a sizeable difference to the impact of noise on constituencies around the east midlands. I welcome the CAA&#039;s decision to redesignate flight paths over less-populated areas for safety, noise impact and environmental reasons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para75">To sum up, people should not complain too loudly or too long. Let us see what the new flight path arrangements are like; how they operate and whether they are much better, as I believe that they will be. Let us continue the dialogue with the airport, which has, at long last, decided that it wants to be a far better neighbour than it has been.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 435WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para76">One reason why I intervened on the hon. and learned Member for Harborough on the issue of designation is that we all seem to know what people are opposed to, but have little idea of what is an acceptable level of activity. I do not know what level of night flights coming out of East Midlands airport is acceptable and I represent constituents who oppose night flights, but accept that there is a case for them and for the air freight industry at the airport. Today, I hope to tease out what level of activity&#151;if we were talking about designation&#151;would be acceptable for all our constituents in Leicestershire who are affected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para77">I share some of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire, including the concern about how we make progress. One of my fears about designation is that it is held up as a panacea for all our ills; as if we achieve all that we want if we achieve designation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para78">In the meantime, I have constantly proposed a three-point plan. Indeed, I mentioned it again in the House in response to the White Paper. The 10-year strategy&#151;the master plan&#151;is absolutely vital, because unless we really know what the growth of the airport could be, the impact on the Loughborough constituency, on south Derbyshire, on north-west Leicestershire and on other parts of Leicestershire will be phenomenal. The figures in the White Paper are quite frightening; the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned 60,000 night flights a year. The number of passengers has already grown from 2 million to 4.5 million in only three years. The impact will be enormous if that growth continues at its current rate, so the 10-year master plan is exactly what local people are willing to accept. It is vital for the Government to take account of our view of the potential growth of the airport in their 10-year plan and so ensure the democratic accountability that was rightly talked about. We are part of the process, and a new extension, growth in passenger numbers and the introduction of low-cost flight companies at the airport should not come about by stealth.

<a name="50209h01_para80">Again and again, I, and others, have consistently asked in the House and in other places exactly what those stringent noise controls are, because without them the master plan is a meaningless exercise and we are simply keeping the current arrangements and adding a few extra bits. We need to reassure our constituents, and those of us who live under the flight paths need to be reassured that we know exactly what we are talking about. It is a nice phrase, but we need to know the details, which I hope the Minister will give us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para81">We quite rightly talked about the inadequacy of expecting of North West Leicestershire council to be the monitoring body and the independent consultation body, and about the need to replace it. We need a proper local body with teeth that can monitor the activities of NEMA and work on behalf of the Government and Members who represent the county and elsewhere in the region. Exactly how will that body be constituted, and does the Minister have any plans to strengthen the existing consultation? If all that fails, designation 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 436WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
remains the final hurdle to surmount. Again, however, what do we mean by designation? I hoped that we would hear more today about what people expected.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para82">With regard to those of us who already suffer night flights, when did we find them acceptable and when did they tip over into becoming unacceptable? We need an open and honest debate. The current number of night flights might already be too much for those who are most directly affected. Environmental measures such as the new chapter 4 aircraft might mitigate some, but not all, of the impact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para83">I ask that my three-point plan be considered and that we have an honest and open debate about what we want, because East Midlands airport does provide an enormous number of jobs and great economic benefit to each of us in many different ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para84">My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire mentioned the surface transport plan. My constituency suffers particularly from east-west traffic going through the villages of Wymeswold and Burton and all the way down the A6, the A46 and across, or traffic getting on to the M1 and going down south. It is sometimes too much. A lot of freight tries to cut across country and go through the smaller villages in the Wolds. I asked the county council to carry out an impact assessment of that traffic, and it agreed to do so as part of the local transport plan. We need to ensure that we keep on top of that, because it is a big issue for constituents who benefit from the airport but also suffer the environmental impact on the ground as well as in the air.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para85">I hope that the Minister will adopt a realistic and robust approach to the East Midlands airport. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire and I have found its representatives to be most helpful in our discussions with them over the years, but we still hit the barrier mentioned at the start of the debate; accountability is still an issue. We hope that there will be the opportunity to strengthen the existing proposal as part of the White Paper and to make sufficient progress to ensure that the environmental impacts of that necessary airport are minimised.

<p><a name="50209h01_spnew24"><b> John Thurso  (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) on securing the debate. It is clear from listening to hon. Members&#039; contributions that there is considerable concern about the matter, which is also an important local issue, on both sides of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para86">In his opening remarks, the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the name of the airport, which I have visited only once, about 15 years ago. I was given a lift by a friend in a small private aeroplane after a wedding, at which I was a guest. At that time, I was general manager of the Cliveden hotel, which I set up, and I was able to get back to the hotel in time to welcome the bride and groom, who had driven down the M1.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para87">I did some research for the debate and found an article from the Derby <i>Evening Telegraph</i> of 20 January, which stated that it had asked 20 airports if they flew to Nottingham, and only three immediately replied yes. The other 17, when asked if they flew to East Midlands were able to say that, yes, they flew there. There is clearly some confusion about the name.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 437WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para88">Hon. Members have put a very powerful local case extremely well, and I will leave it to the Minister to answer. I want to make some general points. The first, implicit in the debate, is the tension between those who benefit from the facility&#151;this applies not only to airports but to many other infrastructure and economic endeavours&#151;but are unaffected by the disbenefits, and those who suffer from the disbenefits because they are the hosts, and live near by. It is a critical point and it applies to aviation at any airport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para89">The industry would argue that everyone has a right to fly and that people have an almost unfettered freedom to fly wherever they want, whenever they want, but that that is not the case. There are two kinds of freedom; the freedom to do things and the freedom to be protected from the adverse effects of whatever other people have the freedom to do. There should be a balance between the rights of those who want to do things, and the rights of those who need to be protected from them. It has to be done with constraint and consideration; the good neighbourliness to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred. In devising a wider aviation policy, it is important to face up to that fact and accept that we must consider both sides of the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para90">My second point is about aviation policy in general. In the past decade, there has been a phenomenal growth in passengers, largely due to the expansion of low-cost airlines, but also for other reasons. What is not often referred to is the equally impressive growth in air freight. It now accounts for 30 per cent. by value of freight imports into this country, although by weight the figure is much smaller; less than 10 per cent. The problem is that we do not consider the true cost of aviation, especially in environmental terms. Aviation needs to address that problem so that it has a fair playing field compared with other modes of travel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para91">I would like aviation internationally to be brought within the limits of the Kyoto convention. In this country, air passenger duty singles out passengers, but there is no similar levy on freight planes. I would like a move from air passenger duty to an aeroplane tax that would also cover freight planes, and to externalise some of the costs of aviation so that there is a proper balance between its benefits and disbenefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para92">A powerful case has been made for designation, although I am not entirely certain that it is the right remedy. Perhaps it might be better to do it through the master plan. However, I leave it to the Minister to answer that case.
</p>



<a name="50209h01_time8"><h5>10.45 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Greg Knight  (East Yorkshire)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) not only on securing this important debate but on waging a tireless campaign on this issue on behalf of his constituents. He knows that I am well aware of the strong level of feeling not only among his constituents, but among those of other hon.&nbsp;and right hon. Members in the vicinity of the airport, and even wider across Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and parts of Derbyshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para93">As the Chamber is aware, the Government produced a White Paper setting out their policies last year. Sadly, that aviation White Paper led to court challenges and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 438WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
has left uncertainty hanging over many people&#039;s lives. In my view, the Government&#039;s policy has failed to live up to its own billing. There are two problems with the White Paper. First, it fudges some key issues and therefore causes blight around airports as legal battles are fought. Secondly, there is little sign of the joined-up thinking that we have always been promised, either between the Department for Transport&#039;s aviation policy and the rest of its responsibilities, or between it and other Government Departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para94">There have been a few references today to the name of East Midlands airport. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) referred to a report in the Derby<i> Evening Telegraph </i>in January this year. I have to say to him that this debate has been going on for about 30 years. I remember that when I was a Leicester city councillor, the airport was spending tens of thousands of pounds on consultants&#039; fees to decide on what to change its name to. I wish that it had spent as much time on consulting residents about how it goes about its activities as it has on consulting about changing its name for three decades. As all hon. Members here know, the airport is expanding very quickly; the White Paper itself forecast&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew26"><b> David Taylor </b> : Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Knight </b> : I have only a couple of minutes left, and the hon. Gentleman had a fair crack of the whip earlier. It is not as if he has not been called to speak.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para95">The White Paper forecast that the airport could attract between 12 million and 14 million passengers a year by 2030. However, in addition to that, the airport is one of the country&#039;s major hubs for freight, and is the leading UK airport for freight carried by all-cargo aircraft. The White Paper also forecast that the airport could be handling as much as 2.5 million tonnes of freight a year, possibly more than that by 2030.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para96">The White Paper reveals that Ministers do not seem to appreciate the scale of the problem in the region. It states that Nottingham East Midlands airport is situated away from the main centres of population and, as such,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a relatively small number of people live within the 57 dBA noise contour.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para97">However, the projected growth of the airport would increase the size of the contour to include more than 10,000 residents; more importantly, many thousands more live on the cusp of that noise contour. The nature of air cargo operations means that many flights take place at night, when, of course, background noise levels are much lower. So this is bad news for residents in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para98">The Government&#039;s own consultation document forecast that there could be more than 60,000 cargo flights a year by 2030, and a substantial proportion of those would be late in the evening or at night. It is clear that this large expansion will continue to have serious consequences on those living under the flight routes. The issue of noise raises two questions; first, compensation, and secondly, what measures can be taken to minimise noise levels. The aviation White Paper states that the Government expect airports
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;to offer households subject to high levels of noise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. assistance with the costs of relocating&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 439WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para99">and acoustic insulation to those who are in an intermediate noise region. Will the Minister say whether those compensation rules will apply to those who live under the flight paths at Nottingham East Midlands airport? We believe that the current scope and level of compensation for noise blight is inadequate to compensate for the serious problems that will be suffered by those who live under the flight paths of aircraft flying at night. What discussions has the Minister had with Nottingham East Midlands airport about improving the level of compensation? If the answer is none, she really should go to the airport and meet the airport operators.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para100">I believe that the people of the east midlands deserve clarity and openness and, where their peace and quiet is going to be shattered, adequate compensation. Does the Minister not accept that our present laws do not give local authorities the power to deal with the sort of problems that we have heard about today, and therefore that there is only one conclusion; we need to see some action from the Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew28"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I should like to register my appreciation at the splendid manner in which all present responded to the application of the new ruling; they did so with alacrity and good humour. I call the Minister to respond.
</p>



<a name="50209h01_time9"><h5>10.50 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Charlotte Atkins) </b> : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) for choosing to debate this important subject. He has raised many concerns, concerns that I have also seen expressed in letters from the hon. and learned Gentleman and other hon. Members here today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para101">Passenger traffic at Nottingham East Midlands airport has increased dramatically since its adoption as a base by a number of no-frills carriers; annual growth averaged almost 15 per cent. in the five years to 2003. There are signs that that growth is now slowing; in 2004, the airport handled some 4.3 million passengers, which was up 2.9 per cent. on the previous year. Scheduled services now operate to 25 destinations, on a balanced mix of leisure and business routes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para102">That expansion is in line with the Government&#039;s policy of encouraging growth at regional airports. It has a number of benefits, which include supporting the growth of the local and regional economy; relieving congestion at more over-crowded airports, especially those in the south-east; reducing the need for long surface journeys to airports; and giving passengers greater choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para103">NEMA&#039;s strategic importance, however, arises from its freight operations. It handled some 227,000 tonnes of air freight in 2003, second only to Heathrow. Almost all of that was carried by dedicated freighter aircraft, making it the most important United Kingdom airport for that type of traffic. In the same year, it also handled more than 10,000 tonnes of mail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para104">NEMA is well suited to such a role. Its central location and its proximity to the M1 enables it to serve much of the UK, and it possesses an adequate runway length and sufficient space for the development of cargo 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 440WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
handling facilities. That has served to attract the express freight carriers, and NEMA has become the most important regional hub for DHL and UPS. The vast international networks operated by such carriers offer enormous benefits in connectivity for businesses in the east midlands and beyond, and they offer rapid access to global markets.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew29"><b> Mr. Garnier </b> : We are delighted hear a sort of &quot;Down Your Way&quot; tour of the airport&#039;s charms, but we want the Minister to deal with the issues that were raised in the debate. I wonder whether she will stop reading out publicity material for the airport and get on and deal with the issues that concern us.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew30"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : I would have expected those hon. Members who represent the Conservative party to have recognised the benefits of a regional airport of NEMA&#039;s significance. It is interesting that they are very much against red tape and the Government taking commercial decisions; but when it comes to NEMA, it seems that they want the Government to take responsibility for the whole business.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para105">The midlands consultation document on the future development of air transport, which preceded the White Paper, looked at the option of a second, wide-spaced runway at NEMA. The White Paper did not support that option; on the evidence available, we concluded that the economic case for a second runway had not been made. We shall, however, review the case for a second runway should the growth of NEMA prove to be more rapid than our forecasts suggest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para106">Although hon. Members have denied it, the airport is situated away from the main centres of population, and a relatively small number of people live within the 57dBA noise contour, which is the commonly accepted standard for the onset of &quot;significant community annoyance&quot;. The populations around Gatwick or Stansted, for example, are much larger. Some 2,500 people in the existing development of NEMA live within the 57dBA contour. That is expected to grow to 11,700 in 2030. The comparable figures for Luton are 8,000 in the present development and 19,000 by 2030. NEMA is not on a par with the three designated airports in the south-east.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para107">While the White Paper supports the expansion of both passenger and freight operations at NEMA, it is not a licence for the uncontrolled expansion of operations. It states that the expansion on night operations must be accompanied by stringent controls on night noise and increasingly generous noise insulation and other mitigation measures. I have no definition of stringency or stringent controls. We will obviously look to the airport operator to provide an indication of its transport and traffic forecasts and proposals and also its mitigation measures. That is the context in which the airport operates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para108">Many Members have asked about designation. Like my predecessors, I have written many letters on this issue. Although I appreciate the strong feelings expressed by hon. Members and their constituents, the situation has not changed. As the Minister of State, Department for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) made clear, both at the forum that many hon. Members attended and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 441WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
subsequently, the Government&#039;s position is that local and regional airports should find solutions for what are local and regional problems.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew31"><b> Mr. Duncan </b> : It is quite clear that the Labour party&#039;s policy is to oppose the designation of this airport. May I ask the Minister in the time remaining to address my specific point about monitoring existing flights with a clear focus of attention so that we can get the actual facts, without being given the runaround?
</p>




<p><a name="50209h01_spnew32"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : I am happy to take up the issue that the hon. Gentleman raised. If he is having problems finding out what flight has overflown a constituent, I am happy to look at that. NEMA flights have a noise and track-keeping system. It should be possible to say whether it is a NEMA flight. The hon. Gentleman spoke of his problems with the CAA coming back to him within the period when it was possible to say whether a flight was from a particular direction. He mentioned the problem of having only a month&#039;s radar checks. I am happy to take that back and have a look at it, but clearly NEMA should be able to tell the hon. Gentleman whether it was one of its flights. Whether he believes it or not is another matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h01_para109">There are well-established procedures for bringing forward airspace change proposals and they are subject to directions and guidance to the CAA from the Secretary of State. These are designed to ensure that proposals are brought to the attention of affected parties; that they are properly assessed and that environmental impacts are mitigated as much as possible; and that changes are only made where it is clear, after consultation, that an overall environmental benefit will accrue. That is the existing procedure that has to be used. There is no reason why NEMA should not also go down that path.

<a name="50209h02_head0"><h3 align=center>Ambulance Trust Mergers</h3>

<a name="50209h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>


<p><a name="50209h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  (Cotswold)</b>  (Con): I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to discuss the merger of the Gloucestershire ambulance trust with Wiltshire and Avon ambulance trusts. It is causing great anxiety in Gloucestershire and I am grateful to the Minister for being here to reply to the debate, as I am for the support of my near neighbour and good colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para0">I shall set the scene. Gloucestershire ambulance trust has a two-star rating and some of its innovative measures are among the best in the country. Yet, it has been proposed to merge the trust with two failing adjoining ambulance trusts: those of Avon and of Wiltshire. If people doubt that fact, they have only to look at the response time figures provided by the NHS. In the most recent year for which figures are available, Gloucestershire is consistently in the 94 to 95 per cent. range in response to category A and category B calls, whereas Wiltshire has only a 84.9 per cent. response time and the figure for Avon is a disastrous 66.4 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para1">So why ruin one of the most innovative ambulance trusts in the country and merge it with two failing trusts? The inevitable result of such action will be a fall in service for the people of Gloucestershire. They pay their taxes and they are entitled, at one of the most vulnerable points in their life, to service. If someone is lying beside the road, dying from a motor accident, or is in his home with liver failure or a suspected heart attack, the one thing that that person wants is a quick ambulance response. The merger will inevitably slow down that response and many people think that it is a prelude to replacing ambulances with cars driven by one paramedic. One paramedic in a car responding to an emergency cannot perform the same service as an entire ambulance team.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para2">It is abundantly clear to me that the proposal is massively unpopular with the people of Gloucestershire. As I have said, the service currently enjoys a two-star rating and those working for it see no advantage whatever in being combined with the Avon and Wiltshire services, which have been classified as &quot;failing&quot; by the Government. Under the misdirection of the Government, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority is seemingly willing to denigrate the Gloucestershire ambulance service and place the Wiltshire ambulance service under Bristol control, all for the measly aim of saving money. The SHA has had a miserable record. Its deficit of &#163;100 million is one of the biggest in the country. It has had no fewer than three chief executives in the short time that it has been in existence, yet the Government, having formed that SHA, now want to do the same with our ambulance trusts. Even the chief executive of the SHA told a newspaper that the proposed ambulance merger is about &quot;reducing overheads&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para3">We must not be taken in by such silken tones. The damage to the ambulance services in the south-west will be not only qualitative but financial. The record of the Government in wasting public resources by reorganisation is well proven. I say to the Minister in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 443WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
good faith that each reorganisation costs a great deal of money and usually results in a worse service for us&#151;the public, the taxpayers who pay for that service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para4">While desperately trying to cut monetary corners, the SHA will in fact be sacrificing millions of pounds&#039; worth of investment. The huge financial commitment to the Devizes call centre and to the brand new Quedgeley call centre, which was delivered at a cost to Gloucestershire council tax payers of some &#163;6.5 million and which is about to be stripped of its fire service role because the Government want to regionalise fire services, is to be wantonly abandoned and those call centres are to be left as empty testimonies to the Government&#039;s disregard for the public purse. I understand that there is a 30-year break clause in the agreement at Quedgeley, so perhaps the Minister can tell us how much it will cost the ambulance service to break that agreement.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson  (Tewkesbury)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising this important matter. He will be aware&#151;perhaps he will come to this&#151;that we face a similar problem with regard to the fire and rescue service. I am sure that he will tell us how new the building at Quedgeley is, because what we are discussing represents an enormous waste of money.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown </b> : My hon. Friend raises a good point. We have been to the tri-service centre and seen it working. We have seen the superb telephone operation that the people of Gloucestershire now have. The close co-operation between the three services&#151;police, fire and ambulance&#151;is benefiting the people of Gloucestershire. The Government&#039;s initiative was a good one, but they are about to tear it up, even though it has been going for only 18 months. That is ridiculous. What a waste of &#163;6.5 million of public money to tear it all up, take the fire service away and regionalise it, and now propose to take the ambulance service away. My hon. Friend is exactly right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para5">The painfully apparent lack of any firm business case from the SHA for the merger has rightly led the Gloucestershire county council health overview and scrutiny committee to call for an impact assessment to be carried out urgently, before the plan is rushed through with little regard for the consequences. At the very least, the Minister should satisfy himself with a robust business case that the plan makes sense. He owes it to the people of Gloucestershire to demonstrate that they will receive a better service as a result of the merger. If they will not, why take away a service that works?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para6">The SHA was content to turn to Adrian Lucas, of the Scottish ambulance service, who is no doubt a very able man, but who surely has little experience of the particular local circumstances and conditions that the Gloucestershire ambulance service faces. His answer was that emergency calls from Gloucestershire should be answered from Bath or Chippenham, but how can an emergency call being answered from Bath or Chippenham help my constituents or even those of my hon. Friend in the most rural areas of the north Cotswolds? I do not think that the Minister has any idea, and I invite him to come and look for himself. Some of my constituents live 30 miles from the nearest district general hospital. If they do not have a proper ambulance service when they need it, they will die. There is no question about that. We must be sure that the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 444WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
merger will work; otherwise, we are putting people&#039;s lives at risk. I say that to the Minister in the starkest possible terms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para7">Regardless of how technically advanced the variety of global positioning systems may be in modern ambulances, modern technology cannot replace the knowledge of local drivers. They know the conditions and the traffic variations. That is particularly important in the Cotswolds in summer, when the roads in a place such as Bourton-on-the-Water are chock-a-block. A local ambulance driver will know how to get round the jams, but someone from Bristol, Avon or wherever else will not have that local knowledge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para8">One can envisage what might occur. I shall give the Minister an example. During the last Christmas break, a single telephone fault crippled the local GP out-of-hours service and, in an instant, threw an extra burden on to the ambulance service. The very thought of a similar fault occurring in a joint services call centre that might be responsible for some 2.2 million people and of all its possible consequences is awful.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para9">Moreover, it seems that the reduction in call centre capabilities is being quietly mirrored by a reduction in the resources awarded to our hard-working ambulance crews, even to the degree that the SHA is taking away ambulances and replacing them with cars. The threat to replace ambulances in rural areas with meagre car response units&#151;essentially, a paramedic and a first-aid kit, rather than the panoply of medical services and expertise that arrives when a fully equipped ambulance pulls up&#151;is testimony to how little attention is being paid to the essential needs of patients in Gloucestershire. It is self-evident that one paramedic cannot provide as good a service as a trained team of ambulance men.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para10">I turn to some of the innovative measures that the Gloucestershire ambulance trust is pioneering. It is one of the country&#039;s leaders in some of the new treatments. For example, in pre-hospital thrombolysis treatment, modern IT enables the electronic kit to be attached to somebody&#039;s body and the information to be transmitted to a specialist sitting in a hospital, who can then see exactly what phase the heart is in and administer the drug at precisely the right time. That saves lives. Not only does it save lives, but it is an example of how people might be kept out of hospital, thereby saving the NHS even more money. An efficient ambulance can treat people on the spot. They do not necessarily have to go to hospital; it might be more suitable for them to go into a nursing home, or even to stay in their own home with proper treatment from an occupational nurse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para11">Running down the ambulance service makes no sense. Apart from the pre-hospital thrombolysis initiative, the Gloucestershire ambulance service is one of the most innovative in the country in forming partnerships with other first-responder groups, such as the fire brigade. Indeed, the protocol with the St. John Ambulance brigade was so good that that brigade is now using it nationally. The Gloucestershire ambulance service has been awarded 120 auto-external defibrilators. That was the second largest award by the British Heart Foundation, and it went to one of the smallest ambulance trusts. The Gloucestershire ambulance trust is one of the most innovative trusts, and it provides one of the best services in the country, and yet the Government want to merge it with two failing ambulance trusts. What on earth sense can that make?

<p>
<a name="50209h02_para12">As my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury knows, those who work for the ambulance service in Gloucestershire are very proud of it; they are proud to see it performing so well. If the merger goes ahead, and they see the quality of the service that they are able to offer falling, they will leave and go to the private sector, and that will have a knock-on effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para13">The ambulance service can be the bridge between people and the NHS, and it can help keep people out of hospital. However, even these peerless ambulance staff cannot be expected to provide a faultless service if they are not given the tools that they need to do the job. The tragic accident involving Mr. and Mrs. Jones and Ms Moran late last month that resulted in one fatality shows the price that will inevitably be paid when ambulances are not properly supplied in a timely fashion, but one must also look at the success stories, such as that of Mrs. Stevenson and her son Zak. They were given the highest level of care and attention by the ambulance crew and connected staff when little Zak began to experience breathing problems and had to be rushed to hospital in the most dire winter conditions, which made some roads impassable. It was primarily due to the Gloucestershire ambulance crew&#039;s local knowledge of alternative routes that Zak reached hospital in good time and was successfully treated and allowed to make a full recovery. Such local knowledge would simply not be available under the proposed merger; ambulances could be manned by paramedics from many miles away who have little first-hand knowledge of their immediate environment of a maze of twisting country lanes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para14">The Conservative party has stood up for the interests of local people against a burgeoning and blind, centrally led bureaucracy. Local Conservatives, under Councillor Barry Dare, called for a motion urging the strategic health authority to carry out a proper consultation before adopting the merger plans. The need for such a consultation and the blatant risks of not listening to the concerns of local people and ambulance crews were so apparent that Councillor Dare&#039;s motion received cross-party support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para15">Unabashed by their total humiliation in the north-east referendum that threatened to abolish the county of Northumberland, this Government, aided by the Liberals, are determined to pursue their unpopular European-style regional agenda and abolish our county services by stealth. As my hon. Friend emphasised, we have seen that they want to regionalise our fire service. Now the ambulance service is to be merged with failing neighbouring ambulance trusts. Similar plans for our police cannot be far behind.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para16">I have something to say to the Minister: my constituents, my hon. Friend&#039;s constituents and the people of Gloucestershire pay their taxes to this Government in ever increasing amounts. They get a very good service at present. If it deteriorates, I will hold the Government to account.

the debate and on his interest in his ambulance service. Equally, I congratulate the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), who are present today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para17">I must say to the hon. Member for Cotswold that that was the first time that I have heard a Eurosceptic argument imposed on a discussion on ambulance services. I counsel him, in the interests of his constituents, not to over-egg his argument by suggesting that decisions have been made and that firm proposals are on the table when that is absolutely not the case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para18">The hon. Gentleman talked about his Conservative colleague on the county council putting down a motion calling for a thorough consultation. The only thing that is currently on the table is a proposal to consult on the matter. It is ridiculous to suggest that that has come about because a Conservative county councillor has decided to make party politics out of the issue. The SHA&#039;s proposal is to consult&#151;nothing else, at this stage. I will ensure that his comments are seen as part of that consultation.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown </b>  <i>rose&#151;</i>
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : Let me make some points first. The hon. Gentleman had 15 minutes and turned what could have been a constructive debate about the future of his ambulance service into a party political diatribe. So, I think that I am entitled to make some progress before I give way to him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para19">The staff of the national health service in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s county and elsewhere are working extremely hard to provide better services for everybody; that includes those who must make difficult management decisions about the structures of such services. They want to engage in constructive dialogue with local populations about how best to achieve that. It does not help anybody if attempts to have such a dialogue are undermined by people saying that decisions have already been made, when, palpably, they have not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para20">Before I discuss the local ambulance service, I should say something about the national ambulance service, because the hon. Gentleman accused us of certain strategies which do not exist and have not been implemented. We recognise that the ambulance service provides the first point of access to health care for a wide variety of patients. It is the most important contact for more than 5 million 999 callers every year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para21">Far from running down the ambulance service nationally, the Government are committed to it. On top of its base funding, we have put in &#163;50 million since 1999&#151;providing &#163;21 million for additional front-line ambulance staff. Money has been provided for purchasing vehicles; &#163;3.4 million has gone to enabling services to equip front-line ambulance vehicles with state-of-the-art satellite navigation; and &#163;10 million has been provided to purchase ambulance equipment for heart patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para22">This Government are not trying to run down the ambulance service; we are committed to it. That is why we set a standard that at least 75 per cent. of 999 calls from patients with immediate life-threatening conditions should have an ambulance respond within eight minutes. In 2001, less than 71 per cent. of those calls were responded to within eight minutes, but during 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 447WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the past year performance against that standard has exceeded 75 per cent. Now, 98 per cent. of patients are overwhelmingly satisfied with the care that they receive from their ambulance service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para23">That sort of commitment and those sorts of targets apply equally to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents as to mine. Just because somebody lives in a rural area does not mean that the Government&#039;s target of reaching them within a particular time is any less of a commitment than elsewhere. Indeed, it is necessary to recognise the issues of rurality and deal with them appropriately, to ensure that we meet the targets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para24">A demonstrable improvement in patient care is being achieved. In many areas of the country, including the hon. Gentleman&#039;s, innovative work and attempts to modernise are taking place. For example, there are now 400 emergency care practitioners treating patients at the scene, which avoids people having to go to accident and emergency unnecessarily. I am sure that in his calmer moments the hon. Gentleman would like to congratulate all those people on their contributions rather than launching into an attack on their motivation, which is what came across to me from his comments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para25">Although progress has been made, we can do even better. That is why we appointed Peter Bradley to lead a strategic review of ambulance service delivery. It will consider how to make longer-term improvements in areas such as ambulance service staff education and training, clinical indicators and outcome measures. It is also expected to resolve issues such as how best to clarify clock start/stop times to ensure the transparent and consistent measurement of response times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para26">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of local services. As he said, Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority has three ambulance services: the Avon&nbsp;Ambulance Service NHS Trust, the Gloucestershire Ambulance Service NHS Trust and the Wiltshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust. Gloucestershire and Wiltshire are two of the smallest ambulance trusts in England. The management of such local ambulance services is a matter for the local health economy&#151;not for me or other Ministers sitting in Whitehall. For exactly the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave, I have no knowledge or experience whatever of conditions in the Cotswolds. I cannot possibly know what conditions are like in his constituency; I have enough to do making sure that I understand conditions in my own constituency. That is why it is important to allow decisions to be made by local people who know about the traffic in the summer in Cotswolds villages and about the conditions on local roads, and who understand the issues of rurality. It is not for me, the Government or the Secretary of the State to impose any model on the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local ambulance service; it is for the people charged with responsibility for those services in his area to make the decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para27">It is right and appropriate for strategic health authorities and commissioners to examine the provision of ambulance services in their area and to consider whether the current arrangements could be improved to benefit patients and staff, reduce duplication and improve efficiency. That is what is happening now. In April 2004, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority embarked on a project to consider how emergency services in Wiltshire could be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 448WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
better shaped to meet the demands of the future. Many factors will have prompted the authority to initiate that project, including rising demand for ambulance services and the fact that ambulance performance was identified in the Department&#039;s annual review with the authority as an issue that needed to be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para28">Although the project initially focused primarily on Wiltshire, it also provided an opportunity to address the future role of services in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire as a whole. Two clear stages governed the development of the work. First, there was the need to develop and agree a service framework that enabled ambulance services to make a more effective contribution to unscheduled care. For example, the project considered how staff in new roles, such as the emergency care practitioners whom I mentioned earlier, could be best utilised. That is particularly important for rural communities such as those in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. ECPs have the skills to treat patients at the scene of an accident, which can help to avoid the need to travel to A and E. Secondly, there was the need to consider the best organisational arrangements in which to implement the service framework.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para29">Once a rationale for the review had been established, three options emerged: the creation of an integrated management team across the three organisations, a merger into a single organisation and the status quo. The current situation is that Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority has decided to commission an independent organisation to undertake a detailed benefits analysis and risk assessment of those options. The recommendations of that analysis should be presented to a steering group of chairs and chief executives from the three trusts and their lead commissioners, together with the SHA. That is exactly the business plan that the hon. Gentleman asked me to ensure would exist before any decisions were made.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown </b> : The Minister&#039;s last comment was very helpful. To ensure that we get something useful out of the debate, will he assure us that the people of Gloucestershire will be given every opportunity to contribute to that study, that they will have plenty of time to do so and that the study will genuinely take their views into account? The Minister has given the impression that the failure of the Wiltshire and Avon ambulance trusts is all that this is about, and that is exactly the fear of the people of Gloucestershire, who get such a good service at the moment.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I have steadfastly tried to avoid saying that that is the primary reason for the review. It is my belief that the SHA sees potential benefits to considering the three organisations together. Each of the three organisations and everyone throughout the area, including the people of Gloucestershire, will benefit, and the perceived problem of underperformance in Wiltshire will also be dealt with. I promise the hon. Gentleman that his constituents will be included in the consultation. It is clear from having talked to the SHA and having studied the matter since realising that the hon. Gentleman had secured this debate that the SHA intends to have a wide-ranging and thorough consultation with everyone before any decisions are taken.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 449WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para30">I stress again that this is an objective exercise. There are no hidden agendas or predetermined outcomes. Nothing in the process should worry the hon. Gentleman, his constituents or any other hon. Member in the Chamber. Indeed, there is much for them to gain. Since 1974, mergers and reorganisations have reduced ambulance services from about 100 to 31 trusts, and there is a general trend towards fewer larger ambulance trusts. For example, Shropshire merged with the West Midlands ambulance service, and three ambulance trusts merged to form Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Trust. There are significant gains to be made for each ambulance service as a result. The potential benefits for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents are there to be seen, and it is foolish to close our eyes to the possibility of those benefits.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew7"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson </b> : The Minister is talking about other ambulance trusts that have merged, but in an answer to my parliamentary question, the Minister of State, Department of Health, his hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) said:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We are not aware of any other SHAs and their constituent organisations formally considering this issue.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>31 January 2005; Vol. 430 c. 741W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para31">I am confused.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h02_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I am referring to ambulance trusts that have already decided formally to review their structures and to merge. I confess that I do not recollect that question offhand&#151;unfortunately, I do not remember every question that I sign&#151;but I shall be happy to answer it if the hon. Gentleman writes to me with his query. Faster response times, reduced bureaucracy and other such issues are all potential gains for all the constituents of all the Members in the Chamber today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para32">NHS bodies have an absolutely clear duty to consult on these matters. The Government and the Secretary of State make that clear. We do not want to be put in the

<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 450WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
position of taking any decisions at the centre about mergers or reconfiguration. We want those matters to be sorted out locally by local people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para33">I know that the hon. Member for Cotswold is not the only Member interested in this issue. His hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury has asked parliamentary questions about it, and my hon. Friends the Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew), for Forest of Dean (Diana Organ) and for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) have already met my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), who leads on ambulances issues for the Government. They have already expressed their concerns, so all Members who represent the area have started to engage in the process. It is very important that all Members do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para34">It is also very important that the hon. Member for Cotswold ensures that the opinion of every one of his constituents is listened to. I fully support him in that, and I am happy to meet him and to discuss the matter in the Chamber as necessary so long as he understands that, at the end of the day, the decision is for local people, not me. I want local people to produce the best strategy for themselves and to decide how best to improve services throughout the area and not only in one part of it. That will ensure that he and all his constituents are satisfied that there will be gains for them and for others in the area from any decision that is eventually taken. The status quo is still an option, as is rationalising the management organisation rather than an outright merger of the three trusts. However, we can ensure that constituents&#039; views are taken into account only if we all engage constructively in the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h02_para35">I conclude by thanking the hon. Gentleman once again for securing the debate, but I ask him not to give the impression that decisions have been taken when clearly they have not. These are matters for local people to engage in.

<a name="50209h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50209h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hilton Dawson  (Lancaster and Wyre)</b>  (Lab): I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate the debate. I know, because of the hon. Members present, that it will be a high-quality debate. It is a shame that so far there are not more Members present to take part in it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para0">I regard it as a gross failure by us all that this debate is needed. It is an indictment of this country that it leads the wealthy, developed, powerful nations in the number of children who are in prison. There are about 2,500 children in young offenders&#039; institutions now, perhaps 200 others in secure training centres and 200 in local authority secure children&#039;s homes. I do not have a problem with local authority secure children&#039;s homes; they work to the standards laid down by the Children Act 1989 and they are inspected by the Commission for Social Care Inspection according to the principles of that Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para1">The huge problem with local authority secure children&#039;s homes is that places in them are being lost at an extraordinary rate. Some 71 places&#151;almost a quarter&#151;in local authority secure care have gone since 2000, when the Youth Justice Board took over responsibility for the commissioning of places in what is termed the secure estate. That is especially lamentable when we consider the most shameful disgrace of all, the most appalling fact about custody for young people and children: in the past eight years&#151;since I have been a Member of Parliament and since this Government have been in power, carrying out superb reforms to the lives of so many children&#151;16 children have died in prison, at a time when 71 places in local authority secure care have been lost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para2">I am not aware that any child has ever died in local authority secure accommodation. I have worked in several of those places and I know that they have contained, looked after and managed young people with horrendous records of offending; young people who have committed the gravest crimes that anyone could commit, and they have kept them safe. Their expertise and skill is being lost; many good people who formerly worked in those institutions lament the passing of those establishments and of the old community homes with education, which also did a good job for young people. I particularly lament, and recognise, that the passing of so much good quality care no doubt has something to do with the extraordinary increase in the number of children in prison. It has doubled in the past 10 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para3">I return to the most appalling fact&#151;the 16 deaths. I am aware that I cannot speak about all those cases today; some are sub judice. However, hon. Members in this Room are well-informed, and people read the newspapers and know a lot about the circumstances. I was with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State only two weeks ago at the scene of the latest tragedy, which I deeply regret was in my constituency. I regard these 16 deaths as unnecessary, avoidable and appalling, and I am sure that we all agree with that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para4">During this debate, I am sure that somebody will reflect on how difficult the issues are, and how complicated the subject is. We can make it difficult and complicated if we wish to, but we can also make it quite simple. It is about basic principles and sheer bloody-
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 452WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
minded political will. Perhaps the attendance today reflects the fact that people are sometimes nervous about the issue of young offending, particularly when approaching a general election. People are clearly and rightly concerned about crime in this country, so there is not much sympathy among the general public for young offenders. However, I have appeared many times on the national media trying to draw attention to what we are to discuss this afternoon, and my e-mail inbox is roughly divided 50:50 between those who think that it is outrageous for a Member to be standing up for young people in prison, and those who are very encouraging that someone is doing so. These are controversial issues, but they are vital matters of life and death, and, frankly, politicians should be prepared to take a lead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para5">We are talking this afternoon about the principles and political will that anyone should display if they aspire to govern this country well. I am not going to fight the next general election, but hon. Members around the Room, from three parties, will do so. They will be out on the stump, and will have to confront the issues that we are discussing. I hope that we can all agree that it is unthinkable and intolerable that a child should ever die in the custody of the state. It should surely be one of the state&#039;s greatest duties, when anyone&#151;let alone a child&#151;is committed to its custody that they are kept safe. There is a remarkable and regrettable lack of public debate, or even public information, when a child dies in custody. I cannot imagine what would happen to social workers if a child died in a children&#039;s home. We know what happens to social workers in cases in the community, where children die at the hands of parents or carers, but it seems that there is little concern about children who have committed offences who die in our prisons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para6">I suppose that such people are not children at all; we insulate ourselves from the fact that they are children. Anyone under 18, of course, is a child, but we insulate ourselves from that fact by referring to them as &quot;juveniles&quot; or &quot;offenders&quot;, and the prisons where they live as the &quot;secure estate&quot;. The Government properly and gloriously tell us that every child matters, but perhaps juvenile offenders do not; in fact, we know that they do not. The Children Act 1989 states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;When a court determines any question with respect to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the upbringing of a child&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para7">for example, where that child will live, for however long&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;the child&#039;s welfare shall be the court&#039;s paramount consideration.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para8">That does not, however, apply to a child older than 10 who expresses his or her abuse, neglect, disturbance, illness, lack of parental guidance, inadequate education, learning difficulties, naivety, immaturity, or poor choice of friends through the commission of a criminal offence. As is regularly stated by the Government and the Youth Justice Board, the principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by young people. Having regard to a child&#039;s welfare is a secondary aim of the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para9">It is good that those in charge of custodial institutions have been brought within the remit of the Children Act 2004. Under section 11, they are bound by a duty to safeguard and promote the well-being of children in their custody, but that duty does not apply to those who sentence children to custody, or to those on the Youth Justice Board who decide where in the secure estate 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 453WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
children should be placed. Such crucial decisions are often taken on the spur of the moment, with a degree of surprise; they often need to be taken quickly, perhaps at the end of a long day in court, having had little opportunity to weigh up the particular needs of a child, who may be hundreds of miles away from home, who is wondering where he or she is going.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para10">As I said, the overarching principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by young people. That is the first note of humour that I have introduced to the debate. However, the offending rates are lamentable. Home Office figures show that in 2001, 70.4 per cent. of children who received a custodial sentence reoffended within 12 months. In 2002, that figure had marginally improved to 68.3 per cent. Those are the most recent figures, but even if the situation carries on improving it would be a fair bet that about two thirds of the 2,500 or so children who are currently in prison will have reoffended by this time next year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para11">Prison does not work. Let no one accuse me, or anyone else who agrees that there should be no children in prison, of being soft on crime. Prison is a generator of crime, and confirms young people, and adults, in a criminal identity. It introduces young people to others who are more criminal and to the means to carry out further criminal offences of which they were not aware. It is lamentable, under a Government who have been so good for children, that children can be publicly identified and have their pictures all over the front pages of local newspapers, so that their families, friends, neighbours and everyone in their communities can identify and label them for a long time.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew1"><b> Matthew Green  (Ludlow)</b>  (LD): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the situation is often worse than that? When children leave jail after serving a short sentence, their status is often raised among their peers. Naming and shaming young people in the newspapers gives them status among other young people and raises the possibility of their behaviour being copied by other youngsters.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Dawson </b> : I agree. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point: some young people misguidedly relish their appearances on the front page. Some look to the day when an antisocial behaviour order will be imposed on them. The introduction of such legislation and such a means of dealing with young people shows a complete misunderstanding of their psychology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para12">As much as anyone, I have seen the way in which crime and the fear of crime can blight people&#039;s lives and wreck communities, and I want an effective response to crime. Just as much as anyone in Parliament&#151;perhaps more than many others&#151;I am committed to tackling crime and antisocial behaviour. However, to tackle the offending and offensive behaviour of young people effectively, we must deal with all the factors underpinning that behaviour. We must understand that we are dealing with human beings at a stage at which they can grow and mature through their difficulties, and we must recognise that the way in which we treat them can make their behaviour far worse, compound their problems and put them in danger.

<a name="50209h03_para13">I advocate a much longer period of intervention for many young people than they receive in prison. In large part, I would support such intervention taking place in the community, integrated with all the other systems of support for every other child in the community. I am certainly not averse to children being looked after in the care system for much longer than they serve under a detention and training order. I am in favour of young people who are a danger to the community being looked after for much longer in a local authority secure children&#039;s home than they would serve in a young offenders&#039; institution. It is essential that we address some of the very serious issues underlying criminal and antisocial behaviour, many of which are long-standing. Many issues relate to abuse and neglect over years, and it will take years of work, therapy, support and consistency to help young people through those issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para14">Prisons complain to me that they do not have the young people long enough to enable them to do decent work. There are good people in prisons who tell me that some young people there are experiencing the positive influences of people for the first time in their lives, albeit within the horrendous confines of a prison institution, but that they are not there long enough. Programmes are not long enough and not developed enough.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para15">None of the work needs to take place within the confines of a prison, however. The philosopher Foucault said that prison is dangerous when it is not useless. It is a horrible place to put a child. I thought that on my most recent visit to Lancaster Farms. Ironically, that is probably the best young offenders&#039; institution in the country, but I thought, &quot;What a horrible place for a child&quot;, when I looked around at the walls, the wire, the uniforms, the keys and the disgusting little cells with their huge locked doors. We owe young people far more and should do far better by them than that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para16">We also owe the public much more than useless rhetoric about the fact that prison somehow works, or a lot of stuff about the amelioration of conditions in prisons. I know that more money is being spent on prisons, that education authorities now work there and that primary care trusts are going to be much more involved; and I know that, following the Munby judgment, there will be more child protection and more advocacy for young people in prisons. However, we should compare the average annual cost of a place in a young offenders&#039; institution with that of one in a local authority secure children&#039;s home. The former is &#163;50,800 and the latter&#151;where children are looked after properly&#151;is &#163;185,780. If we are to lock children up, we should be prepared to pay the proper cost. We should pay for appropriate ratios of staff to children. With three to six staff serving 40 to 60 very needy children in prison, compared with one to six staff for two to eight very needy children in local authority secure care, it is obvious where they will be better cared for, even before we consider the rules and regulations, the inspection regime and the fact that local authority children&#039;s homes are required to be child-centred in ways that young offenders&#039; institutions cannot be.

<a name="50209h03_para17">The Government have been good for children, and I take my hat off to my hon. Friend the Minister, who is an excellent Minister.

children in prison, in order for them to have child protection workers and children&#039;s advocates? Why on earth does that same excellent organisation have to establish its own independent inquiry under Lord Carlile into the use of physical restraint, solitary confinement and strip-searching of children? Those are outrageous things to do to children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para18">The chief inspector of prisons recently said that there are a number of areas in which prison service orders are simply inappropriate for children, and do not reflect child protection principles. However, the Youth Justice Board has an aspirational strategy, whatever that is&#151;every Saturday evening, I aspire to win the national lottery, but I have not managed it yet&#151;which is supposed to cover constraint, confinement and strip-searching. Why do we need an independent organisation to search out what is going on in the institutions of state? What have the Government done to respond to the 11,500 cases of physical restraint of children in three secure training centres in five years; to the 200 injuries to children in 11 months resulting from restraint in prisons; and to the ghastly fact that one young man died while being restrained in a secure training centre last April?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para19">Why does another fine organisation, Inquest, have to campaign for the public inquiry into sentencing policy that was recommended to the Home Secretary by the coroner at the inquest into the appalling death of 16-year-old Joseph Scholes? Joseph Scholes died nine days into a two-year sentence for stealing a mobile phone. A victim of sexual abuse, a disturbed, self-harming child&#151;he had slashed his face just before his appearance in court&#151;he was in prison, in virtual isolation, and in a bizarre form of canvas-strip clothing, until he hanged himself. Why can we not have a public inquiry into sentencing policy and the death of Joseph Scholes? We need an inquiry to tell us all what is going on in young offenders&#039; institutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para20">Why is there so little support for the bereaved families of Joseph Scholes and the two other young people who recently died in secure training centres? One of them was a young man aged 14 who, last August, became the most horrifying statistic of all: the youngest person in modern penal history to die in a prison in this country. Why are there delays of up to two years in holding inquests? Why is there no central monitoring of inquests and recommendations? Where is the effective attempt to learn the lessons from all these tragedies?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para21">I have been to my local young offenders&#039; institution, Lancaster Farms, on many occasions, and, sadly, I have made two visits already this year. The first was routine. Members of the Prison Officers Association backed up their pension claim by telling me that they were involved in 10 or 12 violent incidents between children every day. That makes Lancaster Farms a dangerous place for children to be. I have been involved for a long time in inspecting places where difficult young people have been looked after, and that sort of bullying would simply not have been countenanced.

Friend the Minister has responded promptly to it&#151;of a mentally ill, hallucinating and possibly psychotic child who had been refusing food.

Later that day, the staff gave

me more examples of children who they thought should not be there, because the offences that they had committed were nowhere near serious enough to merit a custodial sentence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para23">On my second visit this year, I met young people in the prison&#039;s hospital wing, who were there for various reasons: they were suffering from mental illness, their offending was such that they were thought to be at risk from other young people in the prison, they had been victims of bullying or they were simply afraid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para24">The Prison Reform Trust tells us that 90 per cent. of young people in prison have a recognisable mental disorder and that 10 per cent. suffer from a severe psychotic illness. The 10 per cent. figure is interesting, because the Youth Justice Board tells us that it is seeking to reduce the population of children in prison by 10 per cent. over the next two years. That is a paltry ambition, although I am not even sure that the board will be able to achieve it, given the increasing number of children in prison who have breached antisocial behaviour orders. Given the rate at which children are dying, there will have been four more deaths in that two-year time scale.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para25">Frankly, I am critical of the Youth Justice Board. It is the body that placed 3,337 children who were officially recognised as vulnerable in Prison Service custody in 2003&#150;04, even though 24 per cent. of children in custody report being assaulted and one third report feeling unsafe, according to the inspector of prisons. It is the body that glosses over so many issues. Its recent consultation document on its strategy for the secure estate describes child deaths as &quot;serious incidents&quot;. It selectively quotes the Children&#039;s Rights Alliance for England to say that it has made miraculous improvements in the Prison Service without giving us the next sentence, which says that a number of institutions
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;were so bad&#151;were guilty of such gross violations of human rights&#151;that even when improved they still fall short of adequate.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para26">The Youth Justice Board estimates that there are 200 to 300 people whose needs it cannot meet, who today could be in just as much despair as the young people who died. There could be another death in the prison system today, such is the need, scarcity of resource and ineffectual nature of the establishments in getting to grips with some of the most troubled and disturbed young people in the land. We need to do much better, and we should have the principle and guts to face the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para27">All we need to do is take the lead from the magnificent children&#039;s policy that the Government are supposed to be developing and from the UN convention on the rights of the child, from which lamentably the Government have secured an opt-out in respect of children in prison. Let us treat all needy children as children. Let us have regard to what other countries do. Let us look at what we tried to do in this country in 1969, for goodness&#039; sake. If we believe that every child matters, we should have the guts and principles to raise the age of criminal responsibility way above the age of 10 to 16. We should ensure that any child over 16 sentenced to custody for offences that endanger the public&#151;some young people do need to be removed from our society&#151;goes to secure care rather than a prison and to somewhere run according to the principles of the Children Act.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para28">What we have in this country&#151;and the reason why I am leaving this place&#151;is a fantastic opportunity to transform children&#039;s services and the lives of all children. We are faced with the prospect of leaving thousands of children outside those services and in the inadequacies of the prison system. If we raised the age of criminal responsibility, it would ensure that all the new agencies and integrated services would have to respond at length and with real skill to all the neglected, abused, needy, challenging, difficult, ill, na-ve and immature young people who cause society problems. They would have to respond to them in terms of those services, the children&#039;s needs and the Children Act, not criminal justice legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para29">Using all the resources that we have at our disposal and all the children&#039;s legislation, young people could be managed, via Sure Start, extended schools and the range of integrated community resources coming on stream. Excellent workers&#151;people in the youth offending teams, youth inclusion programmes, and intensive supervision and surveillance programmes, and workers in young offenders&#039; institutions who genuinely want to work with children&#151;could be brought out of those institutions and better trained to work with children in the community and the care system. They could work with children in local authority secure care, but do so according to Children Act principles and having been trained properly. They could work with children across the gamut of health, education and social care policy, bringing integrated services together and locating their work largely in the communities from which they come.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para30">That solution applies to many countries and could have applied in this country for the past 30-odd years. It would address offending far more effectively than we do via the current system. It would also address the needs of children as effectively as possible and would help them to grow to maturity&#151;growing up is the best antidote to youth offending&#151;in their own communities but away from the negative influences of a prison culture. It would also keep children safe. I commend that approach to all hon. Members. If we have the principles, we need the political will to carry something like that through. If it were put properly to the people of this country, it would command an enormous amount of support.

It is a great shame that he has decided to stand down, because that will mean that there is one less of us that who think that young people receive far too negative a press.

<a name="50209h03_para32">How can it be that in the United Kingdom there are currently 2,665 young people in prison, yet in Italy there are none? How is it that the Italians can manage the system so differently from us? Are the young people in Italy all angels? If that is the reason, we must be breeding an awful group of young people. Of course that is not the reason; it is the way in which they are treated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para33">Most other European countries have, at most, a few dozen young people&#151;perhaps the severest of cases&#151;in custody. Yet we lead the way in Europe in the number of young people that we lock up. The UK cannot be proud of that record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para34">We heard from the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre about the number of deaths in custody. I do not want to cover again that ground about which he spoke so well. However, I would like to speak about the incidence of self-harm among young people in custody. We know, from the Government&#039;s own figures, that in 2001&#150;03 there were 414 incidents of self-harm by young people. That is a far higher rate of self-harm than among adults in prison, and is a sign of the underlying problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para35">It is also clear that when those young people are put into segregation, the rate increases further. Over a five-year period&#151;1999 to 2004&#151;117 incidents of self-harm occurred in segregation. That includes attempted suicide, which is classed as self-harm. The number of deaths in prison could have been substantially higher if some of those suicide attempts had been successful. The figures are appalling, and the fact that the last young person to die was only 14 is a shocking indictment of the country&#039;s attitude to young people in prison.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para36">One of my concerns is that&#151;perhaps to placate the mass media or, in some cases, the public&#039;s perception&#151;the Government and the Conservative party seem to be trying to outbid each other on who can sound the toughest about how many people should be locked up. It is a matter of shame that politics should compete on that territory; the Government and the Opposition should see fit to argue that keeping large numbers of young people in prison is nothing to be proud of in the 21st century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para37">Of even more concern is the fact that prison does not work for young people. The social exclusion unit published a report in 2002 called &quot;Reducing Reoffending by Ex-Prisoners&quot;. It found that 84 per cent. of juveniles released from prison in 1997 were reconvicted within two years. Prison cannot be working if the reconviction rate is 84 per cent. For those aged 14 to 21, the reconviction rate was 80 per cent. Of those who had served a short sentence of less than 12 months, which is typical for young people, 92 per cent. were reconvicted within two years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para38">Short sentences do not work; they do not give people time to work with the prisoners. Young persons in prison for less than 12 months are not likely to have their behaviour addressed before being released, and they are likely to reconvict. Those are exactly the people for whom we need to find different routes, different ways of dealing with them&#151;perhaps in ways suggested by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para39">One of the problems with young offenders&#039; institutions is that, because they are few in number and located in different parts of the country, offenders are often a long way from their families. One of the things 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 459WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that helps prevent reconviction is for young people to stay connected with their families and the local environment. It is all about making sure that they feel that they have something positive to come out to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para40">Her Majesty&#039;s inspectorate of prisons reported on juveniles in custody in April 2004. It was found that only 30 per cent. of boys and 23 per cent. of girls in custody had said that it was easy for their families to visit. They were held too far from their homes, and contact with their families was not easy. Contact with the family must be one of the more important things for young people. The Government&#039;s approach to locking up young people is making it more difficult to keep such links.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para41">Some disturbing figures are given in various Government reports. The social exclusion unit found that of those locked up, 25 per cent. of males had suffered violence at home; and 85 per cent. of them exhibited signs of personality disorder. Those people need treatment and help. Yet they are often locked up in an environment where they receive no help. Not only are we failing young people; we are failing society, because those young people come out with their behaviour unchanged and their ways unaltered. As a result, they are far more likely to be criminals. That is a problem not only for the individual; it is a problem for society.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para42">The staffing ratio in young offenders&#039; institutions averages between three staff to 40 young offenders and six to 60. It is the lowest staff-client ratio of any child placement of any kind in any sector. It is no surprise that we are failing those children if they are being put in places where they have the least chance of being helped, yet that seems to be the preferred route.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para43">Under section 98 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, if the youth offending team deems 15 or 16-year-old males to be too vulnerable for prison placement, the courts may direct them to be held in remand in a local authority secure unit or a secure training centre. The problem with that is that the order can be made only if placements are available on the day on which the remand decision is taken. The availability of placements in secure accommodation is the critical factor, regardless of the vulnerability assessment. The randomness of the availability of places cannot be in the best interests of the individual or society and cannot be the best way of placing these children. That is why some children who have been assessed as vulnerable continue to be sent to young offenders&#039; institutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para44">The Government should consider expanding that sector as an alternative to young offenders&#039; institutions, even as a first step and simply to meet the needs of the assessments which the Crime and Disorder Act has allowed to be taken into account. They have set up a system that should help, but the lack of places is helping to create the problem. They have opened the door to a solution, but they have not created the resource that will provide the answer and produce the end result.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para45">I support the call for a public inquiry into the death of Joseph Scholes, not only because his death was sad and tragic, but because it might open the way for the country as a whole to realise that the situation in this country is scandalous and that other countries deal with youth remand better than we do. We need to learn from other countries and to find a way of solving this problem. The Labour Government cannot be proud of these figures. I am sure that they would criticise them if they were in Opposition.

If he does want to reduce them, he should examine the experience of other countries and find ways of expanding the number of secure children&#039;s homes and secure training centres run by local authorities, as they are a substantial improvement on young offenders&#039; institutions.

<p><a name="50209h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Humfrey Malins  (Woking)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) on securing the debate and on the thoughtful and constructive way in which he has always approached these issues. I sense today, and I am sure the Minister will agree, that the debate is not party political but is being conducted by parliamentarians with an interest in the subject, and I hope that they can say something constructive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para47">I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) for his well chosen words. I declare an interest in that I am a former stipendiary magistrate, I sit as a district judge, and I am a recorder of the Crown court, so I am involved with juveniles in my very part-time professional life, which I hope will not become full time before long.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para48">There is no particular theme to what I want to say today, but I have several observations to make which I hope will be a constructive contribution to the debate on young persons in custody. How does one deal with them? Here is a passing thought, which was echoed in an earlier comment: where it is essential for young people to be in custody, it is my experience and that of many other district judges that nothing can be achieved by a short sentence. There is little point in putting someone behind bars for four, five, six or seven weeks, because nothing is achieved. If one has to put young people in custody, there is a strong argument for a sentence of sufficient length to enable something useful to be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para49">The problem has been illustrated already: there are vast numbers of young people in custody. A couple of months ago there were more than 10,000 under 21-year-olds in prison in England and Wales and, as has been said, 2,500 under 18-year-olds in custody. The striking thing is that certain features are common to an extremely high percentage of the under 18-year-olds. A huge percentage have low literacy and numeracy levels, have a history of being in care or social services or have some form of personality disorder or psychotic illness. A huge percentage, therefore, come from a background that is hardly likely to encourage a secure and stable life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para50">Young people today also face some problems that I do not think you and I, Mr. Deputy Speaker, faced when we were young. They are the twin problems of drink and drugs, which drive so many people to crime and therefore into custody. Young people are no exception. It is a sorry state of affairs that in today&#039;s community binge drinking is not limited to those of a greater age, but is prevalent among both 18 and 19-year-olds and, regularly, 15 and 16-year-olds, who get fake ID cards and believe that it is sensible to behave like mad people on drink. That leads to crime. Many youngsters who commit crime and go into custody have been fuelled by drink, which is much more readily available Nowadays.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para51">As for drugs, I might not even have heard of heroin or crack cocaine when I was 17&#151;in fact, I cannot remember. Certainly the prevalence of drugs and the easy access to the killer drugs, which turn youngsters into criminals, did not exist 20 or 30 years ago. Youngsters are growing up in a much more difficult society, where much less is set in concrete than was the case 20 or 30 years ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para52">I want to make a couple of points about sentencing and what works with youngsters. I am not a fan of the drug treatment and testing order, under which youngsters on drugs are told by the court that they are on the order for six months, which means that they have to return to the court every month and that they will be tested from time to time, to see how they are getting on. The results are mixed. Imagine if there were such a thing as a smoking treatment and testing order, whereby one was told to go away and stop smoking, and be tested now and again. My point is that the drug treatment and testing order lacks the element of compulsion that could make it work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para53">On the other hand, when I was considering the literally dozens of available sentences for young people, I came across one that has, over the past year or so, been&#151;I do not like the term&#151;&quot;rolled out&quot;. I am referring to the intensive supervision and surveillance programme, which is one of the orders that a court can serve a young person.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para54">Such orders at least get to grips with the young person, usually a prolific young offender, who for 12 months will be under the supervision of the probation service. During that time there will be intensive work on education and training, family support, skills and restorative justice. The young person will try positively to change offending behaviour. Help will be given with accommodation and drug treatment problems. There will be a minimum of five hours of educational activities each week day, even for youngsters who have truanted from school, and evening and weekend contact with a relevant worker. There is a huge emphasis on jobs, and a continuing emphasis on contact, through tracking, policing and tagging. Such orders are intensive and work extremely well&#151;not all do, and the courts struggle hard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para55">I shall move off sideways because something has occurred to me. I went to a judicial sentencing seminar the other day, and we had to pass sentence according to the following set of facts. Three boys aged 12, 12 and 11 go up to another boy in the playground and say, &quot;Give me &#163;1 or we&#039;ll thump you.&quot; Later in the day, they go up to another boy and say, &quot;Give me your drink or we&#039;ll hit you.&quot; The astonishing thing is that that was a judicial sentencing exercise in which the charge was robbery. I thought it strange that we were dealing with 12-year-olds behaving as 12-year-olds always have, and they were going through the court system and I had to think of a sentence. What is going on in the school and at home when someone cannot get a grip of 12-year-olds and say, &quot;Come on, let&#039;s do better&quot;? That was just a passing thought, and is a sad reflection on 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para56">I shall now discuss a couple of things that work. We are not talking about party policy today; I am of the view that nobody should be in custody unless there is no alternative. Terrific emphasis should be placed on young

I went to the young offenders&#039; institution and remand centre at Feltham a couple of years ago and heard an astonishing story. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; I said to somebody. &quot;I was driving while disqualified for the third time.&quot; &quot;Any other convictions?&quot; &quot;No, I just drive while disqualified.&quot; &quot;Why do you drive while disqualified? What&#039;s the problem?&quot; I asked. &quot;Well&quot;, he said, &quot;I can&#039;t pass the written and theory tests because I can&#039;t read and I can&#039;t write. But I&#039;m a damn good driver and I&#039;ve never done anything else wrong in my life.&quot; &quot;Well how are you getting on with reading and writing now?&quot; &quot;Not at all well, nothing&#039;s happening.&quot; One despairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para57">The Minister will have heard of Trailblazers, which is a good scheme originating from Feltham for one-to-one mentoring. Youngsters in the last few months of their sentence at Feltham are visited by mentors. If you were my mentor, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you would be there twice a week seeing me for a couple of hours and continually thereafter, telling me about life, meeting me two or three times a week and helping me to get a job. The mentors might have a criminal background themselves, which is all the more reason why they will be useful in that respect. Trailblazers at Feltham is committed to improving the lives of young offenders and has some extraordinarily good statistical rates for lack of reconvictions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para58">What about custody? A young friend of mine, Tom Rogan, was at St. John&#039;s school in Leatherhead. Older children at that school had almost a mentoring relationship with younger and similar aged people in the Leatherhead area with problems. Some of them had attention deficit disorder, some had domestic problems and others had turned to crime. They used to talk to them to try to find out what was going on and whether they could help. Tom said that they all thought, as 17 and 18-year-olds, that there was a place for custody, and I agree that there is. The point was made earlier that some young offenders glory in going to prison, but on the other hand, as Tom said, incarceration takes the cool out of crime. He went on to say that they were convinced, as 17 and 18-year-olds, that what those young people from disadvantaged backgrounds lacked were the skills to make their own way in the community, family support, training, education and confidence. They felt that there was much more work to do on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para59">Finally, I want to refer to a new programme, which I think is called the intensive fostering programme. The Home Office will know about the scheme, which is to be used instead of custody. Effectively, there is a supervision order to the youth offending team requiring the offender to reside for one year with a professional carer. In cases where the family background of the young person is absolutely chaotic and dismal, there may be a requirement to live with professional fosterers, who have to be very decent and good families to give the love and care to a youngster who is going off the rails that they have so sadly missed in the past. I do not intend to sound soppy when I say that love, care, discipline, a good education and a secure background are extremely important. If we are to get more youngsters out of custody and get them off the conveyor belt to crime, as my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) said on one occasion, that is the way that we must move.

<p>
<a name="50209h03_para60">Those are a few passing thoughts. They come from someone who does not talk party politically today and who recognises the problems in the system. I believe that drink and drugs are greatly involved in some of today&#039;s problems. Many more drug rehabilitation places are necessary.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Dawson </b> : The hon. Gentleman speaks from huge experience as a judge and stipendiary magistrate. He has expressed his support for all the positive programmes that have been introduced. However, there is no reason why any of them could not be carried on with young people within the care system, as an attachment to supervision orders in care proceedings. There is surely no reason why any of these measures have to be taken with young people who have been through the criminal justice system.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Malins </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right. One of the problems with all these courses is funding. Many are extremely expensive. Many of these courses exist outside the criminal justice system, but they are linked with it in many ways. I suspect that our successors will be sitting here in 30 years asking what on earth can be done about young people and crime and the large numbers in custody. This is one area of policy where there are serious contributions to be made from men and women of good will in every political party. We all share the same objective: more young people with constructive and good lives and fewer, if possible, in custody.
</p>



<a name="50209h03_time3"><h5>3.3 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50209h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Paul Goggins) </b> : It has been excellent debate. We have heard three superb speeches from the hon. Members for Woking (Mr. Malins) and for Ludlow (Matthew Green) and from my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson). I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. It is a difficult subject, but I, as the Minister, do not shy away from it. I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss it with him and other colleagues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para61">My hon. Friend has, as usual, spoken with great passion, understanding and experience. His experiences goes back beyond 1997, when he entered this House, to his former professional career. In some ways I was pleased that there were fewer speeches than there might have been this afternoon as it gave him a superb opportunity to lay out in full his beliefs and views on the issue. I am sure that in years to come when people ask what he stood for here, we can point them in the direction of his speech today. It summed up everything. My hon. Friend was candid enough to admit that of the letters in his postbag, half support his views and the other half oppose them. But that does not deter him from trying to strike the right balance. Nor does it deter me, even though we may strike it in a slightly different position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para62">We have been grappling with two basic questions. First, is custody ever an appropriate response to offending by young people? Secondly, if it can be justified, how can we make a positive intervention in a young person&#039;s life that can help them to turn away from offending? On the first question I want to make the Government&#039;s view absolutely clear: custody should only be used as a last resort. The vast majority of young 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 464WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
people who get into trouble can be steered away from offending without the need for custody. Indeed, we have given statutory backing to that requirement in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para63">The statistics show that by and large those who go into custody have committed a serious offence for which there is no realistic alternative sentence, pose a danger to the public or are persistent offenders for whom other options have not worked.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para64">Every year, about 190,000 young people get into trouble with the police. About half are dealt with outside the court system by means of reprimands or final warnings, and most of them stay out of trouble after such intervention. Of those who go to court and are convicted, the overwhelming majority get either a low-level disposal or a community sentence, such as action plan orders, supervision orders, or community rehabilitation orders. Only about 4 per cent. go into custody each year, and they are mostly young people who have failed to respond to non-custodial sentences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para65">Reference has been made to antisocial behaviour, but young people are not sent to custody for one-off acts of antisocial behaviour. Reprehensible as they are and urgently though they need to be dealt with, we are talking about young people committing serious crimes or having a long-standing record of repeat serious offending.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew7"><b> Mr. Dawson </b> : There is a serious, new but growing problem of young people being sentenced to custody because they are in breach of antisocial behaviour orders. They are often young people without substantial criminal records, but we have opened up a new avenue for custody.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : My hon. Friend raises what I know has been an issue of public debate, and because of that and my responsibilities, I have carefully examined the figures. The numbers of young people going into custody due to a breach of an antisocial behaviour order are very small. People are served with ASBOs not for dropping litter in the street, for example, but for very serious behaviour that can destroy the lives of individuals and families. It is a serious matter, although I reassure my hon. Friend that the numbers are small.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para66">When a young person is sent into custody, it is important that it is not seen as a stand-alone initiative. If we have learned nothing else, it is that periods of custody must be followed with intensive supervision in the community. The hon. Member for Woking quoted the example of Trailblazers, and was quite right: part of that ongoing supervision and support is often provided by mentors who can provide the personal support to young people that is often necessary to sustain the change that we all want to see.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew9"><b> Matthew Green </b> : The Minister is arguing that young people who end up in custody are often repeat offenders whose behaviour other systems have failed to address. However, 84 per cent. of young offenders who go to prison reoffend within two years. They are being sent into a system that is almost guaranteed to fail them as well.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I know that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend both raised the issue of reoffending 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 465WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
rates, and I share their concern about the high levels of reoffending. I am determined to do everything that we can to reduce those levels, although they indicate that individuals going into custody are young people who are already showing an embedded pattern of crime in their behaviour, which regrettably often recurs after their release from prison. We must, at the very least, reduce the rate and seriousness of reoffending. I assure the House that the Government will do everything possible, working in partnership with the Youth Justice Board, to do that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para67">In everything that I am saying, I do not wish for one minute to appear complacent about the current situation; nobody should be, and we intend to do more. The hon. Member for Woking mentioned the intensive supervision and surveillance programme, which combines challenging, purposeful activity with intensive surveillance, and can include electronic tagging. From a standing start in July 2001 to the end of November last year, there were 1,346 young people on ISSP schemes. Those young people would otherwise have run a serious risk of being in custody, but we can sustain them in the community under that intensive supervision.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Malins: </b>  If I did not say so earlier, let me tell the Minister that the district judges&#039; bench was not happy about these orders in the early days, but the more time goes by, the more it believes that they are beginning to work and could be a success.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew12"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : That is very encouraging. We have had other feedback from sentencers and professionals in the field to support that view. That is why the draft youth justice Bill, which was announced in the Queen&#039;s Speech, will contain proposals for further measures. These will include an intensive supervision and surveillance order, turning the packaged support that we have been discussing into a substantial provision, which the courts will be able to use as a clear alternative to a custodial sentence. We will also be making the statutory criteria for custodial sentences tighter still.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para68">The hon. Gentleman mentioned intensive fostering, and that is also something that we want to see develop. Clearly, if a young person has been deprived of decent, normal relationships, that may in some way be behind their offending behaviour. If we can get them that experience of family life and put them back on track, that will send a sensible and positive message.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para69">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was rather critical of the drug testing and treatment order. It is true that there were relatively high levels of reoffending in the early pilots, although, again, those who were subject to DTTOs were high-level offenders and chaotic drug users. The evidence is that if we can get people through these programmes, many of them will stop committing offences. Reporting back to sentencers is an important aspect of the order; it is an additional responsibility for sentencers, but my experience is that offenders who know that they must go back and have their progress reported directly to sentencers have an added incentive. Indeed, those who go back to the sentencer, having managed to stay off drugs and free from crime&#151;this would apply to young people, too&#151;get a massive boost when the sentencer can, for once, say something positive 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 466WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about them, rather than repeat the usual negative message. However, we shall no doubt return to the issue in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para70">We have discussed the state of the juvenile secure estate and the regimes for young people who are placed in custody. I acknowledge that criticisms of it have been made here and elsewhere, and there is certainly scope for improvement; I do not deny that for a second. However, it is worth spelling out some of the improvements that have been made in provision for under-18s over recent years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para71">Until 2000, there was no separate secure estate for under-18s. In that year, we took the major step of giving the Youth Justice Board responsibility for purchasing and commissioning juvenile secure places. We saw that as a key step in raising standards and improving the conditions in which juveniles are kept. We have invested heavily in improving custodial provision. In 2003&#150;04&#151;the last year for which we have audited accounts&#151;the Youth Justice Board spent &#163;225 million on the secure estate, which was a 20 per cent. increase over 2000&#150;01.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para72">That investment has clearly brought results. The Youth Justice Board has established an entirely separate juvenile estate for boys, and I am delighted to be able to&nbsp;confirm that it has achieved the goal of removing all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 and 16-year-old girls from Prison Service accommodation. It has also set up a national system for placing offenders, and it is worth saying that boys under 15 and all girls under 17 are held in secure training centres or local authority secure children&#039;s homes. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre feels strongly about the number of local authority secure children&#039;s home places that are available, and it is true that the number of such places has fallen in recent years from 297 to 235. At the same time, however, we have developed the secure training centre places, which were not there in the past. Between them, those two areas of provision now offer accommodation and supervision for the younger boys and for most of the girls who come into the custodial system. They provide 509 places, considerably more than there used to be.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew13"><b> Mr. Dawson </b> : I did not say much about secure training centres. However, would the Minister confirm that in their staffing ratios, the quality of life that they offer and the training of the staff whom they employ, they do not meet the standards and principles of residential care for children?
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew14"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I can see that there are differences. However, I think that some of the differences that appear to my hon. Friend to be negative are positive. Secure training centres offer greater scope for education, more space, and more opportunity to do certain activities in and, by and large&#151;from what I have seen&#151;they are safe and do constructive work with young people. It is sometimes argued that we developed them because they are cheap. They are a little&#151;not much&#151;cheaper than local authority secure children&#039;s homes. The average annual cost of a place in a secure children&#039;s home is about &#163;185,000, and one in a secure training centre is &#163;164,000. They are not cheap; they are 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 467WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
expensive, and we are right to make that investment. I take extremely seriously the safety of children in secure training centres.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew15"><b> Mr. Dawson </b> : I accept that my hon. Friend takes the safety of children in secure training centres extremely seriously. However, there have recently been two deaths in such centres, one during an incident of restraint. I gave some statistics about the thousands of times in which restraint has been used in secure training centres. What has the Home Office done to investigate the methods of restraint used by staff in those establishments?
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew16"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I will come to that a little later. I hope that he will allow me to conclude the part of my speech that emphasises the improvements that we have made in provision for young people in custody. The increase in educational funding has been substantial, and a young person in custody now has an average of 24 hours&#039; education and training every week. Some might think that that is not remarkable; that that should be our standard. I agree. However, it was not achieved in the past, and we are achieving it now. That is wholly positive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para73">Of course, hon. Members are right to press for further improvements. I am sure that more needs to be done, and we should all consider what might be possible. However, it is also fair to acknowledge the improvement in standards. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre pointed out that a rather partial quotation from the Children&#039;s Rights Alliance was used in the recent the Youth Justice Board publication. None the less, it acknowledged that improvement had occurred, as did the Audit Commission, which regards our youth justice system as a massive improvement over what there was before.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para74">A matter of particular concern to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre, and to hon. Members of all parties, is the serious and pressing issue of suicide and self-harm. The recent death of Gareth Price at Lancaster Farms YOI, like all deaths in custody, was a terrible tragedy, and I send my deepest sympathy to Gareth&#039;s family, and to the staff at Lancaster Farms. My hon. Friend mentioned earlier that he and I went together to Lancaster Farms just a few days ago and met the member of staff who tried to save that young boy&#039;s life. We should never forget the efforts that staff make, and the care that they show the vulnerable young people in our custodial system. I pay tribute to them for that, and am grateful that my hon. Friend has joined me in doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para75">We take such deaths extremely seriously. First, there is a police investigation whenever there is a death in custody. That is quite right because, depending on the circumstances, there might be grounds for a prosecution. Certainly, there is a need for a report to the coroner. Of course, the coroner carries out an inquest into all deaths that occur in custody. There is also the chapter 8 review, using the Department of Health guidelines, which is conducted by the local authority for the area in which the young person resided ordinarily. As the prisons and probation ombudsman has been given the responsibility for investigating all deaths in custody, including, now, those of juveniles, there is also the investigation that he carries out with support from 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 468WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the Youth Justice Board. So a rigorous and comprehensive view is taken of any death in custody, and rightly so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para76">Shortly&#151;before the end of February, I hope&#151;the Home Office will be able to respond to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which published before Christmas an extensive and important report on deaths in custody. I hope that the House will see from our response that we take these issues seriously.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Dawson </b> : Will my hon. Friend tell me why the Home Office turned down the recommendation from the coroner at the Joseph Scholes inquest that there should be a public inquiry? I know that he has taken a great deal of action in this regard, but surely there is a good case for a public inquiry.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew18"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : The case for a public inquiry has been put by hon. Members. The coroner who conducted the inquest into Joseph Scholes&#039;s death wrote to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to urge him to consider a public inquiry, and we considered the arguments for such an inquiry very seriously. It was of great concern to us to ensure that we responded to the concerns that the coroner expressed, which were in three areas. First, he was concerned about the sentencing issues to which Joseph&#039;s case gave rise, particularly as regards sentencing for robbery. It seemed to us that it was appropriate to refer that matter to the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which will draw up sentencing guidelines in respect of robbery. We want the council to consider carefully the case of Joseph Scholes as it draws up its guidance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para77">Secondly, a number of operational issues arose from Joseph&#039;s case. We asked David Lambert, a former assistant chief inspector for the social services inspectorate, to undertake a review of all the operational issues and to report back to the Home Office his findings. I anticipate that his report will be with me very soon. We shall certainly want to learn from any operational issues that he deals with and makes recommendations on in his report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para78">The third strand of concern relates to the provision of custodial places. As the Youth Justice Board is conducting a review of the secure estate&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre referred to the document that it published&#151;it was timely that we asked the board to incorporate questions about Joseph Scholes&#039;s case in its consideration. My hon. Friend and others will note from the document that that is one of the specific requirements that I have placed on the Youth Justice Board as it carries out its review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para79">We have sought to break down the concerns into those three strands and to deal with them urgently, so that we can learn from Joseph&#039;s tragic death. We let Joseph Scholes down terribly, and there is no hiding from that. We have to learn from his case. The fact that we do not agree that a public inquiry is needed should not lead anyone to think that we do not regard this as a most serious matter, but we are seeking to develop responses as quickly and comprehensively as possible in the way that I have outlined, rather than through a public inquiry.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew19"><b> Matthew Green </b> : The Minister has mentioned in relation to two of the concerns that he has outlined that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 469WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
there will be reports. Will he reassure the House that those reports will be published in full, with all relevant details? One reason for the demand for a public inquiry is the concern that somehow the system will sweep this matter under the carpet. It would go some way towards meeting people&#039;s concerns if all the reports were published in full as a result.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h03_spnew20"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : On reports by the prisons and probation ombudsman, which do not apply to the case of Joseph Scholes because he did not have the responsibility at the time, there are sometimes difficulties in publishing reports in full because of personal details. However, in relation to the three issues that I have outlined, it will, I hope, be apparent from the Sentencing Guidelines Council report that the case of Joseph Scholes has been taken into account. Any recommendations made by David Lambert will be made public, and I see no problem in publishing all of his report. Subject to further clarification, I can give the Chamber that assurance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para80">It is apparent in the Youth Justice Board&#039;s document that it is taking account of the case of Joseph Scholes in its review, and I am sure that we will look to its eventual proposal, following the consultation period, to see that it has taken account of that tragic case in its future plans. I am a firm believer in transparency in most things, and certainly in this area, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will seek to make it plain what lessons have been learned and how recommendations will be put into effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para81">New policies and practices have been introduced by the Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board since 2001. They include counselling, support groups, specialised psychological interventions and measures to improve general health. It is worth emphasising that from April almost all prisons will have their health services commissioned by the local primary care trust. In other words, the national health service will take over all health provision in our prisons, and in most of them that will be from this April. That is leading to substantial new investment in health, and it will inevitably lead to improvements in the quality and standards of health care that is provided. That is a wholly good thing.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 470WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para82">We now have in place suicide prevention co-ordinators in all our establishments, and the Youth Justice Board has funded dedicated juvenile outreach teams. Further measures are being put in place, and more action is planned to improve regimes. We are putting in place first-night and reception facilities, better systems for recognising vulnerability, child protection training, mental health nursing, counselling and peer support. We also want to minimise the use of segregation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para83">It is important to remember that young people in custody often have very serious problems that form a major part of the background to their offending&#151;for example, family histories or a history of substance misuse. Looking after and safeguarding such damaged young people will never be an easy task. Identifying which young people are most at risk is critical, and although a significant number of young people in custody are assessed as vulnerable, many can be safely accommodated in a juvenile young offender institution with the right help. Others who are more vulnerable may be better placed in a secure training centre or local authority children&#039;s home.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para84">Hon. Members&#151;and my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre in particular&#151;raised concerns about the use of restraint, especially since the death of Gareth Myatt in Rainsbrook secure training centre in April last year. Investigations and inquiries into Gareth&#039;s death are still in progress, so I am not in a position to say much about the particular circumstances of the case. However, I can confirm that the Youth Justice Board is reviewing the safety of restraint techniques in secure training centres and considering how better behaviour management practices could help to minimise the need for restraint. It is vital that all establishments are safe for young people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h03_para85">In November, the Youth Justice Board issued a consultation document, &quot;Strategy for the Secure Estate for Juveniles&quot;, which has been mentioned several times. It sets out in detail some of the achievements that I have referred to, explains the assumptions and principles underlying the board&#039;s approach to custody, and outlines plans for the period 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. The consultation period ends on 28 February. I shall refer the <i>Hansard</i> report of this debate to that review&#151;it is important that our views are known&#151;and I assure the Chamber that we will continue to ensure that wherever young people are kept in custodial care, that is done safely as possible.

Friend the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg), for taking the time to respond. He will know that our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills made a speech at the Secondary Heads Association conference in Blackpool on 1 February, in which she set out proposals to improve classroom behaviour. In her closing statement, she said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I have set out today my approach to this vital issue. Now I want to hear from you.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para0">So as we build on the emergent tradition in this excellent facility of Westminster Hall, I offer the Minister some thoughts, which I am sure he will take away and build on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para1">I have already been asked why a Welsh Member of Parliament should sally forth on an issue that has been devolved to Wales. There are two reasons. First, to define me or any of my Welsh colleagues as purely Welsh MPs is to miss the fact that we are also Members of the British Parliament. Proud as I am of being Welsh and of representing the fine constituency of Ogmore in south Wales, I have a role to play in all legislation and policy that passes through this House, so I boldly set foot on such territory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para2">Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the issue of classroom discipline reads across geopolitical boundaries in the United Kingdom, as our educational systems in Wales and England have developed together over a long period and still have fundamentally similar approaches. So a discussion in Westminster Hall has reverberations in the debating Chamber at Cardiff bay. Every parent and teacher in London, Llanelli, Bridgend or Birmingham has concerns about classroom behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para3">At the outset, it is important to note that although the tabloids will rage about this issue, our classrooms are not in anarchy. However, the Ofsted report shows that 10 per cent. of secondary schools have unsatisfactory levels of behaviour. We should deplore that, but we should strongly applaud the seven in 10 schools whose pupils&#039; behaviour is deemed good or better, and we should encourage the two in 10 schools that are deemed satisfactory to build on their success and to improve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para4">Hon. Members must be concerned that one in 10 schools have unsatisfactory standards of pupil behaviour. We must ask where those schools are located. What are their catchments? I am willing to hazard a guess that a disproportionate number are in communities that face the greatest social, cultural and economic challenges. The Minister might want to correct my assumption, but it is a pretty wise guess. If I am correct, there is an added imperative to tackle disruptive behaviour, because the children, teachers, head teachers, governors and parents whom we are failing in the most challenging communities will be the ones whom we most want to help.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para5">The Government have singly pioneered the cause of social inclusion. Year after year and in so many ways, we have proved that we are bold enough to offer radical 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 472WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
solutions to creating people&#039;s life opportunities. We have acknowledged that the debate has changed. We have put that on record and changed the debate, so that everyone now acknowledges that a good education in early years through to secondary school is of paramount importance to improving life chances. However, that good education can be marred by classroom indiscipline, and the life chances of any child thus diminished.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para6">Just as we have come to recognise the corrosive effect of low-level antisocial behaviour in our communities, there has been recognition, at least in the Labour party, of the destructive power of low-level indiscipline in our classrooms. What might have been termed &quot;having an attitude&quot; a few years ago can be seen in many ways, such as arriving late to class&#151;I warn anyone who might wander in late to this debate that that will be an indication of their classroom tendencies. There is chatting while the teacher talks, of which Mr. Deputy Speaker might also take notice; leaving the school grounds without authority; answering back; abusive language; and annoying and distracting other pupils.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para7">Those might seem minor and relatively unimportant issues on their own&#151;some might say that they are hardly worth bothering about&#151;but they are highly important, as they systematically undermine teachers and support staff; and they destroy the classroom experience for the majority of pupils, who want to learn, and for the majority of parents, who want to see their children benefit from the school experience. We do not want every pupil to be the teacher&#039;s pet presenting a shiny new apple every day. However, if some children are themselves the bad apples, the whole barrel can rot from within.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently argued for zero tolerance of classroom indiscipline. That caused some controversy: the phrase &quot;zero tolerance&quot; caused some to go into a spin. The zero tolerance approach to education in the United States was pioneered in response to acts of violence that often involved firearms and knives, but can we really apply zero tolerance to low-level misbehaviour of the sort that I have described?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para9">Critics argue that the concept of zero tolerance in the classroom is singularly unhelpful. It suggests punishments for minor infringements of behaviour that are far too severe. It implies a draconian approach to classroom discipline. It smacks of a clampdown. It treats all offences equally severely, and it does not recognise different levels of indiscipline. Importantly, it does not recognise that solutions should be tailored to the individual needs of the child. Yet I strongly believe that the concept and language of zero tolerance has a significant role to play&#151;and it does not have to be to the exclusion of other complementary approaches.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para10">Saying that all types of classroom misbehaviour, no matter how severe or minor, are not to be tolerated and will be dealt with is not incompatible with saying that the response to different types of misbehaviour will differ in scale and complexity. Zero tolerance and a flexible, tailor-made response to each pupil&#039;s needs are not incompatible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para11">That approach could and should build on the good work already being done in the best local education authority areas and among the best schools, which share 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 473WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
good practice. Solutions to misbehaviour should involve flexible discipline plans, formulated with the help of teachers, parents and pupils. They should involve excellent in-school, on-site support, to avoid the possibility of exclusion. We know too well the slippery slope that leads from school exclusion to a more fundamental social exclusion, and on to criminality. It is far too obvious to be ignored. Not taking steps to avoid exclusion also has costs. We should encourage schools to work together to develop active, engaged pupil referral units&#151;units that work intensively with schools to re-engage the pupils with mainstream education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para12">All of those approaches are essential; and without them, talk of zero tolerance is meaningless. With them, however, zero tolerance takes on a new life. It sends out the clear message that we are on the side of teachers and of children. We should have zero tolerance not only of violence and abuse in the classroom but of low-level indiscipline by the few, which can disrupt the class and destroy the learning experience for others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para13">The message of zero tolerance signals that the Government believe that authority should be invested in the teachers, that classroom discipline is with the teachers, and that we trust the teachers to carry out that important role. The political signal is crucial but, as stated, it has to be backed by a parallel policy of co-ordinated, flexible support for the child and sometimes for the parents, to ensure that exclusion is avoided whenever possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para14">Let us be clear, however, that exclusions have a role. We cannot do as Opposition spokesmen suggest and take away review panels and exclusions. Just as head teachers must have the backing of politicians to exclude pupils as a last resort to protect their staff, other children and the learning experience and ethos of the school, so should the child and the parents have the fundamental right to challenge the decision of a schoolteacher and a board of governors to exclude. In that way, on the rare occasions&#151;and they are rare occasions&#151;when the decision to exclude is questionable, it can be challenged and overturned if necessary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para15">Currently, the Opposition parties claim that the exclusions policy is in disarray owing to successful challenges. They would argue that every successful challenge diminishes the authority of the teacher, the head teacher and the governors, and also diminishes the culture of discipline in the school. If I were a teacher, and a pupil of mine were to argue that in an essay entitled, &quot;The standards in our schools and the youth of today&quot;, my response would be to summon that individual to my office, order them to do extra homework and more research, and tell their parents those dreaded words, &quot;Could do better.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para16">In fact, as the Opposition know full well, only one in 50 appeals against exclusions is successful. Putting on my maths teacher hat, that means that 98 per cent. of exclusion decisions are deemed valid and appropriate. That is not an exclusions policy in chaos. Exclusions have a vital role to play. Would any MP seriously tell the parents in their constituency that, when their darling son or daughter is threatened with exclusion, there is no recourse to appeal, and that that is only natural justice? I hope not, but I suspect that over the next few months my hopes are likely to be dashed.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 474WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para17">Zero tolerance is a message not only for children and teachers but for parents. I know the implications of that all too well. I have three boys in primary school; they will grow up into teenagers and, if they are anything like me, heaven help us. I have triple the potential for disciplinary slip-ups as time goes on, especially when they get into comprehensive school and discover girls and parties. I therefore do not say what I am about to say lightly, but it needs to be said. Parents must take responsibility for the education of their own children as much as teachers do&#151;in fact more so. By their own words and actions, parents can either reinforce or tear down the school&#039;s approach to discipline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para18">One day, in a school in my constituency&#151;a school that has a very good track record on discipline and behaviour&#151;I watched in amazement as a parent charged into the reception area while I was waiting for a meeting, towing behind him quite roughly a clearly distraught child who was in tears. The child was embarrassed and humiliated. He watched his father launching a tirade of abuse against the school secretary&#151;abuse that would not have been out of place after the 9 o&#039;clock watershed. He issued threats and accusations over a relatively minor issue that could easily have been sorted out. A teacher then came out to deal with him, and again I was amazed at the abuse and vitriol that he hurled at teaching staff in a public place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para19">I can understand a parent who comes to school with valid concerns and raises them&#151;we try to encourage that&#151;or someone who argues on behalf of their child with the teachers or the head teacher. However, what message would a child witnessing such an exchange take away about the authority of the school and the status of the teachers and school staff? What strategies did that child learn about how to tackle issues? He might himself want to challenge the teacher at some point, having learned that the appropriate way was to shout and harangue&#151;not to listen, but to hurl abuse and invective, and not to show respect, but to denigrate those who should have some authority within the school. That is why I am adamant that, as well as the soft approaches of support for children and parents, and the harder measures to deal with children, such as exclusion, there must be similar packages to deal with parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para20">We face a mixture of challenges. Some parents do not have the appropriate skills to parent effectively, and they do not know how to instil discipline in their own children or how to set boundaries for them. Such parents can and should be offered support and active intervention to help them develop those skills. We should make much more use of parenting programmes. I know that the Government are committed to that. Parenting programmes are a classic example of something for which we are accused of being a nanny state and intervening, but they work very well, helping parents to turn around their approach to their children and to parenting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para21">Such softer support mechanisms have to be reinforced with firmer measures. They should include sanctions and penalties. It is no good pretending that support measures, coupled with the good will of the school and agencies, will be sufficient to convince every parent of the need for discipline and of the role that they have to play. I applaud the Government&#039;s commitment to further the use of stronger measures. Those have to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 475WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
include, as a last resort, parenting orders administered through the courts and penalty notices for truancy. There has to be more willingness to use those measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para22">It is right that teachers demand of the Government and politicians at all levels that we put appropriate mechanisms in place to assist with classroom discipline, and that we put ourselves firmly on the side of teachers and children. We must support teachers and give them the message that we trust them to get on with using the measures, flexibly and with autonomy, to meet the needs in their schools. However, zero tolerance is an important message in setting that agenda and the benchmark of the type of discipline that we expect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para23">We have a right to expect that those approaches should be used. Schools and local education authorities should be allowed flexibility and autonomy but they should not be allowed to leave any appropriate tool unused in the toolbox. The adage that a bad workman blames his tools could be rephrased as a bad workman is bad because he does not use the proper tools at the appropriate time. We can innovate; we have seen it already in schools across England and Wales. There is the yellow card system, for example, and the idea that boundaries for behaviour are clearly set for children. It is not a simple knee-jerk reaction, with one penalty fitting all. There is a warning system that shows that children are stepping over the line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para24">Crucially, while we talk about zero tolerance, we must recognise that children face different challenges. Some have emotional needs; they need help and support. Some are not getting the parental support that they need. Some, quite frankly, do not know what the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are. All of those approaches have to be available in that toolbox and used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para25">How do we make progress? Further support for teachers in the classroom is undoubtedly necessary, as is support on school sites, so that children are not excluded too readily and we can try to turn the situation around and keep them within mainstream education. Learning support units, which the Government are pushing strongly, are to be welcomed. They need to be used more frequently in more local education authority areas. Schools should be encouraged to exclude where appropriate as a last resort, and backing should be given to head teachers and governors to do so. There is good practice in pupil referral units in England, as there is in Wales, but it is not consistent. We need to push much harder to ensure that, if local education authorities are not developing the resources and expertise, schools work together as consortiums to try to do so. Parental support and parental penalties are also important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para26">This approach needs some holistic thinking, using all the measures available. The Government and politicians should be unafraid to say not only that bringing weaponry into school and the physical abuse of teachers will not be tolerated, but that boundaries will be set for low-level misbehaviour in class. That will undoubtedly improve the life chances of the children concerned. Correspondingly, if we fail to do that and if schools fail to play their part, they will fail the children in their charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para27">I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response. This issue is of fundamental importance, and should be considered as such by the Labour Government, who have been so

good at tackling social inclusion issues. If we get things right, especially from a grass-roots level, with schools and LEAs consistently taking part, we will deliver a major service, particularly to our most disadvantaged communities, whose schools face the greatest challenges.
</p>



<a name="50209h04_time1"><h5>3.50 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50209h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Derek Twigg) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on securing this important debate on what is a crucial area of education. He expressed well his concern, interest and knowledge of the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para28">We take behaviour in schools seriously, and we are the first Government to do so. We have invested a great deal of money in improving behaviour, because we believe that every child has the right to the best possible education, to enjoy learning in a positive environment, to achieve, and to make the best of their life. That applies to every child, not just a few.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para29">Everyone thinks that they know what to do about behaviour, and a lot of ill-informed comments are made and simplistic solutions suggested. Many suggest that most children are disorderly, even out of control, and that behaviour is getting worse all the time. That simply is not true. Ofsted tells us that more than 90 per cent. of behaviour in secondary schools is just satisfactory or better. Schools are often the most secure and stable environment in the communities that they serve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para30">We know that there is a long way to go. So far, we have taken a two-pronged approach to the issue. First, we have addressed the most challenging areas through the behaviour improvement programme&#151;involving about 1,500 schools that face serious behaviour challenges&#151;through which we provide intensive support in the form of extra learning mentors, learning support units, behaviour and education support teams, and police in schools. The programme will be extended to a further 500 schools later this month.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para31">As my hon. Friend said, there are issues of social disadvantage in relation to behaviour, but that should not be an excuse. Many schools are achieving against serious odds. Brinkburn school draws most of its 920 pupils&#151;one third of whom are entitled to free school meals&#151;from surrounding housing estates in an area of high unemployment and deprivation. It is part of the excellence in cities initiative and the behaviour improvement programme, and has suffered the usual range of behaviour-related problems, which led to a high rate of exclusion. However, the latest Ofsted inspection rated the behaviour of pupils at Brinkburn school as &quot;very good&quot;. It stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Relationships are very good and collaboration is a strong feature of the school&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para32">It went on to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Enthusiasm for the school by the majority of pupils is very high.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para33">Improvements in behaviour are reflected in the reduced number of exclusions. In 1998&#150;99, a total of 178 pupils had fixed-term exclusions and 11 were permanently excluded. Those figures have steadily fallen. In 2003&#150;04, 108 pupils had fixed-term exclusions and three were permanently excluded. In the current year, so far only nine pupils have had fixed-term 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 477WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
exclusions and only one has been permanently excluded. Those figures effectively represent half-yearly results and put the school on course to far exceed the BIP targets for the year, which are 70 fixed-term and three permanent exclusions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para34">The professionals, who are the real experts, tell us that their top priority is to continue the support to end low-level classroom disruption, to which my hon. Friend referred. Therefore, the second part of our strategy is to provide all secondary schools with training, materials and extra expert support to tackle the behaviour issues that schools identify as their top priorities. Schools can deal with the great majority of behaviour problems through good teaching, and good behaviour policies and procedures. We are giving them the tools to do so and to improve things.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para35">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said last week, there are things that we just cannot tolerate: we cannot let pupils arrive at classes with the wrong attitude; we do not want pupils whose thoughts are elsewhere when they should be on their lessons; and we cannot accept such pupils disrupting teaching by annoying their classmates. Every pupil and teacher has the right to expect a safe, secure and orderly classroom, so that teaching and learning can flourish.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para36">My hon. Friend talked about zero tolerance. I am talking about a zero tolerance policy under which any incident and any level of bad behaviour is dealt with promptly and appropriately. Zero tolerance is about creating a climate in a school where everyone&#151;pupils and staff&#151;shows respect for each other and for each other&#039;s work. That does not mean excluding more pupils. Schools that involve parents and the whole school community in creating their behaviour policy are less likely to have to exclude pupils. Zero tolerance means zero tolerance of the behaviours that disrupt pupils&#039; learning, not of pupils themselves. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the additional things that we will do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para37">The great majority of schools are effective in this respect; they have agreed a clear behaviour policy, which is respected and supported by the whole school community and developed with parental and pupil involvement. For secondary schools where Ofsted finds behaviour unsatisfactory, we are working with local authorities to ensure that schools develop plans to improve the situation as a matter of urgency, and to ensure that specialist help for improving behaviour is channelled to those schools straight away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para38">It is not a job just for schools; we must all offer our full support to head teachers, who are striving to promote good behaviour. It is imperative that parents support the school&#039;s behaviour policy and do not automatically assume that when their child is punished he or she must be in the right and the school in the wrong. Above all, it means parents taking responsibility for their children&#039;s behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para39">It is not easy for some parents to manage their children&#039;s behaviour and there is help and support available to help parents do that more effectively. Schools and local authorities are being encouraged to engage with parents and to guide them towards sources of help when their children persistently misbehave in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 478WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
school, using home-school agreements and, in cases of exclusion, the parenting contracts that we have introduced. When parents are unwilling to engage, it is right that we take action to ensure that they do so, through parenting orders administered by the courts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para40">We want every secondary school to have access to a wide range of high-quality support in and out of school. In the classroom, most teachers can manage most forms of poor behaviour and, as I said, we have done a great deal to help to develop those skills, through our key stage 3 behaviour and attendance materials, for example.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h04_spnew1"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies </b> : Will the Minister on behalf of the Secretary of State undertake to ensure that discussions take place with the Welsh Assembly, so that best practice can be disseminated on both sides of Offa&#039;s Dyke&#151;not so that in Wales they follow what we are doing, but so that we can learn from each other&#039;s experience?
</p>




<p><a name="50209h04_spnew2"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : My hon. Friend knows that we are keen to promote best practice, and I shall come to why that is important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para41">Some children need more; for those at risk of exclusion, support needs to be available within the school but outside the classroom. Schools should have access to approaches such as learning support units, learning mentors and behaviour support teams, which have shown their value in helping young people with challenging behaviour and those at risk of exclusion. The support systems within schools have a vital role in helping head teachers to promote good behaviour, but sometimes they are not enough. We continue to support the right of head teachers to exclude children from school when they need to.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para42">It has been suggested that the existence of appeals panels undermines the rights of heads to exclude; that is nonsense. Exclusion appeals panels provide a safety net for parents and, crucially, keep exclusion decisions out of court and avoid all the extra stress and bureaucracy that that would cause. Less than 2 per cent. of head teachers&#039; decisions on exclusion are overturned by appeals panels ordering the reinstatement of the excluded pupil.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para43">We want to provide quality education for every child, even those who have been excluded. We need a high quality of out-of-school provision that continues their education and deals with their behaviour issues. As part of the local authority-led reviews, local authorities and schools are looking at the adequacy of provision for excluded pupils provided in pupil referral units, for example, or by voluntary organisations. We expect groups of schools increasingly to act as the commissioner for such provisions, purchasing them from local authorities or from the voluntary sector. By exercising their collective buying power, groups of schools will be able to use customer pressure to drive up the quality of provision outside schools and for challenging pupils.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h04_para44">The aim for excluded pupils is that they can eventually return to the classroom when their behavioural problems have been addressed. We remain convinced that schools collectively taking responsibility for such pupils is the right thing to do. It is completely 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 479WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
unfair when weaker schools, which are unpopular and have spare places, are required to take all the hard-to-place pupils in an area, which makes it even more difficult for them to bring about the improvements that they need to make. It is also unfair if vulnerable children, such as looked-after children, are denied access to better schools&#151;

<a name="50209h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Jeremy Bamber</h3>

<a name="50209h05_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50209h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Andrew Hunter  (Basingstoke)</b>  (DUP): At 7.35 on the morning of 7 August 1985, officers of the Essex constabulary forcibly entered White House farm, Tolleshunt D&#039;Arcy, Essex. After a search of half an hour, they had found five bodies: those of Neville Bamber, his wife, June, their adopted 28-year-old daughter, Sheila Cafell, and her twin six-year-old sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At approximately 3.15 that morning, the Bambers&#039; 24-year-old adopted son, Jeremy, who lived in a neighbouring village, had called the local police informing them that he had heard from his father saying that his sister, Sheila, had gone crazy and had a gun. Jeremy Bamber met the police at the farm at about 3.40&nbsp;am. The police initially believed that Sheila, who had a history of mental illness, had committed four murders before shooting herself, but members of the extended Bamber family soon started trying to convince the police that Jeremy was responsible. In due course, he was arrested, charged and convicted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para0">The trial was unusual. The judge ruled that only Sheila or Jeremy could have committed the murders. Consequently, a major thrust of the prosecution case was to demonstrate that Sheila could not have been responsible and that Jeremy was therefore guilty. It was a near-run thing; the jury convicted Bamber on a 10:2 majority vote. If just one of 10 jurors had wavered, Bamber would have walked away a free man. Instead, he has been incarcerated for 19 years, consistently protesting his innocence. Subsequent developments, particularly during the past 12 months, have given rise to grave concern that Bamber&#039;s conviction may be another of the great miscarriages of justice, to be bracketed with the Bridgewater Three, the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para1">With the Bamber case, the key issue has been, and remains, the non-disclosure of evidence to the defence. Early in 2004, Bamber&#039;s new defence team looked at the evidence again, and exhibit 29 caught their attention in particular. It was a document listing some radio messages from the scene of the crime. The defence wondered whether it might be the first page of a longer document rather than a complete document in itself, so they sought clarification. Essex constabulary was adamant that exhibit 29 was a whole document and had been available to the defence for the trial. Unconvinced, Bamber&#039;s defence team took the matter to court in March 2004. They were successful, and the police produced the entire document. Exhibit 29, it transpired, was not a single-page document, and Bamber&#039;s solicitors received by fax a 24-page summary of radio communications. They then took the unusual step of writing to both the trial judge and the chief prosecution counsel, inquiring if either had known at the time of the trial of the existence of the lengthier log of radio messages. Both replied that they had not.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para2">On receiving the 24 pages, the defence immediately noticed that the first two pages had not only been re-written on different paper from the rest, but had been edited. A comparison with police witness statements revealed that several key radio messages that were made had been left out. Why? The defence therefore asked for the original document so that it could be sent for electrostatic document analysis testing, but Essex

<br>&nbsp;<br>
constabulary refused. The request has been repeated many times, and on each occasion the constabulary has refused.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para3">The disclosure of the radio message log was not the only dramatic development last March. Bamber&#039;s defence had requested only one document. However, perhaps inadvertently, the police also provided evidence that had not been requested&#151;pages from a contemporaneous telephone log and from a contemporaneous incident report. The defence had not known that either existed. It was immediately apparent that the two logs and the incident report that the police had withheld contained details that were entirely inconsistent with the case put by the prosecution at Bamber&#039;s trial. I will give just two examples; others might be used by Bamber&#039;s defence on another occasion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para4">First, at 5.25 am, officers in police car call sign Charlie-Alpha 7&#151;the same officers who had met Bamber at White House farm and spent much of the time with him&#151;relayed a message from the tactical firearms team to incident headquarters. The firearms team was in conversation with a person inside the farm. If the police were in conversation with somebody inside the farm at 5.25 am, the case against Bamber collapses. He could not have murdered everybody in the farmhouse before 3 am if at 5.25 am the police were talking to one of his supposed victims. If, on the other hand, the police were in conversation with a third party inside the farmhouse, the judge&#039;s ruling that either Jeremy or Sheila and nobody else could have committed the crimes is blatantly wrong. However, neither trial judge nor prosecution or defence had any opportunity to evaluate the 5.25 am entry, because the police had withheld it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para5">Secondly, four entries in the logs and incident report flatly contradict the prosecution&#039;s account that Neville Bamber&#039;s body was found downstairs in the kitchen and the other four bodies upstairs. An entry in the radio message log, which the police withheld for nearly 19 years, reads:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;0737: one dead male and one dead female in kitchen&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para6">The telephone message log, which the police withheld for nearly 19 years, records:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;0738: one dead male and one dead female found on entry&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para7">and at 7.40 am, the incident log, again withheld by the police for nearly 19 years, records a message from a Detective Inspector &quot;IR&quot;&#151;we know only his initials&#151;which. said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Police entered premises. One male dead, one female dead&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para8">We know from their witness statements that at 7.40 am the police had not yet gone upstairs and searched the back of the house, where the other bodies were found. Finally, after they had eventually searched that part of the house and finished their task, they reported:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;House now thoroughly searched by firearms team. Now confirmed a further 3 bodies found&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para9">So, almost immediately on entering the farmhouse, the police had found two bodies downstairs in the kitchen, and later three more bodies had been found upstairs. Most emphatically, that is not what the prosecution said during the trial.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para10">The defence team believe that they probably now know what happened. They believe that the body of Sheila Cafell, which the police insist that they found 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 482WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
upstairs, had first been seen downstairs in the kitchen. Of course, dead bodies do not move. The proposition that Sheila Cafell was still alive when the police thought that she was dead in the kitchen might be dismissed as entirely fanciful if there were not supporting photographic evidence&#151;photographic evidence that was not disclosed until 2001. Unfortunately, Bamber&#039;s previous defence did not recognise its significance before his 2002 appeal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para11">Before the trial in 1986, Bamber&#039;s defence had access to a large bundle of scene of crime photographs, which included photographs of the dead bodies. In the cases of June and Neville Bamber, rigor mortis is evident, as is skin discoloration, and the blood is congealed. The defence wrongly assumed that the first bundle contained all the photographs that had been taken. Before the 2002 appeal, however, the defence team were shown another, smaller bundle of 80 to 100 photographs that had previously been withheld.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para12">At Bamber&#039;s trial, the prosecution argued that if Sheila had committed the murders and then killed herself, she would have trodden in blood as she moved about the house; but no trace of blood was found on her feet. Interestingly, no photographic evidence was produced at the trial to support that assertion. Curiously, the first bundle of photographs contained no pictures of Sheila&#039;s feet. That is not so with the second bundle of photographs, which were withheld. In that bundle were photographs, which were not available at the time of the trial, clearly showing blood on Sheila&#039;s feet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para13">The withheld second bundle contains even more dramatic evidence. There are several photographs of Sheila&#151;there is no rigor mortis, the skin is not discoloured and the blood from her wounds has not yet congealed. Bamber&#039;s defence team have shown those photographs to leading pathologists. Independently, they have concluded that Sheila could not have died much more than one and a half hours before the photographs were taken. However, the police photographer did not arrive until a little after 9 o&#039;clock. According to the pathologists, therefore, Sheila died at about the time the police entered White House farm, and Bamber could not have murdered her.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para14">The points that I have made&#151;I could make many others if we had more time&#151;give rise to grave concern about Bamber&#039;s conviction. Their common theme is the non-disclosure of evidence by the police. Nearly 16 years after the White House farm murders, the defence first saw the second bundle of photographs. After nearly 19 years, the defence team discovered that there was a full radio log, a telephone log and an incident report, of which they had previously been unaware. It is the understatement of all understatements to say that such non-disclosure is deeply worrying. Even worse, it is still going on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para15">Bamber&#039;s defence team have repeatedly asked for access to the following: first, the notebooks and other papers of Inspector Jones, who headed the initial investigation and firmly believed in Bamber&#039;s innocence; secondly, the findings of the coroner who inquired into Inspector Jones&#039;s sudden death, which have never been made public; thirdly, the audio recordings of all telephone and radio messages from White House farm; fourthly, the audio recordings describing the scene of the crime; fifthly, the video 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 483WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
recordings of the scene of the crime; and sixthly, the original radio and telephone messages log and incident report. All are still being withheld from the defence. On every occasion on which the defence team have asked for them, Essex constabulary has refused to provide them. I put it directly to the Minister&#151;and ask her to respond&#151;that that is surely an intolerable state of affairs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para16">In December I tabled a written question asking the Home Secretary to instruct Essex constabulary to give Mr. Bamber&#039;s solicitors all audio tapes relating to events at White House farm. The Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The disclosure of information held by Essex Constabulary is a matter for the Chief Officer of the force&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para17">Unfortunately, the chief constable has made his position clear: he will not co-operate. One wonders why not. The Minister also stated in her reply:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;If the information requested is available under the access provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 or the Freedom of Information Act, then Mr. Bamber may have his own rights to gain access to such information under this legislation.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 21 December 2004; Vol. 428, c.&nbsp;1556W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para18">Those possible rights have been explored, but appear not to exist. It is now time for the Home Office to take matters seriously, and consider carefully not only the few points that I have made, but the whole Bamber affair. In particular, it should look at the issue of non-disclosure and the behaviour and attitude of Essex constabulary. It is also time for the Criminal Cases Review Commission to expedite matters so that the case of Mr. Jeremy Bamber is not left in judicial limbo. Such action is necessary to avoid perpetuating what a growing number of people fear may be one of the greatest miscarriages of justice of our times.

<p><a name="50209h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart) </b> : I thank the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and congratulate him on securing this debate on the important and, in many ways, sensational case of Jeremy Bamber, who is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of his adopted parents and sister and her twin sons.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para19">The hon. Gentleman has stated that he believes that the Home Office should look closely at the Bamber affair, and in particular at the issue of non-disclosure and the behaviour and attitude of Essex constabulary. I shall begin by saying that, on previous occasions, the Home Office has looked closely at the Bamber affair, as have the constabulary and the City of London police, following a complaint by Mr. Bamber to the Police Complaints Authority under the previous system. Its 14-month study did not uphold Mr. Bamber&#039;s complaint. Since then, there have been reforms to the Police Complaints Authority, and I do not know whether Mr. Bamber has made a further complaint to the new Independent Police Complaints Commission. Perhaps, however, it would help if I explained the recent handling of requests to review cases such as Mr.&nbsp;Bamber&#039;s, because that is relevant to the points raised by the hon. Gentleman.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para20">The 1993 royal commission on criminal justice recommended that the responsibility for re-opening cases of suspected miscarriages of justice should be
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;removed from the Home Secretary, and transferred to a body independent of Government.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para21">Parliament agreed with that when it passed the Criminal Appeal Act 1995, setting up the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Accordingly, the Home Secretary&#039;s powers to consider alleged miscarriages of justice ended on 31 March 1997, and were replaced by new powers vested in an independent body, the CCRC. It has the power to review and supervise investigations into possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; to approve the appointment of investigating officers; to gain access&#151;I emphasise this&#151;to documents and other material that may be relevant to its investigations; and to refer any cases when there is a real possibility that the conviction or sentence will not be upheld to the appropriate court, which will treat the referral as a new appeal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para22">The Home Secretary is answerable to Parliament for the work of the commission, but as it is operationally independent, he cannot intervene in its determination of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a particular case. That being so, in many ways, it is&nbsp;not within the Home Secretary&#039;s remit to examine Mr.&nbsp;Bamber&#039;s case. I recognise that the hon. Gentleman is asking not for a general re-examination of the case, but for a particular investigation of the role of Essex constabulary. Further allegations of non-disclosure by the Essex constabulary are a matter for the CCRC, rather than for the Home Office, because non-disclosure can be a ground for the CCRC to refer a case back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Court of Appeal. The commission referred Mr.&nbsp;Bamber&#039;s case to the Court of Appeal in 2001, following an earlier investigation, but those grounds were not based on non-disclosure. Mr. Bamber&#039;s solicitor added a number of non-disclosure arguments at the appeal hearing, although they were dismissed by the full court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para23">I understand that the commission has recently been asked to investigate the new allegations, and I can confirm that under section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act it has the power to gain access to documents and any other material that may be relevant to its investigations. I have been told that there are something like 4&nbsp;&nbsp;million items of material in this case, so there is a large range of matters that the commission needs to investigate. If it has not already done so as part of its earlier review of the case, which resulted in the unsuccessful appeal in 2002, it may, if it believes it appropriate, obtain the material to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para24">It would be inappropriate for the Home Secretary to become involved in this or any other alleged wrongful conviction. The safety of the conviction is a matter for the courts rather than the Home Secretary. Accusations about the Essex police are a matter for the chief constable of the force or the new Independent Police Complaints Commission. There is an important public policy reason why both the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Independent Police Complaints Commission are independent of the Home Office: to create public confidence in those authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para25">Mr. Bamber is of course aware of the Criminal Cases Review Commission&#039;s remit, as his second appeal in October 2002 followed its reviewing his case and

<br>&nbsp;<br>
referring it back to the Court of Appeal on 23 March 2001. In that case, the Court of Appeal did not find that there were sufficient grounds for finding the conviction to be unsafe. In its judgment, the court went so far as to say:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It should be understood that it is not the function of this court to decide whether or not the jury was right in reaching its verdicts. That is a task that is wholly impossible in virtually every case because this court does not have the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses give evidence, and deciding which of the witnesses are trying to tell the truth and which of those who are trying to do so are accurate in their recollection. Our system trusts the judgment of a group of 12 ordinary people to make such assessments and it is not for the Court of Appeal to try to interfere with their assessment unless the verdicts are manifestly wrong, or something has gone wrong in the process leading up to or at trial so as to deprive the jury of a fair opportunity to make their assessment of the case, or unless fresh evidence has emerged that the jury never had an opportunity to consider.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We have found no evidence of anything that occurred which might unfairly have affected the fairness of the trial. We do not believe that the fresh evidence that has been placed before us would have had any significant impact upon the jury&#039;s conclusions if it had been available at trial. Finally the jury&#039;s verdicts were, in our judgment, ones that they were plainly entitled to reach on the evidence. We should perhaps add in fairness to the jury that the deeper we have delved into the available evidence the more likely it has seemed to us that the jury were right, but our views do not matter in this regard, it is the views of the jury that are paramount.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para26">It is open to anyone to re-apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission if they can present an argument or evidence not raised in previous court hearings or demonstrate that the case would, exceptionally, otherwise merit a reference back to the Court of Appeal. I am informed that Mr. Bamber&#039;s solicitor reapplied to the commission in March 2004. I understand that the commission reached a provisional decision but that his solicitor has since provided further material that will take time to investigate. I am confident that the commission is dealing with the further application both fairly and thoroughly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para27">It is neither in my remit nor in that of the Home Secretary to consider the said to be newly discovered police logs or any other new evidence that may have been made available to the commission. However, the commission can ask for that material and assess whether it demonstrates that the concern expressed by the hon. Gentleman that there has not been a fair trial is sufficient to merit re-referring the case to the Court of Appeal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para28">I believe that it is at best premature to discuss a call for a further inquiry into the suggested withholding of information by the Essex constabulary. At the second 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>9 Feb 2005 : Column 486WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
appeal, the court found no evidence to support Mr. Bamber&#039;s allegations of serious wrongdoing, including deliberate non-disclosure, by the police; nor did the results of the internal inquiry and the 14-month investigation of Mr. Bamber&#039;s complaints by the City of London police confirm that there was any justification to Mr. Bamber&#039;s allegations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para29">I understand that there is no current recorded complaint to the new Independent Police Complaints Commission. If there is a complaint that the police are deliberately withholding material, that is the proper authority to deal with the matter. Only if a third appeal contradicted the earlier findings of the re-referral and of the previous court might it be reasonable to consider whether an inquiry was needed into how the matter had come to that pass.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209h05_para30">Before us is a concern that evidence has not properly been made available to the body that is rightly charged with judging it. There is an independent body, which is sifting through that evidence and which has the powers, given to it by Parliament, to call for that evidence if it believes that it is in any way relevant to the case for a re-hearing by the Court of Appeal. It is doing that job. I urge the hon. Gentleman to depend on that process. The Criminal Cases Review Commission has been pretty efficient at dealing with the matters before it.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hunter </b> : Is not the point that the CCRC may be evaluating submissions from Mr. Bamber&#039;s solicitor and has the power to request evidence, but the defence does not? The defence&#039;s submission to the CCRC is the weaker, because it does not have access, or powers to gain access, to the evidence that the police are allegedly denying it.
</p>




<p><a name="50209h05_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart </b> : The hon. Gentleman points out that these are allegations. The record of the CCRC in its independent role is good. It has referred a number of cases back to court. I do not have the figures before me, but I think that, to date, there have been more than 60 cases in which the judgments of previous courts have been overturned as a result of its work. The CCRC is not anybody&#039;s patsy. It has the power to require the material. It is the mechanism that has the power to ensure reconsideration if a case merits reconsideration. We have established a powerful independent way to deal with miscarriages of justice. If the concern is that there has in this case been a miscarriage of justice, that body must have the opportunity to do its job and to ensure that that matter is dealt with effectively.
