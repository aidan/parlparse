<a name="41027h01_head1"><h3 align=center>Greater Manchester Metrolink</h3>


<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Margaret Moran.]</i>
</p>



<a name="41027h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="41027h01_spnew0"><b> Ian Stewart  (Eccles)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate at the first time of asking, as the subject is a top priority for all hon. Members in the Greater Manchester area. A number of them want to speak today, so I shall try to confine my remarks accordingly. However, I intend to take some time to give an overview of the problem, in the hope that that will leave hon. Members time to make their remarks in a more pointed way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para0">The Metrolink tram system is an on-road technology that can also run on heavy railtracks. The Greater Manchester passenger transport executive, which has responsibility for buses, trains and light rail systems&#151;trams&#151;across Greater Manchester, introduced a phase 1 line from Bury to Altrincham in 1991. That was followed by a phase 2 line from Manchester city centre to my constituency of Eccles in 1998. This successful and viable system has been acknowledged as a positive model for the rest of the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para1">Since the Government announced in July 2004 that phase 3 of the Metrolink was, in effect, being put on ice, there has been a flurry of meetings, campaigns, petitions, posters, videos and letters to the official broadly based &quot;Get our Metrolink back on track&quot; campaign, which is supported vociferously by the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>, the <i>Salford Advertiser </i>and other local media. On 23 September, a high-level delegation from Greater Manchester brought more than 41,500 messages of support for the campaign to be handed in at No. 10 Downing street.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para2">Ministers have been very willing to hear our representations. I thank the Minister who is here today, Tony McNulty, the Secretary of State for Transport, Alistair Darling, and the Prime Minister for meeting delegations of Greater Manchester MPs to explore ways in which we can move forward to secure the Metrolink investment that we all want. Following those meetings, the Department for Transport set up a working party with the Greater Manchester PTE. The Minister and Keith Bradley MP are involved in seeking a viable solution.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I must call hon. Members&#039; attention to the practice that we employ in these august surroundings. They should refer to colleagues by constituency rather than by name. I hope that hon. Members will follow the correct practice from now on.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew2"><b> Ian Stewart </b> : Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I was, of course, referring to my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley).

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para3">As I said, following the meetings, a working party was set up. I stress that the purpose of this debate, from my point of view, is to place the problem in context, not to try to take the place of the working party. However, I am clear that progress can and must be made in concluding a viable settlement, not only because of the overwhelming public support for the Metrolink in Greater Manchester, but because concluding such a settlement would be good value for money, environmentally sound and the sensible thing to do for the good of the conurbation and, indeed, the whole north-west.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para4">In my constituency, I recently held a &quot;big conversation&quot; meeting on the Metrolink, at which large and small businesses and voluntary organisations came together to express support for the Metrolink extensions. In Greater Manchester as a whole, the Manchester chamber of commerce, the Transport and General Workers Union, of which I am a proud member, and Unison are all firm supporters of Metrolink phase 3. At regional level, the North West regional assembly and CBI North West have come out firmly behind phase 3. Indeed, CBI North West did not pull its punches when it said in a letter to the Prime Minister that its members
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;do not overemphasise the point when they say that withdrawal of the Government&#039;s support for Metrolink is a hammer blow to the confidence and prospects of Northern England.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para5">Why is the rhetoric so strong and the passion so high? It could be argued that I do not have a direct interest in the matter, but I am delighted to say that Eccles and Salford were included in Metrolink phase 2. The Metrolink came to Eccles in 1998 and was opened by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. I would like to outline in the words of my constituents and other commentators why the Metrolink is so popular. Alan Coates, from Life Opportunities Ltd., says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We are a small organisation supporting people who have a disability in their own communities. The facility of having easily accessed transport from Eccles has greatly improved their opportunities for getting to other parts of their greater community. The promise of a much wider transport system held significant prospects for not only improved life experiences but also for a greater employment pool. In supporting people who have a disability we are also employers of some forty staff many of whom were previously unemployed. Salford still has numbers of people who are unemployed and a factor in them remaining so is access to efficient transport systems. Returning to work after being unemployed presents the individual with many challenges and availability of transport is often a deciding factor, this particularly so when the work is distant from their home e.g. to the airport.&quot;</p>

</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew3"><b> Andrew Bennett  (Denton and Reddish)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the great successes of Greater Manchester has been the airport, through the jobs created there and in the surrounding area? However, we now have a situation where between 8 and 9 o&#039;clock the vehicles using the motorways going south are slowed to a crawl because of the large number of people travelling to the airport. Is it not important that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 429WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
we have this link so that people can travel to the airport from the north of Manchester on the tram system, freeing up the motorways?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew4"><b> Ian Stewart </b> : My hon. Friend is an experienced Member, and he is absolutely right. I will come on to some comments from the airport managing director later that confirm the points made by my hon. Friend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para7">A letter from two of my constituents, Leslie and Angela Wiseman, reads:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Having been a resident of Eccles for the past 25 years and a regular user of public transport the Metrolink was the best thing that happened to Eccles. The system is fast, efficient and pollution free and it is a disappointment that it is not to be extended to other parts of Greater Manchester. Journeys such as to and from Manchester Airport by Metrolink would be quicker, cheaper and easier.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para8">Some of the small businesses in my constituency such as Smiths restaurant, an excellent restaurant in the centre of Eccles, have contacted me. Elaine McCann, Justin Critchley and David Hebden, who are partners in this business, wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;As partners in a small, but busy, restaurant in Eccles, we are in no doubt as to the amount of extra trade that the Metrolink brings to us and to other small businesses in the area. People coming into Eccles via the Metrolink are from not only our immediate neighbourhoods but also from more distant areas which can mean they&#039;re using more than one line and changing trams in order to get here. They seem more than happy to do this and an extension of the tram service can only mean that this, and other areas, will benefit from the injection of trade, business and works that such an extension would produce.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew5"><b> Tony Lloyd  (Manchester, Central)</b>  (Lab): I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend in his listing of every letter from his constituents, but I am tempted to ask him whether he has found anyone against the Metrolink in Greater Manchester. I wanted to make a point consistent with what he has just said. Would he say a few words about the regeneration impact of the metro and the importance of those lines going out from east Manchester to Ashton, in relation to the advanced plans for the regeneration of our conurbation and its economy?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew6"><b> Ian Stewart </b> : My hon. Friend is right, and he will hear me make some comment about the issues that he raises, but I shall leave the detail to my right hon. and hon. Friends from the constituencies concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para9">I will continue with a few more of the testimonies because it is right, as my hon. Friend has indicated, that every Member from Greater Manchester and beyond has a postbag that that could fill up the week&#039;s business of this place&#151;rather than an hour and a half in Westminster Hall&#151;in support of phase 3 of the Metrolink. Gerry Goodwin of Goodwin Machinery Ltd. writes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Business property and homes have been purchased on the new links designated and you cannot let them down. As a staunch car user myself&#151;when the South Manchester Line was started&#151;I have used it at least twice a week to travel to Manchester and Bury.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para10">John Spooner, the managing director of Manchester airport, writes:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Greater Manchester has been at the forefront of the delivery of integrated transport in a sustainable way . . . The existing Metrolink system has been a resounding success by any measure. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</ul>



<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 430WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>It has therefore been an integral part of our transport strategy for many years. We have moved from being just supporters of the scheme to reserving valuable land for its construction and, in the last few years, directly investing over &#163;60 million of our funds to build a new transport interchange. This involved over a million pounds in advance works and building a tunnel for the Metrolink extension . . . </p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We have been investing in education, skills and training in local communities in readiness for the access to work that would flow from the construction of the Metrolink extension.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para11">Geoff Muirhead CBE, who is the regional chairman of CBI in the north-west, is on record as stating:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Even taking into account these (additional) costs, I understand the scheme would still make a return on the investment required, even on the narrow basis used to assess its forecast performance. If the criteria were expanded to include benefits other than these related solely to transport, such as access to employment, social inclusion and enhanced land values, then the return on investment is vastly improved.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para12">There is one final testimony that exemplifies some of the hidden demerits of the cancellation of the scheme. My hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas), wrote to the Network Rail chief executive. I quote from the letter sent by the chief executive, John Armitt, in reply on 25 August 2004. He wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Thank you for your letter dated 3 2004 August detailing your concerns over the decision to cancel the Metrolink project for Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The decision by the Rt. Hon. Alistair Darling MP, Secretary of State for Transport, to reverse the planned changes for the Network Rail-managed infrastructure&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para13">that means the heavy rail infrastructure&#151;
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;has naturally affected the budgetary constraints placed upon us by the Office for Rail Regulation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Until the decision by the Secretary of State, Network Rail had proceeded on the understanding that the Oldham loop would cease to be part of the heavy rail network from May 2005 and had not allocated funding to maintain it beyond this date. However, because we are required to maintain the rail network in its existing size and condition, this requirement is likely to extend to the Oldham loop if it is not to become part of the Metrolink network.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The figure of &#163;60 million is the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive&#039;s own based on their own projected information. We do not concur that this figure is accurate and are currently undertaking our own detailed analysis of the various separate factors that would contribute to the cost of maintaining the Oldham loop as a heavy rail loop. These include: track condition&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para14">and so on. He continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Under the interim review of track access charges for the period 2004&#150;9, our agreement with the Office for Rail Regulation for funding would not have included the operation, maintenance and renewal of the Oldham loop.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para15">What I take from that correspondence is that the situation is not at a standstill. Even the figure of &#163;60    million projected by the PTA is, in my understanding, an underestimate. Therefore, if the Metrolink phase 3 does not go ahead, Network Rail will have to find more than &#163;60 million just to maintain the existing heavy rail route.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew7"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> : This is an important point. I say to my hon. Friend and, through him, to the Minister that it is important that we get clarification on the matter. The existing heavy rail, or the light rail that would replace it, is an essential part of the transport infrastructure going 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 431WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
out of the north of the city. The alternative to no Metrolink and no reinvestment in heavy rail is closure of that line. Will my hon. Friend make it absolutely clear that we need an answer about whether closure of the line is one possible outcome?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew8"><b> Ian Stewart </b> : Absolutely. My hon. Friend has, as always, pointed to the important issues, and I would call for an answer to those questions. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister will not be expected to answer today, but it is surely a matter for examination at a later stage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para16">We have anecdotal evidence of what Metrolink has achieved, but there is more rigorous evidence and analysis. In 2000, the Transport Sub-Committee of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee produced a report on light rapid transport systems and detailed their benefits. It said that Greater Manchester Metrolink offered an attractive alternative to the car and could thus help to limit congestion and to reduce pollution, particularly when used with other traffic restraint methods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para17">More recently, the National Audit Office report on light rail systems pointed to the significant benefits to passengers. Although it was not as positive about other systems, it stated that the Greater Manchester system was successful and viable. Back in the 1980s, the PTA made a detailed analysis of transport requirements and concluded that the light rail option was best. My constituency, which is on the north side of the conurbation, has certainly benefited from phase 2.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para18">Metrolink has, in the words of Greater Manchester PTA, been the cornerstone of Greater Manchester&#039;s public transport strategy for many years. Almost one fifth of the passengers using the first phase of Metrolink previously made their journey by car, and traffic volumes on the main radial routes into Manchester running parallel with the light rail system have fallen by between 2 and 8 per cent.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Keith Bradley  (Manchester, Withington)</b>  (Lab): Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the highest volumes of car traffic is in south Manchester running through my constituency? If the Chorlton to Didsbury spur were built, would the shifting of people out of their cars not have a dramatic impact on congestion and benefit the environment and people&#039;s health?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew10"><b> Ian Stewart </b> : I am sure that my right hon. Friend is correct. I said that the figures fell between 2 and 8 per cent., and although such changes may appear small in absolute terms, they have had a significant impact on congestion on the roads affected. Each year, the three existing Metrolink lines carry 19 million passengers and take 3.8 million car trips off our roads. It is expected that the new extensions in phase 3, to which my right hon. Friend has referred, together with the expanded capacity of phase 1, will attract 50 million passengers a year and replace a further 5 million car trips.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para19">My constituents have benefited from phase 2. Phase 3 is planned to serve a number of deprived areas with relatively high levels of unemployment in order to provide better access to potential places of work. It will boost regional competitiveness, assist the creation of sustainable communities and act as a catalyst for tens of thousands of new jobs. I am sure that my colleagues will elaborate on that in relation to their own constituencies.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 432WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para20">Some solutions considered by other areas include the further use of guided or unguided buses. Buses have an important part to play in an integrated transport system. I have argued for bus re-regulation outside London and made many attempts to debate that important issue in Westminster Hall, so I was pleased when the Government announced the introduction of new powers that would enable Greater Manchester PTA to set up a bus-franchising operation, which would decide routes, timetables and fares. I am confident that the PTA will take up that challenge, but it is not a solution that should preclude the phase 3 Metrolink option. It should be done in conjunction with that, not as an alternative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para21">The Government recognised that when my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced in March 2000 that &#163;250 million would be made available for the extension of Metrolink to Oldham, Rochdale, Manchester airport and Ashton-under-Lyne. As the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> campaigner of the day said, we then had our Metrolink for the millennium. All successive transport Ministers have been supportive of a phase 3 extension. At his speech to the CBI conference last year, the current Minister reported that the Government had more than doubled the funding available for local transport when he told the conference that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we&#039;ve agreed funding of up to &#163;520 million for the extension of the Manchester Metrolink.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para22">On the basis of those commitments, Greater Manchester PTA has invested &#163;200 million in buying and preparing land along the proposed routes of the three new lines. I acknowledge that the costs of the project have increased significantly because, it is argued, of high inflation in the construction sector and concerns about risks associated with light rail. When the Government made their announcement in July I acknowledged that costs could not continue to spiral, and although I was unhappy with his July statement I felt that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had left the door open for good, well-run metros such as Manchester to enter new negotiations and identify affordable extensions to their metro systems. I hope that the working party will do that, and find agreed solutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para23">I am pleased that the Secretary of State is on record as saying that the Government are still supportive of the concept of rapid light transport systems and that this is an issue of cost and value for money. The statement is important because it allows me, as the MP for Eccles, to follow the vision that I and others have had for many years. I can call for future extensions of the Metrolink to the Barton strategic economic zone, where we hope that the Salford Reds rugby league club will be successful in building its new proposed stadium, and then for it to cross the Manchester ship canal to the Trafford centre. That would open a new transport facility for my constituents, and would also bring welcome regeneration investment to build on the existing investment that the Government have made in the Irlam and Cadishead bypass. I thank the Minister and the Department for approving that project.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para24">I am sure that the Minister realises that the thrust of my contribution is that to make strategic sense, we need to come to an agreed solution on phase 3 so that we can then move on and grow a viable, value-for-money system in an integrated, appropriate and planned way.

<p><a name="41027h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. Mr. Speaker is always anxious that everyone who wishes to contribute to these debates be accommodated, and I share that view. However, our business is time limited, as hon. Members know, and this debate terminates at 11 o&#039;clock. I am required to call the first of the three Front-Bench spokesmen at 10.30, so we are left with 37 minutes for open debate. I see that four right hon. and hon. Members are seeking my eye, only three of whom have given prior notice. I appeal most earnestly to all of them to bear the time constraints in mind when making their speech, and when accepting or responding to interventions.

<a name="41027h01_time1"><h5>9.54 am</h5>


<p><a name="41027h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Graham Stringer  (Manchester, Blackley)</b>  (Lab): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) on securing this debate. I can think of no more important issue to have affected the people of Greater Manchester in my 30 years of political activity there. No single issue has got through to so many people, and angered them, in the way that did the Secretary of State&#039;s decision not to approve Metrolink on 20 July.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para25">I believe that that decision was fundamentally wrong, but I am extremely pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is present. He has the difficult task of sorting the matter out. I certainly welcome his involvement in the working party. I support the attitude that he has taken to this as a problem to be solved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para26">It is not my intention to try to negotiate or to interfere with the negotiations in this debate. The debate is an important opportunity to go through the issues and to wish the working party success, but also to say in a non-minatory way that if the working party is not successful, the issue will not go away. The people of Greater Manchester, the local authorities there, the passenger transport authority, and beyond that, people in the north-west of England, will not let it go away.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para27">My hon. Friend the Minister has a particularly difficult job because the Department, over the past year or two years, has not been as proactive as it could be. I am still concerned that when the costs of phase 3 of Metrolink escalated, from February 2004 until the statements on 20 July and indeed until meetings in September this year, there was no real activity from the Department to say, &quot;Well, we know the figures are going up. They are going up for a number of reasons. How do we get this show back on the road?&quot;. The Department has viewed the future of Metrolink as a spectator sport, but it is not. It is vital that it happens and that the working party makes it happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para28">I could spend as long as you would let me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, going through the history of this matter, but I do not want to do that. However, I want to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 434WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
put things in perspective. I am concerned that it makes the Minister&#039;s job more difficult when officials are saying that Ministers have &quot;serious reservations&quot; about light rail, at a time when the Minister and the Secretary of State are saying quite different things in public. That sort of thing undermines the process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para29">That is wholly consistent with the attitude that officials have taken to light rail in front of the Transport Committee. If the Minister would care to read question 54 in the record of the Transport Committee of 10 September last year, he will find that the Committee expressed extreme concern that officials from the Department were pressurising officials from the highways authority in Manchester and the PTA to invest in deregulated buses in direct competition to Metrolink along Cheetham Hill road and other parts of the Greater Manchester conurbation. That is not something that we would have expected from a Department that was seriously supportive of light rail. The Committee was also shocked to hear officials misrepresent statistics on the failure&#151;they were pretending that it was a success&#151;of deregulated buses in Greater Manchester and other conurbations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para30">When one is looking for alternatives to Metrolink&#151;we are not, but if the Department is&#151;a simple exercise in arithmetic will show that there simply is not the capacity in any feasible strategy to allow the numbers of passengers to be brought into the centre of Manchester and to other parts of the conurbation by bus. I do not like to quote the last Prime Minister but one, but there is no alternative to Metrolink if we want to move passengers round the Greater Manchester conurbation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para31">As the costs have escalated, black propaganda has been spread that the PTA was gold-plating phase 3 of Metrolink. I know of no gold-plating. The reasons for the costs of Metrolink rising are no great mystery. The world price of steel has risen and a lot of steel would be used in phase 3&#151;that is not changeable. The cost of engineering work has risen because there is so much demand due to the success of the Government&#039;s economic policies. The businesses of light and heavy rail have become extremely risk averse, partly because of the fiasco surrounding the failure of Railtrack and the inception of Network Rail. Banks that fund light and heavy rail will no longer accept the risk. That is probably the largest factor in the increase of the costs of Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para32">There is no great mystery or evidence of gold-plating. If we want to get Metrolink back on track, the Government must accept the costs, as I hope they will because we cannot will them away. Changing the procurement method, as has been suggested on the Floor of the House, would not deliver what we want because re-tendering under a new process would effectively put Metrolink back three years. I remind right hon. and hon. Members that the procurement method of design, build and operate is supported and demanded by Government. It has never been favoured by the passenger transport authority or the passenger transport executive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para33">As far back as 1986&#150;87, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, the then Under-Secretary of State for Transport, insisted, and it has been consistent Government policy since, on the method of design, build and operate, even though surveys, studies and independent consultants all showed that it was the most 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
expensive option. That has always been the case, so it is not good enough for Government to say that they will consider different procurement methods. There is no mystery about why costs have risen; it is easily understood. The important thing is to find a way of working the finances so that the tram system gets back on track.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para34">I shall finish with two final points. First, it is believed in Greater Manchester that the decision is symptomatic of a Government who do not understand the north-south divide. I agree with that, but I know that my hon. Friend the Minister of State does not. Let me put it in context. On the same day that Metrolink phase 3 was not approved, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport announced &#163;2.9 billion extra funding for transport in London. That enabled Ken Livingstone to say to the Transport Committee that his real problem as Mayor of London was not a slight gap in the budget because of fewer cars paying the congestion charge, but that he could not spend the money that the Treasury gave him as fast as it gave it to him. No mayor or leader of a council anywhere else in the country could say that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para35">On that same day, as well as the &#163;2.9 billion extra funding, it was agreed that &#163;340 million would go towards the London Olympic bid. I wrote to the Minister of State and he wrote back on 6 September. I asked whether London would get that money if it does not win the Olympic bid and what sort of assessment has been made of the projects. The answer was that no assessment has been made because it is not known what transport projects will be paid for from that &#163;340 million. There was no answer to whether London would keep the money if it does not win the bid to host the 2012 Olympic games. That is why I believe that the decision is an aspect of the north-south divide. The people of Greater Manchester are right to see it as such and the Government would be sensible to pay attention to them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para36">Finally, it is not just a case of saying that the Government got one decision wrong among the many that they get right. The decision is fundamental to the regional competitiveness of Manchester, Greater Manchester and the north-west. Most of the documents coming out of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister rightly make that point. If we want to do something about the north-south divide, there must be investment to make the north, the north-west and Manchester more competitive. This decision will make the area less competitive and will lead to the Government&#039;s failure to fulfil their commitment to reduce the difference between rates of growth in the north and the south of England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para37">One could say the same about housing market renewal projects in Oldham, in my constituency and elsewhere that are close to tramlines. The areas in which efforts will be made to put right the market failure have been determined partly by the availability of Metrolink, as have several investment decisions such as the north Manchester business park in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para38">The Government believe in joined-up government, but this is not a joined-up decision. It is vital to the environment and to the transport and economic strategies of Greater Manchester that my hon. Friend

</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. There are 23 minutes remaining and three Members wish to speak before Front-Bench Members respond. I call Mr. Michael Meacher.
</p>



<a name="41027h01_time2"><h5>10.7 am</h5>


<p><a name="41027h01_spnew16"><b> Mr. Michael Meacher  (Oldham, West and Royton)</b>  (Lab): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall be brief. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) on securing a debate on this subject, which is of huge importance to the Manchester region and to north-west Members. Like my colleagues, I would also say that, in my experience, no other issue in recent times has caused such widespread and spontaneous bewilderment and anger as the announcement of the Government&#039;s decision not to go ahead with stage 3 of Metrolink. There are good reasons for that response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para39">Metrolink is the lynchpin in my constituency and in that of the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons of the housing market renewal pathfinder, which is an enormous &#163;2.5 billion public-private investment in housing and community development throughout the Oldham-Rochdale area during the next 10 to 15 years. Metrolink is the trigger for several nodes of development across my constituency and the areas of Hollinwood, Derker and Werneth in Oldham. It is part of the recent urban vision for Oldham following the riots three years ago. Metrolink is regarded as a key factor in the renewal of our town.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para40">It is also true that &#163;200 million has already been spent on development and preparation for Metrolink, including the corridor between Manchester and Oldham. Many businesses have already made investment decisions based on the availability of the tram network. It is fair to say that the Manchester city region is the principal economic driver in the north of England and a major contributor to the national economy. Much of that is dependent on Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para41">We have already heard and are very well aware of the Government&#039;s reason for taking the decision; namely, affordability. Of course we are pleased that a working party is now examining alternative procurement options. We cannot presume the outcome, but the Government and my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) are keen to see a solution to the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para42">As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer) indicated, the decision is not in any way limited to the issue of Metrolink. The escalation of costs has also been felt by other light rail systems. Crossrail in London and various road schemes have exhibited similar cost increases. That is due to a wide range of factors, but a key one is the increasing level of risk aversion on the part of the private sector. Developers are seeking to offload the risk factor of passenger numbers not reaching predicted levels on to the public purse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para43">One understands the Government&#039;s concern about that, but the problem is caused by the PFI structure. If my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington wants to get the costs down not only to the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 437WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
&#163;530 million to which they rose, but even lower, how far is that compatible with a PFI structure? The Government sought a way to resolve the problem in the case of London Underground by making a grant on a sufficient scale to reduce the escalation of costs for private developers. I think that I am right in saying that it has been decided to expend &#163;12 billion on Crossrail, largely out of the public purse, which avoids the problem that we are saddled with in relation to Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para44">Metrolink is, and has been for many years, the cornerstone of Manchester&#039;s public transport strategy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley rightly said, there is no alternative. It was never an end in itself or purely about transport schemes. It was designed to complement and to add value to a host of urban regeneration strategies. Certainly costs have risen significantly, but Metrolink is the most cost-effective way of achieving greater modal shift, increasing public transport use, reducing future congestion and delivering far-reaching economic and social benefits by its integration both with other public transport services and wider regeneration strategies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para45">Metrolink has been held up by the Government themselves as an exemplar system. It is certainly the most cost-effective and best of the light rail systems. It was recently given a clean bill of health by the National Audit Office report. Moreover, from the environmental point of view that I am anxious to stress, the three existing Metrolink lines already carry 19 million passengers and take nearly 4 million car trips off our roads. That contributes significantly to air quality in Greater Manchester. We believe that the future system, including the expanded capacity on phase 1, will attract about 50 million passengers a year and replace a further 5 million car trips.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para46">Metrolink is a system for which there is no clear better-cost alternative. I beg my hon. Friend the Minister to find a solution to this problem through the revised procurement costs that are now being proposed by the working party. The Government&#039;s political credibility in the north-west is at risk here because, quite rightly, both my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have indicated in the past their strong commitment to the area and to Metrolink as a central hinge for the future of the north-west.

running for 13 years in Rochdale. My husband was a landlord on Drake street when the plans first appeared 13 years ago. Those plans have been in the consciousness of the people of Rochdale over the past 13 years, and they have planned their businesses and huge development programmes around them. I therefore cannot impress on the Minister enough the shock of the decision to the body politic of the people of Rochdale&#151;not just to the professionals but ordinary people. That could be seen in the swift response that I received within hours of the announcement being made in July. I received e-mails from all over the world, from Rochdalians holidaying and working abroad, expressing their shock, disgust and dismay at the decision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para48">Not one of us pretends that the costs, which had risen from about &#163;200 million to &#163;900 million, were sustainable. To pretend that some of us think that if we exert enough pressure we will get the &#163;900 million, is to be disingenuous and to misrepresent us. We all realise that the costs must be examined. However, we were saddened by the way in which the announcement was made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para49">The announcement was not expected. I have observed the situation during the seven years of my parliamentary life, and every time that there was a slight wobble we negotiated with Ministers to ensure that anything that needed to be done was done to ensure that we were still on track for phase 3 of Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para50">Hon. Members who spoke earlier indicated how successful Metrolink has been to date. The National Audit Office has also put on record how successful it has been. I cannot stress enough the importance of Metrolink in terms of the regeneration of places such as Rochdale. Over the past three or four years, I have chaired regeneration meetings at which we have discussed the design specifications received from the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority. Those specifications would allow local businesses to reinvest in their shopfronts to ensure that they are compatible with the design specifications for the preferred bidder for the development of Metrolink in Drake street. Millions of pounds of Government money have already been spent in the Drake street corridor and in other areas in other constituencies but, more importantly, thousands of pounds of individual business people&#039;s money has been spent. Those business people have made decisions about their entire livelihood and their future investment based on the collective promises made by Labour MPs and the Labour Government about Metrolink. I believe that we are honour-bound to find a solution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para51">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is an honest broker in such matters, and I cannot praise him enough for the role that he and others have played in the working party in trying to find a solution. We must find a solution because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) stated, there are hundreds of millions of pounds of Government money for housing market renewal and for the regeneration of our town centres, such as the area around Kingsway, that depend on Metrolink. Our constituencies contain some of the poorest places in Britain&#151;not just in Greater Manchester and the north-west, but in Britain&#151;and the importance of the big bang to that regeneration cannot be overestimated.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 439WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para52">At any stage we could have separated off into the various wings of Oldham and Rochdale, Ashton and the south, but it is crucial to ensure that the economic regeneration that is linked to the airport and the growth engine of the south of Manchester reaches the north through the centre. There are organisations in Manchester such as Knowledge Capital and Incubator Research in the World&#151;at the biggest university in Europe. The effect of such organisations must be felt in constituencies such as mine, otherwise the regeneration money that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is deploying in Rochdale will not find its true value.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para53">I therefore plead with the Minister to examine the matter in terms of the full cost of every pound of Government money. If we are analysing cost-effectiveness, how is the Minister&#039;s decision cost-effective in relation to the hundreds of millions of pounds of regeneration money being spent in Oldham, Rochdale and north Manchester? It is not cost-effective. It flies in the face of common sense. I hope that things are going in the right direction, but the clock is ticking. I beg that we do not try to approach this matter in a piecemeal manner, and that we realise that Metrolink makes good economic, environmental and social sense as well as being good government.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para54">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) on securing the debate. As other hon. Members have said, there is no issue of greater   importance to our constituents than this, as has    been demonstrated by the words&#151;&quot;shock&quot;, &quot;disappointment&quot; and &quot;anger&quot;&#151;that they have used when expressing their concerns to us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para55">The debate is timely, although I can understand it if my hon. Friend the Minister does not agree, as he is in the middle of complex and difficult discussions with officials and the passenger transport authority. However, it is vital that our constituents know that everything possible is being done to resolve the impasse. Privately, I know that a lot of work is going on to achieve that, but I am not sure that the public fully understand it. We have a chance today to demonstrate that the process is moving forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para56">I endorse the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Mrs. Fitzsimons) that the proposals are a package, which should hang together as a big bang. Inevitably, we will talk about the parts of the line that we know best, but, uniquely, my constituency contains two Metrolink lines&#151;the line through Failsworth and Hollinwood to Oldham and the line from east Manchester to Droylsden and Ashton, and I will speak about both of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para57">Failsworth town centre is desperately in need of regeneration. Recently a major shopping centre deal was secured in expectation of Metrolink arriving soon. Hollinwood sits in the centre of a site at junction 22 on the M60 Manchester outer ring road. It is an important brownfield redevelopment site&#151;the largest single development site in Oldham&#151;and it has been marketed with the aim of its becoming a major job-creation location. The Metrolink station was rebuilt at great cost several years ago in anticipation of these developments.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 440WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para58">Hollinwood and Failsworth are within the housing market renewal area, a multi-million pound Government investment, to which my hon. Friends have referred. It looked like a nice bit of joined-up Government thinking that the housing market renewal area was to be designed around a Metrolink transport artery, and it is impossible to understand why that should now be put at risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para59">On the Ashton line, Droylsden town centre is similar to Failsworth in that there are major plans for canal-side redevelopment there, with shops, hotels, offices and houses, and a deal was recently secured with a developer in the expectation that Metrolink would be a key driver for that town centre development. For much of the day, Droylsden is choked with traffic because of the inadequate road network and the poor public transport system. Ashton Moss is one of the north-west&#039;s major economic development sites; thousands of jobs are anticipated at that brownfield site and Metrolink would run through it. It is next to St. Peter&#039;s in Ashton, which is in the top 1 per cent. of the most deprived wards in the UK. The Ashton renewal team is doing tremendous work in dealing with the issues there, and they are centred around expectations in respect of Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para60">The town centre of Ashton is the terminus of the line and the town is fighting to cash in on the benefits of the opening of the M60 four years ago; large office and retail expansions are planned there and the town is battling to recover from the blow of the recent disastrous loss of its historic market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para61">Tarnside&#039;s economic development anticipates and depends on Metrolink as the core transport facility at the heart of a proper integrated transport system. The Metrolink to Ashton would carry more than 6 million passengers a year, and would save 2 million car journeys. An enormous amount of advance work has already been carried out, and that is what has most shocked my constituents. Ian Spencer, the head teacher of St. Mary&#039;s school in Droylsden, admitted to being completely baffled by the announcement. He spent three years in chaos, working out of temporary classrooms while the old school was demolished and rebuilt nearby to clear the way for the Metrolink station in Droylsden. He cannot understand the logic of what is happening, and I find it extremely difficult to explain it to him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para62">It was a moving event when the &quot;Save Metrolink&quot; campaign visited the school and the pupils&#151;eight, nine and 10-year-old children&#151;came out to the front of the school and made a tremendous noise, cheering and singing, in favour of Metrolink. They really made the point, and if young children can understand why it is vital to their future, it should be easy for that message to go to the people who must take some of the key decisions that will determine the future quality of those children&#039;s lives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para63">Many good residential properties have been demolished along the line of the Ashton link through Droylsden and Audenshaw. We have built a new bridge for Metrolink over the railway near Ashton and an expensive bridge over the motorway to accommodate Metrolink lines at Ashton Moss, which is wider than would otherwise have been necessary. We have demolished industrial premises in the town centre of Ashton. Saddest of all was the demolition of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 441WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Wellington road flats in Ashton town centre, which were cleared to make way for the Ashton town centre Metrolink terminus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para64">There was a long campaign by the residents of those flats to avoid demolition. Their spokesperson, Maureen Consiglio, organised an effective campaign which resulted in them being moved, en bloc, into a redeveloped block of flats, which was funded from the proposed Metrolink investment. Those elderly people now stand and look at the site where their previous homes were and which are now just a heap of bricks and rubble. They are baffled as to why their lives have suffered such upheaval and disruption to make way for something that just is not going to happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para65">There has been support for the campaign throughout Greater Manchester and in my constituency from business, the press and the community and voluntary sectors, but mostly from local individuals. All that they have in common is the feeling that the proposals just do not make sense. On the Ashton line, all the advance work has been done and only the rails and lines need to be installed. All Tameside needs is the track.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para66">At Hollinwood and Failsworth the situation is even more bizarre. The line to Oldham and Rochdale has rails and all it needs is the wires. The people of Ashton, Droylsden, Hollinwood and Failsworth have seen that Metrolink works. They want some of the action that has transformed the economies of towns such as Bury and Altrincham. That is what they were promised and that is what the working party is charged with doing: finding a way to make it happen. With hard work, good will and the wisdom and determination of the Minister and his team, I am confident that a solution can be found and that we will get Metrolink back on track.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para67">Anyone who tours Greater Manchester will see the piles of rubble, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Heyes) referred, where preparations for Metrolink have begun and, in some cases, been completed. A lot of public money has been invested in the scheme and it would be bizarre to people in Greater Manchester if the scheme did not come to fruition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para68">My hon. Friend the Minister has a deserved reputation for political toughness and earned respect when he said of Metrolink, &quot;Not at that price.&quot; Most Labour Members understand that. Very few of us would argue that the public of Greater Manchester or the taxpayer generally should pay over the odds to those who will make money at public expense. A cheaper, more efficient scheme is in everyone&#039;s interest, but the Minister must take on board the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) about the concept of risk. Quite frankly, the financing scheme that central Government imposed on Greater Manchester 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 442WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
was not the right one. It transferred risk from the private sector, which conventionally bears risk, to the public sector. We, the public, will end up paying for the risk that the private sector cannot manage. In this day and age that is a ridiculous way to finance a project such as Metrolink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para69">The challenge is this. The Minister&#039;s reputation for toughness is real and deserved. He is a good politician. He must be tough with those in his Department who have come up with this misguided scheme, and he must introduce a better structure for the financing of Metrolink which allows us to deliver the scheme, which is long overdue in environmental, social and regeneration terms, in a financially efficient manner.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para70">I conclude by reminding hon. Members that we hoped that Metrolink would run to the new stadium for the Commonwealth games. That did not happen, and two years on we are still waiting for even just the preparation. It is long overdue.

Hazel Grove is the south-east corner of Greater Manchester, and although we are not direct beneficiaries of any of the three lines, my constituents are as dismayed by the cancellation of phase 3 as those of the hon. Members who have spoken so far. There is anger and bafflement, and many of my constituents are looking for answers. They want reassurance that there will be a Government transport policy for Greater Manchester and that we will not just be left with the ruins that we seem to have at the moment.

All of us believe that the scheme is right for the benefit not just of the immediate corridors that have been referred to, but of Greater Manchester as a whole and beyond. It is good that we can work together despite the fact that the hon. Gentlemen and I have often had cause to be upset with each other because we share a political community and have points of disagreement.

The cross-party consensus is welcome.

<p><a name="41027h01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Stunell </b> : I thank the hon. Lady for that, and very much apologise for my inadvertently sexist remark.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para72">Phase 3 covers three different routes, which are each important in different ways. Voices have been raised in support of the loop through Oldham and Rochdale, which has been referred to, while the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Heyes) has made a good case for the Ashton line. The third route is out to the airport, which is of particular importance to my constituents. The airport has a strategy of getting 25 per cent. of its 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 443WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
visitors to arrive by public transport. Each day, thousands of workers go to the airport site, and over the year millions of passengers take flights from there. My constituency is on the &quot;flight path&quot; of many of those going to the airport along the ground, so the pollution, congestion and environmental disbenefits of surface transport to the airport are very much in their minds. My constituency straddles key radial routes out of Manchester to the south, including the A6 in particular.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para73">The surface transport plan to the airport is of great importance to us, but I suggest that it should also be of great importance to the Government. The airport strategy documents that they published this year point out the significance of Manchester airport as an economic hub for the north-west and detail their plans for it to become yet more significant in the next 25 years. Crucial to that is sorting out the surface transport arrangements, and crucial to sorting out those arrangements will be a tram link to the rest of the conurbation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para74">A second part of the Government&#039;s so-called integrated transport policy is important in this context: the south-east Manchester multi-modal study, commonly referred to as SEMMMS. That is a plan to reduce traffic, improve public transport, enhance cycle and pedestrian routes and complete the local road network. A crucial part of that is the capacity to extend the tram beyond the existing proposals for phase 3 to Stockport town centre, and ultimately to Bredbury, Romiley and Rose Hill. If the SEMMMS integrated transport plan is still part of the Government&#039;s strategy, I urge them to take that into account when they consider what to do about the tram routes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para75">Many of my constituents saw the Secretary of State&#039;s July statement as much more than a setback&#151;they saw it as an outrage. I had a flood of unsolicited letters from my constituents despite the fact that they know that the tram will not reach them in phase 3. Many residents have signed petitions in local libraries and taken part in campaigns run by local newspapers such as the <i>Stockport Express</i> and the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>. Stockport council has unanimously called for the tram to be restored, citing environmental and economic grounds for doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para76">I have written to the Secretary of State three times in the past 10 weeks and I raised the issue in the House on 13 September. I have not had an answer to any of the letters I have written to the Secretary of State so far, and I might have considered myself unlucky, except that I have a letter from a constituent of mine who did get a reply. He wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;I think that he thought he was writing to the boss&#151;saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I sent a letter to Alistair Darling concerning the cancellation of Metrolink and also concerning the apparent South East England bias of the current administration. I received two identical replies from a Department of Transport civil servant . . . obviously standard replies being sent to all who questioned Mr. Darling&#039;s appalling decision.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para77">That sums up neatly the concerns of my constituents. They feel that they have been treated with disdain and it appears that the Government have no clear strategy or focus for supporting us in the north-west.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para78">Will the Minister confirm that the decision on the funding of Metrolink phase 3 has not changed the Government&#039;s commitment to implement the full recommendations of the SEMMMS report, which was 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 444WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
previously accepted by the Secretary of State? That is vital in my constituency and throughout south-east Greater Manchester. Will the Minister give details to the House of his timetable for introducing the review of costings that has been referred to? It is quite a skilful sleight of hand to substitute a review of costings for the original announcement, which most of us understood would be of cancellation. It is a welcome sleight of hand&#151;we do not have a problem with it&#151;but what is the timetable for introducing clear plans for reactivating all three routes in phase 3?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para79">Does the Minister acknowledge the displaced costs? Reference has been made to the Oldham loop and the &#163;60 million or more that will have to come from other budgets. That is not the whole matter; the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne raised the question of money spent on that corridor, and the airport has also built its tunnel and invested in works there. Does the Minister understand the displaced costs that will have to come from the public purse because of the abandonment of the schemes?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para80">Will the Minister announce that he will answer the pleas of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members from Greater Manchester to restore those vital schemes to the spending programme? Metrolink has already proved to be that rare thing, a successful public transport innovation. Its expansion and development is crucial for regeneration, the economy and the environment, both locally and in setting an example for the rest of the country. Manchester, Rochdale, Oldham, Tameside and the borough of Stockport stand to gain from the reactivation of the schemes, but the benefits will be felt much more widely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para81">The phase 3 scheme has the support of business leaders, the public, MPs and councillors of all parties. It has been commended by the Government&#039;s transport consultants, it underpins the SEMMMS strategy and I urge the Minister to throw his weight and voice behind its restoration as soon as possible.

<a name="41027h01_time7"><h5>10.39 am</h5>


<p><a name="41027h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Greg Knight  (East Yorkshire)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) on securing this important debate. He has been a consistent campaigner on behalf of his constituents on the issue, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who unfortunately cannot be with us today. I am well aware of the strong support for the future of Metrolink in Manchester and beyond. I attended a function organised by the Association of Conservative Clubs recently, when I was approached by Mr. Stephen Day, who used to be a colleague of ours representing Cheadle. He told me of his strong support for the extension.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para82">In recent years, Manchester has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence, based partly on the hard work of its people, and partly&#151;I like to think&#151;on the economic framework put in place by the previous Conservative Government. It is fair to say that the Metrolink system has played a key part in that regeneration, helping to encourage firms to invest in the city. It is clearly a sign of how important the extension of Metrolink is that the Manchester chamber of commerce, supported by the CBI, the Institute of Directors and pro.manchester is co-ordinating a campaign to get Metrolink back on track.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para83">It is no wonder that those organisations want to be involved when it is estimated that some 6,300 jobs will be created by the project. As part of its &quot;back on track&quot; campaign, the chamber of commerce is encouraging members of the public to express their opinions on its website, and the following comment posted there succinctly expresses the views of the majority of local residents:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Getting the next phase of the Metrolink back on track is . . . essential, not only from a local business point of view but also in developing further the massive tourism potential in the region, which is simply being put on hold by this action&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para84">As the hon. Member for Eccles said in his opening remarks, the campaign has gathered more than 40,000 signatures, which is a clear expression of how important the project is to Manchester.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para85">The Secretary of State for Transport has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Manchester&#039;s metro has been extremely successful&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para86">and recognised:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Light rail can be very effective in persuading people to use public transport&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para87">which is one of the Government&#039;s stated transport aims. Indeed, the Government&#039;s &quot;Future of Transport&quot; White Paper states that they want
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;to support and encourage local and regional transport strategies to tackle congestion in towns and cities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para88">Local transport policies are vital, because if we do not get local public transport solutions right, an increasing number of people will take to their cars in despair, adding to the congestion from which we all already suffer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para89">The Deputy Prime Minister more than six years ago famously said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I will have failed if in five years time there are not fewer journeys by car.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para90">The 10-year plan promised a 5 per cent. reduction in inter-urban congestion, and an 8 per cent. reduction in large urban areas. Unfortunately, the result has been a predicted increase in journey times of 30 per cent. by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para91">How will axing schemes such as the Manchester Metrolink extension improve those figures? The Deputy Prime Minister, who travelled to Manchester in 2000, said while there:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am delighted to come to say I am making this announcement that the Manchester Metrolink extensions can go ahead.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para92">The benefits were very clear to him at that time; he told the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is very much about an integrated transport system and Manchester has led the way. I&#039;ve always been impressed by the development of Metrolink. It has encouraged people to use their cars less and public transport more. It&#039;s about the quality of life and about achieving our environmental objectives.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para93">It is not often that I can say I agree with the Deputy Prime Minister, but on this occasion I do. It is strange that under the same Government&#151;but two Secretaries of State for Transport later&#151;the current Secretary of State does not agree with the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s remarks. The Government&#039;s original plans were in no doubt: the Deputy Prime Minister said that he wanted to make Metrolink &quot;the envy of Europe&quot;, and promised that there would be no strings attached to the promised

funding. Is it surprising if the people of Manchester and some of their elected representatives now feel angry about the Government&#039;s perceived U-turn?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para94">In its report, the National Audit Office highlights the real benefits that light rail schemes can provide to communities. The Manchester Metrolink is highlighted as one scheme that has
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;brought significant benefits to passengers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para95">In fairness, the report also highlights valid concerns, which the Secretary of State referred to in justifying his announcement that he intended to scrap several schemes. The NAO report goes on to highlight problems with integration, which is rather damning for a Government who have made so much about integrated transport systems. It also highlights problems with through-ticketing and the time it takes to put schemes in place once they have been approved. However, the main problem identified by the report was financial. For those schemes to be successful, they must be financially viable and value for money. The NAO highlighted reasons for the costs having escalated, citing lack of standardisation, the adoption of heavy rail specifications and safety arrangements and barriers to the adoption of new rail technologies. The report guides us on how to reduce costs and achieve greater value for money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para96">Reducing the costs of a project and improving value for money is part of the key to the way forward. I have been impressed with the way that GMPTE has put forward serious ideas, such as the proposal to increase the length of leases for equipment in order to reduce annual costs. It is an important plan to improve the quality of life for local people, as correctly stated in 2000 by the Deputy Prime Minister and repeated today by all who have taken part in the debate. It is a unique occasion when every speaker takes the view that the Government have got it wrong, and they ought to reconsider the decision that they have announced. Not one speaker has supported Government policy on this issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para97">I am happy to make it clear that I am a supporter of the scheme. My party supports the scheme and a future Conservative Government would consider more imaginative ways of funding the extension of Metrolink, as we would with other infrastructure projects.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew24"><b> Ian Stewart </b> : The right hon. Gentleman has hit on an important point about suggested funding options. Will he explain exactly what his party would do?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Knight </b> : I am in discussions with my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will be making a policy announcement on this issue before the next general election. However, I cannot reschedule my party&#039;s policy announcements to suit this debate, as much as I would like to do so. We will make an announcement shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para98">My party would end the constant stop-start nature of major transport infrastructure projects. Too often, a project makes slow progress through the planning system only to be delayed indefinitely because the finances of the Government of the day do not permit large blocks of extra expenditure.
</p>


<p>

doubt about the future of the Manchester Metrolink extension, so I hope that the Minister in his winding-up speech will be positive and say that he has a solution that recognises the importance of the project to Manchester and the whole region. If he does not, he and the Government will be letting down the people of Manchester.
</p>



<a name="41027h01_time8"><h5>10.48 am</h5>


<p><a name="41027h01_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Mr. Tony McNulty) </b> : I say at the outset, as ever in these debates, that I will come back to the facile contributions from the Opposition Front Benches and concentrate as much of the time as I can on the serious issues raised by my colleagues. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) on convening the debate. I do not necessarily agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Heyes) about its timeliness or otherwise, but I appreciate from all colleagues that, unlike the previous contribution, there will be no detailed debate now on the deal or the way forward. It would simply be inappropriate, given where we are with the working party, to which I will return.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para100">I also congratulate all Labour colleagues from Manchester on the campaign, which I fully understand. I have met a range of colleagues from Manchester since the decision, not least at the Labour party conference, where I met delegates and MPs and attended both of GMPTE&#039;s fringe meetings. I have no desire to read the <i>Manchester Evening News, </i>the<i> Rochdale Express or </i>the <i>Bury Times,</i> or to spoil my colleagues&#039; Sunday meals by turning up on BBC North West with alarming regularity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para101">At the fringe meeting of the Labour party conference organised by GMPTE, I said that all of the key facts made&#151;about regeneration, about the integrated nature of Metrolink and about the real wins that Metrolink extensions would mean for each and every community in Manchester, not simply those served by the three extensions&#151;are without doubt. It is no surprise, and I fully endorse it, that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister launched a document called &quot;The Northern Way&quot; a few weeks ago. At its heart, that document says that Metrolink and its extensions are integral to the regeneration of Manchester. They are but I repeat what I said then&#151;not that project, not at those prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para102">That is the entirely disingenuous and fatuous bit of the argument of both Opposition Front Benches. We did not hear a word about cost from the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell)&#151;absolutely nothing. It was not even a major concern&#151;we should just get on with it, he said. Go back to the last &quot;shadow Budget&quot;, as it is laughingly called, and check whether it contains any more for transport this year: no. Last year: no. Successive previous years: no. It is easy to sit on the sideline as a minor third party and say, &quot;Spend, spend, spend, spend, spend.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para103">To the extent that there was any substance to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments, he dwelt on the airport link. For the purposes of the &#163;900 million package&#151;for want of a shorthand term for it&#151;GMPTE deferred that link 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 448WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
in December 2003. The link that the hon. Gentleman dwelt on is not even on the table in the package before us. It is not on the immediate agenda at all. The hon. Gentleman&#039;s contribution was very disappointing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para104">The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr.   Knight) can talk eloquently about what a future Conservative Government will do. No future Conservative Government would, in any circumstances, consider a project that started at &#163;282 million and topped off at &#163;1 billion barely two years later and say, &quot;No worries, we&#039;ll do it anyway.&quot; They simply would not do that and he knows it. So we will take his rhetoric, and that of his solo colleague in the Greater Manchester area, the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), with a huge pinch of salt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para105">The comments made by my hon. Friends are well made. I need to challenge some of them but I want to address several of them in substance. I start with the odd red herring. That is not a football comment&#151;red herring is a common phrase. What John Armitt&#151;the chief executive of Network Rail&#151;said was that if the Oldham to Rochdale link does not go forward as part of the regeneration, Network Rail has obligations under its contract with the Office of Rail Regulation to sustain, maintain and develop the Oldham link in the line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para106">The notion that it is eking a concession out of me to say that, if the Oldham to Rochdale link does not happen, Network Rail will have to sustain the line is a complete red herring. If that link does not happen&#151;we are not at that point, but I will return to our general approach shortly&#151;Network Rail&#039;s obligations will remain its obligations while the link is part of the heavy rail network.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew26"><b> Tony Lloyd </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. McNulty </b> : I will not until I have made some progress, because plenty of colleagues made other important points. They are all important, and I want to address some of the others, but I may give way shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para107">At this stage at least, I cannot endorse the enthusiasm of my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) not simply to get over these extensions but to bung in a few more&#151;to Trafford Park, to the Manchester ship canal and so on. I understand the aspiration but let us do what we need to do now first.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para108">I must challenge my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Stringer) on the notion that, in the past year or so, the matter has become a spectator sport. One of the first things that I did after joining the Department a year or so ago was meet the Manchester authorities and say, &quot;Ok, your &#163;282 million can go up to &#163;520 million, but that&#039;s your absolute lot. It&#039;s capped and let&#039;s see what we can do with it.&quot; So, we almost doubled the costs. It was not a spectator sport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para109">Subsequent to that, there was a series of revisions, all starting from the premise of &#163;520 million being the cash cap and any number of additions, all the way up to the latest ones of &#163;500 million-plus annual payments. Those are, again, virtually double what we originally planned. In the year and a half that I have been in the Department, it has not been a spectator sport. I do not accept that for a moment. It is not enough for hon. Members, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, to say, &quot;It ain&#039;t gold-plated.&quot; We 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 449WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
know that it is not gold-plated, but we need to drill down and consider the costs. People cannot say, &quot;Well, it&#039;s simple. Just accept the costs. That will be fine&quot;, because the costs are integral to what we are discussing. It may be said that any examination will not get to the bottom of what is going on in respect of costs, but my hon. Friend will know that any number of ideas are being thrown around now. If we believe the BBC, &#163;300 million is suddenly going to be knocked off. If it is that easy to knock &#163;300 million off, it must be worth further study.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para110">Incidentally&#151;I do not want to dwell on this&#151;my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport did not give London &#163;3 billion; he gave London &#163;3 billion-worth of credit, so that Londoners could pay for London&#039;s infrastructure improvements. Ken Livingstone has gone for retail price index plus 10 per cent. on bus fares in the first instance. There is much more to come. It is slightly disingenuous to say that the Government are shutting the Manchester Metrolink but saying, &quot;Here&#039;s &#163;3 billion for London.&quot; That is not the case, and my hon. Friend knows it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para111">I shall not dwell on the north-south divide. As my hon. Friend said clearly, I do not agree about that. Nor do I believe that the Government&#039;s credibility in the north-west is at stake, or that, despite the importance that I, among others, attach to Metrolink, everything that the Government have done thus far in the north-west is suddenly withering on the vine because Metrolink is not proceeding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para112">I have several quick points on the background and the way forward. It is simply not right to say that Manchester&#039;s cost increases are exactly the same as those for schemes throughout the country; they are not. On the latest figures, the cost of this scheme is three times plus what it was originally. There is no comparable scheme of that size. Leeds is double; Portsmouth is close to double; and Liverpool, I think, is not even up to an overrun of 20 per cent. The magnitude of the cost increases in Manchester bears scrutiny. It is not enough simply to put that to one side and say that it belongs with everything else.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 450WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para113">Yes, the National Audit Office has waxed lyrical, but it has done so about Metrolink as it is now. It is wrong to give the impression that it has waxed lyrical or given a rubber stamp or green light to Metrolink 3; it simply has not done so. The NAO has said good things about Metrolink thus far, and rightly so, but not about Metrolink 3. That point is important because, as my right hon. and hon. Friends will know, at least part of the deal on the table is the sustenance of the existing network. That makes it all the more important to move forward and get a deal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para114">The working party has met twice now, and we are due to meet again, I think, the week after next. We must try to find a way forward in an unfettered way, and I need to say this as clearly as I can: that might not mean preserving the big bang. If the big bang and &#163;900 million is the starting point for a deal and it is that or nothing, I return to what I said earlier: not this project, at these prices. If we are to move forward and give Manchester the Metrolink that it deserves&#151;I do not demur from that; I am fully signed up to it&#151;everything should be on the table for the working party.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para115">Phasing, the big bang, shifting the risk back and forth and procurement are all on the table. Drilling down beneath&#151;design, build, maintenance and operation&#151;must be on the table. Re-tendering the whole lot must be on the table. We must not fetter the working party, or the work that it needs to do to get Manchester to where we all want it to be, by locking ourselves in a box that says, &quot;Big bang or nothing.&quot; With the will that has been shown thus far, and the work being done by the Department for Transport and Greater Manchester, we can get to the stage that all my colleagues and I want to reach, whereby all the regeneration benefits for Manchester, about which hon. Members have waxed lyrical, can proceed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h01_para116">I say just gently in passing that the notion that the Liberal Democrats or the Tories would do things far better than the Labour Government is, to use a current phrase, an entirely flawed prospectus that is not worth looking at. We can get to where we want to be. We can get a timetable and a road map that put all these things back on track.

<a name="41027h02_head0"><h3 align=center>NHS Nursing Care</h3>

<a name="41027h02_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41027h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. Archie Norman  (Tunbridge Wells)</b>  (Con): I am very glad to have the opportunity to devote the next hour and half to a discussion of nursing care in the NHS. I want to approach the subject constructively and I hope that the Minister will feel able to do the same and respond to some of the matters that I raise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para0">I do not intend to claim that there is a crisis in nursing care in the NHS. I shall, however, make a case for dealing with some of the emerging issues and argue that certain other concerns merit clarification, at the very least. It is important that all hon. Members recognise that although NHS nurses in general do fantastic work and are remarkably dedicated, they are comparatively less well paid, despite recent pay increases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para1">In many respects, nurses reflect the best of the public service ethos, and they undoubtedly provide outstanding care to the vast majority of patients most of the time. They are the bedrock of NHS patient care. Patients&#039; experience and recollection of hospital stays, in particular, is affected as much by the way in which the nurses treat them as by any other factor. It is important to recognise that that patient care and the experience of being treated and looked after by nurses is driven more than anything else by the ethos, motivation and morale of the nursing work force. Highly motivated, well-intentioned, well-trained and disciplined nurses will give outstanding care, but those who work under stress and are demoralised within an unstable work force will find it much more difficult to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para2">When I researched the subject of nursing in the NHS, I found it extremely difficult to obtain many empirical, objective data&#151;the Minister may be able to help with that. Nevertheless, there are quite strong emerging signs of increasing occasional lapses in the quality of personal care; I stress that they are only very occasional. I shall explain later why I think that may be happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para3">Other emerging issues, including those of morale, work satisfaction and labour turnover&#151;the number of nurses leaving the profession&#151;are potentially serious and expensive for the NHS. Despite the increase in nurse numbers there are still considerable shortages in many NHS trusts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para4">I want first to deal with what has happened to the nurse population, why there are still shortages, and what evidence exists for problems of morale and retention and career development in nursing. On the face of it, there has been a significant growth in the number of nurses in the past six years. The Government have made such an increase an objective and have, broadly speaking, achieved it. Depending on exactly which figures one studies, it appears that in the past five or six years numbers of full-time employees have gone up by some 15 to 20 per cent. In 2003, according to the latest statistics that I have, 304,892 nurses were employed in the NHS. That increase compares, however, with an increase of approximately 11 per cent. in the number of consultant episodes and of 17 per cent. in accident and emergency attendance during the period in question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para5">There has been a marginal increase in nursing intensity in the NHS. The increase in nurse numbers and activity in a very labour-intensive service does not 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 452WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
necessarily mean a significant increase in the available nursing time per patient. That, arguably, is what matters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para6">There has been a significant increase in the number of nurses in training&#151;from 14,604 to 21,200 in 2001. I do not have more recent figures, but I understand that numbers have risen still further. However, it is important to remember that we are comparing the number of nurses and nurses in training with the relatively low figures of six or seven years ago. We could debate why those numbers reached those levels; it would be possible to argue that there was underinvestment in nurse training and nurse delivery. However, I do not intend to dispute such issues or to go into the history. Although the number of nurses in training has increased, drop-out rates have also risen. As 15 to 20 per cent. of nurses in training drop out before they complete their course, the increase in the numbers delivered is not as great as the increase in the number of nursing places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para7">Nurse shortages are still reportedly widespread in the NHS. It is hard to establish exactly how great the problem is, but the Royal College of Nursing estimates that there are 25,000 too few nurses, while official figures claim that the figure is nearer to 10,000 or 11,000. By any measure, there is still a significant shortage, despite the substantial increases that have taken place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para8">Despite the general lack of national statistics, studies have been undertaken on the shortages. They include the <i>British Medical Journal </i>article of September 2002 entitled &quot;Mind the gap&quot;, which concluded:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The serious problems facing acute trusts in England in retaining and recruiting nurses result in high financial costs and low morale and may affect patient care.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para9">It goes on to say that the problem is most acute in inner-city trusts, which will hardly surprise any of us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para10">The average age of nurses is growing every year. Although there are interesting reasons for that, it is also an indicator of the drop-out rate among younger nurses. The average age of nurses is reported to be 41; that is surprising, given the nature of the profession.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para11">The gap in the supply of nurses, which has been created by nurses leaving the profession and despite the Government&#039;s efforts to increase the numbers coming onstream, has been plugged almost entirely by imported nurses. In fact, had we not brought in nurses from abroad over the past five or six years the number of nurses in the NHS would have remained more or less static. Moreover, 30 per cent. of students in nursing colleges are non-EU nationals. I do not mean to imply that recruiting qualified nurses and students from abroad is a bad thing&#151;many of them perform an outstanding job and are extremely well qualified&#151;but it is important to remember that it may leave us open to problems in future if getting nurses from abroad becomes more difficult and our shortages become more dramatic.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para12">The flow of leavers from the profession is large and growing. That says a lot about people&#039;s willingness to stay in nursing and about morale in the profession. According to the register of nurses, the number leaving annually has roughly doubled compared with 10 years ago, and there appears to be a gentle upward trend. Of course, the number of nurses on the register is not an accurate measure of the number working in or leaving the NHS, but those are the figures that are available. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 453WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The estimated 15 per cent. turnover rate of nurses leaving the NHS is rather high, especially bearing in mind that for the most part they do not leave for non-NHS nursing jobs, but leave the profession altogether.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para13">There is evidence of increasing stress in nurses&#039; work, not least because of hospitals&#039; throughput levels, the need to meet standards and declining morale. I do not want to overstate that point, however, and there is reason to believe that it is part of a wider problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para14">The Royal College of Nursing survey for 2003 suggests that 62 per cent. of nurses think that their workload is too heavy. I am not sure whether it has changed much over the years, yet the statistic reflects the concerns felt in today&#039;s workplace. The same survey said that 50 per cent. of nurses would not recommend nursing as a career to others. That is an alarmingly high figure&#151;considerably higher, I should have thought, than 10 or 20 years ago. Curiously, 34 per cent. thought that NHS investment in nursing staff was decreasing, not increasing. Although many more resources have been put in and recruitment has increased, nurses feel that they are working harder than ever and that investment in staff is not adequate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para15">NHS spending on agency nurses has increased by about 80 per cent. in the past six years. The import of that is that agency nurses tend to have less longevity in the work place; that leads to a higher movement of staff through wards, which in turn creates a less stable workplace community that becomes much harder to manage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para16">I am not suggesting that any one of those factors is critical. Nevertheless, if we look at the total picture we see a profession in which numbers have increased through importing nurses but the number of leavers is rising. That may be a reflection of declining morale, changing workplace patterns and lack of work satisfaction among the nursing community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para17">The problem might be addressed in several ways; the Minister may want to refer to them. One salient issue is that a high proportion of nurses, especially young nurses, works on shift rotation, which tends to be family-unfriendly. The way in which acute hospitals are run makes it necessary to have nurses on shift rotations, so it is no good my simply stating the problem and telling people to solve it. It is clear, however, that because of today&#039;s quality of life issues and the range of options that are available to people it is increasingly hard to get young nurses of family age to work in that way.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h02_spnew1"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): The hon. Gentleman is presenting an important case. Does he agree that given the recent settlement for general practitioners, which means that family GPs are now able to operate on a nine-to-five, five-days-a-week basis while continuing to be well remunerated, we should compare their ability to continue their family life with that of nurses who have to work shifts?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h02_spnew2"><b> Mr. Norman </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Not only among GPs, but in the broader health community, we have made progress in making health care work more family-friendly, and nurses working shifts are increasingly conscious of their relative position.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 454WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para18">Having established the background in so far as it is possible with the figures available, I want to discuss the changing nature of the role and the diffusion of responsibility for nursing. Lapses in the quality of patient care occur not only because nurses are working very hard and are not always content with their working life, but because of the changing tasks that we are asking them to undertake and the hierarchy in the ward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para19">Since 1989, there has been a formative change in the nursing profession and in nurse training, with what was then called Project 2000 resulting in a substantial shift in the balance of nurses&#039; training away from practical experience and into the classroom. In addition, the responsibility for the training has been shifted almost wholly from clinical to educational establishments. The arguments for those enormous changes seemed compelling at the time, but they have had important side effects. Nurses&#039; training is now much more academic. Much of a nurse&#039;s work is very practical. Nurses enter their profession because they want to do practical work with patients, but spend half or more of their two to three years&#039; training in a classroom environment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para20">That may have the effect of changing the type of people who enter nursing; it also means that nurses who come on to the wards are less experienced in practical training and the disciplines of nursing. Moreover, as has been widely reported, there is a shortage of mentors to work with training nurses during their clinical practice because a large number of trusts do not take nurses for practical training and there is a shortage of clinical placements. Generally speaking, the stress is on more academic and less practical nursing. I do not want to overstate that case because it is important that nurses should have an academic foundation as we ask them to undertake more complex medical and clinical tasks. However, it is a question of balance. The quality of clinical and practical experience that nurses have when they start working is perhaps not as good as it once was, although they are more qualified in other respects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para21">The other formative change in the workplace has been the development of health care assistants, or non-qualified nurses. That is significant not only in terms of the makeup of workplace economics and the division of tasks but of the effect that it has on the ward environment and the perception of role. On the whole, the rapid growth in the number of HCAs has happened for sound economic reasons. It is perfectly reasonable to employ people who are less well qualified and earn less to undertake less challenging tasks, but the ratio of qualified to unqualified NHS staff&#151;30 per cent.:70 per cent.&#151;may be approaching the limits of what is manageable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para22">In theory, health care assistants are supposed to have a national vocational qualification, but the evidence suggests that a large number do not. The King&#039;s Fund estimates that only 30 per cent. have a full NVQ, while others may have as little as six weeks training before they start on the wards. Yet in a pressured ward environment HCAs are inevitably asked to undertake important functions, some of which are medically sensitive. Unison conducted a survey&#151;in 1999, so it is out of date&#151;showing that HCAs&#039; tasks can include help with drug administration. Some 18 per cent. carried out invasive procedures, 11 per cent. took blood samples; and 61 per cent. helped with catheter care.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 455WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para23">We should not imagine that HCAs undertake only menial or basic tasks, because they are becoming an important part of the patient-health service interface. Anecdotal and survey evidence suggests that some patients have more interaction with assistants than with qualified nurses. It is potentially serious that some HCAs have had very little training and have arrived through what is in effect an unregulated route. The Minister may want to consider whether there is a compelling case for regularising the role of HCAs&#151;I was going to say &quot;regulating&quot;, but I do not want to give the wrong impression; I mean that we should standardise their minimum training requirements and what is expected of them&#151;and establishing a smoother career progression that would allow people to start work with the minimum level of training, qualify as HCAs, then qualify as nurses and move on through the management and clinical hierarchy. The elements of progression have been put in place without proper ladders or quality controls.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para24">The other side of the issue is the development of the so-called academic nurse. By way of illustration, although it is not very scientific, <i>The Guardian</i> of 11 October quotes Claire Rayner, the president of the Patients Association, who refers to the lack of practical training of nurses and the development of &quot;academic nurses&quot; and cites the
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;yawning gap between academic nurses, who have to spend more time pen-pushing than giving patient care, and the less informed healthcare assistants.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para25">That is backed up by anecdotal evidence from constituents, relatives and other people with recent hospital experience who have told me that nurses on the ward felt that they were too important to undertake patient cleaning and other basic patient care activities. That is unacceptable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para26">According to the nurse&#039;s job description, it is not necessarily part of their official role to deal with the basic tasks of patient care. The qualified nurse is asked
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;To provide planned nursing care for patients and their families; To assist in the management and organisation of work as required.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para27">The HCA&#039;s role is described in a subtly different way. He or she
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Assists qualified staff by undertaking personal care duties for patients; Reports patient condition to qualified staff.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para28">In a way, the role of the qualified or academic nurse is being institutionalised as having to do with clinical care and that of the HCA as having to do with cleaning patients and ensuring that they are comfortable. I say this with no disrespect, because I know that the vast majority of nurses are absolutely dedicated to total patient care. However, it is important for the NHS to be unambiguous about the fact that all nurses on the ward are responsible for ensuring that patients are clean and comfortable and that their psychological and personal requirements are looked after. We increasingly hear patients complain that they feel neglected because no one comes to clean them, look after them or ensure that they are comfortable. When my mother-in-law was recently in hospital, she was not provided with a proper pillow for 48 hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para29">Such problems stem from the emerging hierarchy in the ward environment. They do not only arise in the UK; in Australia and Canada, programmes introduced 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 456WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to increase the number of lesser qualified nurses or HCAs in the ward environment have had a material impact on the number of mistakes made with patients, as well as on clinical outcomes. I am not saying that the writing is on the wall, but we can learn from the experiences of other countries. We must establish exactly what the roles are to ensure that a situation does not developing whereby some people look after patients and others are primarily clinical in their approach. There is a level beyond which the ratio cannot be pushed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para30">The last aspect of the problem to which I want to refer is the nature of the workplace and the loss of accountability for the ward environment. There was an entirely different system in the early days of the NHS, although I am not advocating a return to that. For example, ward discipline&#151;control of the ward environment&#151;was much better, which helped nurses to do their jobs and to ensure that patients were properly looked after. Through custom and practice, we have allowed that to slip away. It is a question not just of bringing back matron and putting people in charge, although there is a bit of that involved, but of working and management practice throughout major hospitals. Part of the problem is that many hospitals now have almost uncontrolled visiting hours, which means that nurses no longer have two or three hours in the morning when they can get back control of the ward environment and ensure that it is clean and under control and that patients are properly looked after.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para31">Another problem is that doctors and other members of staff are able to stroll around the ward at will and to appear at unexpected times of day. That may not happen all the time, but it undermines the ward sister&#039;s role and her ability to say, &quot;This is my ward. I am in charge of this environment and can be held accountable for it.&quot; When my father was a consultant, before there was an NHS, there was no question of his turning up on the ward without permission. He would have to arrive at the right time, then he would be presented with his starched white coat and told when people were ready to receive him. Needless to say, when that happened all the blankets were folded and everything was neat and tidy. I accept that that is a bygone era, but nursing is partly to do with discipline&#151;the ability to control things and having standards that are rigorously enforced. Ward sisters should have enough spare time to check that everything has been done properly and to lead and teach the ward staff&#151;the other nurses and HCAs&#151;to ensure that they are doing their jobs well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para32">In most major acute trusts, turnover on the wards is probably much higher than the 15 per cent. that I mentioned earlier. If about a third of the ward staff move on every year, as in some trusts, it is much harder to establish a workplace community or any sort of continuity. It is also harder for sisters to manage new staff, who often have to deal with problems that are outwith their experience and need to be shown the ropes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para33">The Minister is probably planning to refer to modern matrons, and I do not intend to be critical of the initiative to bring them on board. In most trusts, however, the modern matron is not matron as we used to know her, but a new layer of management. The critical role is that of the ward sister, as the person who is in charge of the ward, not that of the modern matron, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 457WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
who takes broader responsibility for an array of tasks that fall outwith the ward sister&#039;s role. The critical question is this: does the ward sister have the capacity and the authority to make decisions about who comes on to the ward and when, the cleaning on the ward, and the management of his or her staff?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para34">We have previously debated MRSA in this Chamber. That is a central issue, as the development of MRSA is all about cleanliness in the ward environment and thus the ability of nurses and HCAs to control what happens there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para35">I invite the Minister to comment on the emerging trends that I have outlined. Despite the growth in the number of nurses, there is still a problem with nurse shortages that could grow. We are highly dependent on imported nurses, which, if nothing else, would put us somewhat at risk were the flow to dry up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para36">There are also important issues to do with the balance of qualified and non-qualified staff on wards. The role of HCAs in relation to the standard of the qualifications with which they enter the NHS is becoming a serious issue. It is fundamental that we do not allow a hierarchy of personal care to develop. There is a risk that some nurses may feel that they are a little too important to do the menial tasks involved in caring for patients. That would represent a major erosion of the successful culture of service in the NHS. There must be a case for creating a better continuum of career development through the nursing profession. We need to understand why the number of people leaving the nursing profession seems to be growing and why the average age of nurses seems to be rising.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para37">Is the Minister satisfied that steps have been taken to re-establish a greater sense of discipline and control of the ward environment? That would help to improve the working environment, team working and the people&#039;s development, as well as to deal with the more fundamental issue of cleanliness and MRSA.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
profession. There is little doubt that nursing remains one of the most amazing, challenging and wonderful professions for anyone to go into.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para39">I am guilty of the following offence: I am totally bound by the principle of wards and nurses, when we need to remember that nurses work in all sorts of settings and ways and with all sorts of people. In this debate, it would be wrong not to acknowledge the range of nurses&#151;men and women of all shapes and sizes, working with the elderly, or with young people, and working in ways that may be different from what we shall discuss today. It is important to remember that the nursing profession is incredibly wide, and offers enormous opportunities for many people. The estimate is that more than 80 per cent. of care in the NHS is delivered by nurses, so it is right and proper that we should focus on those care givers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para40">We need to be clear that nursing in the 21st century is a different deal from what it was even when I started my nursing training in the early 1970s, in that nurses must now work in partnership. The hon. Gentleman created a wonderful picture, and I remember the ward sister&#039;s vice-like grip. She was able to create her own environment. At times it was not particularly encouraging of new nurses, or nurses who wanted to progress or develop their skills, but it was a way of making sure that she kept a grip on her ward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para41">Of course, we cannot operate in that way today. Being an excellent ward manager, and being in charge of a team of people who contribute to nursing care, is a different deal. It is important to give the ward cleaner an equal say about what happens in a particular setting, and it is important to ensure that the consultant is aware that he or she should do a ward round at the appointed time, outside the protected mealtime&#151;an important new development in the NHS, which I welcome. We must remind consultants, as well as nurses, that it is important to wash their hands between patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para42">The picture that emerges of nursing and of the care delivered is different from what we might expect, because without that co-operation and that sense of everyone contributing, the workplace cannot function.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para43">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells talked about Project 2000. Few of us&#151;certainly few in the profession&#151;would argue that we should return to hospital-based training, because it was so variable. We now use the phrase &quot;nurse education&quot;, and nurses are properly educated through the university system. I understand why we moved to the university-based system, and respect that decision. Although that change has created problems, it has without doubt raised the standard of education of nurses and ensured that people have a proper career path into nursing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para44">I was interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments about the average age of nurses, which has been affected by several factors. I am not sure that it was right for me to go, as I did as a young woman, straight into nursing from a pre-nursing course at college, but I did so because I was so determined to become a nurse. When I go to the nurse education centre at the university of Sussex and talk to people in nurse education, I see a tremendous age range, and I find that heart-warming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para45">It is encouraging that people who may want a career in the nursing profession, or a profession allied to nursing, who have become health care assistants but 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 459WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
later realise that what they really want to do is to become fully trained and registered nurses, can do so. That is an excellent way to get people into nursing, because it overcomes many of the problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, such as the lack of ward-based experience.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para46">There is little doubt that classroom education is desperately needed. I well remember going straight on to the ward after six weeks in a nursing school and being asked to look after 10 intravenous infusions for people who had serious operations. That was unacceptable. The whole flavour of nurse education has changed. If people who have experience on the ward, such as health care assistants, take a measured decision to move into nursing, and trusts encourage that path into nursing and offer support, that is a tremendously efficient way to get nurses into training, not only because such people turn out to be excellent nurses, but because the chances of their falling away from nurse education are much reduced, since they know exactly what they are going into. That area could benefit from further expansion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para47">Nurses make such a difference today. None of us should run away from the fact that nursing is incredibly pressurised. The way in which the NHS is being reformed and is responding to patients&#039; needs, and the pressure on those who have to deliver care, makes it much more difficult for them: they have to think quickly about how to ensure that patients are treated decently and in time, and that they are not kept waiting. Such considerations add to the problems of those who deliver care, most of whom are nurses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para48">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that concerns and complaints are often about nursing and associated issues, such as how we care for people on wards. That is understandable, but there are ways to tackle the problem. Many nurse organisations and trade unions are contributing to the way in which nurses develop and gain new skills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para49">The Royal College of Nursing&#039;s &quot;Nursing the Future&quot; campaign is superb, and came from America. It involves a series of nurse ambassadors from all areas of nursing who go out into schools and into the community, promoting nursing in a positive way because they feel positive about what they do and they want to go out and explain what nursing is all about. They all appear in different ways: a mental health nurse turns up in his jeans, while a formal ward nurse wears her uniform.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para50">We can develop nurse education in many ways. The key is giving power to nurses, and we have made enormous strides. The Government have accepted and had to sort out the awful morass of nurse prescribing, which was mouldering in the doldrums and not making any progress. Now we have a comprehensive range of nurses who can prescribe, and do many other good things, themselves. In some settings they can order their own X-rays, and can ensure that everyone is ready to come in and get organised for out-patients&#039; appointments. They have the power to organise their own workplace.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para51">I have visited many areas to see how nurses can operate, and to ensure that they feel valued by their trusts&#151;that is the point. A nurse today, without doubt, is highly respected. However, nurses are also under enormous pressure. They can rise to that challenge if we 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 460WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
ensure that we value them as a profession, and support them. We should not have a silly, rose-coloured-spectacles view of nursing, but we should support nurses properly, either through the Government or by the way in which the community relates to nurses. They do not want wishy-washy support; they want their profession to be properly recognised. I firmly believe that we are moving in that direction. The pressure is on for them, but I am convinced that they are up to the job.

<p><a name="41027h02_spnew5"><b> Dr. Richard Taylor  (Wyre Forest)</b>  (Ind): I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman), not only for raising this issue but for tackling it so sympathetically and constructively, and not in a party political way. I also want to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) for her long experience in nursing&#151;and for warning me before this debate that I had to be a little careful about what I said about nurses, as she is sitting so close to me.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para52">Recently, after a Health Committee meeting, I received an extraordinarily rude letter from a constituent. At that meeting we had been talking about nursing, and I and other Members had repeatedly referred to nurses as being of the feminine gender. That lady got very worked up about that, and it is important to recognise that nurses are of both sexes, of equal efficiency and equal value.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para53">Having got that off my chest, I want to remind the Chamber of what Florence Nightingale said in 1860:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;No <i>man</i>, not even a doctor, ever gives any other definition of what a nurse should be than this&#151;&#039;devoted and obedient.&#039; This definition would do just as well for a porter. It might even do for a horse. It would not do for a policeman.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para54">Thank goodness that definition went ages ago, thanks to Florence Nightingale and lots of other people. I agree with the hon. Member for Crawley; I am talking more about hospital nursing, and in hospitals there is a partnership. The nurse is no longer the handmaiden of the doctor. She or he is an equal partner in the ward team running the show in the best interests of the patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para55">I want to concentrate on one aspect of nursing that I fear is being lost in some respects&#151;I shall consider the reasons for that after I have given some examples. I am talking about the role of the nurse as the advocate of the patient. All patients are supposed to have named nurses when they go into hospital; that is crucial. With the decrease in the hours that doctors are allowed to work and the lack of continuity of care from the medical profession, continuity is provided by nurses, who have always worked on shifts and are therefore used to handing over when they move on. However, it is in the advocacy role that nurses are needed. That is sad, but it is so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para56">I echo what the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells said; it would be easy to be highly critical, because most of the letters that we get are critical rather than supportive. Let me give some examples of cases in which a nurse&#039;s advocacy was missing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para57">An 82-year-old man had an epidural injection that went wrong, resulting in a respiratory arrest, so he was really very ill. He was transferred to another hospital for overnight observation because the first one could not keep him overnight. At 7.30 in the evening, after seven 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 461WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
hours on a trolley, he was seen by a consultant, who said, &quot;If you can walk, you can go home.&quot; His elderly wife was there, his son came by car, and they struggled to get his clothes on. He could just walk, so he did go home&#151;and his wife was up all night. In my day, which was after the time of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s father, the nurses would not have allowed that. They would have stepped in and said to that consultant, &quot;This chap can&#039;t go home now.&quot; That is one factor that is missing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para58">In another case, a 91-year-old suffered from unhygienic conditions on the ward, lack of personal care, two falls, pressure sores, incontinence, loss of dignity and loss of the will to live. The patient died, and there was even a delay in the notification of the death. In a third case, a 19-year-old died of a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which was probably inevitable. The family was up in arms because the information given during the poor girl&#039;s final illness was scanty and hopeless. Again, in my day, if I, as a doctor, had been guilty of handling that family as it was handled&#151;this occurred not at my hospital, but a long way away&#151;the nurses would have slaughtered me. They would have gone in and explained to the family exactly what was going on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para59">The worst example of all is the case of Victoria Climbi&#233;. In the inquiries, the social workers were blamed and the doctors were blamed a little bit&#151;I think that the doctors should have been blamed a great deal more&#151;but where were the nurses? One morning, when she was in hospital, a locum senior house officer was on duty, with no consultant cover, for one single shift, and at no stage was that locum instructed by the nurses about what was going on. That loss of advocacy is very severe. Beverly Malone has spoken about people being &quot;too posh to wash&quot;, but I will not carry on that theme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para60">Why have we got into this state? Enough has been said about Project 2000. I agree with the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells, in that I think that things have gone a little too far. I agree about academic training, but that must be balanced with more practical training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para61">There are issues of stress, overwork, undue reliance on agency nurses&#151;who inevitably do not take the same responsibility for the patients as permanent staff do&#151;and ward discipline, in which I am a great believer. When I first arrived at the hospital where I was to work as a consultant, I was staggered when I walked into the office and all the nurses and sisters stood up. I had not been used to that at a London hospital, but that was the discipline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para62">Nurses must cope with the tremendous expectations associated with widening roles. There are nurse practitioners, nurse consultants, managers, modern matrons, and emergency care practitioners, and they are expected to take on the job of the junior doctors who are not there to do it. GPs no longer do the job at night either, so there is a tremendous strain on the nurses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para63">I recently attended a lecture by an eminent professor of nursing called &quot;The death of nursing&quot;. He made the point that every time there was a change, people would say, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s the death of nursing.&quot; He believed that nurse leaders had to respond to all the changes by ensuring that they had different ways of working. His main point related to leadership of the trained nurses to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 462WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
get the students, the cleaners, the health care assistants and the junior doctors all working together. I am not altogether in favour of modern matrons; that is simply a name for the unit nursing officers whom we used to have. I would much prefer there to be one senior matron, who makes everyone quail when she goes round the wards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para64">I appeal to the Minister to remember that the traditional job of a nurse is caring for, as well as organising, other people. A little more practical training would help. As Tacitus said, &quot;Experience teaches,&quot; and, from the 16th century:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Experience is the best teacher.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para65">and

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Experience is the father of wisdom.&quot;</p>

<a name="41027h02_time3"><h5>2.52 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41027h02_spnew6"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) on securing this very important debate, and echo the praise given by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) for the way in which the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells made his case.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para66">It is a pleasure to follow both the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) and the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, because they both speak from a great deal of personal experience of working in the NHS. I declare an interest to an extent, in that my wife is a former nurse. She still occasionally works on a nurse bank in a local hospital.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para67">Like the hon. Member for Wyre Forest, I want to concentrate on acute hospitals. As the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells rightly pointed out, there may be a disjunction between our debate on the statistics for nurses coming and going, retiring and moving to the country, and what is being delivered in the real world and the stresses and pressures experienced on the wards themselves. I shall concentrate my remarks mainly on wards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para68">We need to recognise that, as from April this year, the starting salary of a trained nurse will be &#163;17,060 a year. When one compares the antisocial hours, the responsibilities, the life-and-death decisions that nurses have to take or participate in taking, the stresses and strains, and the physical nature of the job, with those of other professions&#151;for example, the police&#151;nurses are undervalued in terms of remuneration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para69">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells rightly emphasised the change in the nature of nurses&#039; training since the introduction of Project 2000. There must be an appropriate balance between the academic and the practical, or the clinical. Those who have been involved in nursing for many years repeat that, in their experience, many new nurses are well trained academically but need more clinical experience before they are let loose on the wards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para70">In an intervention on the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells, I attempted, perhaps not particularly well, to contrast nurses, who work antisocial hours and shifts&#151;necessarily, as wards operate 24 hours a day&#151;who make life and death decisions and who accept all their responsibilities, and are paid at a certain level, with GPs, who recently managed to secure for themselves&#151;in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 463WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
effect, and if they so wish&#151;a nine-to-five job, five days a week. Compared with nurses, they are well remunerated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para71">I am not saying that GPs do not deserve their pay or that they do not do a good and important job for which they should be properly remunerated, but I question whether the difference in levels of pay for GPs and nurses is appropriate, given the responsibility that nurses have, particularly on acute wards. I would argue from a Back-Bench position that perhaps there is a need for a review, although I would not commit my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) to spending plans, which are for him, not me, to make.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para72">I have only a few minutes left in which to emphasise two points. The first is about the amount of paperwork that nurses are now required to deal with in order to maintain their responsibilities on wards. As I see it, nurses have taken up new roles as patient biographers. They must complete a veritable encyclopaedia of information before patients can be admitted. They need superhuman powers to find the time to engage in nursing care itself, on top of all the paperwork.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para73">Recently, I asked a nurse how much paperwork had to be completed when admitting a patient. I was told that a 28-page form must be completed when a patient is admitted to an acute ward, and that a great deal more paperwork must be completed during their stay.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h02_spnew7"><b> Laura Moffatt </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that taking a really good case history and background of the patient contributes to good nursing care throughout that patient&#039;s stay?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h02_spnew8"><b> Andrew George </b> : A balance needs to be struck between the amount of paperwork and the amount of time left for nursing care&#151;that is a question of judgment. I simply make the point that many nurses say that much of the data and information collection is unnecessary, does not help with their job, does not help them come to clinical decisions on the ward and does not necessarily assist with the longer-term care of the patient. They estimate that the amount of paperwork has increased by about 30 per cent. in the past two to three years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para74">In early September, the <i>Daily Mail&#151;</i>if I dare quote from it&#151;published a letter from Sally Boxall, who stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I&#039;m one of the 40,000 nurses quitting the NHS&#151;in my case, after 25 years. The reasons that have led to my frustration at the whole soul-destroying set-up include the paperwork . . . nurses are expected to make it a priority, before patient care&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para75">and that they have become bed managers rather than carers. We must recognise that there is a difference between what we debate in this Chamber and what actually happens on the ground.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para76">I spoke to nurses recently about a current case in a Cornwall acute trust. Twice during the past two weeks, night duty&#151;from 9 pm to 8.30 am&#151;was covered by one recently qualified D grade nurse on &#163;17,000 a year. She and two health care assistants had care of a ward of 28 seriously ill patients. That nurse had to administer drugs, put in and change drips, discuss medical care with doctors, give information to relatives, talk to nurses from other wards about the transfer of patients, admit emergencies, administer injections, change catheters, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 464WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
insert nasogastric tubes, and decide whether patients needed oxygen or a remedy for low blood sugar levels. She also had to deal with cardiac arrests, although it needs two nurses to resuscitate patients. I understand that is happening regularly. The local NHS acute trust hospital is short of 80 qualified nurses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para77">There are serious problems. Nurses are undervalued as well as being underpaid. I hope that the Government recognise that, and that they will take those issues on.
</p>



<a name="41027h02_time4"><h5>3 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41027h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam)</b>  (LD): I add my congratulations to those expressed to the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) on securing this debate. I also congratulate him on the manner and tone in which he presented his argument and the evidence that he gave in support of it, and I congratulate all who have contributed to the debate. I shall pick up a number of the points that have been raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para78">First, I echo what was said at the beginning of the debate about the nature of nursing. Nurses are dedicated, but they are still less well paid than many others in the public sector. As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George) said, unfavourable comparisons can be made with other public sector workers, some of whom have done very well&#151;they have received increases in salary and their work is valued.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para79">The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells was right to say that nurses are the bedrock of patient care in the NHS and that they embody the very best of the public service ethos. We must do everything we can to cherish and protect that, and to build upon it. During the next few minutes, I shall run through some of the issues that have been raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para80">The hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) rightly said that hon. Members had so far focused on nursing in the hospital setting; she said that nursing was far from being confined within the boundaries of NHS or other hospitals. The profession reaches into many other settings. I think particularly of the key role that nurses play in primary care; increasingly, they lead primary care teams, and many have become practitioners with specialist interests. As we heard, they have taken on a prescribing role, they run clinics, and they are taking a lead in developing and supporting self-management. Those are some of the many aspects that make the profession one that more people should consider as a career. I certainly support the &quot;Nursing the Future&quot; campaign that has been mentioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para81">It is worth mentioning the British public&#039;s view of nursing&#151;assuming that polls are an accurate reflection of their views. In a poll for <i>Nursing Standard</i>, MORI found that 81 per cent. of people believe that nurses are caring and understanding. In the same poll, eight out of 10 people said that they thought nurses were extremely hard-working. This year, through its in-patient questionnaire, the Healthcare Commission asked patients, &quot;Did you have confidence and trust in nurses treating you?&quot; We should remember that 75 per cent. of respondents in England said, &quot;Yes.&quot; We MPs can often be disproportionately influenced by our mailbags. People tend to write to us only when things go wrong, but we must remember the good things when looking at the overall picture.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 465WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para82">Reference was made to the ongoing concern about hospital-acquired infections and the need for a management structure that allows nurses to be more clearly in control of the ward environment. For example, concern has been expressed during the past few years about the way in which contracts were let for cleaning and catering in hospitals. Those contracts led to a fragmentation of the chain of control and command in hospitals, which made it more difficult for ward sisters, matrons and others to be confident that what needed to be done could be done immediately, rather than having to go through a lengthy contractual process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para83">It is interesting to read the reports, also in <i>Nursing Standard</i>, on the National Patient Safety Agency&#039;s hand hygiene campaign. The agency found that on average only 40 per cent. of necessary hand hygiene procedures were carried out. I mention that because earlier today I had the pleasure and privilege of visiting the Epsom and St. Helier NHS Trust and joining the infection control team there&#151;Dr. Sharon Chambers, Dr. Louise Neville, Mandy Cehssum and Gill Hickman, who are the infection control nurses&#151;as part of its infection control week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para84">I visited wards, met a number of modern matrons and the sisters in charge, and took part in a practical exercise to see how good people were at hand hygiene. The powder was put on, and people&#039;s hands were washed and run under the scanners. The experience was most interesting&#151;although I came out worst&#151;and it was a good demonstration of how engaged wards are with infection control teams. I applaud what is being done to encourage people to become engaged, in a competitive way, with basic hand hygiene, which is an important aspect of reinforcing good practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para85">I want to pick up something that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) said about pressure sores. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives was keen not to commit me to any spending figures in this debate, but we need to consider how to ensure that the resources now available to the NHS are used to best effect. To rehearse some figures, it cannot be to the best effect for more than &#163;2 million a day to be spent on treating bedsores in the NHS. Nearly one in 10 patients are affected by bedsores, more than 90 per cent. of which are preventable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para86">Good health care assistant practices can materially alter that situation. For example, some research suggests that spending &#163;200 on a pressure mattress can save &#163;1,500 on treating bedsores. There are ways in which the resources can be used more effectively. That would introduce a quantum leap in the quality of care of the individual and save the NHS resources to boot. We should ensure that the existing examples of good practice on bedsore management and reduction become the norm. Perhaps some of the examples of infection control that I have given could be repeated for bedsores.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para87">Feeding is also important. Recent research shows that 40 per cent. of patients going into hospital are already malnourished, and that 70 per cent. of those will become more malnourished within a week of their admission. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 466WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Addressing the annual meeting of the Royal College of Nursing in Harrogate about the issue, Caroline Lecko, a matron at King&#039;s College hospital, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We saw on the wards that they were extremely busy over the lunchtime period, so busy that the food really wasn&#039;t being noticed by nurses, by doctors, by therapists and everybody was too busy to make sure that patients were actually eating.We were seeing patients not really being prepared for meals and not being made comfortable to eat, with food left out of reach.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para88">That is a real concern about practice being overlooked. Ensuring that food is eaten is linked to the other points that have been made about health care assistants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para89">Reference has been made to age profile of the nurse work force. With between one in five and one in four of the work force over 50, the NHS still faces the huge challenge of ensuring that we do not experience increasing shortages again over the next few years, despite the welcome increase of 67,500 since 1997. Just across the pond, the US estimates a shortfall of 1 million, and nurses are being actively recruited over here. Such pressures will intensify, not go away, and thus further increase our need to import overseas entrants into our work force, as has been said. For instance, last year more than half of those registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council came from overseas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para90">One of my concerns about agency nurses relates to the Audit Commission&#039;s work a couple of years ago. The commission had serious concerns about the training, supervision and management of agency nurses entering the ward environment and said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;All these factors increase the chances of patients receiving care of a poorer quality than they would otherwise get.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para91">We spend &#163;1.7 million per day on NHS nurses in agency roles. That is a large sum of money, but I am not certain that it necessarily achieves flexibility for the permanent work force.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para92">That brings me, briefly, to training. A report published in May entitled &quot;Failing Students&quot; echoed mentors&#039; concerns about the academic quality and competence of nursing trainees. Can the Minister explain what is planned for taking forward the work of the Nursing and Midwifery Council on standards for the preparation of teachers of nursing and midwifery to ensure a necessary improvement in the quality of students coming through? I am not talking about those who give up, but those who get through into practice. The NMC report shows that mentors are ringing alarm bells and saying that some people are getting into practice who should not be there.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para93">In conclusion, nurses are the bedrock, and we must do all we can to support them. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s response.
</p>



<a name="41027h02_time5"><h5>3.10 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41027h02_spnew10"><b> Mr. John Baron  (Billericay)</b>  (Con): I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) on securing the debate and on his contribution, as well as the subsequent contributions. We should make it clear that we owe a debt of gratitude to all NHS staff, not just nurses, for their hard work and commitment. The phrase has been used many times, but our nurses are the bedrock of our NHS. In many ways, in people&#039;s minds nurses reflect the standard of care that they receive in the NHS. We owe them all a debt of gratitude.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 467WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para94">My hon. Friend rightly focused on standards and drew our attention to one or two areas that could be improved. In particular, he mentioned the importance of morale. There is no doubt that morale within the NHS, particularly among the nursing profession, is not what it should be. The Royal College of Nursing survey &quot;Stepping Stones&quot; surveyed around 10,000 nurses at the beginning of this year. One third said that they would quit the profession if they could, and 11 per cent. said that they planned to quit it in the very short term. The internal rotation shift system to which my hon. Friend referred&#151;days, evenings and nights within a short period&#151;was particularly unpopular. It is no surprise that the number of nurses leaving to work in the USA has doubled in the past year alone.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para95">That poor morale has been caused in large part by the Government&#039;s micro-management of the NHS through its targets. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government&#039;s targets are well intentioned. No one can argue about an increase of more than 40 per cent. in NHS spending, but I believe that the Government are underestimating the extent to which targets are sapping morale within the NHS. Targets, however well intentioned, are preventing money from reaching front-line services, and there is strong evidence to suggest that they are distorting clinical priorities and that is demoralising staff. Targets are clogging up the system, and that is why the NHS is suffering so many retention and recruitment problems. After such a massive increase in spending, there has been only a modest increase in activity. We have seen a 40 per cent. plus increase in spending, but only a 5 per cent. increase in hospital treatment. Patients are suffering because they are having to wait far longer than necessary to be treated. The turnover figures are there for everyone to see.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para96">I believe that the NHS turnover rate runs at around 22 per cent.&#151;well above the national average. In financial terms, that is costing the NHS about &#163;1.5 billion a year&#151;the price of 10 new hospitals. A report by the Audit Commission in 2002 on this issue cited specific factors such as lack of professional autonomy, a sense of being undervalued by the Government and bureaucracy. Those are, without doubt, some of the problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para97">I could go on giving evidence suggesting that targets are distorting clinical priorities. One of the most forceful statements recently was that of the outgoing chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr. Ian Bogle, who, as the Government will be well aware, said last year:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The one memory that will linger long  . . . is the creeping, morale sapping erosion of doctors&#039; clinical autonomy brought about by micro-management from Whitehall which has turned the NHS I hold so dear into the most centralised public service in the free world.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para98">He went on to say that doctors, nurses and managers were being forced to collude in widespread cheating to meet waiting time targets designed with an election in mind. Even Unison&#039;s head of health, Karen Jennings, has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Hospital staff need to be free to concentrate on clinical needs and priorities instead of chasing crude targets.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para99">Although targets, through their demoralising effect, have frequently been cited as a reason for the failure to retain nurses, the system of star ratings, as the Minister 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 468WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
well knows, has come in for particular criticism. Jim Johnson of the British Medical Association has made the point that the star system
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;measures little more than hospitals&#039; ability to meet political targets and take inadequate account of quality of clinical care, or factors such as social deprivation.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para100">The problem with star ratings is that they are a blunt measure. They are fine for measuring hotels, but not complex organisations such as hospitals, because they give patients and the medical professionals working in them, including nurses, no indication of how well their department is doing. The system saps morale, tars all departments with the same brush and means that nurses and other medical professionals are continually trying to raise standards but star ratings are getting in the way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para101">One could argue that all those things are necessary because otherwise we could not understand how the NHS was performing. However, it would be better to get rid of the targets and introduce a set of clinical standards, decided by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, whereby the medical professionals themselves, rather than politicians sitting in Whitehall, decided the right level and type of care and treatment that should be provided. There is no doubt about it: Government targets are preventing money from reaching front-line services, and sapping morale. They can also interfere with the implementation of standards, which comes back to a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para102">We know that 5,000 people a year die from MRSA, and although it did not suddenly appear in 1997 but was here before that, figures suggest that it has increased significantly in recent years. Again, Government targets appear to be hindering the fight against MRSA because they are overriding the recommendations of infection control teams to close beds or wards for cleaning. That is clearly wrong, and needs to be put right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para103">I suggest to the Minister that a useful way of ensuring, measuring or judging the meeting of standards involves patient representation&#151;this too returns us to one of my hon. Friend&#039;s central points. Although a tried and tested system of patient representation and monitoring is one way in which standards of nursing care can be gauged, that has been fundamentally undermined by abandoning the tried and tested system of community health councils, which operated for almost 30 years, in favour of myriad bodies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para104">We know that staff turnover in patients forums is high; in the first four months of this year it was some 11 per cent. Many people have commented that the forums are being starved of resources and facilities. I put it to the Minister that if we lose an efficient system of representation, we take away one of the main props&#151;one of the main ways in which we and the nursing profession, and those outside it, can ensure that standards are being met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para105">In conclusion, I suggest that standards of nursing care are not necessarily falling. We believe, as do all Members, that nurses are doing a great job. However, the Government are placing obstacles in the way of improvement. For example, recent national service frameworks&#151;the Government&#039;s chosen tool to lever up standards&#151;have no targets attached to them. In a world without targets we would welcome that, but in a culture of targets, it spells disaster. Targets equal cash, and medical conditions that do not have targets attached will struggle.

<p>
<a name="41027h02_para106">We know that modern matrons have been introduced, but we question their effectiveness on matters such as MRSA when the Government, as I have suggested, get in the way of them raising standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para107">The recruitment and retention problems reflect the fact that although improvements have been made in the NHS&#151;there is no disputing that&#151;progress is not what it should have been, bearing in mind the money invested. We can refer to the high turnover rate, but this is not the fault of the nurses and other professionals who work in the NHS. It is the fault of the Government, who cannot see that their approach is fundamentally wrong.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para108">Politicians must stop interfering. The Government must stop bombarding nurses and other medical staff with targets, and micro-managing the NHS. The NHS has been a political football for too long. The time has come to scrap the targets and the star-rating systems, and give all hospitals true freedom, so that they are accountable to patients and not bureaucrats. We believe that that approach will usher in an environment in which doctors and nurses, freed from political targets, will choose to stay because they can enjoy the freedom to give patients a standard of care that they can be proud of.
</p>



<a name="41027h02_time6"><h5>3.21 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41027h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Miss Melanie Johnson) </b> : In the brief time left to me, I shall do my best to sum up the debate. I join other hon. Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) on securing the debate. It is becoming a habit for me to respond to Wednesday afternoon debates initiated by the hon. Gentleman. As on previous occasions, I found that much of his speech was sensible and I could agree with it&#151;but not with all of it, by any means.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para109">I join other hon. Members in recognising that NHS nurses are at the heart of the service. They provide 80 per cent. of the care, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, and much of what we accept as the fabric of the NHS is built on the values of nursing&#151;such as caring, treating people with dignity and respect and combining clinical and technical expertise with the fundamentals of care that matter to patients. For patients and other members of the public, nurses are often the face of the NHS, as has been said. The care that they provide is highly valued, and the Government pay tribute to their hard work and dedication.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para110">I shall first draw attention to some inconsistencies between the remarks of Opposition Members. I am glad that the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells recognises that we have, broadly speaking, brought about an increase in nursing numbers. That is not the impression that one would get from the remarks of his hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron), who attacked us on the subject of targets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para111">Any organisation needs ambition and goals, and a way of telling how well it is doing. We have been instrumental in removing Whitehall controls. That has been the thrust of what we have done. In speaking about targets the hon. Gentleman failed to comment on our very good success rate, whether in the high percentage of patients who now wait only four hours&#151;or much less&#151;
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
to be attended to in accident and emergency departments, the 12.2 per cent. cut in cancer mortality rates since we have been in government, or the 23.4 per cent. cut in deaths from coronary heart disease in the same period; that percentage is still growing. I could go on, but I do not have the time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para112">I must tackle one other point made by the hon. Member for Billericay before moving on to the much more sensible resum&#233; of key issues given by the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells. I refer to the point about hospital treatments and productivity, which was nonsense. In considering productivity, no account is taken of walk-in centres, most primary care work, or NHS Direct. Any successful public health or prevention work does not contribute to those productivity statistics. The more successful we are on prevention and public health generally, the less productive we are by the measures being unthinkingly used by the Opposition. That is completely ridiculous.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h02_spnew11"><b> Mr. Baron </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h02_spnew12"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : No, I will not, because I have far too little time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para113">As we are talking about what the Government have done, I should add that there are now 77,500 more nurses, and there has been a 62 per cent. increase in training places for nursing and midwifery. That means that 21 per cent. more nurses are now caring for patients, according to our figures, which despite slight differences, are broadly in keeping with what the hon. Member for Billericay said.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para114">I want briefly to recognise the new roles being played by nurses, although the issue did not crop up in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt) rightly commented on the number of different settings in which nursing takes place. There are now 697 nurse, midwife and health visitor consultant posts, as well as a new top clinical grade that is helping to modernise and improve services, raise standards, retain the most experienced and expert nurses in practice and strengthen clinical leadership. Nurses are also acting as a first point of contact in some of the schemes that I mentioned, such as NHS Direct and walk-in centres. Furthermore, they have a range of new responsibilities and specialist roles. My hon. Friend, with her wonderful expertise and background in nursing, described how nurses can now prescribe medicines at different levels. There is a range of new activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para115">More than 18,000 of those 77,500 nurses and midwives have returned to the NHS since 1999. We must not forget nurses in primary care, whose numbers increased by nearly 18 per cent. between 1997 and 2003. In addition, vacancy rates fell to less than 3 per cent. in 2003&#151;I am afraid that I do not have a more recent figure. Finally, the number of nurses entering training has increased dramatically&#151;by 62 per cent. I want to say a little more about nurse training, however, because the issue exercised several hon. Members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para116">We obviously want to attract as many people as possible into nurse training. We also want to focus on the practical side of nursing and on those who want to take on advanced clinical roles. We need a mix of skills, as I am sure the hon. Member for Billericay will recognise. We have therefore increased the practical element of training 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 471WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to 50 per cent., to ensure that nurses acquire the skills needed to care for patients in the more traditional way that hon. Members have talked about. It is important to strike the right balance in preparing nurses for the future, and our nursing strategy &quot;Making a Difference&quot;, which was published in 1999, led to developments in education that have improved nurses&#039; practical skills. In the formal sense, the provision of practical experience is an essential element of all pre-registration education. UK pre-registration programmes require 50 per cent. theory and 50 per cent. practice, and that seems to me a pretty good balance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para117">On the question of maintaining people in training, we have no evidence that drop-out rates are increasing. The latest data are still being analysed. The latest complete data that we have go back to 1997&#150;98 when there was a 20 per cent. drop-out rate. Rates vary a great deal across universities and nursing branches, but local work force development confederations are working with local education providers to reduce drop-out rates, so the issue is being considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para118">On the future role of health care assistants, hon. Members and others must recognise that such people play a key supportive role, which we need in the skills mix in our hospitals. Most health care professionals are already well regulated. We issued a consultation document called &quot;Regulation of Health Care Staff in England and Wales&quot; on 2 March and closed the consultation period on 2 July. The consultation considered the categories of staff whose work has a direct impact on patients and who have the potential to compromise public safety if their work or behaviour falls short in any way. It set out a range of options, including full statutory regulation for such staff. We are analysing the responses to the consultation and we will decide the way forward in the light of those.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para119">There is huge satisfaction with nursing care. We know from a study by the Royal College of Nursing that the majority of nurses&#151;78 per cent.&#151;are enthusiastic about their work, and 85 per cent. believe that they can provide a good quality of care. The vast majority of patients, too, are happy. The nurses enjoy doing their job, and that is recognised in all the responses that we have; 85 per cent. of the nurses in the RCN &quot;Stepping Stones&quot; survey agreed with the statement, &quot;The quality of care provided where I work is good.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h02_para120">It is important to recognise that a new brand of nurse consultant is out there, as well as all the traditional roles that we have been talking about. Modern matrons have been mentioned, and there are now more than 3,000 of them employed in the NHS, but it is not possible to think that we could go back to the past&#151;

<a name="41027h03_time1"><h5>3.39 pm</h5>


<p><i>On resuming&#151;</i>
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Flook </b> : I am delighted to have secured this important debate to voice my concerns, those of county councillors of all political parties in Somerset and those of all the people of Somerset, not just my constituents. All five of us who represent Somerset constituencies are concerned about the implications of the Government&#039;s failure to factor the figures from the 2001 census into the formula spending share.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para0">The debate is about getting a fairer grant settlement for Somerset, particularly in view of the fact that the formula used by the Government to distribute money to local authorities is very out of date. One problem is that it is based on old census data; it uses the 1991 figures rather than those collected in 2001. That skews the formulae used to distribute the grant to each local authority. It is difficult to calculate accurately the figure by which Somerset is short-changed. The council has made a fair stab at it and calculates that it is between &#163;3.6 million and &#163;3.8 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para1">I pay tribute to County Councillor Bob Little, the local Opposition finance spokesman, who expressed concern in the council about the situation. As a consequence, he drafted a letter that was signed at the end of July by the leaders of all three parties represented on the council. All five of us local Members of Parliament, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, received a copy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para2">In the letter, the county council said that it was astounded that the Government made the decision that they did in July, when they announced that the formula spending share for the financial year 2005&#150;06 would not use the census figures collected three years ago. The Government have estimated the loss to county councils alone as being worth some &#163;116 million each year, as the FSS fails to take into account the depopulation of the northern metropolitan areas and the growing populations in the south-west and the south-east.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para3">What does that mean for my constituents? In Taunton Deane there are 8,000 more people than were counted in the 1991 census, while the figure for Somerset is more than 37,000 higher than in 1991. The failure to use the 2001 figures will not even be rectified for the next funding round. That is why we are here.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister apparently has a principle&#151;just the one, no doubt&#151;which is clearly stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Data to be used in grant distribution should be the most up-to-date available&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para5">I am sure that the Minister will comment on what he considers to be the most up to date. However, we all know that the Government are using data from 1991 as the basis for the FSS. That means that the funding for services based on demography and socio-economic 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 473WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
factors reflects the situation at the beginning of the last decade, rather that that at the beginning of this decade. In the past 13 years, Somerset&#039;s population has increased, but the people who have moved into the area tend to be older than those who were there before, and their requirements are different. That is not recognised if one uses the 1991 census figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para6">As the population has grown larger, so have the towns. The constituency of Taunton is somewhat larger than it was 15 years ago. That means that the relative sparsity factor in Somerset has increased for those in the rural areas as well. That, in turn, means that we probably do not get the funding that we ought to for rural schools or rural transport. The upshot is that there is inaccurate and inadequate funding for services. All of us know from our constituency mailbags that authorities throughout the country are feeling the squeeze of funding pressures over and above those caused by the fact that the latest census figures are not being used.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. David Laws  (Yeovil)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Is he aware in the past 30 years or so of any precedent for a Government waiting such a prolonged period to incorporate census data into funding figures? Is there not a serious danger that those delays will lead to unfairness not only for Somerset but for county councils throughout the country?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew3"><b> Mr. Flook </b> : The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about precedent. If the Minister does not have the information with him today I would be interested to know at a later date what happened with previous census figures and how quickly they were implemented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para7">We would all admit that the FSS and its predecessor became even more complicated despite the fact that in the late 1990s the Government said that they were going to simplify the system. Since then, computer modelling has become much more sophisticated and the speed with which answers to questions should be found has increased. As the Minister will find out, and as a number of us were aware in the mid-1990s, a lot of juggling goes on to find the most advantageous solution to the FSS that suits as few councils as possible. It would be interesting for the Minister to write to us about what happened in the early &#039;90s, &#039;80s and &#039;70s, and before that if possible, if he does not have the answer now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para8">The population in the south-west has grown, and the population mix has changed in that there are more elderly people, particularly in Somerset, which has led to inaccurate and inadequate funding for services. When it first became apparent that the Government were unlikely to use figures from the 2001 census and would be sticking with the 1991 figures, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The ODPM might not have sufficient resources to conduct the analytical work&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>

</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory  (Wells)</b>  (Con): Is my hon. Friend amazed, as I am, at the ODPM&#039;s pathetic excuse that it does not have enough officials to deal with the update, when the same Department is spending a great deal of money and management time on engaging with the unwanted and unnecessary regional assemblies? We suffer from one such talking shop in the south-west. Does he agree that if the Government redeployed some of the civil servants trying to impose an extra layer of bureaucracy on us in the shape of regional assemblies and made them work on updating those figures, we might have a more equitable funding settlement and meet his quite legitimate concerns?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew5"><b> Mr. Flook </b> : My right hon. Friend makes a good point. Just the other day, he was showing me an advertisement in the local newspaper for six new jobs to help to back up the regional assembly. That is funded by the taxpayer, and the money has no doubt come from the ODPM. It is fair to make the point that money is being allocated to the regional assemblies, but I do not wish to go down that avenue, as we are not here to debate that subject. However, if that money had been reallocated to number-crunching civil servants, we might have received the figures more quickly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para11">The Minister will say that that is in fact down to the Treasury, and I will come on to that point, but we are discussing how &#163;46 billion is allocated&#151;or misallocated, as the figures are seemingly so out of date&#151;throughout the country. That misallocation is hardly surprising, as the figures are 10 years out of date. The Government say that it is all right because, according to the letters that the Minister sent to Members of Parliament, there is a freeze on the formulae so that the ODPM can provide every council with funding stability. That freeze locks in the advantages for those who benefit, but it locks in the disadvantages for those who suffer. Those who get too much continue with the luxury of having too much, while the others can just waddle along calm in the knowledge that they are being officially short-changed by central Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para12">There is still hope that the Government may find some resources to crunch the numbers in time for the figures from the 2011 census, but we now know from the announcement made on 21 July that they will definitely not be ready for next year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para13">So, let us think about the amount by which council tax will have to rise in 2005&#150;06, the next financial year. In Somerset, council tax has risen considerably in recent years because of a combination of Government failure and perhaps&#151;how can I put this?&#151;the way in which the council has been run. In the forthcoming increases, at least 2 per cent. of the rise that the taxpayers of Somerset will have to pay can be put down to what can be described at best as an administrative failure and at worst as a political ploy by the Government to help their friends in the north.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para14">Is that a coincidence, just ahead of next year&#039;s election? The Minister shakes his head. Is it a coincidence that the new figures with all the adjustments will not be needed because there has been a freeze, or is it by design? However much the Minister may protest, he must know that perception is everything in politics, and public opinion on the matter in Somerset, and I am sure in the south-west as a whole, is not on his side.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 475WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para15">I am sure that the Minister will tell me that to incorporate the 2001 figures into the formulae is not a simple task, but what Government function is? He will tell us that if he were to incorporate the figures, it would break the funding freeze and cause large changes to the distribution. That is precisely what the people of Somerset, the county council and the district councils need and want. The Government are putting off a proper response to an ongoing trend. I am worried for the Minister&#039;s role. It is logical and it should be obvious that when the Government do get around to using the new census figures from 2001 in the formulae, the end result will be even further removed from where they would be if they used them for next year. But then again, there is unlikely to be an election the year after next.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para16">We know that the 21 July announcement was made three weeks before the end of the Government&#039;s public consultation on local government finance amending reports. It is fair to ask the Minister why he had a consultation so early in the process if there was no intention of taking any notice of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para17">Furthermore, the Government claim that they did not have a full set of the 2001 data because the Office for National Statistics released the data only in stages. I am sure that that will be the crux of the Minister&#039;s defence. What representations did the ODPM make to the Treasury&#151;not because the Treasury is the paymaster, but because it is the Department responsible for the census&#151;about when all the figures from the 2001 census would be available? I hope that it, too, is not involved in the largesse that ends up with the metropolitan counties of the north doing so well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para18">If the figures were to be used, the south-west would gain &#163;35 million and the south-east &#163;49 million. London would lose &#163;50 million. Yorkshire and the Humber would be &#163;14 million lighter, and, surprise, surprise&#151;I am sorry to say this Mr. Deputy Speaker, because I know that you represent a constituency in the area&#151;the north-east would be &#163;24 million the poorer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para19">So, the shire counties are &#163;116 million worse off, the south-west &#163;35 million and Somerset &#163;3.8 million. That would fill in a lot of potholes in Somerset&#039;s roads, buy a lot of library books, and provide quite a number of teachers and a lot more care for the elderly. The county council has called it incompetence. As a Member of Parliament, I do not think that I would go that far. However, householders in Somerset say that the &#163;18 that they are being robbed of is yet another stealth tax. Whatever it is, Somerset deserves a full and proper explanation for that shortfall.

I welcome the opportunity that he has given us to expand on the issues that have been raised by a number of local authorities in shire areas and their representatives.

<p>
<a name="41027h03_para20">Before I comment on the specific issues raised, it may be helpful if I provide some background on the system for distributing grant to local authorities, and on the improvements that we have made to the funding of local government since we took office. In local government finance settlements since 1997 we have increased the amount of Government grant given to local authorities by &#163;19.1 billion. That is a 30 per cent. increase in real terms&#151;above inflation&#151;and compares with a 7 per cent. cut in the four years before 1997&#150;98, when the hon. Gentleman&#039;s party was in government. The spending review 2004 goes further: it provides significant and continued extra investment in local government, with &#163;7.2 billion more than this financial year in general grant for programmes by 2007&#150;08. That is an annual increase of 2.7 per cent. in real terms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para21">I admire the hon. Gentleman for coming to the House to plead for more money for his authority in Somerset, as the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws) have done for their authorities. I have no doubt that on many occasions over the coming months, Opposition Members will stand up to demand more money for their local authorities. As well as coming to the House to demand extra resources, the hon. Member for Taunton might want to have a quiet word with the shadow Chancellor, who has announced that if the Conservatives get into power, there will be a cash freeze for local authorities&#151;not a 2.7 per cent. increase above inflation, but a cash freeze. Perhaps he and his colleagues should have a debate within their party about the impact that such a decision would have on services and council tax increases in their areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para22">Of course, our priority funding areas have been education and personal social services. The latest settlement, in 2004&#150;05, is a cash increase of 6.9 per cent. for those services. There can be little argument that we have provided significantly greater investment since 1997&#150;98, and there is general agreement that recent settlements have offered welcome improvements in the money going to local authorities. The average full grant increase for Somerset since 2002&#150;03 is 6.2 per cent. Inflation was way below that. Somerset county council then chose to increase the council tax by 10.2 per cent., which is regrettable for the taxpayers of Somerset, but at least they got a good deal from the Government with the grant. Taunton Deane borough council had a 3.9 per cent. increase in grant, while West Somerset district council had a 5.4 per cent. increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para23">I now turn to the settlement specifically for Somerset county council. Somerset has benefited from the extra money of which I spoke. In 2004&#150;05, it received an extra &#163;287 million in general grant. That is an increase of &#163;16.5 million, or 6.1 per cent., on a like-for-like basis compared with 2003&#150;04. Over the past seven years, we have provided Somerset county council with an average annual increase in general grant of 4.8 per cent. in cash terms. That is not what I would describe as a case of Somerset being short-changed in the way in which the hon. Gentleman alleged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para24">The current grant distribution system was introduced in 2003&#150;04 after a full-scale review and consultation. The system is designed specifically to take into account the relative needs of different authorities, and to determine grant on that basis. The general principle behind the calculation of grant allocations is to provide 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 477WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
a basic amount per client&#151;per primary school pupil, for example&#151;or per kilometre of road and then to add top-ups to recognise the extra costs incurred in certain areas. The main top-ups are for deprivation and area costs, but a wide range of factors determines the amount of grant that individual authorities receive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para25">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, in order to provide stability to local authorities, it was announced in the 2001 White Paper that following the introduction of the new system in 2003&#150;04, no further changes would be made to the formulae until 2006&#150;07 at the earliest. That decision has been known about since 2001, so the 2004&#150;05 settlement was made on the same formulae as last year, 2003&#150;04, and we intend to maintain the freeze for 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para26">Although we have frozen the grant distribution formulae, something that local authorities were pleased about because it gave them stability and certainty over a three-year period, we have endeavoured to use the most up-to-date data available each year for grant calculations. However, we have updated the data used in settlements only where it has been possible to do so without changing the underlying formula. I stress that point. Let me give examples of that, because it has been put around by so many shire authorities in a way that has been unhelpful and inaccurate, and I should like to get it absolutely clear. To give an example of where the data have been upgraded, when we calculate the older people&#039;s social services FSS each year, we use updated figures for the population aged 65 and over in each area, and we use the number of older people that each authority supports in care homes. We also update the proportion of older people claiming income support or disability living allowance in each area. Those are two of the deprivation indicators in that FSS formula.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para27">However, where data change greatly it is generally not possible to use them to calculate FSS without amending the underlying formula. Two census-based deprivation indicators from the children&#039;s social services formula illustrate that point. Information from the new census tells us that the number of children living in single-parent households increased by 45 per cent. in England between 1991 and 2001 and that the proportion of children living in flats varied widely across the country, falling by 38 per cent. in the north-west but standing still in London and the south-east. Given those large changes in the data, it is clear that the relationship that we observe between the relative need for children&#039;s social services and the 1991 census data will not hold when the new census data are applied. In short, we would no longer be confident that the children&#039;s social services FSS was being directed to the authorities with the highest need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para28">I have spoken at length about those examples to show why sometimes we use certain data, and sometimes we do not use other data because they would necessitate amending the fundamental underlying formula, and we have a policy decision to freeze the formulae for three years to give certainty and stability. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#039;s desire to see the 2001 census data incorporated into the formulae for the grant system as soon as possible. I have given examples of where we do that and where we do not, and why. However, I want him to understand that we have had to make difficult 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 478WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
decisions, of which those examples are just two, on whether to include the latest data available&#151;the 2001 census data&#151;or retain the formula freeze and provide the stability that we believe authorities require. Having balanced those arguments, we decided not to use the 2001 census data in the 2005&#150;06 settlement. That decision was announced on 21 July.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para29">Having reached our conclusion, we felt that it was better on balance to announce the decision as early as possible to enable authorities to make informed decisions for their 2005&#150;06 budgets. I know that the consultation exercise was still ongoing at that time, but we decided to move early once we made that decision, to give local authorities more time to take the changes into account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para30">I am aware of concerns expressed by the County Councils network that the new data were not incorporated into this year&#039;s 2004&#150;05 settlement because of lack of prioritisation of Government resources. I understand that that is the point that the hon. Members for Taunton and for Yeovil were debating earlier. In fact, we could not have incorporated the new data in 2004&#150;05&#151;this year&#151;even if it were technically possible to do so because we did not have the full set of 2001 census data. In fact, we received the last set of data that we needed from the ONS only on 21 October, a few days ago. I therefore hope that I have been able to set that matter straight for the hon. Gentlemen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para31">As I have already said, it would be technically incorrect simply to introduce the data without first amending the statistical models underlying the FSS formulae.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Laws </b> : Is there any technical reason why the Minister could not incorporate the 2001 census data into the 2005&#150;06 settlement?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope </b> : I have already explained that where the data would affect the underlying formula, we will not incorporate them because we have chosen to freeze the formulae for the three years 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06; otherwise there would be unintended consequences&#151;the money would go to the wrong place. Changing the formulae in that way would end the freeze, which is designed to create the funding stability that local authorities require. Further research is being undertaken on the formula changes needed to incorporate the 2001 census data into the whole FSS for several services, in particular personal social services and the police. That research should conclude in time to allow us to introduce the 2001 data in 2006&#150;07, not 2005&#150;06. As the research is ongoing, it is not possible at this time to estimate what amount of grant any authority would receive if the 2001 data were to be incorporated in 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para32">In the few minutes that remain, let me just say a few words about the figures that the hon. Member for Taunton mentioned. He said that Somerset will lose &#163;3.8 million because we are not using the 2001 census data to calculate the 2005&#150;6 settlement. It is not actually that easy to say what the impact of the data would be, or to come up with a figure. I understand that the figure of &#163;3.8 million&#151;indeed, the hon. Gentleman mentioned &#163;116 million as the gross figure for all shire counties&#151;
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 479WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
was taken from a technical paper that was discussed at official level by the settlement working group. That paper illustrated what would happen if we were simply to use the 2001 census data in the current formulae. It was also based on only a partial update of data, as not all the data were then available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para33">Local authority experts, including the County Councils Network, agreed that that was the wrong thing to do. Therefore, the &#163;3.8 million and &#163;116 million that the hon. Gentleman quoted do not accurately reflect the effect of updating the census data in the funding formulae. I regret that the figures simply are not accurate, although they seem a useful explanation for what many have dubbed the missing millions.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Flook </b> : In which case, what is the figure?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h03_spnew9"><b> Phil Hope </b> : The point is that we cannot give figures at present, as they are being calculated. The scaremongering by the shire authorities&#151;and the Members who make their case in this Chamber&#151;simply will not do, when they themselves have been at the table to discuss these matters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para34">We have worked with local government to establish the best way to use the new census in the funding formulae. It is clear that incorporating the new census data will require formula changes, particularly for the social services and police, that would best be made as part of the formula review that we are undertaking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h03_para35">Time is not on my side, so I shall just conclude by saying that, despite the robustness of the debate this afternoon, I fully understand the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. The Government have carefully considered the case for incorporating the 2001 census data in the settlement for next year, but in order to provide authorities with the funding stability that they have welcomed overall, we decided to maintain the promised formula freeze next year. This has been a good opportunity to debate the matter. It builds on the work of the officials&#039; settlement working group, in which all the issues are discussed, perhaps in a slightly more collaborative way than we have managed today. We shall continue to work towards incorporating the 2001 census data in the settlement for 2006&#150;07 as part of our wider review of the distribution formulae.

<a name="41027h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Cash Machine Charges</h3>

<a name="41027h04_time0"><h5>4.9 pm</h5>


<p><a name="41027h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. James Plaskitt  (Warwick and Leamington)</b>  (Lab): May I, through you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate?
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para0">I raise this issue because of a series of concerns. One third of the cash machine network in the United Kingdom now charges people a fee for accessing their own money, and the proportion of fee-charging cash machines in the network is increasing. On current trends, we are not far from the point where the majority of cash-dispensing machines will charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para1">Charges vary, but they are not less than &#163;1 and are often more than that, and as a proportion of the average cash withdrawal they can represent a significant deduction. There is evidence to suggest an increasing concentration of such machines in lower income areas, and my major concern is that there is no robust code or regulation in place telling the customer what is going on. In other words, there is inadequate transparency in the industry and it should be addressed, given the trends. People should object to paying for the privilege of collecting their own money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para2">There is something ironic about the current situation. If my current account in the bank is in the black, I can go into a bank branch&#151;an expensive building&#151;go to a teller, who is employed at some expense to the bank, and withdraw cash from my account for free. However, if I go to a cash-dispensing machine in the street, where no expensive building or member of staff is involved, it is increasingly likely that I shall be charged for using that machine to do exactly the same thing. The hole in the wall has become the hole in my pocket.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para3">There is currently much debate about the reform of gambling laws. If I engage with a gaming machine I know that I may lose my money, or I may win&#151;I take a gamble. However, if I use a cash machine that charges, I will always lose. It is guaranteed to drain my account every time. According to a <i>Which</i> survey, two thirds of people do not expect to be charged by a convenience cash machine. I am beginning to wonder why there is so much fuss about slot machines, when there are already 20,000 one-armed bandits on Britain&#039;s high streets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para4">I have nothing against any company wanting to get into this business and make money out of it. I am not asking the Government to ban charges for accessing cash, or asking banks or finance companies to offer a free good. They are in business and they have the right to try to make money, and a network of cash machines costs something to operate. However, the consumer also has the right to fair trading, honesty and transparency. Consumers have choice as their weapon, but they can deploy it only if they have information, and they will have it only if those they are trading with are transparent about the deal on offer. That is where there is a big gap, and we need to work to close it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para5">The big high street banks are not the main culprits. For the most part, their machines, often in their branches, are free at the point of use with no charge to the customer withdrawing cash&#151;a service that is funded by interchange fees exchanged between the banks. The main problem is with the cash machines owned and operated by other companies, such as Hanco, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 481WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Moneybox, Cardpoint and Travelex. Hanco has the largest share of the market with 26 per cent. and Moneybox is second with a 15 per cent. share. Since Moneybox started in this business in 1999, it has raised its average charge by 60 per cent. Cardpoint currently has a 14% share of the market and has a declared strategy&#151;it can be found in its annual report&#151;of increasing the number of machines and increasing charges per withdrawal. A minority of the total cash withdrawn via the hole-in-the-wall operations is issued by these companies&#039; machines. However, that is where the main problem lies and it could easily become a more significant problem unless appropriate codes or regulations are put into place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para6">Let me give a simple illustration of the problem. On Monday, I went to Leicester square. In between the Empire cinema and Ben and Jerry&#039;s ice cream parlour, there is a cash machine that prominently displays a Link logo. I inserted my card and went through the usual on-screen steps with which we are familiar. After the fourth step&#151;the last before it would issue the cash&#151;a message popped up saying that I would be charged &#163;1.50 for the transaction. As I was attempting to withdraw &#163;20, that would have meant a 7.5 per cent. deduction from my cash, so I aborted the transaction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para7">However, let us consider the problem. The machine was registered as a Link machine, which most people understand to be a free network. The Travelex sign was tucked away out of obvious sight. There was no prominent sign on that machine to tell me that it would charge; in fact, there was no sign at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para8">When I began using the machine, there was no message to warn me that I would be charged. How realistic is it in normal circumstances to imagine that people will pull out of the transaction, as I did, having got that far? They have already queued, there are probably other people behind them, they want the cash, and they are in a rush. That is simply unfair trading. That machine belongs to Travelex, which cannot possibly argue that it is a convenience machine, serving only a limited clientele, and that there must be a need to charge.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe) </b> : I am interested by my hon. Friend&#039;s argument. Could he describe the difference, as he sees it, between a convenience machine and the one in the case he has just outlined? I am trying to get clear in my head the differences in definition between a convenience machine and the one in Leicester square, next to Ben and Jerry&#039;s.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : To some extent, all the machines are convenience machines. The phrase has come into use to refer, by and large, to machines that are not located in branches of the main banks. That is what the term has come to mean, but it covers a collection of different locations and sites. I can help my hon. Friend further by pointing out that just a few metres away from that machine, in Leicester square, is a row of cash machines owned by NatWest that are not in a branch but all offer free withdrawal.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 482WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para9">Leicester square is obviously a busy area. There is a very high footfall, to use the jargon, so Travelex&#039;s uncommunicative machine is just a cynical bit of consumer exploitation. In its briefing, Link says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;You will only be charged  . . . if you use a &#039;convenience&#039; cash machine. These are found in locations that would not normally justify the cost of installing a cash machine because fewer people are expected to use them&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para10">That is what Link says should be the case with convenience machines, but it is patently the case that in Leicester square, one of the busiest locations one could find, Link&#039;s policy is being breached by that Travelex machine. I do not believe that it is the only such example.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para11">If we move away from Leicester square and London altogether, we can find even more interesting examples. Let us travel instead to Liverpool, to the L5 postal district, one of the poorest in the United Kingdom. In the core of that area, nine of the 10 available cash machines charge. Or we could go to Glasgow, and the G34 postal district&#151;six of the 10 machines in that core area charge. By contrast, in some of the more prosperous parts of the country, such as Fleet, in Hampshire, in the GU51 postal area, we find that eight of the 10 core machines are free. In the RG40 postal area of Wokingham, seven of the 10 core machines are free.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para12">There is a financial exclusion issue arising out of the conduct of those companies. Where bank branches have largely gone from an area, people are left increasingly dependent on so-called convenience machines. They are incurring the charges, which fall disproportionately on customers with lower incomes. Benefits are increasingly paid directly into bank accounts. If a mother in the L5 area withdraws the money for her child benefit via a so-called convenience cash machine, 5 per cent. of it will end up in the hands of the automated teller machine provider.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para13">There is also an element of age discrimination. Once a child has reached the age of 14, he or she can obtain a cash card&#151;not a cheque account or a credit card, just a cash card. In general, children of that age will be drawing out very small amounts, so the &#163;10 cash withdrawal on the Saturday morning trip to the shops could very well incur a charge of &#163;1.50 if taken from a convenience machine. That is a 15 per cent. deduction from the young person&#039;s cash. Those customers do not have many other available sources from which to obtain their cash and may well be less aware of their options.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para14">A pattern of disadvantage begins to emerge and will only worsen if the current behavioural trends in the industry are left to continue. The signs are that they will, which is why I want to bring this issue to the attention of the Chamber. Many of the banks are disposing of their cash machine network&#151;that is, machines outside their branches. HBOS, for example, sold its non-branch machines to Cardpoint. All those machines used to be free, but they are unlikely to remain so. Abbey has also sold off part of its network to Moneybox, so free machines&#151;in this case, those in petrol stations&#151;are now becoming charging machines. The banks can still be involved even when the machines are sold off to other operators. RBS, for example, owns Hanco.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para15">It is objectionable to have to pay for the privilege of collecting my own money, but I accept that those in business will see this as an opportunity to make money. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 483WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
As I said in my opening remarks, however, I as a consumer have or should have some power in this relationship. At the moment, however, too many consumers are being deprived of those powers. Action is necessary to restore a level playing field.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para16">What intervention is there in this relationship? The system is currently governed by the Link network, which applies a voluntary code, part of which I just quoted. The code quite rightly indicates that cash-dispensing machines that charge should say so, but, as the Leicester square example showed us&#151;it is not the only one&#151;the code is not worth the paper it is written on because it is not policed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para17">I want customers to be able to vote with their feet and walk away from charging machines wherever possible. That will be possible only if there is greater transparency about what those machines do. I want an enforceable code that will protect the free parts of the network, such as those operated by Nationwide. That will give consumers the power to which they are entitled. The code should say that machines must display a clear and prominent warning that they charge. This warning must be on the machine itself, not only on the screen, and it should not be tucked away or disguised. After all, if a small cigarette packet can contain a large, clear sign saying, &quot;Smoking kills&quot;, surely a much larger cash machine can display a sign saying, &quot;This machine charges.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para18">Wherever possible, the amount of the charge should also be given equal prominence. The same charge notice needs to be included on the promotional signage associated with that machine, not just on the machine itself. All non-financial transactions must remain free of any charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para19">This is not yet a massive problem, but I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that it is already significant. The trends are worrying, and are clearly established. For example, the number of fee-charging machines has increased by 40 per cent. in only the past six months. Last year, 63 per cent. of the 5,600 new ATMs installed in this country charged fees. Very soon, there will be more fee-charging machines than free ones in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para20">Those who are trying to maintain a free and convenient cash machine network are under siege from others in the industry who are anxious to charge us for accessing our own money. The voluntary code is not working, which is probably unsurprising, given the big banks&#039; dominance over the Link network. I therefore say to my hon. Friend that it is time for the Department, which does act in the consumer&#039;s interest, to enforce fair play.

<a name="41027h04_para22">Cash machine charges affect everyone in the UK. Such machines are the first port of call for many of us. As my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington said, they have supplanted the traditional counter as the mechanism of choice for withdrawing money. Many significant changes have been made to the system in the past few years. I welcome many of those developments, including the removal, in most cases, of charges to customers for using machines&#151;notwithstanding the issues raised by my hon. Friend&#151;the increasing transparency where charges are applied, and the wider deployment of machines. We can be sure, however, that the changes have provided, and can continue to provide, real benefit to consumers. The Government are committed to ensuring that consumers get a fair deal, value for money and greater choice. We see that as good not only for consumers but for British businesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para23">My hon. Friend will know that many of the changes to cash machines result from the March 2000 report by Don Cruikshank on competition levels in UK banking. In that context, Cruikshank examined the UK machine network, Link. I want to say a few words about the report, which had a huge impact on the industry. It found that many consumers faced charges levied by their card issuer and, sometimes, additional charges levied by the cash machine provider. Those charges were not, in many cases, made clear when the cash withdrawal was made. The requirement to be an issuer of cards in order to operate cash machines was a real barrier to entry to the market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para24">Following the report, Link made several changes to its rules. I am interested in my hon. Friend&#039;s interpretation of those rules. Link opened its membership to non-bank organisations. It required that all charges, whether applied by the cash machine owner 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
or the card issuer, should be notified to the customer by means of an on-screen message at the time of the transaction and that customers should always have the option to cancel the transaction without charge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para25">Link also banned double charging, which means that card issuers will not charge customers for cash withdrawal at a machine that attracts a convenience fee, and a machine will not apply a further charge to a cash withdrawal where a customer&#039;s card issuers charge a cash advance fee. Link has made those welcome changes to its rules, and the Government believe that they have had a positive impact on the market.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h04_spnew4"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s response, but he has just referred to the Link document calling for information to be given to customers using cash machines &quot;at the time of the transaction&quot;. That is a very vague phrase. In the case that I cited, the machine in Leicester square, the time of the transaction is the last moment before it issues the cash. A lot more activity goes on before that. Does my hon. Friend agree that the customer needs to know from the outset that they are to be charged, not at the very last moment?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h04_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : Given my experience in the Treasury Committee, my hon. Friend will not be surprised if I do not respond immediately with my personal opinion. I am sure he will appreciate that in these debates it is important to consider in detail the information that hon.   Members give us and respond accordingly. By happy coincidence, my officials are meeting Link representatives tomorrow, and I shall ask them to take up the issues raised by my hon. Friend in the debate. I undertake to respond to him and to the Treasury Committee in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para26">On the whole, it is extremely good news that the vast majority of customers do not have to pay to withdraw cash when they use a cash machine that is not owned by their bank. According to recent Link figures, about 97 per cent. of all cash machine transactions are now free.
</p>




<p><a name="41027h04_spnew6"><b> Mr. Plaskitt </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way again so soon. Does he acknowledge that even though a charge is incurred on a small percentage of all the cash being dispensed, if we take the figure that he has just mentioned, &#163;3.6 billion in cash is dispensed on which fees are charged? Will my hon. Friend bear in mind the fact that that amount is 48 per cent. higher than the figure for the year before, which is a fast growth in the section of the network that charges?
</p>




<p><a name="41027h04_spnew7"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. In the spirit of how we progress on these matters, he will understand that a Minister&#039;s response comes from the advice given him by officials. I know that my hon. Friend will appreciate that I, as Minister with responsibility for consumers, want transparency, to ensure that the consumer is not treated unfairly. My hon. Friend was right to make the point about percentages and what they mean in real terms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para27">Our information is that Link rules state that customers must be warned of the charge and given the option of cancelling the transaction. They stipulate that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 486WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
an on-screen message detailing all charges will appear before the transaction is completed, and the customer can pull out of it without charge. I recognise that there is some discussion about when that point is reached.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para28">I understand that Link members have also agreed that a sign saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This machine may charge you for Link cash withdrawals&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para29">will be clearly visible to card holders before the card is inserted in a cash-charging machine, either by a notice on the machine or an upfront screen message, at the discretion of the cash machine owner. My hon. Friend knows of our work on transparency and advertising; the sign must be very clear and the consumer must be aware of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para30">On the whole, I welcome these developments and encourage the widespread adherence to the principles. It is important that consumers have relevant, correct and transparent information in order to make informed decisions and avoid being misled, which is the key issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para31">As my hon. Friend said, fees are still charged in some cases, such as the use of store, credit or charge cards, when the card issuer charges a cash advance fee, or the use of non-bank cash machines, which are often called convenience machines. Increased competition in the market has led to a growth in the number of cash machines, both those provided by the banks and those provided by non-bank operators. Most non-bank or convenience machines are found in locations that would not otherwise justify the cost of installing a machine, and I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend said about the machine in Leicester square. The issue about charging in areas where convenience machines are likely to be&#151;garages, pubs and stores&#151;involves the number of transactions. Many of us, if we find that we need cash but would otherwise not have access to it, are prepared to pay for that opportunity of access.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para32">The recent increase in the number of convenience machines is a benefit resulting from the changes to open up the market. Competitive markets provide the best means of ensuring that the economy&#039;s resources are put to their best use by encouraging enterprise and efficiency, and widening choice. Where markets work well, they provide strong incentives for good performance, encouraging firms to improve productivity, to reduce prices and to innovate, and they reward consumers with lower prices, higher quality and wider choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para33">Allowing non-banks to join Link has allowed new operators to fill a niche and to deploy cash machines in many locations where there had previously not been a machine. The Government believe that the growth in the number of non-bank cash machines has led to an increase in choice for consumers and is driven by demand from consumers. The machines provide access to cash in locations that were not previously served, and the operator must cover the cost of providing that service. It is important to remember that prior to the change in the Link rules to allow that to happen there would have been no cash machines in most of those locations. Despite the growth in the number of non-bank cash machines, I have been told that they account for only 3 per cent. of transactions, notwithstanding the point about the value of that 3 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para34">As my hon. Friend knows, the Government are committed to promoting financial inclusion and I would be concerned if poor people were more likely to pay for 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 487WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
cash machine use. The Government have acted to make the benefits of banking services more widely available; I will say something about that in a moment. I would be very concerned if the rules on the transparency of charging information were not being properly adhered to or enforced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para35">I must now say a few words about the regulation of the industry. The provision of payment services, including the deployment ofATMs, is not regulated by the Government. However, that is not to say that there are no safeguards in place. The amount of money that flows through the UK&#039;s payment systems&#151;Link is one, albeit one through which relatively small amounts of money flow&#151;means that the Government must take an interest in the possibility of risks to banks or to financial stability. Most of the participants in the UK&#039;s main payment systems are banks, which are authorised by the Financial Services Authority. The non-banks that are members of Link are not FSA-authorised, and the Bank of England has responsibility for overseeing payment systems as part of its wider responsibility for financial stability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para36">The Government have no plans to make the provision of payment services a regulated activity. We do not believe that the risks posed are such that the costs of regulation would be outweighed by the benefits. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>27 Oct 2004 : Column 488WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
However, the European Commission is currently developing a directive for a new legal framework for payments, which is likely to create a pan-European regulatory regime for payment services. The Government are currently engaged in ensuring that that regulation is both focused and proportionate. Although the Government do not support regulation of the provision of payment services, we believe that it is important that the market functions efficiently and that the competition is driving good service for consumers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41027h04_para37">In conclusion, it is good news for consumers that most do not now pay for using cash machines, but I understand the points made by my hon. Friend, and I will ask my officials to discuss them with Link at the meeting tomorrow. It is important to me that there is transparency and fairness and that consumers are not misled. The work of the Treasury Committee, in conjunction with what we are trying to achieve in my Department and the work of the Treasury, will offer a better deal for consumers. The work that my hon. Friend has done means that consumers will be protected, and I am grateful to him for raising the matter today.
