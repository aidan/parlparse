</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60228h01_spnew0"><b> Steve Webb  (Northavon)</b>  (LD): Good morning, Mrs.&nbsp;Humble. I am delighted that my debate has excited the attention of the House. The allocation of business rates revenue is important to my constituents and many others.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para0"><a name="stpa_1">The current local government finance structure does not fully recognise or reward local authorities&#039; contribution to economic growth.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;Local authorities bear many of the costs of economic development although they do not benefit from the increased revenues it generates. Since 1990 business rate revenues have been paid into a central pool so that local authorities get no direct individual or local benefit.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para1"><a name="stpa_2">Those well chosen words are not mine, but those of the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raynsford), the previous but several local government Minister&#151;and how right he was.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para2"><a name="stpa_3">The serious issue that I want to raise is about what happens to the taxes that businesses in our constituencies pay. The key point is that since 1990, business rates have been set nationally; they are now known not as business rates, but national non-domestic rates. The money paid by local businesses, although collected locally, is passed straight to central Government and reallocated, not according to where it came from, but loosely on a per capita basis. I shall come back to that point in a moment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para3"><a name="stpa_4">Why am I&#151;apparently uniquely&#151;interested in that? It is because in South Gloucestershire, the unitary authority where my constituency falls, something strange has been going on since 1997. In that year&#151;the year I was first elected&#151;businesses in my constituency paid just under &#163;45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million in business rates, but we in South Gloucestershire received &#163;53 million. So in 1997&#150;98, we were net beneficiaries by &#163;8 million of the business rate system; those figures come from a written answer provided to me by the Department concerned. It has all gone wrong since then, because in every succeeding year we have put more into the national pot than we have taken out. In 1998&#150;99, there was an immediate swing: local businesses paid nearly &#163;60 million, but received only just over &#163;55&nbsp;million. There was, as it were, a &#163;4 million tax on South Gloucestershire businesses&#151;money that they paid in tax that did not benefit the local community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para4"><a name="stpa_5">Time would permit me to go through each succeeding year, but I shall not. Suffice it to say that in each and every year since then there has been a substantial South Gloucestershire tax&#151;a levy on our businesses, money that did not return to the local area. I am delighted to see that my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), has joined us; he will want to make a lengthy contribution to the debate. The extent to which South Gloucestershire businesses overpay business 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
rates&#151;that is, pay money that does not benefit South Gloucestershire&#151;has knock-on effects on the area of Gloucestershire that he covers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para5"><a name="stpa_6">So the tax was &#163;4 million in 1998. Things got very bad in 2001&#150;02, when the tax became &#163;14 million. In this place, we toss figures such as &#163;14 million around as though they were spare change, but in the context of the budget of a local authority which, as I shall say repeatedly, is one of the worst funded in the country for other elements of local authority funding, &#163;14 million is a huge sum.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para6"><a name="stpa_7">I am not making a party political point; the council is run in a joint administration by all three political parties. This year, the all-party council signed up to a budget that involved getting rid of travel tokens for disabled people, which had been in place for a long time. That has been controversial locally, but it is the kind of difficult choice forced on that local authority because of its very tight financial position. Those business rates that we do not get back really matter.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para7"><a name="stpa_8">In the most recent year for which figures are available&#151;the current year&#151;it is estimated that &#163;11 million more is paid by local businesses than is received from the national pot. The issue is a running sore. Cumulatively&#151;I am sure you were wondering what the cumulative figure was, Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humble&#151;&#163;53 million more has been taken from South Gloucestershire businesses than was given back to South Gloucestershire people since the Government came to power. To give an idea of the scale, that is more money than was stolen in the Bank of England heist&#151;it is that kind of rip-off. That huge amount of money goes out of the local community and does not come back.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para8"><a name="stpa_9">I have been doing a bit of investigation to try to work out why that has been. What has caused that switch around? One of my local councillors&#151;Councillor Dave Hockey&#151;raised the issue with me. He said, &quot;Did you realise that all this money is going out of the area on business rates?&quot; I said that he was not right, because I had asked a question in Parliament and found that, surprisingly enough, we were net recipients. I had asked the question four or five years previously. The first time I asked, we had been net recipients. I thought that surprising, because we had low unemployment and lots of business; one would have imagined that we would not have been. I just left the issue alone. It was through the assiduousness of one of my councillors, who said, &quot;Go and have another look&quot;, that I realised how much things had changed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para9"><a name="stpa_10">Why have they changed? Back in 1997&#150;98, local businesses were paying &#163;45 million in business rates. This year, they are paying double that&#151;&#163;93 million. That is strange, because official Government policy is that business rates do not go up by more than inflation each year. In a sense, the answer to that is obvious when one thinks about it. However, on the face of it, business rate increases each year, in terms of the rate poundage, are capped by retail price inflation. How can it be that businesses are paying double over a period of just eight or nine years?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para10"><a name="stpa_11">Two things are going on. First, I think I am right in saying that business rate revaluation happens every five years, so we are probably on our second revaluation over the period. In a growing area where business land is in short supply, rates have gone up substantially. However, I am still astonished that the burden has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
doubled, because the revenue that we have got back has gone up by only 60 per cent. That is the root of the problem; the bill has more than doubled.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para11"><a name="stpa_12">Not only South Gloucestershire is involved, although it is particularly affected by the phenomenon; other parts of the country are also affected. Across the country as a whole, Greater London is the only standard region that pays more than it receives. That will not surprise the House unduly. It is not the whole of Greater London&#151;outer London is a net recipient&#151;but inner London, and the particular cases of the City of London and Westminster. I am reliably informed that Westminster pays more in business rates than the whole of Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool put together, so there are clearly very big imbalances. I pre-empt any criticism that I might end up with some very simplistic recommendation by saying that simply arguing that we should retain business rates locally is not of itself a sufficient response, because there are very big imbalances. I accept that point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para12"><a name="stpa_13">I feel in a slightly Bob Geldof mood this morning. I do not mean exactly, &quot;Give us your money&quot;, but &quot;At least give us our money&quot;, or &quot;Give us some of our money&quot;&#151;that would be a start. I am a very modest man. I do not say, &quot;Give us your money&quot;, but &quot;Give us some of our money.&quot; That would be nice.
</p>






<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60228h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I thank my near neighbour for giving way and I am sorry that I missed the first minute of what he said. My only disagreement&#151;the hon. Gentleman has not come on to this&#151;is that it is not the district&#039;s money. The money should be restituted to where it comes from, which is the immediate area. I have always believed&#151;to be fair, the Government considered this issue in their review of business rates&#151;that at least part of the money should go back to the relevant parish or town, where there are representative bodies. Where I live, in Stonehouse, there is the bulk of the industry. It is a running sore that we put all the value into the local economy, but get nothing out of it. Does the hon. Gentleman agree? He is a new localist, surely.
</p>






<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60228h01_spnew2"><b> Steve Webb </b> : I am grateful for that comment. Obviously, the issue does not arise in quite the same way. South Gloucestershire is a unitary authority, so there is not the same issue between county and district as in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s area. However, there is an issue about towns and parishes, and if the Government are willing to address the point about locally raised money being spent locally, there might well be an argument for going further, to the towns and parishes. That is an interesting point.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para13"><a name="stpa_14">As I say, not only South Gloucestershire is involved, but the City of London, Westminster and other parts of inner London. How does the system work at the moment? Since 1990&#150;91, central Government have set the rate, which applies to the local tax base&#151;the rateable value of non-domestic properties. The money is sent centrally and allocated per capita&#151;although that is something of a simplification, as is everything in local government finance, given that there are issues about multi-tier authorities, police authorities and so on. Broadly speaking, the money returns per capita and not according to where the business activity is.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 4WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para14"><a name="stpa_15">Someone who is concerned about social justice, such as myself, might say, &quot;Why are you moaning? Is business not a good thing? Jobs are good news. You should be glad that you have the jobs. Stop complaining and talk about something else.&quot; However, it is not that simple. Although I welcome the fact that unemployment in my constituency is below the national average and that we have had prosperity&#151;they are obviously good things&#151;businesses and rapid economic growth bring costs as well as benefits. Today, I am asking for the system more accurately to reflect the costs of growth and not simply its benefits.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para15"><a name="stpa_16">What are the costs? One of the constant headaches in our area is the lack of infrastructure. I always think that my constituency is the nicest place in the country in which to live. The quality of life, the environment and so on are some of the things that make that the case. Judging by letters that I receive and people&#039;s complaints, the traffic congestion, the difficulty of getting affordable housing and other such issues sometimes make it not the nicest place in which to live. All those matters are exacerbated by rapid economic growth. In a sense, steady economic growth is far more manageable, but that is not what has taken place in South Gloucestershire. There has been rapid growth, thousands of new houses have been built and the infrastructure has not kept up. Had the business rates money been retained locally to a greater extent we could have done much more to accommodate the growth.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para16"><a name="stpa_17">Let us consider traffic congestion. Each time another business park is built there are huge traffic implications: major highways works and so on. The roads network simply cannot expand fast enough; nor indeed should it. Dealing effectively with traffic congestion has been a huge ongoing issue. There is an area known locally as the north fringe of Bristol&#151;that winds up the people of South Gloucestershire greatly, because it is in South Gloucestershire, although we all know where we are talking about. It has a lot of employment and it will have thousands more houses because of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s intervention. It has gridlock at certain times of day. When the council tries to reroute anything or change the phasing of the traffic lights, it often makes matters worse. Such things cannot be fixed on the cheap. Dealing with the highways infrastructure and the consequences of business growth is a long-term job that requires serious investment. If more of the business rates were retained locally, there would be a better match between the additional jobs, the revenue that comes from those rates and the costs that follow.
</p>






<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60228h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Eric Pickles  (Brentwood and Ongar)</b>  (Con): I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis, but I am unclear whether he is talking about retaining locally a greater proportion of the business rate&#151;a specified sum in respect of growth&#151;or the whole of the business rate. The Government&#039;s scheme redistributes it around the country. If it is not redistributed, certain parts will never have sufficient funds to deal with their economic needs. How would he address those things?
</p>






<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60228h01_spnew4"><b> Steve Webb </b> : I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#039;s intervention. I tend to look upon my speeches as the equivalent of a thriller novel: they build gradually to the exciting denouement. He might be the sort of person who turns straight to the back page to find out

<br>&nbsp;<br>
whodunnit. If he bears with me, I will address his point, although I will give him a teaser in respect of my conclusion so as not to keep him in suspense too much.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para17"><a name="stpa_18">Essentially there should be wholesale local retention of business rates but with some sort of equalisation mechanism to offset the extremes that would result. The consequences would be a substantial rebalancing of funding, which is currently far too centralised, but with local discretion at the margins. That is what I would like, but I will return to the point in more detail later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para18"><a name="stpa_19">Infrastructure costs result from rapid business growth. Planning is perhaps a neglected topic, in the sense that every council has a planning department. South Gloucestershire&#039;s planning department assesses major projects such as highways schemes and business park developments. It deals not just with Mrs. Jones&#039;s home extension but with things that have knock-on effects for the whole area, the local plan and the entire strategy. That is a big job. The planning department has, at times, been completely swamped by large applications. The process needs to be resourced properly. Clearly, as there is a lot of industry and business in the area, there are big issues about waste disposal and other environmental concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para19"><a name="stpa_20">There are also big knock-on effects on public transport. Clearly, and quite properly, we cannot just build our way out of the roads problem by constructing yet more roads, as to do so would change the character of the area. It is far better to give people realistic alternatives. Public transport is grossly underfunded in South Gloucestershire. The authority has no natural centre; the centre is outside the authority, in Bristol. People travel into Bristol but they do so by travelling across the authority. They travel to the north fringe of Bristol&#151;the south fringe of South Gloucestershire. The situation does not lend itself to cheap public transport. It is not as if everyone lives on the outskirts of the big city and goes in to work, and all we need is a series of bus routes in and out. A much more messy set of public transport arrangements are needed, involving arterial and cross-country routes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para20"><a name="stpa_21">There are also many people living in relatively small towns and villages, and many of the public transport services are simply uneconomical. The provision of one commuter bus in the morning and one in the evening for people who live in a small village might be all that is economical. Yet, a bus service cannot be run on that basis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para21"><a name="stpa_22">Substantial knock-on effects are involved. South Gloucestershire has an extremely high level of car ownership, so more businesses and jobs mean either massive congestion or serious investment in public transport. We have not really received that investment. Retaining the business rates would enable South Gloucestershire to do more work in that area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para22"><a name="stpa_23">I want to mention one further cost, which is not an obvious one despite its importance: the cost of housing. One might imagine that lots of businesses, jobs and growth would mean lots of people with lots of money who could afford to buy their new Barratt homes on the big new estates. One might imagine that there is no problem. However, what happens is that people move into the area because of the jobs and buy up the houses, because they can afford to do so. That has consequences for the local sons and daughters, for local families and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 6WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
for people in rented accommodation. There is a dearth of rented accommodation, because owner-occupation is high, partly because of the jobs and the prosperity. Affordable housing is also in short supply, because the buying power of the people moving in for the jobs is substantial.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para23"><a name="stpa_24">How does the council meet the housing need of the people who are not part of the process that I am discussing? How does it ensure that sons and daughters can afford to get a foot on the housing ladder? Surprisingly, for a prosperous area such as the one I represent, one of the biggest issues that people come to see me about every week is the lack of affordable housing to rent or to buy. That would not be obvious to an outsider. It would be easy to think that lots of jobs mean that people can afford houses and that there is no problem. However, housing is one of our biggest problems. Were we able to retain more business rates locally, the council, in partnership with housing associations or whoever, would be able to do more to ensure a better supply of affordable housing in the area. The jobs and so on are not unalloyed good news.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para24"><a name="stpa_25">There is a sting in the tail. The other thing that people say is, &quot;You get all these jobs and people moving in, so the council must be rolling in it.&quot; When a new house is built the people who move in pay council tax. However, let us consider what the funding formula does. It examines how much can be raised in council tax from all the houses and how short that amount is of what is needed, and it is involved in filling the gap. In other words, every extra house and extra bit of council tax comes off what the Government make available to the local authority in the other bit of the funding formula. Each extra person and extra house does not benefit the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;council at all; the money comes off what the Government give in the revenue support grant or in the formula spending assessment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para25"><a name="stpa_26">It gets worse. People then say, &quot;Hang on a minute. The Government give you back money for every child in your schools and for every elderly person using your social services.&quot; However, when one examines the league tables, one sees that South Gloucestershire is ranked either second or third from bottom in the entire country for the amount of money per pupil in its schools, the amount of money for elderly people needing social care and so on. It is the infamous triple whammy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para26"><a name="stpa_27">Businesses come into the area, but there is a proportion of the authority&#039;s money that we never see. The council tax revenue is simply knocked off what the Government give, so we do not see that. The cost of educating each new child and looking after all elderly people is greater than the money that central Government give to pay for education and care. We make a loss on each person who moves into South Gloucestershire. It is an indisputable fact that population growth is a loss-making activity there. The argument of, &quot;Jobs are great. You are a prosperous area. Tough&#151;go and whinge somewhere else&quot;, does not stack up. Things are much more complicated than that. That is why there is a strong case, particularly in South Gloucestershire, for greater retention of local business rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para27"><a name="stpa_28">Let us consider the Government&#039;s thinking and what consultation they have carried out. Obviously, they undertook their own balance-of-funding review. The issue was critical. It was about how much of the council 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 7WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
tax that is raised locally was spent locally. At the moment, to put it crudely, it is about a quarter. To put it roughly, business rates amount to a fifth to a quarter of council spending on average. If we were to relocalise business rates, instead of raising locally a quarter of what is spent locally, the amount would be about a half. I consider, as the Minister probably does, that raising locally only a fifth to a quarter of the money that is spent locally is the wrong balance to strike.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para28"><a name="stpa_29">The Government do not set up a balance-of-funding review if they do not sense that the balance has swung too far and that there is too much central control and not enough local discretion. Clearly, we are talking about a continuum and there is no exact right figure, but relocalising business rates could lead to a fairer, more equitable balance of funding&#151;half local, half national.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para29"><a name="stpa_30">The House will not be astonished to learn that, when the review consulted, almost all local authorities wanted relocalisation, to change the balance of funding and to reduce what is called the gearing problem. The House will know that, when a local authority needs to raise extra money, it cannot do so through the half that it receives in block grant from central Government, because that is fixed. It cannot raise the extra money from the quarter that it receives in business rates, because that is fixed. So the &#163;1 on the whole budget becomes &#163;4 on the quarter that is raised locally. In other words, the gearing problem is that 1 per cent. on the whole budget becomes 4 per cent. on the council tax.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para30"><a name="stpa_31">If the council could get some of the money through the council tax and some of it through the business rates, the gearing would become not 1:4, but 1:2. In other words, marginal increases become less of a hit on council tax payers and marginal cuts become less of a benefit to council tax payers, but such matters are less acutely focused on one particular sector, and that must be right. It is another advantage of relocalising the business rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para31"><a name="stpa_32">One argument for relocalisation is that local authorities that are depending directly on businesses for revenue have more incentive to work closely with them. History does not show that that has always been the case. Before 1990, one of the reasons why business rates were nationalised&#151;it is funny to think of the Thatcher Government nationalising things&#151;was the feeling that local authorities were a bit out of control in respect of what they were doing to businesses and that some of the increases were arbitrary. It was felt that increases were sometimes large and unpredictable and that, because businesses did not vote, they were a soft target. I understand such arguments and I shall return to them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para32"><a name="stpa_33">Over the 15 years since, there has been a cultural change. There is clear evidence that local authorities see it as their role to work closely with local businesses. Economic development partnerships and strategic partnerships are now much more in the warp and weft of what local government does, so there is much less anxiety that a reckless, malicious local government would fling taxes on businesses because it was easy to do so, with no regard for the consequences.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 8WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para33"><a name="stpa_34">Understandably, the business community has its reservations about allowing local authorities to set business rates without let or hindrance. One argument that is often used is that businesses do not vote, so why should local authorities be allowed to levy the tax and be in the position of taxation without representation? The fact that local authorities can tax businesses, but businesses cannot vote them out would be an argument against corporation tax. Businesses do not vote in national elections either, but we still tax them, so I am not sure that that argument stacks up. As well as being council tax payers and private citizens, the voters are employers, employees, shareholders and consumers and all have an interest in a prosperous local economy. The local electorate is not indifferent to the level of business rates, so the argument is not straightforward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para34"><a name="stpa_35">Clearly, we need to avoid arbitrary changes and huge swings. Business needs a certain amount of stability and predictability. I shall come back to the safeguards. As I agreed with the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) by implication, there would need to be an alternative sort of equalisation. For example, if Westminster City council were allowed to retain its business rates, it would be paying citizens to live here because of the amount that it would raise. Obviously that would be an absurd extreme. The City of London could be paying for world cruises. Matters are not as simple as that, but an equalisation mechanism could still allow local authorities to determine what business rate local businesses could bear and what was appropriate for the services that they have to provide because of the presence of rapidly growing businesses, and that is what I am arguing for.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para35"><a name="stpa_36">The Local Government Association said that, when the national business rate system was introduced, 29 per cent. of all council spending came from business rates. Now the amount is 20 per cent., so it has fallen from just under a third to a fifth. No one is suggesting that there should be a huge shift, but that change has happened partly because of the inflation cap on business rates and partly because of huge hikes in council tax. It has meant that, within the local economy, far less is now being borne directly by business. Speaking as an economist, I say that in one sense business does not exist. It is shareholders, employees or customers. Any tax will ultimately be incident on the consumers, the employees or the shareholders. To say that so much of the tax is on business is slightly a misnomer. I hope that hon. Members understand what I mean by that.
</p>






<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60228h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Pickles </b> : As he has reminded me that he was an economist, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will consider my question easy to answer. Assuming that we accept his plan for a more modest redistribution, what additional amount would the Government have to put in to ensure that the poor parts of the United Kingdom received a sum equal to their needs?

<a name="60228h01_para36"><a name="stpa_37">The proportion of local tax paid by business has now fallen to a fifth. Many people would consider that that has not been a carefully planned, calculated, long-term strategy, but that it has just happened. It has been the year-by-year consequence of substantial above-inflation council tax rises and nominally, at least, inflation-linked business rate raises.
</p>






<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60228h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : The hon. Gentleman has not mentioned the rural domain where there has been a careful plan to keep businesses in place by reducing business rates substantially, half through central Government and up to half through local authorities. That is vital in the sense that it is often why some businesses can stay in operation. I do not want him to lose the thought that there is a planned way in which to operate business rates, although it is a bit more confusing. It is wrong to consider that it is an urban model. We need a level of subsidy for rural businesses, otherwise they will go out of business. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees.
</p>






<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60228h01_spnew8"><b> Steve Webb </b> : The rural post offices that have survived in my constituency have benefited from business rate relief, as have small shops. In many ways, greater local discretion on such things enables local authorities to be more responsive to precisely those sorts of local needs, instead of there being a national system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para37"><a name="stpa_38">If there was a worry that it would be unacceptable to allow councils free rein to jack up the business rates as much as they wanted&#151;and, perhaps, to keep council tax down as a result&#151;what sort of safeguards could we have? Various options have been considered. The balance-of-funding review came up with something. One interesting suggestion is to link council tax increases to business rates increases. That would mean that councils would not be free to jack up the business rates just because businesses do not vote, and to freeze the council tax, because any decision about increasing business rates would have a consequent effect on the electorate&#151;albeit that increases would be more fairly shared. I am not unsympathetic to that kind of idea. I do not in general like shackling local discretion, but if there is an anxiety that history has shown that total freedom has been misused, there might be at least a transitional need for some sort of link.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para38"><a name="stpa_39">There might also be some mandatory consultation process with business, although I am slightly sceptical about that, because businesses have felt in the past in respect of business rates that they went to consultation meetings and then everything went through exactly as it did before. Therefore, I am not sure how one could enforce mandatory consultation that actually changed anything.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para39"><a name="stpa_40">There could be intermediate options between having a national rate, as at present, and an entirely local rate. Getting rid of the inflation cap on the national rate would help to offset the imbalance between council tax and business rates. Some element of growth money could be retained locally&#151;I will come on to that topic shortly&#151;or there could be a national rate for large businesses, for consistency across the country, but a variable rate for small business. Therefore, various reform options could be considered.

<p>
<a name="60228h01_para40"><a name="stpa_41">What conclusion did the balance-of-funding review come to&#151;other than that there needed to be another review, of course? One option was that local authorities might be allowed, at the margins, to keep some of the growth money; the local authority business growth incentive scheme was mentioned. I must admit that I had forgotten about that scheme until I did a bit of research. I remember sitting in the House in November 2002 and hearing the Chancellor talk about it. His pre-Budget report of that year stated that the Government intended to explore ways to build on local government reforms by allowing


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;local authorities to retain some or all of any increases in business rates revenue to spend on their own priorities.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para41"><a name="stpa_42">I remember sitting in the House in November 2002 and thinking, &quot;At last we have a local government finance reform that might benefit South Gloucestershire.&quot; Little did I know! The pre-Budget report went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;Under any proposals, the additional revenue would come from increases in the tax base generated by local authorities successfully encouraging growth, and not from increasing the tax on existing business.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para42"><a name="stpa_43">In other words, this scheme was not going to be about local authorities putting up taxes; it was going to be about local authorities encouraging growth and keeping some of the fruits of growth. In November 2002, I thought, &quot;It is great that this has been announced by the Chancellor. It probably needs to be announced another four times at six-monthly intervals, but then it will happen.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para43"><a name="stpa_44">Nothing happened for rather a long time. Then, the following summer, we had a consultation paper on the scheme. It came up with various criteria that the scheme should adopt. The first was to give


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;local authorities an incentive to maximise local economic growth&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para44"><a name="stpa_45">Occasionally, I want to add the word &quot;sustainable&quot; to such phrases&#151;but that subject is, perhaps, for another day. The second was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;that the scheme should give local authorities additional revenues to spend on their own priorities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para45"><a name="stpa_46">We are all in favour of that. The next principle was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;that the incentive should be consistent with Government aims for growth in all regions of the country and reductions in the persistent gap in performance between regions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para46"><a name="stpa_47">That is an interesting principle because&#151;to stray slightly&#151;part of the reason why we have such growth in South Gloucestershire is the imbalance in the national economy. Personally, I think that too much growth is being forced on an already overheated area, with some of the costs that we have been talking about. Another principle is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;that the scheme should be as intelligible and transparent as possible.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>

In July 2005&#151;more than two years later&#151;the final details of the local authority business growth incentive scheme were produced, which I thought was great because, at last, councils were going to get to keep some of their business rate growth money. In July 2005, the Minister for Local Government 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 11WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
explained how the scheme would work. The main aspects were summarised in the accompanying press release:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;Business growth will be measured in terms of the increase in a local authority&#039;s rateable value during a calendar year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para49"><a name="stpa_50">That is a reasonable way of doing that. It also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">&quot;The starting point .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will be their rateable value&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para50"><a name="stpa_51">at the end of December 2004. Next, the press release went into local government finance mode:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">&quot;Each authority will have a &#039;floor&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para51"><a name="stpa_52">That is a target; this scheme is about giving local government more discretion, and the first thing the Government do is set a target. They say that each authority will have a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;target level of rateable value growth that must be reached to gain from&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para52"><a name="stpa_53">the scheme. But it is not as simple as that: an authority will have a floor, which


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;will be the baseline minus a national adjustment factor&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para53"><a name="stpa_54">Therefore, we have a target, a floor, a baseline and a national adjustment, despite the fact that this scheme is meant to give local authorities more control.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para54"><a name="stpa_55">There is also a scaling factor:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;A scaling factor of 70 per cent. will be applied to all revenues gained above the floor to calculate the amount of revenue that can be retained locally.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para55"><a name="stpa_56">However, there is a ceiling, which is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;the maximum revenue that an authority can keep&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para56"><a name="stpa_57">That


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;will be based on a modified form of the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) part of Formula Spending Share (FSS).&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para57"><a name="stpa_58">We should remember that the criteria for that are that the scheme should be &quot;intelligible and transparent&quot;. The press release states that that will be phased in as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;The level of the ceilings for the first three years of the scheme will be 3 per cent., 6 per cent. and 9 per cent. respectively, of modified EPCS FSS.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para58"><a name="stpa_59">In a sense, I do not care&#151;if we get some money, I just do not care. The press release then goes on to mention &quot;two-tier areas&quot; and so forth.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para59"><a name="stpa_60">The press release then includes a statement on which I would be grateful to hear the Minister&#039;s response, because I would like to know what it means for South Gloucestershire. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;Authorities that fail to retain money under the scheme will be re-based, to give them a fair and meaningful challenge in the next year, and a new lower floor will be calculated, determined from their new starting point.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para60"><a name="stpa_61">What does that mean for South Gloucestershire? In February 2006, the money was announced: 250 local authorities got money out of this scheme. It is precisely the sort of thing that I am talking about&#151;growth, and local authorities keeping some of their business rates. Money was given to 250 authorities&#151;the amount was about &#163;100 million&#151;but South Gloucestershire got nil. This is what I thought: how can a scheme be devised for fast-growing authorities to help them retain more of their business rates, and we get nothing?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 12WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para61"><a name="stpa_62">I have come up with Webb&#039;s law of local government finance, which is that every reform of it produces the worst possible outcome for South Gloucestershire. I have discovered since I became an MP that that is an immutable law. When the Chancellor announced the scheme in November 2002, I could not conceive of any authority in the country failing to gain&#151;and I thought that if any authority would gain, it would be mine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para62"><a name="stpa_63">I hope that the Minister can explain what happens now. I presume that this is what has happened: we have had year after year of rapid growth, but at the moment when that was measured, our growth had decelerated. I will not call for a retrospective business growth incentive scheme, because that would go against the transparency and coherence point, but I hope that Members are beginning to see where I am coming from. We have had years of rapid growth, with its associated costs, and yet the system has not reflected that. Now that South Gloucestershire has not qualified under this year&#039;s scheme, will it be easier for it to qualify next year&#151;or not? I do not understand whether that will be the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para63"><a name="stpa_64">I query the scheme&#151;and that is not only because we did not get any money out of it. It feels like a classic case of people saying, &quot;We&#039;ve got the balance-of-funding review, and then we&#039;ve got another review&#151;the Lyons inquiry&#151;so we can&#039;t make any decisions about anything, so we will just fiddle around the edge.&quot; This has all the hallmarks of the Chancellor having created yet another fiendishly complex scheme that has a whole set of bureaucracy&#151;administration, central targets and so forth, which will no doubt need to be abolished once we have some sort of relocalisation&#151;and I think that the philosophy behind it is very peculiar. What is it saying exactly? Is it saying that local authorities should grant more planning permissions for new businesses, so that they get to keep some of the business rates? That would be a strange incentive mechanism. I am not entirely sure what authorities are meant to do that they are not already doing. Local authorities promote local enterprise; what additional things are they supposed to do to try to generate extra money? What is the incentive mechanism? What is the scheme trying to incentivise? I am not clear on that.

Gentleman agree that one way to cut through a lot of the problems would be to do what we are starting to do with housing development&#151;although the Government have been taken there kicking and screaming&#151;which is to consider an element of land value taxation? It should be put formally on the table that what is wrong with this country is that we have never taxed land fairly and effectively. That is as true for business as for housing development. The Government are on to something in considering a planning gain supplement, although they have not gone all the way. Does the hon.

term. My priority, as the hon. Gentleman will gather, is to try to do something more immediate about the real financial crisis faced by local authorities&#151;well, by my local authority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para64"><a name="stpa_65">So, is it just me? Are we talking about special pleading from one local authority? Actually, we are not: paragraph 160 of a 2003&#150;04 report by the all-party Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister says, in the context of relocalising business rates, that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;In the Committee&#039;s view it must be a priority to make a change in the balance of funding.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para65"><a name="stpa_66">The Committee concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;The Committee therefore recommends that the Government returns business rates to local authority control as soon as possible, but no later than 1 April 2006.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para66"><a name="stpa_67">I know that the Department likes to follow the Select Committee&#039;s recommendations, so it has a busy month ahead if it is to meet that deadline.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para67"><a name="stpa_68">We are not just talking about the special pleading of one local authority; the issue is bigger than that. It is about the balance of funding between central and local government, which has got out of kilter. An all-party Committee, representing all parts of the country, thought that that would be the right structural change. It so happens that, in my judgment, such a change would benefit my area, but there are also good conceptual arguments for it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para68"><a name="stpa_69">So where are we now? The Lyons review considered the same issues once again and, funnily enough, came up with many of the same answers as the previous review. Interestingly, Sir Michael Lyons said that not all businesses opposed the relocalisation of business rates. There are two reasons why some businesses actually supported it. First, some of them wanted local discretion for funding transport, road improvements and regeneration; I did not mention regeneration because it is not a particularly big issue in my area, but clearly it is in some parts of the country. Secondly, there is a feeling among businesses that links with local authorities have weakened since business rates became national, because there is no need for that dialogue, and that has tended to undermine those relationships. But still we are waiting.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para69"><a name="stpa_70">In conclusion&#151;I hope that I have not deprived anyone of the chance of contributing to the debate&#151;if someone came to the issue cold, they might think, &quot;Don&#039;t be ridiculous; you&#039;re talking about a prosperous area. It has plenty of money, and people there don&#039;t have any problems. Just leave it alone&quot;, but if they looked at the matter in a bit more detail, they would realise that things are not that simple. They would realise that jobs and prosperity are great, but come with an infrastructure cost that is not being met, and that every additional person who moves into South Gloucestershire is a net drain on its exchequer. That is a strange situation: the Government are setting up an incentive scheme to encourage local authorities to generate business growth, yet when the local authority gets business growth, it loses money. That cannot be right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para70"><a name="stpa_71">Sorting out South Gloucestershire&#039;s problem will be part of a bigger structural reform that, as the Select Committee said, has its own justifications. We should make the balance of funding more even, so it is not three quarters to one quarter, but half and half; that would be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 14WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
much better. We should try to have a system whereby local communities, and council tax payers who also wear other hats as employers, employees and customers of local businesses, can decide on the right balance for themselves. That has to be right. For too long, under successive Governments, there has been a drift towards central Government telling local government what to do. We should relocalise business rates, with appropriate adjustments for the imbalance of business rate revenue, but should then allow local authorities to change rates at the margin to reflect local priorities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para71"><a name="stpa_72">Perhaps I have made the odd comment that was not wholly appreciative of some Government schemes, so I will end on a note of consensus. All three parties represented here today are apparently in favour of localism. I am reliably informed that the new Conservative leader believes in localism. I do not know whether that is in the pamphlet that he is sending to Conservative party members, but most good things are, as far as I can see. I hope that he is in favour. The Government are the new localisers, I am told, and we are localisers, too, so there is every chance of all-party agreement on the issues that I raised. I hope to go back to south Gloucestershire at the end of the week with that &#163;11 million to give back to the local community.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60228h01_spnew11"><b> Mark Hunter  (Cheadle)</b>  (LD): I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) on raising the subject today and on securing this debate, but I caution him against making too many security arrangements for taking a cheque back with him at the end of the week. One always feels optimism about such matters, but it may be slightly too optimistic to hope that the Government will turn the matter around in that space of time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para72"><a name="stpa_73">It is clear that the issue is of great importance to the community in South Gloucestershire, and the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend are shared by businesses, residents and councils the length and breadth of the country. It is widely accepted that the overall system of local government finance is somewhat discredited, to say the least. After all, if there was no fundamental problem with the system, the Government would not have set up the wide-ranging Lyons review, and it would not have taken so long for that review to report to Parliament. Our debate has highlighted one of the key reasons why the system is in crisis: the lack of control and accountability for the financing of local services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para73"><a name="stpa_74">The fact that local communities and their elected representatives do not determine their own fate when it comes to funding for local services is a major factor in the public&#039;s lack of confidence in local democracy as a whole, and business rates are a shining example of the kind of centralism that stifles much local decision-making. It always seemed strange to me, in the three years when I served as council leader in Stockport, that we were obliged&#151;by law, I believe&#151;to consult the business community when formulating annual budgets, yet whatever was said, and however much the council listened, we could alter neither the rate nor the total amount that we raised from it. That was one of the more bizarre aspects of an already strange system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para74"><a name="stpa_75">There are a number of arguments for retaining the status quo&#151;frankly, there always are&#151;but I have not seen any compelling evidence that shows conclusively

<br>&nbsp;<br>
that businesses would move out of high-rate areas into lower-rate ones. That did not happen when the rates were localised, and I do not believe that it would happen now. Neither do I believe that councils are itching to increase local taxation. In fact, according to the Audit Commission, the steep increases in council tax since 1997 have largely been caused by the gearing and the central control of the system that we are debating. The attitude seems to be that Government believe that local matters are best dealt with from an office in Whitehall, and that denigrates our democratic system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para75"><a name="stpa_76">I find it patronising, at best, to be told that democratically elected representatives are somehow unworthy of, or not to be trusted with, tax-raising powers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon said, local government&#151;I am sure that the Minister will agree&#151;has moved on since the days when Militant Tendency occupied Liverpool city hall, and when councillors might be tempted to let rip with such powers. These days there is a much more professional and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;business-like approach in town halls throughout the country, where local authorities, including the Liberal Democrat one in Liverpool, work closely and constructively with their partners in the commercial sector. Anyway, as we all know, this Government are not afraid to cap.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para76"><a name="stpa_77">A new system of localised business rates could not be implemented overnight. Transitional arrangements could be put in place to offer assurances to businesses. For example, we could start by localising only part of the rate, with the other part remaining linked to inflation, or maintain the national system for large businesses at least in the short term.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para77"><a name="stpa_78">Businesses are an integral part of their community and it would be doing a disservice to local representatives to suggest that they would abuse any powers in this area. Businesses would then have a much greater stake in their local authority. Safeguards can be applied to the system, by linking business rate levels to council tax increases, for example, if that is required, once the two systems have converged. By localising rates in this way, we would be restoring accountability to the system and encouraging responsibility.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para78"><a name="stpa_79">The fact is that my party is asking not for more but for fairer taxation. Recent trends mean that the burden of local authority finance has been shifting away from businesses to council tax payers, and it falls disproportionately on those in our community who are least equipped to pay it. It is not just that businesses in South Gloucestershire are being ripped off; what really rankles is the fact that pensioners and people on low and fixed incomes are paying for that.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="60228h01_spnew13"><b> Mark Hunter </b> : I thank the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) for his intervention, but my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has already indicated that these issues can be dealt with via the equalisation mechanism, which would be necessary. In any event, if the point of what I am trying to put across today is not clear by the end of my remarks, I should be happy to converse further with the hon. Gentleman.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para79"><a name="stpa_80">It rankles with us that people on low and fixed incomes are paying for all this. On a very limited scale, raising money from businesses at a local level, through business improvement districts, has proved successful and I do not see why those successes cannot be repeated more widely.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para80"><a name="stpa_81">There is a risk involved in changing a policy like this, but I believe the Government should be bold in handing powers back to local authorities. We have heard plenty of rhetoric from Ministers about the localism agenda and empowering communities, but that is about as far as it has gone. Local government has seen creeping centralisation for far too long and, as a result of that centralisation and the gearing effect, council tax for the vast majority of people is spiralling.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para81"><a name="stpa_82">I hope that when Lyons finally reports, he will take on board views like the ones expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon this morning, because after all, one of his key tasks is to restore confidence in the system of local government finance, and reallocating business rates to local councils would be an excellent place to start.

I commend his criticism and his urging the Government to be bold in returning powers to local authorities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para83"><a name="stpa_84">One of the highlights of my recess was listening to the <i>Today</i> programme, when the Minister of Communities and Local Government introduced double devolution. It was immensely interesting to hear that, as he moved from <i>Today</i> to <i>The World at One</i> and <i>PM, </i>the right hon. Gentleman was faced with the same question&#151;&quot;Which powers are the Government proposing to devolve to local authorities?&quot;&#151;which touches on local government finance and the business rate. I did not have the opportunity to listen to <i>The World Tonight</i>, but by the end of <i>PM, </i>he was not capable of giving a single example. I suppose that if one is in charge of such immense powers, it is sometimes difficult to let go.

<p>
<a name="60228h01_para84"><a name="stpa_85">I thought that the hon. Member for Northavon was courageous&#151;so much so that I am sure his statements will appear in numerous copies of <i>In Touch&#151;</i>when talking about redistribution under his proposals. At one point, I thought that he was suggesting that an additional sum of money was to be put in the pot by the Government to take care of the equalisation problem. However, the hon. Member for Cheadle assured me that that was not the case, so it must be the reverse; we must be dealing with a set sum.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para85"><a name="stpa_86">The hon. Gentleman talked about transitional relief, which must mean that net recipients will receive less and there will, perhaps, need to be a cushioning effect&#151;perhaps a floor&#151;which he criticised so regularly in relation to additional economic growth. There must be a floor, which means that over a period of years the poorer parts of the country will receive less financial help. That is a brave statement, particularly when&#151;I am looking at the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#151;the hon. Gentleman seems to be targeting Labour seats. The red rose may be featuring in this particular thing. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman is a great man, and if we can get his words around the nation, so much the better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para86"><a name="stpa_87">I return for a moment to what the hon. Gentleman was saying with regard to local authorities being the beneficiaries of new business. He was right to say that the comprehensive performance assessment form is a little bit complex and is difficult to fill in, but he has to understand that there is a problem of management that does not just relate to new economic growth, which is almost exactly mirrored in the CPA regime. South Gloucestershire has almost certainly lost out where a number of authorities lose out: it is impossible in the forms to put the information in any kind of context.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para87"><a name="stpa_88">The hon. Member for Northavon talks about his local authority having a process of growth, which has not been taken into account when it arrives at a particular point. One often sees that in the CPA forms, because one cannot work out precisely where an authority has come from in order to give the appropriate rating. That can be done within the form to assess the economic growth; however, although the direction of travel can be worked out, the speed cannot. If South Gloucestershire is given another base, it would probably take three or four times before that captures what is happening, by which time the process would have moved on again. There is a legitimate criticism to be made in respect of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para88"><a name="stpa_89">The hon. Members for Cheadle and for Northavon were a bit sniffy about the business rates consultation. I am old enough to remember the old system. I participated in the last rates consultation when business rates were localised, and I participated in the first one thereafter. In the last one, everyone demanded a lower increase in the business rate and in the next one they demanded a higher increase in the domestic rates. It was an interesting experience.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para89"><a name="stpa_90">I think that what divides the good authorities from the bad is whether they treat the rates consultation meeting as a straightforward decision about how much to put up the council tax. The good ones treat it almost like a &quot;state of the nation&quot;; they try to work closely with their business communities, they lay out their plans and the ways in which they want to take the authority forward and consider ways of helping local business. As the hon. Members for Northavon and for Cheadle said, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 18WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
no serious local authority can expect to be able to offer prosperity to its citizens unless it works closely with the business community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para90"><a name="stpa_91">I was kind of interested&#151;or rather, I was beyond interested; I was fascinated beyond belief&#151;by the lack of commitment to site value rating. It took a prompting from the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) to elicit from the hon. Member for Northavon some general support for site value rating. I think it would be fair to say that unless the balance of funding is properly addressed, any problems in our current financial system will almost certainly be exaggerated. Firms in an area where land values are higher, such as local high streets, will end up with much larger tax bills, which will put many firms out of business and encourage new development on cheaper greenfield sites. I see the Minister nodding. It will also mean that two pieces of land of the same size in the same area will be taxed equally, irrespective of the use to which they are put. So, for example, a garage development would pay the same as a next-door office block of the same floor size. That does not strike me as terribly sensible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para91"><a name="stpa_92">I must commend to the House the comments of the Liberal Democrat housing spokesman in 2002&#151;I have had a temporary lapse and cannot remember his constituency&#151;who said:

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para94"><a name="stpa_95">The hon. Member for Northavon mentioned being a little uncertain about why the amount collected in business rates had gone up. No doubt he was very clear in his mind about the Government&#039;s undertaking, in statements to Parliament, that the business rates would be revenue-neutral. That clearly has not been the case, as the hon. Gentleman, I think, hinted. There has been a 7.4 per cent. increase in real terms, in the process of revaluation of the business rate. The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that that is quite an important part of business expenditure. In fact, the business rate is the third largest sum that a local business must put out, after 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 19WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
wages and rent. It is to be regretted that such a rapid change&#151;particularly in areas that have enjoyed considerable economic growth since the last revaluation&#151;was not cushioned with a subsidy from central Government, as has been normal. Business rates have been higher this year for medium and large firms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para95"><a name="stpa_96">We spoke a while ago about complexity with reference to councils&#039; ability to adjust and claim for additional economic growth. All those problems have been mirrored in the low take-up of small business relief; it is suggested that local firms are losing out on half of that. As a result, to finance the transitional relief, the Government have capped the reductions in bills on properties where revalued rateable values have fallen. That is the so-called downward phasing. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said that some firms will be paying almost 50 per cent. more than their true liability and that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">&quot;it is absurd that those whose businesses have suffered and whose rates bills should be reducing, find they have to pay a financial penalty to protect what are usually the more successful businesses from increases in rates bills.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para96"><a name="stpa_97">It is a shame that the small business relief is not automatic. Firms must fill in forms to claim it, discouraging take-up, but the largest multiplier will still automatically be levied on medium and large firms, irrespective of the take-up of small firms. Like the means-testing of benefits, on which the hon. Member for Northavon is a considerable expert, the paperwork will discourage many small businesses from applying. The Government figures reveal that almost half of all small businesses have not anticipated the relief.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para97"><a name="stpa_98">We are now moving into the final phase of the arc that I described. I can understand why all this fuss was created. I look back to the time when I was a council leader. There were firms in local authority areas not far from the one that I represented&#151;Bradford&#151;where firms were so desperate, because of the penal nature of the taxation, that they went to the extraordinary length of removing roofs from factories to avoid it. If that had happened in an authority on which I was a representative, I should have found it deeply shaming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para98"><a name="stpa_99">There was a feeling that the business rates could be squeezed until the pips squeaked. That proved not to be so.I have always felt that the recession that we faced in the steel and textile towns of the north of England was made quicker and deeper by what happened. It was not the cause, because things were going against a trend, but there comes a time when people ask, &quot;Shall we try and go on for a little longer, in case there is an upturn?&quot; and decisions are taken. However, that is ancient history. I do not think that there are many authorities in the country, regardless of political control, that would even contemplate that. We have seen the effects and they are not particularly pretty.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para99"><a name="stpa_100">My party is considering these matters, and I have an official statement to make on its behalf. It is the kind of thing that one reads on the way home, thinking, &quot;This will go down quite well&quot;:

My party is considering the issue, but speaking as an individual, not as a spokesman for my great and glorious party, I think that the day when we repatriate business rates cannot come soon enough. Indeed, there are good and solid economic reasons for repatriating them, but I am not entirely sure that I want to go down the line suggested by the hon. Member for Northavon, because I do not really want to rob the poor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para101"><a name="stpa_102">Before we can make a final decision on this hard issue, we must be clear in our minds about the effect that the balance of funding has on the multiplier. The biggest issue&#151;whether we are talking about business rates, local income tax or council tax&#151;is always resource equalisation. We clearly cannot have the poorest part of the country being starved of resources and the richest part retaining everything, although, in truth, I cannot imagine any political party allowing that to happen, because down that route would lie madness.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para102"><a name="stpa_103">So, the short answer, as we dip towards the end of the arc of the great novel of business rates, is that my party is, as hon.

Although my party is not, at the moment, opposed to returning business rates, it is not saying yes. On the other hand, I am saying yes.

Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) in that regard. I congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb) on securing the debate and particularly on his success in persuading so many colleagues to stay away and allow him the opportunity fully to develop his position and his argument. The debate provides a useful opportunity to discuss the allocation of business rates generally and in the 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 settlements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para103"><a name="stpa_104">The hon. Member for Northavon is particularly concerned that local authorities are unable to keep the business rates that they collect, and I sense that the debate is part of the campaign that he has mounted to return business rates to local authorities, among his other objectives. It was interesting that, speaking for himself, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar agreed with the hon. Member for Northavon, but that he did not quite agree with him when he spoke for the Conservative party. That was quite an interesting balancing act.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para104"><a name="stpa_105">I shall try to outline the Government&#039;s position and their view of the status quo, as well as respond to several of the points that have been raised and set out the way forward. However, in contrast to the hon. Members for Northavon and for Brentwood and Ongar, my conclusion will be no surprise when I arrive at it in a few minutes&#039; time.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para105"><a name="stpa_106">In 2006&#150;07, for the first time, we have announced two-year grant allocations for every local authority in England. We have put a premium on the stability and predictability of funding, so that councils can plan

<br>&nbsp;<br>
ahead for better service delivery. The first full three-year settlement will be introduced alongside the next spending round. In the interests of further stability, we have made grant floors a permanent part of the grant distribution system. Floors guarantee a minimum year-on-year grant increase for all authorities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para106"><a name="stpa_107">South Gloucestershire has benefited from the extra money that we have invested in local services in recent years. For the 10-year period to 2007&#150;08, we have been able to provide South Gloucestershire district council with an average annual increase in general grant of 5.7&nbsp;per cent. in cash terms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para107"><a name="stpa_108">The business rates system makes a significant contribution to the funding of local authorities. However, as far as local authorities are concerned, there is no correlation between the business rate that is collected in their areas and the business rate that is allocated to them. In fact, most authorities are net gainers, benefiting from the large business rate contribution from the City of London, Westminster and some other large authorities, as the hon. Member for Northavon acknowledged

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para108"><a name="stpa_109">Business rates help support all tiers of local government in an area. For the South Gloucestershire area, that means that business rates are provided for South Gloucestershire district council, Avon fire and rescue authority and the Avon and Somerset police authority.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para109"><a name="stpa_110">Before 2006&#150;07, business rates were distributed to authorities on a pound-per-head basis. From 2006&#150;07, they will be distributed under the same formula as revenue support grant.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para110"><a name="stpa_111">It is important to consider not just the distribution of the redistributed business rates but revenue support grant and principal formula police grant. We refer to those three elements collectively as formula grant. From 2006&#150;07, the Government have introduced a new system to distribute formula grant. Under that system, the distribution of formula grant is determined wholly by four elements: relative needs amount, the relative resource amount, the central allocation&#151;an amount per head&#151;and the floor damping scheme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para111"><a name="stpa_112">The relative needs and resource elements should be broadly familiar to hon. Members because the system has long contained formulaic estimates of relative need and relative ability to raise council tax. The central allocation makes explicit what was always implicit in the system&#151;that after taking account of differences in relative needs and resources, some grant is allocated on a per-capita basis. Finally, to ensure that each authority gets a reasonable increase in grant, the Government set a guaranteed minimum percentage increase in grant each year&#151;the floor. The cost of that is met by scaling back grant increases above the floor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para112"><a name="stpa_113">Once we have worked out an authority&#039;s allocation of formula grant, we need to work out how much of each of the elements that make up formula grant an authority receives. We do that as follows. First, we subtract the amount of principal formula police grant, if any, that an authority receives from its formula grant. We then split the remainder into revenue support grant and redistributed business rates, in proportion to the England totals of those elements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para113"><a name="stpa_114">As I explained, every local authority receives a proportion of the redistributed business rates. So in the South Gloucestershire area, the result of all those 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 22WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
calculations is that the district council will receive &#163;41.016 million in redistributed business rates in 2006&#150;07, Avon fire and rescue authority will receive &#163;19.904 million and Avon and Somerset police authority will receive &#163;52.761 million.
</p>






<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60228h01_spnew19"><b> Steve Webb </b> : I am grateful to the Minister and I am following the detail closely, but will he consider the sentence that he has just said? He said that South Gloucestershire would get &#163;41 million back from the business rates, but South Gloucestershire businesses paid &#163;92 million in business rates this year. I have been talking about a gap of &#163;10 million or &#163;11 million hitherto. Is the Minister saying that, from next year, because the reallocation is done on a different basis, there will be a huge gap between the local business rates that are paid and received back?
</p>






<p><a name="st_21"><a name="60228h01_spnew20"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick </b> : I shall discuss what is going to happen when I seek to clarify the issue of the local authority business growth incentive, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para114"><a name="stpa_115">I was going to say that the hon. Gentleman had based much of his speech on the amount of business rates collected by South Gloucestershire and the amount of redistributed business rates that it received. However, I was also going to say that, if we look at the figures for 2004&#150;05, we see that whereas South Gloucestershire businesses contributed just over &#163;84 million to the pool, South Gloucestershire received &#163;68.796 million in redistributed business grants. As the hon. Gentleman says, there was a differential, but South Gloucestershire residents also benefited from the amount of business rates provided for the fire and rescue and the police authority that cover their area. Avon fire and rescue authority received more than &#163;9 million and Avon and Somerset police authority received more than &#163;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million. It is therefore true that South Gloucestershire is a net contributor of business rates to the pool, but the amount is perhaps not as much as hon. Members may have been led to believe.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para115"><a name="stpa_116">The hon. Member for Northavon described the local authority business growth incentive scheme very accurately and fully. The first grants, totalling &#163;110&nbsp;million, have been paid to authorities in 2005&#150;06. As he said, South Gloucestershire received no grant under the scheme in that period. An evaluation of the first year of the scheme is under way and will determine what changes could be made to improve the scheme&#039;s effectiveness. At this time, therefore, there is no precise answer to the hon. Gentleman&#039;s question.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para116"><a name="stpa_117">It is right that local businesses should contribute to the funding of local authorities. It is also right that we should use the grant in the settlement, including redistributed business rates, to ensure that all councils are able to set realistic council tax increases. The most important factor in that is the stability and predictability of Government grant. As I have said previously, we ensure that every authority receives at a least a minimum percentage increase above the previous year&#039;s formula grant, after adjusting for changes in funding and function.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para117"><a name="stpa_118">Under the Conservative Government, if the calculation of an authority&#039;s grant was below the level of the previous years, that authority had to live with it. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 23WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Since 1999&#150;2000, the Government have ensured that every local authority receives at least the same amount of grant as the previous year, on a like-for-like basis. This year we have also provided authorities with grant allocations for two years. That means that they can take both year&#039;s grant settlements into account for their medium-term planning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para118"><a name="stpa_119">I started by saying that the issue was complicated. As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, we have been considering the local government financing system for some time. The arguments that he has put forward in favour of a re-localisation of business grants are not new. In 2004, the balance-of-funding review acknowledged that re-localisation of business rates could give councils greater incentives to promote economic development and improve links with businesses. However, it also noted that businesses had serious concerns, including risks to productivity and competitiveness. They argued that the proposal would be likely to harm relationships between business and local government. The report noted that re-localisation of business rates was not an easy option and that further work would be required.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para119"><a name="stpa_120">Following that review, the Government established an independent inquiry under Sir Michael Lyons to consider the case for changes to the system of local government funding, and to report and make recommendations by the end of 2005. As part of that inquiry, he was asked to assess the case for giving local authorities more flexibility to raise additional revenue, and to analyse options for shifting the balance of funding, including, among others, the reform of business rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para120"><a name="stpa_121">In September 2005, the Government agreed with Sir Michael to extend his inquiry so that it could consider issues relating to the wider functions of local government and its future role, as well as, and prior to, making recommendations on local government funding. Sir Michael will produce his final report at the end of 2006, which will contribute to the comprehensive spending review of 2007.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para121"><a name="stpa_122">The extension to Sir Michael&#039;s inquiry will enable us to make well-informed decisions on local government finance. We believe that we should make changes to local government funding only when we have a clear and complete understanding of what we want local government to do. That understanding must be shared not only by central and local government but by all those who help to deliver services and, most important, by the people whom they serve&#151;the general public. In short, we must settle function before funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para122"><a name="stpa_123">Some of the arguments regarding business rates have been helpfully set out in Sir Michael&#039;s interim report and consultation paper, which was published on 15 December 2005. The Government welcome that publication as a useful contribution to the debate on the future role and function of local government and the way it is funded; however, it is an interim report, not a final one. Sir Michael has not come to firm conclusions, but has set out some of his thinking to date and begun an important process of consultation on the role and function of local government.

setting of business rates and whether business rates should be re-localised. He notes that arguments have been made previously, not least to the balance-of-funding review, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, about the contribution that the re-localisation of business rates could make to changing the balance of funding. Local government has supported that position for some time, although as Sir Michael notes, it too recognises that business rates play an important role in the equalisation system for supporting services across the country. As such, they could not be wholly retained locally without significant other reforms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para124"><a name="stpa_125">Sir Michael also notes that there are arguments against re-localisation, as evidenced by the representations from, among others, the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce. They have expressed concern that local control of business rates would make tax bills less predictable and could lead to an increase in the taxes paid by business. It is clear from Sir Michael&#039;s interim report that there is a range of views on the subject. Sir Michael confirms that he


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">&quot;will continue to explore the interactions between business and local government in many of the areas my remit covers. This will include further consideration of how changes to business rates could improve the ability of, and incentives on, local authorities to support and promote economic development, including looking at current exemptions and discounts.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para125"><a name="stpa_126">We have always made it clear that there are difficult decisions to be taken on local government funding. That is why it is important to take the time to get them right. Any substantial reform has to be set firmly within the wider context of a clear, shared understanding of the role of local government. We will make no decisions on the re-localisation of business rates or on any funding issues within Sir Michael&#039;s remit until we have received and considered his final report, which is due at the end of this year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para126"><a name="stpa_127">With the extension of Sir Michael&#039;s remit, there is now an opportunity to promote a greater understanding of local government among the public. We encourage all concerned to contribute to the next phase of Sir Michael&#039;s inquiry so that he can offer the best possible advice in his final report. In this way, we are confident that Sir Michael&#039;s work will provide the platform for fundamental and lasting reform.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para127"><a name="stpa_128">This debate is an example of the interest in the funding of local government, and I am grateful for the opportunity that it has provided to hon. Members to air their views, including, so extensively, the hon. Member for Northavon. Sir Michael is also keen to see a wide-ranging debate on the issues relating to his inquiry. I encourage hon. Members to ensure that he is made aware of their views so that he can take them into account.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h01_para128"><a name="stpa_129">Finally, I agree with the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) that, sadly, there will not be a cheque in the post before Friday. However, Sir Michael will bring forward proposals in due course that I hope will command general support.

<a name="60228h02_time0"><h5>11 am</h5>



<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60228h02_spnew0"><b> John McDonnell  (Hayes and Harlington)</b>  (Lab): First, I declare my interest as chair of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers parliamentary group as set out in the Register of Members&#039; Interests.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para0"><a name="stpa_130">I am grateful to be able to raise the important issue of industrial relations within the railways industry. I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg), will agree that the men and women who work on our railways perform a magnificent job in helping to keep Britain moving. It is a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, 365-days-a-year task. Railway workers know better than anyone that for the railways to work effectively, there has to be co-operation from all involved: the cleaners, railway workshop grades, train maintenance staff, track workers, catering staff, signal technicians, office staff, call-centre operatives, station revenue protection staff, signal operators, guards and drivers. They all work together in all hours and, sometimes, appalling conditions, to ensure that our trains keep running. In fact, prior to privatisation, British Rail&#039;s work force were judged the most productive of any rail service in Europe. A recent Catalyst study confirmed the efficiency of the service and the contribution that the work force make to that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para1"><a name="stpa_131">Railway workers continue to do a brilliant job, despite having to pick up the pieces of the disastrous privatisation undertaken by the last Conservative Government. Privatisation not only crippled our railway system, but saw the privateers make huge redundancies and attack wages and conditions so that the income of the vast majority of railway workers even fell behind average earnings during the period of privatisation. Although our rail staff remain in the private sector, they are magnificent examples of public servants. They retain the ethos and commitment of the public service, and often have to work in severe conditions; for example, there has been a huge increase in staff assaults, and they now find themselves on the front line of a risk of terrorist attacks.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para2"><a name="stpa_132">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister&#151;indeed, all Members of the House&#151;will agree that our rail staff should be treated fairly and with respect, and that they deserve a fair framework for industrial relations. I hope that he will reassure them today that the Government share those aspirations and are willing to act to achieve a fair framework for industrial relations in the modern railway industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para3"><a name="stpa_133">I shall highlight three areas of concern: the role of the Association of Train Operating Companies in industrial relations; the role of the Government in industrial relations; and the industrial relations problem of the future of the railways pension scheme. The purpose of ATOC, as it is known in the industry, is a mystery to me and many of my colleagues. What is it? I checked its website, and it is not a statutory body but a voluntary organisation whose role is to serve as

<p>



</p>


<p>

</ul>
<p>

&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 26WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para5"><a name="stpa_135">That sounds exceptionally good.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para6"><a name="stpa_136">Members of ATOC&#151;the TOCs, or train operating companies&#151;are paid handsomely for their work. Indeed, according to a recent study by Professor Jean Shaoul of the university of Manchester, the combined total income of TOCs rose by 26 per cent. from &#163;4.8 billion in 1997 to &#163;5.8 billion in 2003.
</p>






<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60228h02_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): My hon. Friend describes an organisation, ATOC, that seems to have worthy aims. Will he tell the House how frequently ATOC has met the railway trade unions to discuss issues of common concern, such as those that he has mentioned: training, pensions, and staff assaults? Would not that be a worthwhile forum in which to resolve some of these problems?
</p>






<p><a name="st_24"><a name="60228h02_spnew2"><b> John McDonnell </b> : The answer is never. That is the principal point that I wish to make about the role of the association, because train operators have been subsidised with never less than &#163;1 billion a year&#151;indeed, in 2003&#150;04 the amount reached &#163;1.8 billion&#151;all of which is funded by the taxpayer. They have made profits of &#163;1 billion, yet without the subsidy, train operators as a whole would have made a loss every year. With such generous public support, therefore, the Government should be keen on train operators showing a bit of commitment to social partnership by at least meeting the unions.
</p>






<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60228h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. George Galloway  (Bethnal Green and Bow)</b>  (Respect): Will my hon. Friend confirm that the taxpayer is subsiding private train operators between two and three times as much as the taxpayer subsidised British Rail before privatisation?
</p>






<p><a name="st_26"><a name="60228h02_spnew4"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I welcome that intervention, and refer back to the Catalyst report, which demonstrated the driving down of public interest from the Government and the public support for British Rail. Even in those circumstances in which there was less public subsidy being provided, the Catalyst report, for which transport experts and economists were independently consulted, judged that British Rail was one of the most productive and efficient systems in Europe.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para7"><a name="stpa_137">Since then, privatisation has resulted in more and more public subsidy being poured into the private sector, which has been creamed off in profits for over a decade. That is the point. With such generous public subsidies, one would expect, and the Government should expect, ATOC at least to show a bit of commitment to social partnership. ATOC regularly meets the Government and other stakeholders in the industry, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) said, it does not meet the representatives of staff&#151;the rail unions. Indeed, it has refused to meet the unions to discuss anything, not only industrial relations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para8"><a name="stpa_138">We know&#151;there has been evidence of this in previous debates&#151;that there has been a continued rise in staff assaults on the railways. Many Members, particularly in London, have participated in the safer stations campaign and have called for improvements to protect passengers and staff, but that does not seem to matter to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 27WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
ATOC. It does not see any benefit in meeting the rail unions to discuss an industry-wide approach to this problem; it simply refuses to meet the unions to address this basic issue.
</p>






<p><a name="st_27"><a name="60228h02_spnew5"><b> David Taylor </b> : On a point that links to the core of the debate, does my hon. Friend hope that ATOC will resist the apparent suggestions for the hiving off of the British Tranport police, who tackle staff assaults and are tooled up to improve the record in that respect?
</p>






<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60228h02_spnew6"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I concur with my hon. Friend&#039;s sentiments; this is another issue on which one would expect ATOC to meet the rail unions to discuss and place on an agenda. If we are to discuss the safety and security of staff and passengers on the railway system, one would expect ATOC to come to the table with the unions, but it does not meet on anything. We all agree that there is a need to plan and develop industry-wide training and skills. Does ATOC discuss that with the unions? Forget it; ATOC was not interested when an approach was made by the unions. There is a growing crisis with railway pensions, which I shall discuss later. That is a key issue for all concerned&#151;employers and employees&#151;but ATOC would rather not talk to the unions about that either.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para9"><a name="stpa_139">Members will find it astonishing that ATOC will not agree even to meet the unions to discuss what could literally be matters of life and death. After the appalling terrorist attacks on London, the Mayor, Ken Livingstone, rightly had discussions with the railway unions on future safety and security matters on London Underground. All sides thought that those talks were productive and helpful in developing our response to terrorist attack.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para10"><a name="stpa_140">Those discussions throw into sharp relief the fact that there is no forum for similar discussions with the train operators. The unions have sought meetings with employers through ATOC to discuss improved transport security following the terrorist attacks, but ATOC, which receives billions in public subsidy from the Government, still refuses to meet the unions even to discuss that basic issue. That is unacceptable. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister agrees that that cannot be allowed to continue. As he knows, we have already had a meeting on this issue. The rail unions and the TUC have also had meetings with the Government to try to sort out the matter. Can he assure me that the Government will now intervene and ensure that there will at least be a dialogue between the rail unions and ATOC? The unions stand ready and willing to attend a meeting with ATOC, wherever and whenever that can be arranged, to discuss these critical issues, and we are asking the Government to intervene if ATOC refuses. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to give that assurance because we know that the Government take an active interest in railway industrial relations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para11"><a name="stpa_141">That takes me to my second point.
</p>






<p><a name="st_29"><a name="60228h02_spnew7"><b> Tom Brake  (Carshalton and Wallington)</b>  (LD): Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to his second point, will he clarify the extent to which he thinks 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 28WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
dialogue should take place between ATOC and the rail unions? Does he believe it should include pay, pensions, which he mentioned, and terms and conditions?
</p>






<p><a name="st_30"><a name="60228h02_spnew8"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I think that there is an opportunity now to establish a framework in which all matters of common interest to employers and employees in the railway industry can be placed on the table. That should start with a discussion about conditions and the future of the industry. There is an opportunity to return to a co-operative relationship on wages negotiations to avoid the multiplicity of negotiations that take place at present. It will be for both sides to decide how they go forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para12"><a name="stpa_142">The key issue is to get people around the table. If we can get employers and unions around the table to discuss some of the basic planning of the industry&#039;s future&#151;for example, safety, security and response to terrorist attacks&#151;that would engender the opportunity to lead on to other matters by mutual agreement. The issue is the principle of the employer talking to employees and union representatives about these critical matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para13"><a name="stpa_143">The Government have a role to play. If we are to seek a partnership in this industry, as we seek it in every other industry, there is an onus on the Government to persuade ATOC to come to the table and not to have a stand-off or to be unco-operatively belligerent to basic discussions and dialogue with the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para14"><a name="stpa_144">There is also the role of the Government. The Government&#039;s role in industrial relations in the railway industry at present is unwise, and even worse than unwise. It is unnecessary and, to put it bluntly, can be seen as unfairly interventionist on the side of employers rather than the unions. It is not a balanced approach. Many in the industry and certainly many railway workers believe that the Government in key instances are letting them down.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para15"><a name="stpa_145">The matter needs to be explained because most people find the Government&#039;s role unbelievable. I presume that the Government, following heavy lobbying from the private train operators and our mysterious friends in ATOC, have decided in their wisdom to retain powers used by the now defunct Strategic Rail Authority. Those powers allow the Secretary of State for Transport to intervene directly in industrial relations within the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para16"><a name="stpa_146">First, the Government can veto pay and conditions agreements between the rail unions and private train operating companies. Secondly, the Government can waive penalty payments incurred by private train operating companies involved in industrial disputes. Thirdly, the Government can provide compensation&#151;this is staggering, and I do not know of any other example in any other industry, public or privatised&#151;to private train operating companies that have lost revenue through involvement in industrial disputes. In other words, on top of the billions of pounds of subsidy and profit already paid to private train operators, it is now Government policy to bankroll private train operating companies in their disputes with the rail unions. That is subsidising a subsidy. It is subsidising industrial relations failure on behalf of employers.

<br>

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="60228h02_spnew9"><b> Mr. Galloway </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene again in his admirable speech. I congratulate him on obtaining this debate because it is timely and important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para17"><a name="stpa_147">The first time that I met the Secretary of State for Transport, 31 years ago, he was pressing Trotskyite tracts on bewildered railwaymen at Waverley station in Edinburgh. He metamorphosed, as have so many new Labour Ministers, into a man applying the lash to militant trade unionists, as he now sees them, in the railway industry. That was unbelievable enough, but my hon. Friend has just told the Chamber that despite taxpayers providing subsidies of between two and three times the amount of those previously provided to British Rail, the Association of Train Operating Companies has now resuscitated a power that would allow it to compensate maverick employers who will not meet their employees for the failure of their industrial relations strategy. Perhaps he will repeat what he said so that the Chamber can be sure of what he said. Can it really be true, even of this Government?
</p>






<p><a name="st_32"><a name="60228h02_spnew10"><b> John McDonnell </b> : There is a Trotskyist analysis of how we have arrived here, but we can talk about that later.

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para18"><a name="stpa_148">If the left was demanding a Labour Government to subsidise unions in disputes, my hon. Friend and I would describe it as a transitional demand. That is the ludicrousness of what is going on. If we told the Government that we expected them to subsidise unions and to pay them so that there is no loss to the work force when they go on strike, there would be uproar in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Sun</i> would run pictures of my hon. Friend the Minister&#151;

Many of us were shop stewards before coming to the House and it beggars belief that that is happening. In practical terms, the reality is that that provokes and prolongs disputes because there is no loss to the employer.
</p>






<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60228h02_spnew15"><b> Tom Brake </b> : The hon. Gentleman clearly objects to subsidies, but does he believe that there are cases&#151;for example, 7/7, when I understand that train operating companies received a subsidy&#151;when the use of Government money is appropriate?
</p>






<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60228h02_spnew16"><b> John McDonnell </b> : What I resent is not subsidies to the railway industry, but subsidies being creamed off into profit by the private sector. In addition, I resent subsidies being used in industrial disputes to strengthen the hand of employers to achieve their objectives in those disputes. If there is to be a level playing field, it should be level for industrial relations. Otherwise, industrial relations in the railway industry are soured rather than having a proper climate and framework.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para19"><a name="stpa_149">I shall give some examples. Richard Branson of Virgin Trains and Brian Souter of Stagecoach can expect payouts from a Labour Government whenever they take on a rail union. That is beyond belief. Not only is it obviously wrong, it is an unprecedented and dangerous departure from existing policy on private sector industrial relations. It could have widespread implications beyond the confines of the railway industry. Where will the Government next intervene to prop up multi-million-pound private companies in their battles against the unions?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para20"><a name="stpa_150">What about the cost of that ill-conceived policy? In answer to a parliamentary question on 14 March 2005, I was told that the Strategic Rail Authority has paid a staggering &#163;23 million to compensate private operating companies for revenue losses during strike action between March 2003 and November 2004. That &#163;23&nbsp;million could have provided investment in the rail service.

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para26"><a name="stpa_156">I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister some questions so that we can put the matter on the record. I hope that today&#039;s debate will prompt further public and parliamentary scrutiny of the whole process. First, how long have the Government&#151;and, before them, the SRA&#151;pursued this policy? That is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway) made. How long has this been going on? I ask the question because some confusion has been created by some of the responses to the Transport Committee. The issue was briefly raised in that Committee on 26 November 2002 as part of its inquiry into the SRA. In an exchange at that meeting, the Chairman asked Richard Bowker of the SRA:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;Is it true that you volunteered to underwrite any problem that should arise for any company in relation to a strike?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para27"><a name="stpa_157">Mr. Bowker replied:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">&quot;No, not at all. We remain of the view that the companies who are the most appropriate people to negotiate and to manage industrial relations are the Train Operating Companies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para28"><a name="stpa_158">Yet we know from subsequent parliamentary questions that four months after that Select Committee hearing, the Government, through the SRA, were already paying National Express compensation to the tune of millions of pounds for revenue lost in a dispute 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 32WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
involving ScotRail. Was the Select Committee misled? Did Mr. Bowker not know that that was the intention? We need clarification on that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para29"><a name="stpa_159">Will my hon. Friend also clarify when the Government and the SRA started the policy? Precisely when did it start, and who took the decision? Do the Government use taxpayers&#039; money to provide direct or indirect financial support to private companies during industrial disputes, or to veto private sector pay-and-condition agreements, in any industry other than the rail industry? Is this industry unique, or are hidden subsidies provided to other employers by the Government?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para30"><a name="stpa_160">Under what statutory arrangements do the Government believe that they can use such powers? It would be useful to clarify exactly the statutory arrangements, as several hon. Members would seek to amend the legislation. Did the Government or the SRA take legal advice on the issue? What legal advice was provided, by whom, and can it be made publicly available? Hon. Members would, at the least, want to clarify whether this is a legitimate role for the Government and whether legally the Secretary of State has such powers.
</p>






<p><a name="st_47"><a name="60228h02_spnew25"><b> Mr. David Drew  (Stroud)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): Will my hon. Friend ask an additional question? He will know that new franchises are about to come into operation. I have been told by union activists that the companies that are taking on those franchises may use the opportunity further to reduce trade union rights and activities. Should not the Government insist that the franchises include right and proper processes for trade union officials and members to engage in industrial relations? It would be an absolute disgrace if such activities were to be reduced.
</p>






<p><a name="st_48"><a name="60228h02_spnew26"><b> John McDonnell </b> : It would be useful if this debate were to send a message to companies that seek to provoke industrial relations breakdowns, or to reform, change or cut pay and conditions, and are willing to take on the unions on the basis that their activities will be subsidised by the Government. We must send out the message that Members of this House will examine and scrutinise every penny of taxpayers&#039; money that is used to subsidise industrial relations provocations. At this key stage of the tenders being transferred, we run into danger by feather-bedding employers and train operating companies that are willing to risk industrial relations in the industry to enhance their profits.
</p>






<p><a name="st_49"><a name="60228h02_spnew27"><b> David Taylor </b> : Is there not a myth about industrial relations in the rail industry? Even in the peak years&#151;if we can call them that&#151;of Thatcherism between 1979 and 1996, there were just a handful of industrial disputes. They were regrettable, but there were just a handful. The number quintupled between 1997 and 2004, not least because the negotiations involve 73 different bodies, including 25 train operating companies, 10 infrastructure companies and so on.
</p>






<p><a name="st_50"><a name="60228h02_spnew28"><b> John McDonnell </b> : That leads back to the original point, which is that there should be some discussions between the Association of Train Operating Companies and the unions.

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para31"><a name="stpa_161">I shall finish off with a couple of questions to the Minister. Will he tell me when the powers were taken and when the decision was made to provide the SRA and the Government with those powers? At what level of Government was that decision made? It smacks of a decision centred on No. 10. It astounds me that No. 11 and the Treasury would agree to such a scale of subsidy to the private sector being made in such an unaccountable way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para32"><a name="stpa_162">This leads me to my final question on the matter. Will the Minister explain the formula or the criteria used to determine whether a private train operating company can receive support in this way? Is there a checklist of actions that the company has to have undertaken? Is an assessment undertaken by the Secretary of State of whether the company has acted reasonably in seeking to settle the dispute?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para33"><a name="stpa_163">I have another example of where the Government intervene in industrial relations; it is happening at the moment in the Prison Service. The Home Secretary has the opportunity in law to intervene to prevent industrial action in the Prison Service. However, he has that power only on the basis of making an assessment of whether it is reasonable to do so, and he assesses the behaviour and the activities of the partners within that industrial relations framework. Do similar procedures exist in the decision-making process through which the Secretary of State for Transport awards significant sums of money to the companies? Does the Secretary of State consider the behaviour of and actions taken by employers in seeking to resolve the dispute, or in seeking to prolong or provoke it?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para34"><a name="stpa_164">Will the Minister tell me which companies have received such financial support, and how much support have they received? It would be very useful to get on the record, down to the last penny, how much Branson and others have been trousering from Government on the basis of disputes that they have provoked.
</p>






<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60228h02_spnew29"><b> Ms Katy Clark  (North Ayrshire and Arran)</b>  (Lab): My hon. Friend has already mentioned that substantial subsidy has been given to First ScotRail in respect of an industrial dispute in Scotland. Recently, powers relating to railways have been transferred to the Scottish Executive. It would be helpful if the Minister told us what discussions had taken place with the Scottish Executive on the issue, and if he confirmed that it was within the Scottish Executive&#039;s powers to decide not to continue with the policy and not to provide subsidy to private companies in this way.
</p>






<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60228h02_spnew30"><b> John McDonnell </b> : That is an important question. My understanding is that the Scottish Executive have a role in the matter, but we need clarity on that.

In an answer to a written parliamentary question, my hon.&nbsp;Friend the Minister confirmed that Virgin Trains was in discussion with its franchise manager&#151;the Government&#151;on the current dispute. With regard to this dispute, will he assure me that the Government are not providing the train company of our multi-billionaire friend Richard Branson with any financial support?

We would then have the opportunity to place that matter on the record in a further debate. The debate does not end here: the issue will come back time and time again, every time there is a dispute in the railway industry and every time we identify a single penny going from the taxpayer to the employer to subsidise disputes. This is the first part of the campaign to get some sort of fair and just industrial relations framework in the railways industry.

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para36"><a name="stpa_166">I move on to address the issue that is souring the industrial relations climate at the moment, which is that of the railway pension scheme. As the Minister will be aware, the scheme is under threat due to significant deficits in a number of different sections of the scheme. A number of sections are okay and can manage the deficits, but a number are not. The deficits have been caused by factors similar to those facing other industry 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 35WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
pension schemes, including poor financial returns&#151;I accept that&#151;but also irresponsible employers exploiting pension holidays during the early years and the actuary&#039;s change to mortality assumptions on the basis that pensioners are living longer.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para37"><a name="stpa_167">However, the threat to the railway pension scheme has been significantly compounded by the fragmentation and privatisation of the railways, specifically by railway employers enjoying surpluses built up during the latter years of British Rail when thousands of railway staff left the industry in preparation for privatisation. The rail employers have not been prepared to use those surpluses or the billions of pounds profit made from privatisation to fund the schemes adequately.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para38"><a name="stpa_168">The structure of the railways means that train operating and infrastructure companies&#039; contracts cover only a number of years before they are re-tendered, which introduces instability into the system. The Minister will be aware that that has acted as a disincentive for train operating companies and other rail contractors to take on the liability of additional contributions now, or to recoup any overpayments from surpluses in the future. It is a structural problem in the industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para39"><a name="stpa_169">The problem has been compounded by the fact that, following privatisation, the unified railway pension scheme was fragmented into more than 100 different sections, which has meant the loss of the economies of scale and financial stability provided by the unified scheme. As a whole, the private train operating companies, Network Rail and its contractors are entirely dependent on public subsidy for their continued survival. Does the Minister agree that the Government have a clear responsibility to assist in resolving this problem?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para40"><a name="stpa_170">There is plenty of scope for the Government to act. In the immediate term, they could use their position as the primary funder of the railway industry to provide comfort letters to the actuary to allow for deficits to be repaid over a longer period than the five years currently proposed. That would add some security to the system, which is increasingly in disarray. I understand that there may be plans to provide such comfort letters to cover the train operating companies, and if that is the case, it is most welcome. I hope that it will apply to all railway companies whose pension schemes are suffering from severe deficits. Even if comfort letters are provided, they will not address the fundamental problem of the fragmentation of the railway pension scheme, nor the tendency of various railway operators and employers to act in their own short-term interests.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para41"><a name="stpa_171">Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that the pension system could be made more efficient and secure if the railway pension scheme reverted to a unified fund, rather than the array of individual sections? Does he agree also that it would introduce immediate economies of scale and facilitate stability, long-term planning and more prudent management&#151;essential prerequisites of a healthy pension scheme? There could be strong financial incentives for the Government to move towards a unified pension scheme.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para42"><a name="stpa_172">The Minister knows that every time a train operating franchise changes hands or splits, the pension scheme is restructured to take account of the change of franchise, with pensioners, deferred pensioners and contributing members allocated or re-allocated to various sections of the railway pension or to new sections that are being set up. Pensions are complicated enough, and that adds only complication upon complication. Furthermore, all those changes require the input of actuaries, lawyers and other professionals, and there must be an enormous administrative burden.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para43"><a name="stpa_173">The costs associated with the changes to pensions are borne not by the private companies but by the Department for Transport. Will the Minister tell us how much money the Government have spent in that way since the railways were privatised? Do the Government believe that it represents value for money? Does he agree that it would be far better value for the Government and a better deal for railway workers if there were a unified pension scheme again?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para44"><a name="stpa_174">I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for taking the time to listen to my concerns, and I hope that he will be able to answer my questions, if not today then in writing to us, so that we can read those responses into the record.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para45"><a name="stpa_175">Our railway workers need their concerns raised in this place. When the Government were elected, they went out of their way to impress upon the media and all who would listen to them that their relationship with the trade unions would mean fairness not favours. When it comes to industrial relations in the railway industry, the sense is that the whole process has been reversed. The privatised companies are getting the favours, and the rail staff are not getting any fairness. I hope that the Minister will tell us today how he intends to change that, and I hope that he will at least provide us with a commitment that the Government will consider the matter again.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para46"><a name="stpa_176">As I said earlier, this is the start of a campaign that will not go away.

in keeping the country moving, and about the very important role that they played in keeping us on the move during the recent terrorist incident.

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para48"><a name="stpa_178">Prior to the debate, I sought feedback from several sources, including the unions, individual staff and the industry on the state of industrial relations in the railway industry. I was not overwhelmed by representations from those different sources. Perhaps the unions direct their attentions to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that that is not the case, and I encourage them to share their concerns more widely than appears to have been the case in this instance. It confirms the anecdotal evidence of my recent travel experiences, which is that, generally, industrial relations on the railways are good.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para49"><a name="stpa_179">I received some information from Network Rail about the level of industrial action within its organisation. According to the company, there has been only one incident of industrial action since it took control in October 2002. It has been a period of relative calm. That is in contrast with past years. I have been commuting in and around London on the trains for the past 23 years, and during that time, there have been some very bad periods when many travellers have had to seek other ways of getting to and from work, whether walking, cycling, using the tube instead of the train or vice versa.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para50"><a name="stpa_180">That is not to say that there are no areas of dispute or disagreement, as the hon. Gentleman highlighted. Sometimes, they are resolved quickly, and I am sure that he welcomes the swift action that Metronet Rail took in relation to Blue Diamond. The cleaning contract was quickly terminated after it was revealed that the cleaning contractor was not paying workers the agreed rate. It had its contract withdrawn&#151;a substantial contract that was worth &#163;20 million over three years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para51"><a name="stpa_181">I hazard to say that there are some examples of quite good relations between some of the main players and the unions. However, the hon. Gentleman, through his series of parliamentary questions, has rightly drawn attention to the dispute between the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and Virgin. He referred to the essence of the dispute&#151;an issue about Sunday pay rates, involving 300 guards&#151;and revealed that one of the more surprising aspects of the dispute was the role that the Government have played in providing subsidies to train operating companies involved in disputes. As he stated, and parliamentary answers reveal, Virgin is in discussion with the franchise manager&#151;the Government&#151;about that issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para52"><a name="stpa_182">I do not think that the hon. Gentleman answered my question in an intervention about whether it is appropriate to pay subsidies to compensate the train operating companies in relation, for instance, to a terrorist incident. There are perhaps circumstances in which it is perfectly legitimate for those companies to receive support. However, in relation to industrial disputes, we need much reassurance from the Government that such support does not feed the dispute, rather than seek to resolve it. At &#163;23 million, the sums of money involved are not insubstantial, and I hope that the Minister will be able to provide more detail about which train operating companies have received that subsidy, so that we can consider whether some of the smaller companies would have gone out of business if they had not received it. The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington said that there is a clear way

We also need to hear whether there is anything on the other side of the argument. In other words, are the Government actively providing incentives to ensure that industrial disputes are resolved amicably? Is everything on one side of the argument? I hope that the Minister will respond to that point.

It would be helpful to me as a Scottish Member to know unequivocally whether the Liberals are in favour of the procedure. If the hon.

They might well be sending a cheque to Bob Crow and saying, &quot;You&#039;ve got it right this time, Bob; we&#039;ll give you the dosh.&quot; That is the ludicrous situation that we are getting into if the Government are going to intervene in industrial relations.

Alternatively, has the Minister considered the idea proposed by the transport committee of the London assembly, which is voluntary no-strike agreements in advance of key dates in the calendar when disputes traditionally come to a head, such as Christmas and new year? I am also thinking of the period in advance of the Olympics in 2012. I hope that the Minister will comment on that point. He may also want to provide clarity on what reasonable steps the franchise operators have to take to prevent industrial action. I understand that the Government require operators to do that before any subsidy can be made available.

<a name="60228h02_para56"><a name="stpa_186">I hope that hon. Members agree that, so far, this has been an informative debate, attempting to clarify Government policy. That is what the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington is seeking to do, and I thank his office for clarifying for me before the debate the areas on which he was to focus. The debate has not been about scoring political points, so I hope that the Minister will respond in a similar vein.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60228h02_spnew49"><b> Stephen Hammond  (Wimbledon)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) on securing the debate and on putting his case so clearly, eloquently and forcefully. I support him in praising the staff of the railways for the job that they do. I represent a London constituency that benefits from both surface and underground rail, and the staff work very hard. Unfortunately, all too often in the eyes of the travelling public and perhaps in the eyes of some of the workers, they are represented by union leaders to whom the old adage of the first world war might apply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para57"><a name="stpa_187">I was interested in the hon. Gentleman&#039;s history lesson. We have heard from several Government Members, both Front and Back Benchers, the history lesson of the railways, which always seems to start around 1988, when British Rail started to be a productive and efficient body, and which ignores conveniently the history of the 70 years before that, when Governments of both hues failed to invest. I guide anyone who wants to read a succinct history of the railways to the two articles by Professor Huxley in <i>The Railway Magazine </i>last year, which give a rather more clear, fair and balanced view of railway history.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para58"><a name="stpa_188">There has been quite a lot of talk today about the improvement in industrial relations on the railways and, indeed, throughout the country generally. It is true that industrial relations have improved such that, in 2003, we recorded the lowest number of labour disputes for 25 years, but it is true also that one third of those were recorded on our transport system in some way, shape or form, and that transport still accounted for 25 per cent. of the almost 500,000 days lost. The debate is therefore important in allowing us to consider why some of these disputes still arise. I shall refer to some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington.
</p>






<p><a name="st_72"><a name="60228h02_spnew50"><b> Tom Brake </b> : I understand that today is a big day for the Conservatives&#151;they have published a new glossy brochure. Will the hon. Gentleman set out what it contains about railways policy?
</p>






<p><a name="st_73"><a name="60228h02_spnew51"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I shall leave that for the hon. Gentleman to read later in the day; the brochure does not set out any policy in detail. Of course, later this week the Liberal Democrats have a bigger day, and we shall see whether it presages any change.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para59"><a name="stpa_189">I confirm for the hon. Gentleman that by the summer recess there will be detailed Conservative policies on a number of issues, such as transport policy&#151;particularly rail policy. I shall be delighted to debate them with him then.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para60"><a name="stpa_190">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington referred to a number of the written parliamentary questions that he has tabled about subsidies to the railways. In my 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 41WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
earlier intervention on the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) I said that the argument could be made either way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para61"><a name="stpa_191">There has been much righteous indignation about legitimate cases for industrial action being overcome by an astonishing abuse&#151;I think those were the words of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington&#151;of public funds. He asked a number of detailed questions of the Minister. Surely the nub of the issue is that the franchise agreements, entered into by both this Government and their Conservative predecessor, have enshrined the ability to reimburse the franchise operators for net losses due to industrial action. That is within the franchise arrangements and, presumably, subject to normal franchise arrangements and normal contract law: if one side breaches those franchise arrangements, the other can seek redress. I am sure that the Minister will confirm that that is the case. If it is not, I shall be interested to hear his argument as to why.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para62"><a name="stpa_192">The argument to put to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington is that the franchise arrangements have sought to put such things in place so that we can improve services to passengers and investment in the railways, which has been lacking since 1918.
</p>






<p><a name="st_74"><a name="60228h02_spnew52"><b> John McDonnell </b> : The question for the hon. Gentleman is whether those things should be within the franchise agreements themselves. What is his party&#039;s position on that?
</p>






<p><a name="st_75"><a name="60228h02_spnew53"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I am happy to confirm that my party believes that the current franchise arrangements are suitable and appropriate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para63"><a name="stpa_193">I look forward to the Minister giving a number of answers&#151;either in the Chamber this morning or in writing later. If he cannot answer the rather large number of huge, detailed questions, perhaps he will do us the courtesy of making any written response available to everybody by placing it in the Library. That would be helpful.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para64"><a name="stpa_194">I picked up on the remark made by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington about the Association of Train Operating Companies refusing to meet about anything. I accept that that may be right; I simply do not know. However, the quote that I gave from the head of communications at ASLEF clearly indicates that across the industry there is dialogue with the train operating companies in certain cases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para65"><a name="stpa_195">Under the franchise arrangements, the train operating companies have an obligation to speak to franchise operators about industrial relations, safety and security. The hon. Gentleman tried, I think, to present a picture in which no conversation at all was taking place between the unions and the franchise operators. That is somewhat misleading.
</p>






<p><a name="st_76"><a name="60228h02_spnew54"><b> John McDonnell </b> : I find the word &quot;misleading&quot; inappropriate. I made it clear that there is no dialogue between ATOC and the unions. ATOC has refused all meetings about the strategic issues facing the railway industry, including issues of safety and so on. I did not seek to mislead the House in any way.
</p>






<p><a name="st_77"><a name="60228h02_spnew55"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I am happy to withdraw my remark. I merely point out that a huge amount of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 42WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
dialogue is going on between unions and franchise operators and between unions and the train operating companies, as was shown by my quote from the head of communications at ASLEF.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para66"><a name="stpa_196">We have talked a little about the principle of an employer and employee talking together, and I suspect that there is agreement on that across the House. Equally, there must be some agreement across the House that when an agreed negotiation and consultation process is in place, it should be maintained through all the stages of negotiation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para67"><a name="stpa_197">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington has already referred to the Greater London authority transport committee report, which came out this week. It refers exactly to this issue. It says that if the process could be cemented voluntarily, that could revive a great deal of trust in industrial relations in the underground. I accept that the underground is not the same as surface rail, but the point being made was that all too often in London underground negotiations, the unions break an agreed code and threaten industrial action at an early stage. We then see a breakdown into industrial action at a time that causes the height of discomfort to the travelling public.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para68"><a name="stpa_198">The GLA committee made and illustrated the point that that was a continual tactic. It seems sensible that the committee should have recommended that when an agreed negotiation and consultation procedure is in place, the whole of it should be followed through prior to any escalation of action. I hope that that could be agreed across the House, and would welcome the Minister&#039;s support for that recommendation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para69"><a name="stpa_199">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington did not talk about a number of other industrial relations issues. I should like to mention one thing that the public find extremely difficult to understand. The discomfort of the travelling public is clearly the leverage of the unions in industrial relations. Andy Reed, another national organiser for ASLEF, said that industrial relations at the London underground varied &quot;from hostility to anarchy&quot;.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para70"><a name="stpa_200">That is exactly what the travelling public see&#151;the hostility of the unions towards them and the anarchy of the service provided to them. The travelling public have problems understanding that quite often the majority of such actions&#151;or at least a number of them, particularly recent ones on the underground&#151;have not been supported by a majority of the union members.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para71"><a name="stpa_201">For instance, various reports have stated that in the past four years, I think, the RMT has called 23 ballots in respect of the underground system. Turnout has been 48 per cent. on average, but below 40 per cent. in a number of the ballots. Those ballots have resulted in 10 strikes. Much talk this morning has been about unscrupulous employers trousering money, but there are also unscrupulous union leaders who call strikes on minority turnouts and minority support.
</p>






<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60228h02_spnew56"><b> Mr. Drew </b> : I should declare my links with the RMT, which are recorded in the Register of Members&#039; Interests. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I have seen members of the general public hurling abuse at staff members, when, because of the total inadequacy of our network and through no fault of those staff members, connecting trains have gone? I have seen how those staff 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 43WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
members, some of whom I am sure are union activists&#151;I know some activists well&#151;deal with that situation. It is a gross abuse to point the finger at the start at union activists, as the hon. Gentleman has done.
</p>






<p><a name="st_79"><a name="60228h02_spnew57"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : In this case, this hon. Gentleman is genuinely being misleading. I opened my remarks by specifically praising the staff, and I would utterly condemn anyone who made such remarks to railway workers. My remarks about the unscrupulous nature of union leaders referred not to the workers, but to the tactic of calling action on a minority turnout.
</p>






<p><a name="st_80"><a name="60228h02_spnew58"><b> John McDonnell </b> : That was raised in the GLA transport committee debate. The Conservative members argued that industrial action should be called only if a majority of all staff&#151;not a majority of the turnout&#151;voted for it. However, on that basis, the GLA member, Roger Evans, for whom only 13 per cent. of the electorate voted, would never have been elected in the first place.
</p>






<p><a name="st_81"><a name="60228h02_spnew59"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I think that that is also wrong. The recommendation is that there should be a 50 per cent. turnout of the membership in the ballot; that would be the relevant majority. All too often, action has been called on a turnout of well below 50 per cent. That is the difference.
</p>






<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60228h02_spnew60"><b> John McDonnell </b> : Roger Evans, the GLA Tory member, had been arguing that the tube unions should be allowed to take strike action only if a majority of those entitled to vote voted for the action.
</p>






<p><a name="st_83"><a name="60228h02_spnew61"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : That is not the recommendation of the GLA transport committee, which is rather different. It is that there be at least a 50 per cent. turnout in the ballot.
</p>






<p><a name="st_84"><a name="60228h02_spnew62"><b> John McDonnell </b> : So the hon. Gentleman is condemning Roger Evans.
</p>






<p><a name="st_85"><a name="60228h02_spnew63"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : No, I am not condemning him, because he is entitled to that view and I might support it. I was merely pointing out what the actual recommendation is. The tendency of union officials to act in their short-term interests all too often hampers industrial relations in the rail industry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para72"><a name="stpa_202">We could have a debate lasting an hour and a half on the railway pension scheme.
</p>






<p><a name="st_86"><a name="60228h02_spnew64"><b> John McDonnell </b> : We will.
</p>






<p><a name="st_87"><a name="60228h02_spnew65"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I am glad that we will, because it will be an interesting debate. It will be extremely interesting to hear the Minister&#039;s response about previous pension fund holidays, how they will work, and how they have worked and acted against pensioners.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para73"><a name="stpa_203">The Minister might not wish to comment on the fact that across the public sector there is currently an unfunded liability in pensions, which the Government admit to be &#163;460 billion. If they were to be honest and give their unfunded liability in the same way as

<br>&nbsp;<br>
companies must, following the obligations of financial reporting standard 17 or&#151;perhaps to be more generous to the Government&#151;following a discount rate more closely linked to index-linked skills, the unfunded liability of the Government pension scheme would be between &#163;670 billion and &#163;850 billion. I believe that the Chief Secretary has confirmed that in written responses.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para74"><a name="stpa_204">The rail industry scheme&#039;s problem pales into insignificance when we consider the matter across the whole public sector.

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60228h02_spnew66"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I am merely pointing out the Government&#039;s own error. If, in the same way as they force corporate pension funds&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i>

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="60228h02_spnew67"><b> Mr. Jimmy Hood  </b> (in the Chair): Order. I ask hon. Members to stop having conversations across the Chamber.
</p>






<p><a name="st_91"><a name="60228h02_spnew68"><b> Stephen Hammond </b> : I was merely pointing out that if the Government operated on the same basis as that which they force on companies, the unfunded liability of the public sector pension fund would be between &#163;670&nbsp;billion and &#163;850 billion. The Conservative party is considering whether or not we should fund it. It would be honest to say that this Government&#039;s liabilities are 125 per cent. of gross domestic product, not the 60 per cent. that they claim in terms of debt.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para76"><a name="stpa_206">I use the railways every week, both local and national lines, and I have never driven down to London by car. It is a pleasure to use them. I am grateful to the people who work on them to ensure that a good service is provided.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para78"><a name="stpa_208">Some good things are happening and I want to relate them to the Chamber in order to set the scene. The railways continue to be a success. The Government are spending &#163;87 million each week on them and there have 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 45WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
been record levels of investment in rolling stock. On average, over the past 12 months, more than 85 per cent. of trains have run on time as measured by the industry-standard public performance measure. Furthermore, there have been record levels of train patronage; more than 1 billion passengers used the railways in 2005, which is the highest number since the 1960s and makes our railways the fastest growing in Europe. Since 1996&#150;97, rail passenger kilometres have grown by 32 per cent., so people are now travelling further by rail than ever.
</p>






<p><a name="st_95"><a name="60228h02_spnew71"><b> Tom Brake </b> : I thank the Minister for giving way. I was going to say that, having sat in a large number of these debates during the past nine years, I am aware that the introductory remarks about the industry generally tend to squeeze out the time for answering the serious points made by hon. Members.
</p>






<p><a name="st_96"><a name="60228h02_spnew72"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : The hon. Gentleman will just have to listen to what I have to say, and I think he will find that that is not the case.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para79"><a name="stpa_209">It is important to underline the current success of the railway industry. It has much to do with its staff, who are a vital part of the success. Whatever their particular role, their actions contribute to the increased usage of the railway and the general improvement that has taken place. On 7 July we saw the commitment and performance of railway staff during difficult and trying circumstances. I know that an issue has been made about security on the railways and the role of staff.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para80"><a name="stpa_210">It is also important to talk about the future, because the industry is now a vibrant one and more people want to work in it. Recently, I visited HMS Sultan, near Gosport, to see the new Network Rail apprenticeship scheme in action. It employs 200 engineering apprentices. They are the future of our railway industry. How often have we been crying out for investment in apprenticeships and in the railways? The scheme is another example of the good things that are happening. I am delighted about the growing interest in the railways and the increasing number of people using them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para81"><a name="stpa_211">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington raised the point about the Association of Train Operating Companies and meetings with the unions. He will know, as do the unions that I have met, that we have raised issues with ATOC. The specific one, about which there has recently been a further discussion and which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said he would raise, was about getting together to discuss security. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, and other hon. Members, that we are in the process of dealing with that. We will host the meeting between ATOC and the trade unions to discuss security issues. The meeting will be about security and not about other issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para82"><a name="stpa_212">I will now address the specific issues that have been raised in this debate. The Government believe that industrial relations are a matter for the industry and that issues are best and most effectively dealt with between the relevant industry parties. Before the Railways Act 2005, the Strategic Rail Authority had responsibility for industrial relations. When its responsibilities transferred to the Department for Transport last year, my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 46WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
East (Mr. McNulty), stated that the Government intended to continue the SRA policy in this area. My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington raised the matter in his speech and I will go into further detail as I continue mine.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para83"><a name="stpa_213">The Government have three main roles in industrial relations in the rail industry. They must approve any pay settlement agreed during the last twelve months of a franchise; they can agree to waive poor performance penalties, if that poor performance is as a result of industrial action; and they can agree to provide compensation of net losses to train operating companies for industrial action.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para84"><a name="stpa_214">Although the Department will not get involved in the details of pay awards and negotiations, the Government should keep an overview of what is happening in the industry, pay rates and anything unusual that is happening in terms of pay awards. A pay award in one TOC will have potential implications for all TOCs. My officials meet the industry regularly in order to provide me with such an overview. In addition, as hon. Members would expect, franchise management teams are kept regularly up to date with the current position of their TOCs in these matters.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para85"><a name="stpa_215">A specific point was made about Virgin Cross Country. It has regularly met its franchise management team. The meetings have included updates to the Department on the current dispute with the RMT train managers about differential pay on Sundays, which has been ongoing since 1 January 2006. That does not mean that the Government are making, or are planning, any intervention in this or any other dispute. As I have explained, industrial relations issues are for the individual company and the union to resolve. However, we would be failing in our duty if we did not seek to keep up to date on issues that might affect the satisfaction of passengers or the smooth running of the railway, or that might have a significant effect on the public purse.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para86"><a name="stpa_216">On the contractual position issue generally&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="st_97"><a name="60228h02_spnew73"><b> John McDonnell </b> : Before the Minister discusses that, will he clarify the criteria that enable the Secretary of State to judge the intervention or the level of subsidy if there is a dispute? I am anxious to get as much on to the record as possible.
</p>






<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60228h02_spnew74"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I will address that point during my speech. I am sure that he will not be surprised to hear that we anticipated some of his questions. I will get back to hon. Members about the ones that I am unable to deal with today after the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para87"><a name="stpa_217">The Department&#039;s position on industrial relations within the rail industry is defined in the franchise agreements. Everything that the Department does, it does because it has to contractually. There is little that it must do that is discretionary.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para88"><a name="stpa_218">Under the franchise agreement, the Department may at its sole discretion, agree to provide compensation to TOCs for their net losses suffered as a result of industrial action. That clause was added to the franchise agreement in 2003. The mechanism to pay compensation exists because of the relatively short-term nature of the franchises. Because of that, there were worries that TOCs might react in a way that would be to the detriment of future franchises rather 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 47WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
than consider the causes of industrial action on their merits. Such awards might represent poor value for money for the industry as a whole and ultimately for the taxpayer when, in due course, we came to re-franchise the business. However, I emphasise that the compensation is not automatic and is paid only after consideration of all the contributing factors.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para89"><a name="stpa_219">For an operator to be able to receive such support, it needs to be able to demonstrate that it has taken all reasonable steps to avoid industrial action. It also needs to show that it has done all that it can to prevent any action from having a negative effect on its business. Any support covers only net losses, and that captures the savings that operators may make from the industrial action. That remains the Government&#039;s position, but no such payments have been made since the Department took over direct responsibility for franchise agreements from the SRA last year.
</p>






<p><a name="st_99"><a name="60228h02_spnew75"><b> John McDonnell </b> : Is the judgment on reasonable steps undertaken independently?
</p>






<p><a name="st_100"><a name="60228h02_spnew76"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : It is taken by the Department, but the franchise managers work with the individual TOCs to that end. I stress that, since we took over the responsibility for franchising, we have not done anything in that respect. As my hon. Friend said, payments have been made under the clause. In the financial year 2003&#150;04, the SRA made payments of &#163;22.4 million in compensation to TOCs. In 2004&#150;05, that figure was &#163;1.4 million. My hon. Friend has asked for more detail on the breakdown of payments. I shall endeavour to write to him about it in due course.
</p>






<p><a name="st_101"><a name="60228h02_spnew77"><b> Tom Brake </b> : Is &quot;reasonable steps&quot; a legal definition or is there, as the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington suggested, a checklist behind the phrase?
</p>






<p><a name="st_102"><a name="60228h02_spnew78"><b> Derek Twigg </b> : There is a relationship between a franchise manager and a TOC. &quot;Reasonable&quot; is something that we have to discuss and negotiate with the TOCs, but I shall be happy to give the hon. Gentleman further details after the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para90"><a name="stpa_220">I must clarify the position of the Department during the last 12 months of a franchise. When a franchise is at that stage, the position is slightly different. While the franchising concept was being developed in the mid-1990s, it was recognised that there was a need to prevent train operating companies from agreeing above-inflation pay increases, knowing that most of the cost would fall on their successors. To prevent that from happening, a clause was added to the franchise agreements to force the TOC to agree any proposed pay increases that would be above the average earnings index with the Department.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para91"><a name="stpa_221">If the Department were to withhold its consent to such a pay award and that resulted in industrial action, it would be bound contractually to compensate the TOC for its net losses. That has never happened. To reiterate, the clause applies only if a franchise is in the last 12 months of operation. There are several other actions that cannot be taken by the operator in the last 12 months of a franchise without the Department&#039;s

permission, which include the increase or decrease of staff numbers or total staff costs of more than 5 per cent. The Department monitors such issues carefully as part of its responsibility for managing the franchise.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para92"><a name="stpa_222">Reference has been made to renationalisation. I shall not go into detail, but we have set up a new structure within the rail industry. The Department has set up a rail review, with Network Rail taking responsibility for performance. The train operating companies are working with them and also on improving customer service. Working with the private sector is important to bring more investment into the rail network and bring about the improvements that I have mentioned. We are spending &#163;87 million a week. Post-privatisation, there were many complex problems in the industry. We have now set out a much clearer way forward and a structure whereby people understand what is happening. That will bring about further improvements in the rail industry in the coming years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para93"><a name="stpa_223">Reference has been made to agreements in respect of London Underground. Its operation, including industrial relations, is a matter for the Mayor, not central Government. It is for London Underground as the employer to lead in industrial relations and resolve any dispute with the trade unions. Any industrial action on the underground causes unnecessary inconvenience and disruption to the travelling public. We strongly urge all sides to continue negotiations so that the current dispute can be resolved peacefully. The strike arranged for 21 February was cancelled due to both sides engaging in constructive talks. I understand that the proposed strike on 2 March will also not go ahead.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para94"><a name="stpa_224">As for strikes and agreements, and certain times when strikes should not take place, there are no proposals for the Government to ban strikes on London Underground. A local agreement between the employer and the trades union could be undertaken if both sides were agreeable. However, even that could not guarantee that no further action would take place. New York has such a no-strike agreement in place, but that did not prevent strikes from taking place last autumn. It also cannot prevent unofficial action. It is far better that industrial relations are undertaken in a constructive and positive manner from the outset so that strikes or threats of industrial action are not necessary.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para95"><a name="stpa_225">I am sure that hon. Members will agree that now is not the time to go into the wider issues of railways pensions and the existing challenges.
</p>






<p><a name="st_103"><a name="60228h02_spnew79"><b> Mr. Davidson </b> : Before the Minister goes into pension details, did he accept our argument when we asked him for a full and helpful response to our detailed questions? He said that he would respond. Will his responses be helpful and constructive, and clarify matters, or will they be obscuration letters that sometimes come from Ministers?

<p>
<a name="60228h02_para96"><a name="stpa_226">I understand the worries that are felt about railway pensions. It is accepted generally by all parties, including the trustees, that the operation of the railway pension scheme&#151;the RPS&#151;needs to be fundamentally assessed to ensure its continued good operation in the future and that members continue to receive their expected benefits, but the costs need to be contained at an acceptable level. I am aware of the potential for difficulty caused by the announcement of large deficits within sections of the RPS, but I am hopeful that a way forward will be found. Obviously, people are working together to find that way forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para97"><a name="stpa_227">The rail industry has undergone extraordinary changes in the past 10 to 15 years, beginning with privatisation and ending with the recent Railways Act 2005. I stress that the commitment and contribution of trade union members and staff who work in the rail industry has obviously been fundamental in getting over the difficulties that the industry faced post-privatisation, Railtrack and so on, and in taking forward what is now a much more successful railway, which is improving. I cannot underestimate the contribution that the staff have made to that, as have the train operating companies and Network Rail as well as the Government in the way in which we have set in place the strategy for the railway. By working together, we can further improve the railway and take it from strength to strength.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h02_para98"><a name="stpa_228">As for the &#163;87 million, it is crucial that our investment continues. Reliability has been a major factor in improving the railways. More than 85 per cent. of trains are running on time. People are voting with their feet and using the railways in greater numbers. As I said, more than 1 billion passengers used the railway last year. As any successful organisation knows, staff are its biggest asset&#151;

<a name="time_9">
<a name="60228h03_time0"><h5>12.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_106"><a name="60228h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Christopher Fraser  (South-West Norfolk)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have this opportunity to fly the flag for my constituency, and in particular for the market town of Thetford. I am also pleased that the Minister&#151;someone I consider a parliamentary friend&#151;is replying on behalf of the Government. I know that he will be positive and sincere in addressing the issues I raise, and that his advice will help to move us forward. I wish to outline the problems facing Thetford, the opportunities that exist, and what needs to be done to give Thetford the chance it so genuinely deserves.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para0"><a name="stpa_229">Thetford lies in the heart of Breckland, an area of sandy heath and forest around the Little Ouse valley, and it has historically been the industrial engine of the area. It is the fourth largest town in Norfolk, and it is the centre for employment, shopping and community services for the surrounding rural community. It is only six miles from the county boundary, so its catchment area extends into neighbouring Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and beyond.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para1"><a name="stpa_230">Thetford has a wealth of heritage that should attract more national and international visitors, but it is not a renowned tourist location, and it is largely held in low regard by Norfolk residents from elsewhere in the county&#151;indeed, sadly, it is often seen as a troublespot. Between 1956 and 1980, Thetford was a London overspill town, and it went through a period of rapid expansion in housing and jobs. That has left Thetford with large housing estates and industrial areas on its outskirts.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para2"><a name="stpa_231">Norfolk is a diverse county, with some areas of affluence, but others of extreme deprivation. That is a significant problem in Thetford, and particularly in the west of the town. We continue to face the major challenge created by grafting three substantial housing estates on to a relatively small area, but with limited sustained mainstream investment in social and economic opportunities. The 2001 census, coupled with local information provided by the Keystone Development Trust, showed that the key issues include child poverty, ill health related to disadvantage, low educational attainment and aspirations, antisocial behaviour, high teenage pregnancy and high levels of petty crime and domestic violence. Do the Government accept that Thetford has for too long been undervalued in respect of their investment priorities?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para3"><a name="stpa_232">Fortunately, however, Thetford is now reaching a turning point. I am pleased to report that partnership-driven regeneration work, underpinned by the East of England Development Agency and European resources, has brought the town to the threshold of positive change. That has created some hugely positive trends, fostered and encouraged by many local agencies, including Breckland council, Thetford town council, the Keystone Development Trust and Norfolk county council. Thetford is benefiting from demographic diversification, with the influx of new residents who work in Norwich or Cambridge. They will bring some wealth to the town. However, it is important that we develop local jobs for local people, and have a diversity of shops and facilities, so that they choose to spend their money in the town.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 51WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para4"><a name="stpa_233">We have had help for the housing estates through the single regeneration budget and European objective 2 funding, but what will happen when that short-term regeneration funding comes to an end? The local authority is trying to balance the need for new additional housing stock with the difficulties faced in respect of outdated existing housing. That is hard to do. When the Government plan major housing developments, Ministers must accept that we need funding for local amenities if areas such as Thetford are to provide for the community when it moves in. When new houses are built, that has huge implications for schools, GPs&#039; surgeries, and local transport and leisure facilities for children and adults alike.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para5"><a name="stpa_234">Currently, there are about 7,000 migrant workers in Thetford. They meet labour shortages in the local economy&#151;they do jobs that the indigenous population do not want to do. They make a significant contribution to the economic development of the area, but, unfortunately, they are perceived by some as having a negative effect on local services and schools. I would like the Government to support local agencies to promote understanding and respect, and to ensure that we have a properly integrated community. That would allow Thetford to celebrate its new multicultural nature.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para6"><a name="stpa_235">I am the first to admit that much positive work is being done and there is a good feeling in the town, but those trends must be viewed realistically as part of a bigger picture for the community. There has been criticism that support in respect of drug and alcohol dependency, and sexual health and domestic violence on the estates, has been piecemeal, and that the lack of mainstream public resources for community centre costs or social programmes has made things worse. Unfortunately, there is a general fear of crime, and of persistent racism or racial harassment. There is only a limited amount that the local authority can do without support from central Government. As the Minister probably knows, it is doing its best. However, when we find that community policing is hampered by resource limitations, that puts the ball right back in the Government&#039;s court.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para7"><a name="stpa_236">It is true that unemployment is currently relatively low. Many of the industrial estates in Thetford were created in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the Greater London council overspill programme, when many businesses were relocated to the town. That has left a lasting legacy. There is a number of large manufacturing businesses, and a predominance of manufacturing employment in the town; over 50 per cent. of the work force are employed in that sector. However, that means that the national trend of the contraction of that sector has the potential to hit the town very hard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para8"><a name="stpa_237">In the greater Thetford area, we have recently been hit by an announcement by Del Monte that it may close its factory in Methwold, with the loss of more than 250 jobs. Future closures&#151;there will inevitably be more&#151;will result in difficult to let, outdated units as well as job losses. Will the Government recognise the challenges faced by Norfolk market towns such as Thetford, and continue to make funding support available to address those challenges? Will they also recognise that social, economic and environmental regeneration is not only 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 52WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
needed in large urban settlements and seaside resorts, but required to keep Britain&#039;s market towns vibrant and sustainable?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para9"><a name="stpa_238">Now let us look to the future. No one denies that European funds and local and regional public sector regeneration funding have started to address the social, environmental and economic issues facing the town, but will Thetford benefit and move forward over the next five to 10 years? In the draft regional spatial strategy, Breckland council has earmarked Thetford for another wave of significant growth in both housing and jobs. It sees that not as an end in itself, but as a means to regenerate Thetford, and in particular the town centre. Will the Government ensure that Thetford&#039;s potential is fully realised through support for current and future regeneration initiatives, such as the rural enterprise valley and the Moving Thetford Forward projects? Moving Thetford Forward is a vision and development strategy prepared to inform Breckland council&#039;s local development framework. It is a hugely exciting vision for the future of Thetford


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;as a lively market town where people of all ages and backgrounds feel welcome to live and visit&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para10"><a name="stpa_239">but it remains largely unfunded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para11"><a name="stpa_240">Thetford has a dearth of places to play sport, watch films, view art or go dancing. Local residents have some way to go if they want to do so. Young people lack appropriate places to meet, and public transport does not offer easy access to other towns that enjoy such benefits. What support can the Government give to encourage the development of cultural and leisure facilities to enhance the lives of the people who live in Thetford?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para12"><a name="stpa_241">As the leader of Breckland council, William Nunn, told me,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">&quot;we will need to drive this project from the public sector, because the private sector is focused on the negative reports that the media portray&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para13"><a name="stpa_242">I would like to think that this debate will start to redress the balance, and that the positive progress made in the town will persuade the private sector and the media alike that Thetford has an exciting future, which will be delivered all the sooner if we work together, and if the Government openly support the projects being instigated by local agencies and interest groups.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para14"><a name="stpa_243">Other opportunities for the future have been identified and are being examined, including the possibility of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister giving Thetford growth point status, and the possibility of establishing a market town regeneration company; a feasibility study into that is under way. Can the Minister offer advice and encouragement on the future of those initiatives? What about the local area agreement, a key Government tool for engaging all agencies? The LAA highlights many of the issues facing Thetford, but does it bring any new money to deal with them?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para15"><a name="stpa_244">In order to attract investment to the town through skilled employment and well paid jobs, Breckland council is working on the rural enterprise valley project, to which I referred. As Mark Stanton, the economic development and regeneration manager, told me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">&quot;The purpose of REV is to harness the power of Norfolk&#039;s world class motorsport and advanced engineering sectors, to gain competitive advantage for the cluster, its supply chain and related businesses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The project will build an exciting new business 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</ul>



<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 53WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>community benefiting from interaction and collaboration, business and skills support and development, increased investment and infrastructure developments.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para16"><a name="stpa_245">The project includes the construction of Thetford enterprise park, which will offer high-quality, purpose-built premises to the sector and its associated supply chain. However, two key issues are as yet unresolved, the first of which is funding.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para17"><a name="stpa_246">Breckland council, the Crown estate, which owns some of the land, the Government office for the east of England, through objective 2 funding, and Norfolk county council have all made firm or provisional commitments to funding the project. I urge the East of England Development Agency to commit to the &#163;1.5 million grant that would enable the project to get off the ground. I hope that the Minister will support me in that request. As long as the EEDA agreement remains outstanding, there is a risk for the council in starting work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para18"><a name="stpa_247">The project is hugely exciting, and will have a major and continuing economic impact on the district, county and region. It will support a high-growth sector, promote inward investment along the A11 corridor, and bring new, quality employment opportunities. I want the project to be at the heart of an area of investment and opportunity, known and promoted across the country as &quot;Tech Anglia&quot;, where people will want to live and work because it offers a positive future for them and their families.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para19"><a name="stpa_248">If we are to achieve that goal, we must address the outstanding matter of the local roads infrastructure, and in particular the A11, which is a vital link between Norfolk and the rest of the United Kingdom. There remains an 8 mile stretch of single carriageway between Fiveways Corner roundabout and Thetford which leaves Norfolk the only county, and Norwich the largest settlement, not connected to the national dual carriageway network. The need to dual that section is paramount. It must be completed as a matter of urgency. The business community, utterly frustrated by unfulfilled promises and ever growing delays on that stretch of road, has rolled in behind our local authorities. A compelling case has been submitted to the regional assembly. Will the Minister support that project, and will he join me in calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to approve it so that a timetable can be drawn up and work can start?

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para20"><a name="stpa_249">I have highlighted Thetford&#039;s history, the difficulties that the town faces, the opportunities that lie just around the corner, and the next steps towards making a real difference to Thetford and the surrounding area. I know that the Minister will take on board the fact that neighbourhood regeneration is a long haul, but does he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept that neighbourhoods such as Thetford experiencing poverty and disadvantage deserve the best and consistent services, rather than piecemeal regeneration schemes? What can he offer the people of Thetford, and the agencies working so hard on their behalf, for the future? We want Government support for a secure and viable economic future. Where necessary, we want appropriate, timely funding, to ensure the success of the area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para21"><a name="stpa_250">I have one more issue to raise, and that is the concern in Thetford, Breckland and across south-west Norfolk about the proposal by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister that the county should become unitary. There 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
is a commonly held, passionate belief in the local delivery of local services, supported, of course, by Government, rather than a one-size-fits-all unitary approach.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para22"><a name="stpa_251">Again, I thank the Minister for listening to my concerns. I invite him to visit Thetford to see for himself the issues that I raised. Thetford is an example of a town that has been done down by too many people for too long. Much could happen in the town in a short time. I am determined to do all that I can to ensure that Thetford achieves its true potential in this economically competitive and technological age, and to ensure that the concept of &quot;Tech Anglia&quot;, and all that it could stand for in East Anglia and across the country, is truly realised.

<a name="60228h03_time1"><h5>12.45 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_107"><a name="60228h03_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Jim Fitzpatrick) </b> : It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Hood. I congratulate the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) on securing this debate, which provides an opportunity to discuss the significant work in progress to regenerate Thetford. I appreciate his kind remarks, and I hope to respond somewhat positively to a number of his points.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para23"><a name="stpa_252">Recent developments in the town and plans for the future are extremely encouraging, as has been outlined by the hon. Gentleman. Partners including Thetford town council, Breckland council, the Keystone Development Trust and the East of England Development Agency have been working together to develop long-term plans for the town. Those plans culminated this month in the launch of a vision and a development strategy called Moving Thetford Forward, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That strategy is the product of extensive consultation with local stakeholders, and local people will continue to be widely consulted as a vital part of ongoing activities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para24"><a name="stpa_253">At the core of the proposals is the plan to build on the town&#039;s outstanding natural assets. From among those, the town&#039;s waterfront has been identified as offering considerable opportunities for development. I am advised that options for increasing waterside accommodation and attractive leisure activities are under consideration. Residents and businesses are keen for further improvements to the town&#039;s streetscaping, and want to combine a mix of traditional and contemporary enhancements that are sympathetic to Thetford&#039;s rich history and to its need to develop as a modern, thriving economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para25"><a name="stpa_254">In all, five key themes have been identified as the basis for the vision and the development strategy. The putting together of that vision has really underlined the strength of the partnership in Thetford and the determination of central partners, including those mentioned, to reinvigorate the town, working hand-in-hand with local businesses and residents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para26"><a name="stpa_255">It is important that the vision maintains its momentum as a blueprint for practical actions in the town over the next few years. As part of the vision, the East of England Development Agency invited Breckland council to submit a proposal for a feasibility study to consider the potential for establishing a market town regeneration company in Thetford. Obviously, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 55WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that is still at an early stage, but it provides a clear signal of the positive intent of partners to ensure that Thetford continues to progress and realise its potential.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para27"><a name="stpa_256">Rightly, people living and working in Thetford take great pride in the town&#039;s rich history and culture. Thetford has an exceptionally interesting past, which has been influential in shaping key investments to develop the local economy. It was from Thetford that Queen Boudicca&#151;when I was educated, she was called Boadicea&#151;plotted her attempted overthrow of the Romans. Another resident continuing the noble tradition of freedom and liberty was Thomas Paine, who attended Thetford grammar school. Of course, Thetford was a world-famous centre for steam traction engine production in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century through the Charles Burrell company.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para28"><a name="stpa_257">That history has been at the centre of significant investments in the town, designed to unlock the potential in that rich heritage and so help stimulate the town&#039;s economy. The development of the magnificent ancient house museum, located in a 15th century Tudor merchant&#039;s house, will provide an outstanding exhibition space for the town&#039;s collection of valuable artefacts. Those include a hoard of late Roman jewellery and spoons as well as a display of original items from an Indian prince with connections to Thetford, Duleep Singh, the last Sikh maharajah of the Punjab. The manner in which this architectural jewel has been revitalised illustrates well the community-based approach to cultural and economic development in the town. Throughout the closure, local people have been involved and kept informed of progress, and educational opportunities have been maximised through close working with Thetford&#039;s schools.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para29"><a name="stpa_258">The town&#039;s industrial heritage is celebrated and explored in the redeveloped Charles Burrell museum, which contains some wonderful examples of steam-powered traction engines. The local community is now considering options for further developing this facility, including potentially enhancing its impact as a museum that brings to life the history of Charles Burrell and Sons in the town, or extending its usage as a craft and music venue for the young. The need for increased provision for young people in the town has been identified as a particular priority within the Thetford vision and development strategy, as mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para30"><a name="stpa_259">As well as stimulating the town&#039;s economy through the creation of 21st century visitor attractions, such facilities are also acting as powerful tools to engage local people in the town&#039;s history and culture, and that can exert only a positive influence on people&#039;s sense of pride in place and connection with the town, which the Government are keen to promote. This sense of pride in place is clearly important in helping to bring together the culturally diverse community that lives in Thetford.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para31"><a name="stpa_260">Thetford has a proud tradition of embracing and supporting new populations and groups, from the migration of engineers during the 19th and the early part of the 20th century from London, the midlands and Yorkshire, to the expanding employment opportunities in the town&#039;s Burrell works, to the settlement in the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
1950s of several thousand Londoners in Thetford and the more recent establishment of a growing Portuguese community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para32"><a name="stpa_261">Of course, as well as bringing fresh opportunities and perspectives, these changes have also carried with them new challenges. The Government recognise that and have invested, for example, in measures to ensure that the Portuguese community is supported as part of a thriving community and is able fully to play its part. The difficulties faced by this growing migrant community in negotiating language and cultural barriers are real, as are problems accessing employment and training opportunities and general services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para33"><a name="stpa_262">In responding to these challenges, more than &#163;190,000 is being provided under the Home Office&#039;s race equality grant scheme, &quot;Connecting Communities&quot;, through the Thetford-based Keystone Development Trust, to remove barriers to employment and skills development. A central part of this scheme will be a range of services to guide migrant workers through the various types of provision in the Breckland area. The scheme also includes support for the setting up of a Multilingual and European Thetford Association, run by and for migrant workers, and support for better childcare facilities, which are more responsive to the shift patterns worked by some migrants. Practical work advice has been provided to hundreds of Portuguese people, directly resulting in them gaining employment. An information pack, providing a guide to public services in the Breckland area, brings this information together.

</p>


<p>

Further investment in a refurbished grade 2 listed landmark office building in Thetford, to create a community development centre, is providing a strong statement of the town&#039;s determination to put development of its citizens and the work of community groups at the heart of future plans. This is complemented by the refurbishment of a voluntary sector hub to promote voluntary groups and to tap into the unique insight and understanding of this sector as a significant provider of essential services.

Turnover in advanced engineering in Breckland in 2003 amounted to &#163;190 million, of which &#163;23.8 million was within the motor sport sector.

Many schemes are in place or under development to deliver this. The A11 is a key trunk road, both within Norfolk and also as a route connecting Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The Minister will know that several improvements have taken place to this road over recent years&#151;most recently, the current A11 Attleborough bypass improvement scheme, which is due to open in early 2007.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para43"><a name="stpa_272">The A11 Fiveways to Thetford improvement scheme is identified in the Highways Agency&#039;s current business plan as a scheme to be progressed subject to regional priorities. We have now received the region&#039;s advice and are assessing it. The A11 Fiveways to Thetford scheme has been identified as a priority scheme by the region and within that ranking it has been allocated a delivery date of no earlier than 2011&#150;12. This takes into consideration the funds available over the next 10-year period and how the full list of schemes can be afforded out of that funding. I understand that the Minister of State, Department for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), is writing to the hon. Gentleman with details and further clarification.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h03_para44"><a name="stpa_273">It is possible that the scheme could be started earlier, but only if other schemes do not happen or their programmes slip. The region will be undertaking regular reviews of the priority list to ensure that best use is made of the money available. In addition, improvements have been made to the A47 and measures are being taken forward by the Highways Agency, under its route management strategy, to improve safety and incident management and control vehicle speeds along the Acle straight.

<a name="60228h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Southampton Airport</h3>

<a name="time_11">
<a name="60228h04_time0"><h5>1 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60228h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. John Denham  (Southampton, Itchen)</b>  (Lab): I am very grateful for this Adjournment debate and the opportunity to talk about the expansion of Southampton airport. I hope that I am speaking up on behalf of those of my constituents who will be worst and most directly affected by the proposed expansion. The plans that I shall be discussing today were set out in the airport master plan that was published last summer. It is because that plan will eventually find its way to the desks of Ministers that I thought a debate in the House of Commons would be appropriate.


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para0"><a name="stpa_276">I must admit that I am not quite sure what the Minister will do with the airport master plan when it arrives. I hope that one thing that we shall clarify today will be what will happen in Government when the master plans are received from various regional airports. I hope that Ministers will take responsibility for what happens at a local level as a result of national Government policy. My fear, I am afraid, is that Ministers may wash their hands of the problems and challenges that arise; that the master plan will be noted but that nothing will be done nationally to ensure that there is protection from the environmental damage that is currently proposed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para1"><a name="stpa_277">The master plan was produced in direct response to the Government&#039;s aviation White Paper. The first thing that I want today is an assurance from the Minister that the Government will take whatever measures are needed to ensure that the local environmental impact will be properly assessed, taken into account and dealt with. Secondly, the master plan is, as I shall explain, a very big change from the figures published in the White Paper. I shall be interested to know from the Minister whether the Government are in any way committed to the projections that were published just a couple of years ago.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para2"><a name="stpa_278">There is a certain amount of d&#233;j&#224; vu for me in the debate. The first ten-minute Bill that I introduced into the House of Commons after my election in 1992 called for greater local planning powers over airport expansion. It is with some regret that I say 14 years later that very little has changed. There are no direct local or strategic planning controls over airport operations. The only controls&#151;I think that this is true in many ways even of massive airports such as Heathrow&#151;come from the need for planning permission for works on the ground. In Southampton&#039;s case it is only because new hard standings and improved terminal buildings will be needed that local authority planning will come into play at all.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para3"><a name="stpa_279">I still do not believe that it is acceptable that planning controls kick in only because of an accident of the current physical layout of the airport. In any case, the structures are wrong. In our case, the planning authority is Eastleigh district council, which covers the airport but not my constituents, who lie to the south of the site. Southampton district council, the city council, has no direct planning powers at all in relation to the airport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para4"><a name="stpa_280">I presume that Governments have resisted a better planning process because they fear that it might prevent all airport development. I do not think that that is true. As I shall freely acknowledge, the development of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 60WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Southampton airport has brought significant economic, development and employment benefits. Strategic planning processes are often well able to balance different considerations, and there is no reason why airport development should be the one major industrial activity in this country that is not subject to proper planning. Many people in Southampton would find it extraordinary that, although Ministers recently turned down the vital expansion of the port of Southampton&#151;a decision with far greater economic consequences and far fewer environmental consequences&#151;after a lengthy planning process, no similar process has been followed with respect to the development of the airport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para5"><a name="stpa_281">At the same time, I want the Minister&#039;s assurance that the Government will not try to overrule the limited planning powers that currently exist by using the new strategic planning process. It would be quite unacceptable if any future local public inquiry were to be rendered largely irrelevant by a Government declaration that the expansion has regional significance. I hope that we can be given an assurance that the new strategic planning powers will not be used in that way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para6"><a name="stpa_282">One thing is perfectly clear. We cannot rely on the airport operators, BAA, to safeguard the interests of my constituents who live under the flight path. As I will make clear in a moment, I am not as critical of the local airport management as many of my constituents, but it is a sad fact that the master plan made no mention of the immediate environmental impact of airport expansion. It made no mention of the means of controlling, limiting or mitigating the impact in the areas closest to the airport. To do that, we need to look to the local authorities and to the Minister.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para7"><a name="stpa_283">It may help the Minister if I provide a sketch of the airport and its environment. The airport lies between Southampton and Eastleigh, occupying the entire gap between the M27 motorway and what is left of Eastleigh&#039;s rail works. The single runway runs more or less north-south, ensuring that all takeoffs and landings are directly over residential areas in either Southampton or Eastleigh. The simple truth is that if there were no airport there today it is inconceivable that anyone would give planning permission for any type of airport in that location.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para8"><a name="stpa_284">At the southern, Southampton, end, the ground rises relatively sharply to a height of around 300 ft; the rise begins a short distance from the south of the end of the runway and the M27. The rising ground is almost entirely developed as a residential area, with some important local schools. It is that area, Townhill park, that bears the brunt of the noise and disturbance. A small distance to the south is Bitterne park, a contiguous residential area that is also badly affected.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para9"><a name="stpa_285">The majority of complaints come from those living on the hill, but there is also a significant impact on those living at a lower height along the east bank of the river Itchen. I should declare an interest at this point, because that is where I live, although somewhat further to the south than most of those who complain about the airport. The impact on those living in the lower area is partly caused by the deliberate decision to route as many flights as possible along the river route&#151;a decision that I support, even though those flights go over the top of my house.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 61WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para10"><a name="stpa_286">The airport may still be best known outside the city as the site of the maiden flight of R.J. Mitchell&#039;s Spitfire. For much of the postwar period, it was a fairly sleepy local airport. The first major development took place in the early 1990s. It was that that prompted my earlier private Member&#039;s Bill. At that time, low-cost flights had not been developed. The airport was seen primarily as a &quot;briefcase&quot; airport, concentrating on the business market, with a limited number of charter flights.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para11"><a name="stpa_287">The local authorities were able to use their limited planning powers to extract a number of agreements on airport operations, including a ban on night flying. The voluntary agreement to route flights along the river was brought in around this time. It would be wrong to suggest that those controls produced a satisfactory position for local residents. Noise, vortices and general intrusion continued, but to some extent the economics of the airport operation limited the full impact that we had feared in the early 1990s.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para12"><a name="stpa_288">That all changed with the advent of local low-cost flights and the operation in Southampton of Flybe. There was a substantial increase in the number of flights by older and noisier aircraft, particularly the BAe 146. The number of early morning flights also increased significantly. That development, with its huge impact on local people, needed no new planning procedures. It was just a change in the economics of airport operation. The public response was very sharp; at that time the airport became&#151;it has stayed&#151;the most significant local constituency issue in my postbag.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para13"><a name="stpa_289">Over the past two years there has been pretty constant engagement between local people and the airport. I believe that the airport manager, who has just retired, David Cumming, made a serious effort to listen to what local people were saying, and within the constraints of his job, which was of course to manage and expand an airport, to improve things to some extent. Flybe has also been engaged in that process.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para14"><a name="stpa_290">A number of things were attempted. A trial was run which involved alternative routes and allowing the four-engined planes to climb to 3,000 rather than 1,000 ft before levelling out. Unfortunately, the assessment showed a limited impact from those trials, although I and others firmly believe that the local impact on the worst affected areas was positive. It was a shame that the trials were not continued. At long last a better monitoring system was brought in so that aircraft deviating from agreed routes could be identified. Sadly, that has been inoperable for much of the past two years because of problems with the Pease Pottage radar system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para15"><a name="stpa_291">The process of engagement with the airport was not always satisfactory for my constituents. Some meetings became dominated by people who lived a pretty long way from the airport. They had legitimate concerns, but the impact on their lives was far less. It is important at this point to get across to my hon. Friend the Minister exactly how much the airport has grown, and how much it is planned that it will grow. In 1997 there were just under 600,000 passengers and 25,000 aircraft movements. By 2001 there were 803,000 passengers and 27,000 aircraft movements. In 2003 there were 1.138 million passengers and nearly 32,000 movements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para16"><a name="stpa_292">It was in 2003 that BAA made its submission to the Government&#039;s consultation on the development of air transport. In that submission it said that Southampton 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
airport could grow to accommodate around 2.5 million passengers by 2030 within its existing boundaries and assuming, as is planned, additional runway capacity at other airports in the south-east. Thus the long-term aim is for 2.5 million passengers by 2030. The Government seem to accept that view. In their White Paper, they referred to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">&quot;support for some growth to allow it&quot;&#151;</p>

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">&quot;to cater for local demand. The airport operator doubts that the airport could reach the capacity of &quot;</p>

<p>



</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;and believes that, within its current boundary, the airport would more likely grow to a capacity of&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para19"><a name="stpa_295">2 to 2.5 million passengers per annum. That expansion to 2.5 million passengers was greeted with some horror by local residents, but at least it was spread over a lengthy period, with the possibility of quieter aircraft and further restrictions. However, those projections have been torn up in the new master plan. By 2004, the annual passenger numbers had reached 1.5 million, with 37,400 passenger movements. According to the master plan, the number of passengers will be 3 million by 2015&#151;not 2.5 million by 2030&#151;and 6 million by 2030. The number of passenger movements will be 62,000 at the end of that period. It is not surprising that local people have had enough.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para20"><a name="stpa_296">The planning controls are very limited. Development will take place on BAA land over the next nine years, although permission will be required for aircraft stands, taxiways and improved check-in facilities. That brings the issue a bit within the local authorities&#039; remit, and Southampton and Eastleigh have considered the master plan. I am on record as saying that both local authorities have been too weak in their dealings with the airport over the years, although I accept that their powers are limited.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para21"><a name="stpa_297">In September, Southampton city council resolved that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35">&quot;Council acknowledges the important contribution, direct and indirect, made by the Airport to the local and regional economy.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">However, Council also recognises that current levels of noise and pollution are understandably a matter of concern to the residents in some parts of the City and believes that addressing these issues should be at the forefront of BAA&#039;s plans for the future of Southampton airport.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para22"><a name="stpa_298">Unfortunately, the city council&#039;s formal submission to BAA did not reflect that strong unanimous resolution and no reference was made to reducing noise pollution. Why that happened is an internal matter for the city council, but I note that its final position was almost identical to the much more positive position taken by the Liberal Democrat leadership of Eastleigh council.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para23"><a name="stpa_299">There is no doubt that the airport has brought significant benefits. There are 1,500 jobs there, many of which are done by my constituents, who value the opportunities that the airport has brought them. It is also valuable for business to be able to fly into and out of Southampton as a premier south coast airport. Local surveys also indicate wide public support. I acknowledge all that, but sometimes our job as Members of Parliament is to stand up for the minority and to ask difficult questions that no one else wants to ask.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para24"><a name="stpa_300">My constituents who live under the flight path are perhaps the minority among those with an interest in the airport, but their rights must be protected. The airport&#039;s impact can be judged against several different factors, including noise, vortex damage, pollution and safety. Many of those are not amenable to simple measurement or assessment. As we have found in the past, noise readings taken over an extended period do not capture the impact of individual flights. Nor is it easy to measure the combined effect of noise, disruption, the loss of useable amenities&#151;such as a garden on a summer afternoon&#151;or, indeed, fear.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para25"><a name="stpa_301">We had a large public meeting in November, and the position that emerged from it was clear. It is essential that future plans for the airport start from the recognition that the current impact on local people is unacceptable. It is no good asking how much more people can take, because they cannot take any more. On the contrary, the master plan&#039;s starting point should be that local residents&#039; quality of life should improve year on year over the entire period covered by the plan. When the plan is finalised, it should identify the key issues raised in the consultation, setting out how they should be measured and assessed and what measures will be taken to reduce their impact.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para26"><a name="stpa_302">It is pretty clear that, left to itself, BAA will not take such an approach and that local authorities&#039; powers to enforce it are limited. The Minister must therefore assure me that the Government will do everything they can to ensure that we achieve a strategy to bring about a continuous improvement in the environment of Townhill park and Bitterne park. To start with, key elements of such a strategy will include the need for noise reduction. That will partly involve ensuring that the airport puts in place a good monitoring system so that it can track flights into and out of the airport, and it is beginning to do that. However, there must also be an effective and continuous system of noise monitoring so that we can identify not only levels of background noise but the impact of individual flights. In addition, I hope that the Minister will support moves to put pressure on the airport to require operators to use quieter aircraft. We have been promised that the noisy BAe 146s will be replaced with Brazlian Embraer aircraft, which are supposed to have a quieter profile. The problem is that we have no means of forcing through changes faster than the airlines, for commercial reasons, wish to implement them. I hope that the Minister will tell me today that stronger powers will be made available to enable planning authorities to force the move to quieter aircraft.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para27"><a name="stpa_303">The Government&#039;s White Paper made the remarkable claim that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">&quot;we will require that airport developments are consistent with existing arrangements for the control of the noise impacts of aviation&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para28"><a name="stpa_304">but there are no effective controls. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">&quot;local controls should operate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. noise impacts are limited, and where possible reduced over time&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para29"><a name="stpa_305">I agree, but I hope that the Minister can tell me exactly how that is meant to happen. Can she assure me that a local authority could refuse planning permission for further development on the grounds&#151;and solely on the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 64WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
grounds&#151;that no agreement had been reached to reduce noise impacts over time? Such measures will be essential for the future life and well-being of my constituents. We need similar measures to monitor, assess and tackle vortex damage, as well as to assess the current levels of air pollution and ensure that they are reduced.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para30"><a name="stpa_306">We also need to ensure that safety is properly addressed. A few years ago, the major secondary school under the flight path&#151;Bitterne park school&#151;wanted to build a sports centre, which would have been used for a variety of public activities and would have attracted a large number of visitors. However, the school could not get planning permission, because it was under the airport flight path and it was against Government policy to encourage developments that would attract a large number of people under a flight path. Yet, it is now proposed to have almost three times as many planes flying over the same area, which was deemed unsuitable for a development that would attract a large number of people. I hope that the Minister can explain how safety considerations will be taken into account when Government priorities seem so confused. In my view, it will not be possible to have the scale of expansion currently proposed for Southampton airport while delivering an acceptable environment for my constituents. We need to explore ways in which the airport could be required to have a business model that, for example, put more emphasis on business traffic and less on continuous expansion of the low-cost holiday business. In that way, we can keep the elements of the airport that are essential to local economic development, while minimising the harm to local people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para31"><a name="stpa_307">My final question&#151;I apologise to the Minister for going on slightly longer than I intended&#151;is simply this: does it make sense to plan for 6 million passengers in 2030, given everything that we know about climate change and the rapidly increasing contribution of air transport to greenhouse gases? I do not believe for one moment that public policy will be able to allow the increase in air transport that is implied if we are to deliver what we need to deliver to save our environment. At the Liaison Committee a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister told me that, in his view, the global community would need, by 2012, to have taken the key decisions needed to address climate change. It is difficult to believe that those decisions will allow the uncontrolled expansion of air transport that the present figures imply. I hope that the Minister will tell me that the Government recognise the problem and that the planet&#039;s long-term sustainability is, at long last, and after too much delay, being taken into account in aviation policy.

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="60228h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Ms Karen Buck) </b> : I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denham) on securing this important debate. I certainly recognise that the points that he addressed are legitimate and growing concerns, both for the communities in Southampton around the airport and, as he mentioned in closing, in terms of the contribution of aviation&#151;among many other strands of the transport industry and domestic use&#151;to climate change and how we address that.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para32"><a name="stpa_308">Before I come to those issues, I remind my right hon. Friend that the air transport White Paper, which we&nbsp;published in 2003, was the first attempt to set out a long-term framework to match the development requirements of industry. It provided guidance to communities about how air traffic was likely to develop and gave some confidence to that development process. Explicitly, the White Paper did not do so as part of a &quot;predict and provide&quot; approach&#151;the Government wholly reject the accusation that it did&#151;but to reflect the fact that aviation is a growing sector that has an important contribution to make to the economy, as he recognised in his local context, and reflects people&#039;s increasing desire to travel.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para33"><a name="stpa_309">Many UK airports are reaching the limits of their capacity. It is therefore important that we consider how some of those benefits and demands can be accommodated, while absolutely rejecting a &quot;predict and provide&quot; model and ensuring that we build in the necessary measures to mitigate some of the disadvantages of air traffic growth at the local, national and global levels.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para34"><a name="stpa_310">I shall start with my right hon. Friend&#039;s concluding remarks about what the Prime Minister has said is one of the most important challenges facing the planet. The Government recognise that we must ensure that aviation, which is a growing sector, makes a contribution to addressing the urgent challenge of climate change. We know that unilateral action is not likely to be effective, because aviation is by definition a global industry. We are therefore working with other nations through the International Civil Aviation Organisation to promote and develop ways in which aviation can contribute to those aims, developing and introducing better technology, and improving operating practice.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para35"><a name="stpa_311">An important achievement that was driven through during the UK presidency of the EU was to bring nearer aviation&#039;s entry into the European emissions trading programme. We see emissions trading as the way to ensure that aviation makes a proper contribution to tackling climate change. Compared with the other instruments that are currently available, emissions trading is the most likely to be effective because it provides an economic incentive to reduce emissions. That contrasts with, for example, a more generalised taxation measure, which we have also been called on to introduce.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para36"><a name="stpa_312">My right hon. Friend understandably focused his remarks on Southampton. We recognise the economic benefits that regional airports such as Southampton generate for their regions and we support their growth to serve regional and local demand, subject of course to the necessary environmental constraints.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para37"><a name="stpa_313">The White Paper invited airport operators to produce master plans setting out their development proposals in response to the conclusions reached in the White Paper. Master plans provide a transparent means for airport operators to explain their development proposals. They help airport operators to take forward the White Paper policy regionally and locally, and to inform stakeholders at all levels. That enables stakeholders to have a say on how the local airport develops. However, I should make it clear that master plans are owned by airport operators, not the Government. As such, master 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 66WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
plans do not have development plan status, although the level of detail that they contain may inform local and regional planning processes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para38"><a name="stpa_314">As my right hon. Friend recognises, Southampton airport makes a key contribution to local economic prosperity. More than 1,000 people are directly employed there, more than 500 work in related jobs and, according to an economic impact study of 2004, the airport makes an annual contribution of &#163;86.5 million to the local economy. The air transport White Paper referred to smaller airports such as Southampton as having an important role in the future provision of airport capacity in the south-east. It recognised Southampton as a regional airport and supported growth to allow it to cater for local demand.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para39"><a name="stpa_315">The airport expects passenger numbers to grow from the current 1.5 million a year to around 3 million in 2015 and 6 million by 2030. Those forecasts are not subject to Government approval&#151;there are many reasons why forecasts for airports that do not have movement limits set on them may differ from those in the White Paper&#151;but we expect forecasts to be scrutinised in the planning process. If there is an expansion, the figures on which it is based can be brought before the planning process and the forecasts tested for their validity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para40"><a name="stpa_316">BAA published its draft consultative master plan for Southampton in July 2005. The plan detailed how the airport intended to meet the growing demand for regional air travel and gave a commitment to sustainable development and responsible growth. BAA is currently studying the responses to its consultation and I understand that it will write to respondents shortly to outline how it plans to address the key themes that emerged from their consultation. As reflected in my right hon. Friend&#039;s comments, those themes were noise, air quality, the potential impact on climate change and surface access.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para41"><a name="stpa_317">BAA expected to publish its final master plan by the end of 2005, but the number and content of the responses that it received&#151;800, of which I understand that 100 were quite detailed&#151;encouraged it to carry out further work. BAA now expects to publish its final master plan this summer, alongside a noise strategy, an air quality strategy and a revised surface access strategy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para42"><a name="stpa_318">I hope that it is clear that the master-planning process and the consultation that underpinned it have provided an effective means of identifying local concerns and that they in turn have directly influenced BAA&#039;s planning for the airport. I take that as a confirmation of the value of such plans, which were introduced for the first time in the 2003 White Paper.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para43"><a name="stpa_319">That is not to suggest that such plans confer planning approval for development, however. Any proposal for expansion would be subject to the planning system in the normal way, taking account of the policies set out in the White Paper and Eastleigh borough council&#039;s local plan. It is for the local development plan to address the development of the airport. The local plan and the local development frameworks must take account of the regional development strategy when it is finalised next year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para44"><a name="stpa_320">My right hon. Friend is concerned about noise. Southampton airport is designated under section 35 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which requires it to provide a proper forum for consultation with users, local 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 67WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
authorities and local representative organisations. All airports so designated, including Southampton, have chosen to establish consultative committees. The airport is subject to normal planning controls, and the local planning authority may set such noise-related or other environmental conditions on new developments as it considers appropriate. I hope that that goes some way to answering my right hon. Friend&#039;s question.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para45"><a name="stpa_321">I understand that the airport has a range of noise mitigation measures. Scheduled night flights are banned and a flying controls agreement is in place with Eastleigh borough council, which lays down operating guidelines to ensure that noise is kept to a minimum and hours of operation are limited. Noise-sensitive operations are restricted and noise preferential routes are in operation to avoid, as far as possible, the most heavily populated areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para46"><a name="stpa_322">I understand that the airport began a trial of new take-off and landing procedures last July to try to minimise the impact of noise on local people. The trial is due to be completed at the end of October and the results will be reviewed by the airport&#039;s technical working group. The Government&#039;s policy, reflecting the individuality of airports, remains that local noise problems should be tackled with local solutions. The airport&#039;s flying controls agreement with Eastleigh borough council is a good example of that approach.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para47"><a name="stpa_323">The provisional local transport plan for Hampshire notes that many factors contribute to air pollution, which my right hon. Friend mentioned. It also records the preparation of an air quality action plan, which is intended to address the issues that have resulted in Eastleigh being declared an air quality management area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h04_para48"><a name="stpa_324">Unfortunately, I am about to run out of time, but I undertake to write to my right hon. Friend about the other issues that he raised. I very much hope that BAA will read this debate with interest and take proper account of the concerns that he expressed on behalf of his constituents.

<a name="60228h05_head0"><h3 align=center>Second Homes (Cornwall)</h3>

<a name="time_13">
<a name="60228h05_time0"><h5>1.29 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_114"><a name="60228h05_spnew0"><b> Matthew Taylor  (Truro and St. Austell)</b>  (LD): I welcome the opportunity to have this debate, and welcome the Minister for Housing and Planning. This issue has been on-running for some time in our part of the world and in national parks and other areas that are popular for holiday-making. In Cornwall, it has reached crisis point with homelessness figures and the unaffordability of local housing to local people on local wages. Many people who do not come up in the homelessness figures, but who are looking for homes and cannot afford them are also affected, such as young people who live with their families and others who have left the county because of work and the housing situation, but who would like to live where they were born and brought up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para0"><a name="stpa_325">The number of second homes in Cornwall has been growing substantially, although the figures are not easy to determine in detail. The rawest figures suggest that the number of second homes&#151;homes for which people are essentially getting council tax discounts, which are unoccupied for most of the year and which are used by families only for holidays, and are not used commercially&#151;has risen from 9,233 in 2000 to 13,221 in 2005. That is a growth of more than 40 per cent. Almost 4,000 of what were mainly family homes are no longer available to local people. The total number of households in Cornwall is 215,000, so more than 6 per cent. are now second homes of that sort. That does not include holiday homes to let that have come through the business rating system.
</p>






<p><a name="st_115"><a name="60228h05_spnew1"><b> Andrew George  (St. Ives)</b>  (LD): My hon. Friend makes a good point. He will be aware that on the Isles of Scilly, which are part of my constituency, nearly 25&nbsp;per cent. of the housing stock is second homes. In a survey of estate agents that I undertook in my constituency last year, I found that twice as many properties sold in the previous year had gone to second home usage than to first-time buyers. That amplifies the seriousness of the situation.
</p>






<p><a name="st_116"><a name="60228h05_spnew2"><b> Matthew Taylor </b> : My hon. Friend makes a good point about the Scillies, but the problem is not only there, it also affects popular holiday communities around Cornwall. Official figures for St. Just in Roseland parish show that there are 234 second and holiday homes and 596 homes in which people are in full-time residence. Second home ownership in some Cornish parishes is as high as 80 per cent., taking holiday lets into account. A survey conducted in Portscatho suggested that 85 per cent. of properties are unoccupied most of the year. That is not a small village; it is quite a substantial one. Manaccan on the Lizard peninsular, with which my hon. Friend will be familiar, also has a figure of more than 80 per cent.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para1"><a name="stpa_326">To put those figures in context, in the same period there was an increase in social housing. While there were 4,000 extra second homes, the net increase in social housing was 51&#151;just over 1,000 properties were built, but nearly 1,000 were sold through the right to buy. Indeed, since the right to buy was introduced, more than 10,000 council houses in the county have been sold. That is a third of the stock.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 69WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para2"><a name="stpa_327">In north Cornwall, there are 3,797 second homes&#151;I reiterate that I refer to homes used only by their owners&#039; families and friends and which are not rented out commercially&#151;compared with 4,595 local authority and registered social landlord homes. The number of second homes in north Cornwall is approaching that of homes available for affordable housing, and far exceeds that number when commercially let properties are taken into account. There is a similar problem with building developments. In 2004&#150;05, 2,000 homes were built, of which all but 231 were private commercial developments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para3"><a name="stpa_328">All that takes place in a county in which homelessness is a serious issue. In 2004&#150;05, 1,213 households were found newly homeless, of which 875 were considered to be in priority need.At the end of September 2005, more than 1,000 homeless households were placed in temporary accommodation through local authorities, and 15,600 were on the housing register in the county in 2004&#150;05. It is interesting to put those figures in the context of vacancies among local authority and RSL housing. In north Cornwall, there were only 272 vacancies, but more than 2,000 individuals were accepted on the homeless register, which includes only those individuals who are deemed to be in need of social housing. It will not include young adults of working age because they are not considered to be in that sort of need. People have to be disabled, have children or be elderly to qualify, or there must be some other relevant factor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para4"><a name="stpa_329">The most recent figures that I have been given include only second homes under the council tax discount&#151;there is still a 10 per cent. discount&#151;but according to people to whom I have spoken, those data are dubious. Others researching this issue may be aware of that. I make that point because the Minister may refer to that council tax data, according to which second home numbers appear to have remained fairly constant since 2002, and even to have declined in some parishes. However the people to whom I have spoken say that that is not representative of the true issue. Housing officers and county council statisticians all say that those official figures do not reflect the real situation. What evidence of that is there? The deputy chair of the Cornwall branch of the National Association of Estate Agents confirms that estate agents report no decline in the number of people buying second homes in the county. Local communities reporting to district and county housing officers and statisticians say that that the number of second homes in their villages and towns is greater than official figures suggest. That has been confirmed to me by district council housing officers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para5"><a name="stpa_330">A survey conducted by Crantock parish council in 2004 concluded that actual second home numbers are far higher than the census figures. For Manaccan, census figues put second home ownership at 25.2 per cent., but the parish council figure is more like 80 per cent. Similarly, official figures for Veryan parish show 116 second and holiday homes compared to 427 resident households, but in Portscatho, which is one of the major communities in that area, and which is similar to others, an actual household survey suggested that more than 80 per cent. of properties were owned by people who were not in full-time residence. In such places, one has only to look at the blank windows on winter evenings to know that that is obviously true.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 70WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para6"><a name="stpa_331">In Portloe, I was approached by a constituent who is looking for housing. He works as an odd-job man in the area and is obviously on a low income. He had just been given notice to leave the last full-time rented property in the parish. All other rented properties are rented as holiday accommodation, so the best that he could get was a winter let. That vacancy had come about because&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;the property was being sold as a second home.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para7"><a name="stpa_332">Why does the problem with data exist? There are a number of reasons for it, and it is important that the Minister is aware of them, because they are significant issues for Government as well as for us in the county. Restrictions on time and resources are impacting negatively on the quality of data gathered through the census, but I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the fact that council tax data seem to be increasingly more misleading. That might be an unforeseen&#151;or partly foreseen because there was comment about the possibility of tax avoidance&#151;consequence of people seeking to minimise their tax knowing that they can get a 50 per cent. discount on second homes, rather than only a 10 per cent. council tax discount. The senior research officer at the county council told me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">&quot;With council tax my understanding is that it is financially more advantageous for some owners of what really are second homes to pay business rates. Also I don&#039;t think this is quantifiable unless research has been done which I don&#039;t know about, but it is said that some couples with two properties register one of them in each of the two properties and each pays council tax with a single person discount .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Those are just two reasons why the figures may be dodgy.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para8"><a name="stpa_333">The loss of the second homes council tax incentive means that there is a potential financial advantage for couples or family members to register as single occupants of properties. They then qualify for a 25 per cent. discount, and often look forward to inheritance tax advantages in the future. Young adults living with their parents might be registered as living at second homes in order to minimise council tax payments there and future tax liabilities. Alternatively it may be financially advantageous to a register a second home as a small business and apply for small business rate relief. The anecdotal evidence confirms that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para9"><a name="stpa_334">A member of the treasury team at Kerrier district council reported an increase in the number of domestic property addresses submitted on the last batch of forms for small business rate relief. He noted a drop in the number of second homes registered compared with the previous year. People are swapping across. Restormel and Carrick both confirmed that and I was provided with a specific example in Kerrier, which gives a measure of the financial advantage of doing that. A property in Kerrier district council that is currently in council tax band B&#151;a small property with a council tax that is not particularly high&#151;would, with the 10 per cent. second home discount, be subject to &#163;836.46 in council tax. However, if it were registered as part of a small business, it would be subject to &#163;809.25, which would be the full business rate, but if an application were made for the 50&nbsp;per cent. small business discount, the bill would be reduced to &#163;404.63. That is a clear incentive to make the change, even without issues such as capital gains tax avoidance and inheritance tax further down the line.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para10"><a name="stpa_335">If that were happening to a great extent, one would expect the process to filter through to the holiday-homes-to-let market. The figures are incomplete 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 71WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
because if people say that they are registering as a letting business but do not bother to let the property they do not necessarily come into contact with the tourist associations. Even setting that aside, in 2001 there were 2,895 self-catering accommodation businesses in Cornwall and in 2005 there were 4,111, the great majority of which were hired holiday homes. That is significant growth, to say the least, and there are likely to be thousands more. Those figure show that, contrary to the indication from council tax figures on second homes that there has been a slight decline in numbers, there has been an increase of more than 1,000. Taking the two together, it is not unreasonable to assume that about 10 per cent. of all properties in Cornwall are likely to be holiday homes or second homes. Those homes used to be for full-time family use.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para11"><a name="stpa_336">I hope that I do not need to spell out the resulting issues in too much detail, but I will run through them. First, this is money coming in from other parts of the country from people who are wealthy enough either to invest in a small business&#151;letting the property&#151;or to have it simply as a second home. Many people can afford to do that. It undoubtedly contributes to rising house prices because it adds a huge extra demand to the market. The average house price in Cornwall confirms that prices bear no relation to local incomes. The average house price in Cornwall is now just over &#163;208,000, compared with &#163;191,000 in England and Wales, yet our wages are 25 per cent. below the national average. According to Shelter and others, that is the worst affordability gap in the country and worse than London where house prices are higher, but incomes are much higher.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para12"><a name="stpa_337">Since 1999, national house prices have risen by 97.9 per cent. and that created headlines about inflationary house price rises. However, in Cornwall the rise has been 153.1 per cent. Yet wages have fallen further behind the national average in the same period, so it has clearly not been driven by people in the local housing market. That has also led to the erosion of community fabric as family members are priced out of the market and forced either to move away or to live in the family home. Tight-knit communities have been weakened as a result.
</p>






<p><a name="st_117"><a name="60228h05_spnew3"><b> Mr. Dan Rogerson  (North Cornwall)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Does he agree that the effects that he is describing could have an impact on the excellent education system that is provided in Cornwall because of the decline in numbers in small village schools, which will create problems in future?
</p>






<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60228h05_spnew4"><b> Matthew Taylor </b> : My hon. Friend is right, and I was about to come to the reduced use of local services. Those services include not only schools, but pubs, post offices and buses, and reduced use sometimes results in the closure of services. I shall give a couple of examples.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para13"><a name="stpa_338">The first is from my constituency. St. Mawes is a large community but the combination of retirees and the holiday market means that it can scarcely maintain a two-classroom school. Numbers have been declining and the school may be lost altogether. Crantock is another example, which is familiar to my hon. Friend. Two stores have closed, the playgroup has folded, the 
<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
youth club is struggling, pubs have few out-of-season customers, and the village hall, churches and charity organisations are all reporting difficulties in maintaining themselves. In that area, 80 per cent. of homes are reported to be holiday homes or some sort of second homes.
</p>






<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60228h05_spnew5"><b> Julia Goldsworthy  (Falmouth and Camborne)</b>  (LD): I am sure that my hon. Friend is also aware that the regional spatial strategy that the regional assembly is proposing includes a huge increase in house build in the most urbanised areas of the county. That will exacerbate the problem even more. Villages need homes to help to maintain sustainability, but they are not being built in those places.
</p>






<p><a name="st_120"><a name="60228h05_spnew6"><b> Matthew Taylor </b> : I thank my hon. Friend. These shocking figures come from new research, although the Minister may have seen similar material from his civil servants. It has taken a great deal of work to put the material together because it is not readily available through the local authority due to the difficulties in determining what is actually going on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para14"><a name="stpa_339">I want the Minister to consider some serious solutions. First, it is evident from what I have said that we need a serious study of what is going on. Perhaps it could be piloted in Cornwall where there is evidence of the effect of the second-home discount. I welcome the change because the discount seems to have thrown people into various tax avoidance schemes with no proper measure of what is going on. We need some serious work on the impact, not only in Cornwall, but in national parks and similar areas, which seem to be suffering similar problems. Otherwise, funding and planning decisions, not least on house build, will be taken on the wrong basis and the Government will lose cash for local communities, which they should not do. Local councils which need that money to build affordable homes will also lose.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para15"><a name="stpa_340">The second issue is the need to tighten up the application process for small business rate relief. Under Government rules, it seems that all that people with second homes need to do to cut their tax is to say that those homes are available to rent for 140 days a year. They just have to tick a box on a form and do not have to provide any evidence that they have marketed the property, let alone that they have actually rented it out. In many cases, the community does not even benefit from more visitors because the property is occupied for only two or three weeks a year when the family take advantage of it. Yet they benefit from a cut in tax and the local council loses money that is currently being invested in building new affordable homes, which is what the extra money from second-home council tax is being used for.

</p>

<a name="60228h05_para16"><a name="stpa_341">The third issue is that it is important to ensure that the extra funds obtained from increased council tax charges continue to be ring-fenced and are not included in general council income. Councils have a discretionary power to raise the council tax from 90 per cent. and 50&nbsp;per cent. and to get rid of the discount. In Cornwall that money is predominantly being transferred to the districts to build new homes. For example, in 2004&#150;05 such money delivered real results on the ground with 20 houses in Penwith, 10 in Kerrier, 28 in Carrick, 35 in Restormel, 34 in North Cornwall and six in Caradon.

Many more are in the process of being built. Such results depend on the money being ring-fenced, and I hope that the Minister can offer some reassurance on that. They also depend on people paying, and if they continue to move their holiday homes to business rates that money will dry up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para17"><a name="stpa_342">When we have sorted out the tax avoidance issues, I believe that owners of second homes might pay more rather than less council tax than someone with a normal, full-time home. I shall not give a figure and I am not into penalising those people, but it is normal in the tax system&#151;for example, VAT&#151;to pay little or nothing for essentials but to pay the full rate for things that are less essential. For example, we do not pay VAT on food or children&#039;s clothes, but in the housing market people still pay less council tax for a second home than for the home they live in. That seems to be an oddity in the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para18"><a name="stpa_343">My most important call is for the Government to examine the planning system. The national parks have done so with new build&#151;not with total Government support&#151;by introducing restrictions on new build and insisting that it is used for full-time occupation. However, there are still two planning rules that the Minister must review.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para19"><a name="stpa_344">First, barn conversions in rural areas are not allowed for a full-time home, yet they are allowed for a holiday business. That does not make any sense at all and very much angers local communities. In many cases, farmers say that they want to make the conversion for a local person, and that they will charge an affordable rent, but they are not allowed to do so, perhaps because of misplaced sustainability concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para20"><a name="stpa_345">Secondly, it is most important that the Government reconsider giving local authorities planning control powers to stop full-time homes being converted to second homes in ever-increasing numbers. I know that it would be hard to police, but there are good tax reasons for policing such conversions. If they are not policed, there may be substantial capital gains tax avoidance. There is also the business rates issue and potential inheritance tax avoidance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para21"><a name="stpa_346">Policing the development of second homes is necessary anyway, but in communities where 60, 70 or 80 per cent. of homes are being turned into holiday homes and where the demand appears to be insatiable, it is vital that councils can say, &quot;Enough is enough.&quot; Frankly, if they do not, there will be no point in building new homes in Cornwall. From figures that I obtained today about houses built over the past five years, it appears that at least one of every two has, in effect, gone into the holiday and second home market. Therefore, we are not tackling the housing problem in Cornwall.

<p><a name="st_121"><a name="60228h05_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Yvette Cooper) </b> : I thank the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) for securing this debate and for using it to raise the important issue of housing availability and affordability in Cornwall. The Government take the matter of housing affordability seriously, and we recognise that problems of affordability must be addressed in all parts of the country. Sometimes, affordability is talked about as if it affects only London and the south-east, but, clearly, it does not. It affects different regions in different ways, according to the different circumstances that arise.

<p>
<a name="60228h05_para22"><a name="stpa_347">Average house prices in the south-west are over &#163;200,000 and are the fourth highest in the country. The average price figure that I have for Cornwall of &#163;202,396 is slightly different from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s figure, but similar.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para23"><a name="stpa_348">Housing is also a problem for first-time buyers. It can be difficult for many hard-working families and households to pay for starter homes, which can be expensive. There are more than 1 million more home owners than in 1997, largely as a result of lower mortgage rates, but the pressures on the housing market in general mean that first-time buyers in particular face pressures.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para24"><a name="stpa_349">In the south-west, the ratio of lower quartile house prices to lower quartile earnings is 8.46, compared with an average for England of 6.8. We know that there are particular pressures in Cornwall, that house price pressures can have not just a social but an economic impact, and that they can affect the sustainability of local communities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para25"><a name="stpa_350">It is important to put the problem in a national context. The south-west cannot be treated in isolation, although there are some specific issues around the nature of the local economy and the environment in that area. However, there is also a wider context: during the past 30 years, the number of households has increased by 30 per cent. but house building has fallen by more than 50 per cent. Nationally, each year, 190,000 new households are created, but only 150,000 new homes are built.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para26"><a name="stpa_351">The level of house building has increased, but it must increase further. Otherwise, in about 20 years&#039; time, only one third of 30-year-old couples will be able to afford to buy their own home. That is unacceptable, as it does not meet people&#039;s aspirations or housing need. That is why more market homes, more shared-equity homes and more social housing must be built. Further proposals to do that have been set out in the Barker review. They include changing the planning system and consulting on a planning gain supplement to raise additional resources for infrastructure, as well as increasing environmental standards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para27"><a name="stpa_352">The Government recognise that the challenges facing each region are different. There is high demand across London, the south-east and most of the east of England. Rising incomes are matched by even higher housing demand, which is not matched by housing supply. In the northern regions, areas of high demand are sometimes alongside areas of low demand, which creates different challenges.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para28"><a name="stpa_353">In the south-west, there is a problem of housing supply not keeping up with housing demand. It is clear that there is a need to build more homes to meet demand. However, the position is more complex because incomes are lower than in other parts of the country, there are higher retirement levels in certain parts of the south-west and, of course, there are the issues around second homes that the hon. Gentleman raised, which are acute in particular areas.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para29"><a name="stpa_354">The regional spatial strategy must take seriously all those different aspects and the need for more new homes in the south-west, but it must ensure that building is done in a sustainable way. That means matching 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>28 Feb 2006 : Column 75WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
strategies for new house building with strategies for economic regeneration and development&#151;jobs and housing must be considered together&#151;and the location of homes must be considered as well. There is an issue around the long-term sustainability of rural communities, given the additional pressures that they face.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60228h05_para30"><a name="stpa_355">The Government are increasing investment in affordable housing. Of the eight regions, the south-west has received the largest increase in its regional housing pot, up from &#163;137 million in 2005&#150;06 to &#163;203 million in 2007&#150;08. That is a significant increase. The south-west regional housing body proposes providing up to 9,500 more affordable homes in the next two years, up from the 6,000 homes that were provided in 2004. We shall announce the final details of the next programme shortly, but it includes significant increases for the west Cornwall market area. I know that Cornwall county council and the six district authorities are also considering new measures to address the problem.

<p>

We must recognise that the position is complex, as second home ownership can have a positive impact on the economy if it supports tourism, and the jobs and incomes that depend on it. The Government asked the Affordable Rural Housing Commission to consider in more detail the pressures that are created by second homes, and their impact on rural areas. The commission is also considering where new homes should be built and sustainability for small communities and villages, particularly if there are high levels of retirement in the area. We must ensure that communities have a long-term future and not simply an ageing population.
