 The purpose of the debate is to consider the two reports from the Joint Committee on Human Rights on policing and protest. Peaceful protest is one of the cornerstones of a democratic society and we are rightly proud that the UK has a fine tradition of upholding the right to protest. However, protest has been the cause of major controversy in recent years. The law on protest around Parliament has been wholly criticised, as have the use of the containment tactic known as kettling by the police and the tactics used against climate change protesters at the Drax and Kingsnorth power stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para2"><a name="10020467000008">The Committee decided to look at policing and protest in the light of those issues, before the events at the G20 protest. We set out to: identify the problems with peaceful protest in the UK raised by both protesters and the police; assess whether the legal framework for protest was working and, in particular, compliant with the European convention on human rights; and look at police tactics, guidance and training to see whether they fully reflected the UK's human rights obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para3"><a name="10020467000009">Although not an absolute right, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression is protected by articles 10 and 11 of the European convention. The Government must not prevent or restrict protest, except in limited circumstances, and are obliged to facilitate the right to protest. Any restrictions must be necessary, proportionate and prescribed by law-a high threshold. The presumption is in favour of the right to protest. In practice, we recognise that the police have to balance the competing rights of protesters and those protested against, together with the rights of others involved in a protest-journalists or bystanders, for example-and counter-protesters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para4"><a name="10020467000010">During our inquiry we heard from protesters, their representatives, the police and people who have been the subject of protest, such as the staff of Huntingdon Life Sciences and the Minister. Some protest targets complained of under-policing, arguing that there had been insufficient consideration of their rights. Balancing those competing interests is no easy task, and it is no surprise that the police cannot always get it right. Protests will always upset someone-that is the whole point of protesting.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000012">That view was echoed in the Home Office's most recent policing White Paper:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000013">I think that we all agree with that and congratulate the Home Office on that human rights approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000014">We published our first report in March 2009, but within days we saw the issues we had discussed and the need for our recommendations to be implemented brought vividly to the fore during the G20 protests in London. As a result of what happened, we reopened our inquiry in May 2009 and heard oral evidence from G20 protesters and observers, including the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), the chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, senior police officers and the then Home Office Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker). Our second report was published in July 2009. I am grateful for the constructive Government replies to both reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para9"><a name="10020467000015">Two other major reports were produced in 2009 on policing and protest by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. Those were commissioned in the light of the G20 protests by the then new Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson. HMIC's recommendations chime very much with the Committee's findings, which I had discussed with the chief inspector, Denis O'Connor, during his investigations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para10"><a name="10020467000016">We also discussed the findings of our reports, those of HMIC, the Government's response and the White Paper with HMIC, the police-the Metropolitan Police Service, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Association of Chief Police Officers-the Crown Prosecution Service and the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism, my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), at a mini-conference we hosted in Portcullis House last week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para11"><a name="10020467000017">In setting out the issues we identified on the policing of protest, I should begin by endorsing the police's assessment that the vast majority of protests in the UK pass off peacefully and without incident-there are 4,000 to 5,000 public order events a year in London alone. It is rare for the police to offer formal conditions under the Public Order Act 1986-we were told that that happened on 70 occasions across England and Wales in 2008-and large-scale protests that are difficult to police, such as those at the G20 or the Kingsnorth climate camp, are pretty infrequent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para12"><a name="10020467000018">Nevertheless, a number of witnesses complained that police powers were being used more intensively than in the past. There were well-substantiated complaints about the misuse of stop-and-search powers, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, to intimidate or harass protesters and collect personal data without explanation.</p>

 I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and sorry for missing the first minute of his speech. With regard to demonstrations, I get more complaints about the issue of photography than about anything else. Is there now a protocol with regard to whether the police should allow someone to take photographs? I know that the Home Office is to respond to that point, but it is an urgent matter. That is one of the real points of tension with protesters, as I am sure that he would agree.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="10020467000021"><a name="100204h0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="10020467000300"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>
 My hon. Friend certainly makes an important point. The question of photography comes up in all sorts of ways, and I will refer to some of those later in more detail. Issues include the photographing of protesters by the forward intelligence teams that the police use, attempts to prevent photography or to seize equipment, and efforts to photograph protesters as they leave demonstrations and to take their names and addresses, all of which are extremely questionable in law. My understanding is that new guidance is in train on all those issues, so we will have to wait to see what it says. My hon. Friend the Minister will, no doubt, fill us in on the details when she replies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para14"><a name="10020467000022">The use of other legislation intended for non-protest purposes was also raised during the Committee's inquiry. We were concerned to hear that the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which was brought in primarily to deal with stalkers, has been used to obtain injunctions to prevent protest activities that seemed to us to be perfectly legitimate. We heard of the injunction obtained by npower against Dr. Peter Harbour over the Radley lakes issue, where npower wanted to use the lakes to dump ash from power stations, not surprisingly attracting community disapproval. He could not afford to challenge the injunction taken out against him and the protesters. An injunction was also taken out against a photo-journalist for merely taking pictures of what was going on in that case. That was successfully challenged in court, and presumably the case was financed by the journalist's publication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para15"><a name="10020467000023">Injunctions are granted in private, ex parte-a process intended for urgency, and after the event it is often too costly to challenge. If the issue relates to peaceful protest, it is unlikely to be so urgent, so at the least the application should be on notice to the protester. That is what we require for injunctions in industrial disputes, and the same process should apply to protests. I urge the Minister to look again at the civil procedure rules to see if that could be achieved to gain a fair balance and prevent the misuse of that power.</p>

 I am pleased to hear the Chairman of the Committee on which I serve set out the provisions so clearly.

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is a valuable member of my Committee. He raises a serious issue. I was disappointed by the Government's subsequent response when we reiterated our recommendations on that. I do not think that they have got to grips with how serious an impediment to protest the use of civil injunctions is. I had much experience of such injunctions for industrial disputes when I was in practice, and it is difficult to see why the process available for industrial disputes, which is a special process for injunctions that requires that they are obtained on notice to the trade unions concerned, could not also be applied when dealing with a question of protest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para16"><a name="10020467000026">The Government response states that it is difficult to identify who is a protester and who is not because that is not actually defined in law, but I think that the courts are able to draw a clear distinction between what is and is not a protest. Moreover, it is in the court's discretion to refuse an injunction applied for ex parte inappropriately. As in this case, it is hard to see in what circumstances there would be any great urgency about an injunction being granted.</p>

 I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on introducing this important debate. I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, but I cannot see why the Government are against simply introducing into the rules a reference to when article 11 rights are engaged. The courts would understand that, and it would meet the point directly.</p>

 I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who makes an important point. I suppose that the Government will say that the courts are required by the Human Rights Act 1998 to act compatibly with convention rights anyway, but there is nothing wrong with drawing attention specifically to articles 10 and 11 rights, if it comes to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para17"><a name="10020467000029">Poor or non-existent communication between the police and protesters was a theme that the Committee picked up throughout its inquiry. We were struck by the total lack of trust between the police and the climate camp protesters in advance of the G20 protests. The protesters said that they had tried to communicate with the police but were not taken seriously until the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) intervened to broker a meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para18"><a name="10020467000030">The police complained that the protesters refused to specify where their protest would take place. It is perhaps no surprise, in such circumstances, that the police prepared for the worst and were then accused of overreacting-sometimes with justification-to what was a largely peaceful protest. There were incidents of vandalism and violence, but the vast majority of protesters were not engaged in such activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para19"><a name="10020467000031">The Committee recommends that police forces should nominate a point of contact for protesters, to facilitate communication. Some forces have done that for specific  <br>

protests. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed whether she agrees that all forces should adopt that approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para20"><a name="10020467000032">The Government response mentions the use of new technologies to communicate with protesters during protests. However, I understand from our discussions last week that attempts have been made to undermine the use of Bluetooth technology with bogus messages impersonating the police. We must try to find a way to use technology effectively to communicate with protesters, while at the same time making it clear that the messages must be kept secure. The technique is a good one, which should be disseminated among police services, but it obviously needs to be secure so that police officers are not impersonated over the airwaves.</p>

 There is a need for common sense, as my hon. Friend knows from his deep involvement in the matter. One of my constituents was accused of aggravated litter picking-I am not sure whether we yet have such an offence, but that was the level to which things descended, and it did no one any good. It did not do the police any good, because it led to more potential, if not real, violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para21"><a name="10020467000035">The Committee also recommended that if there is a lack of trust between the police and protesters, there might be a role for independent mediators to facilitate communication. HMIC disagreed, arguing that that could reduce the incentive for police to communicate with protesters and other parties affected by protests, but I am not convinced of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para22"><a name="10020467000036">Everyone agrees with the underpinning starting point and goal of no surprises-for the police, the protesters and the targets of the protest. But how can that be achieved if the police and protesters lack sufficient mutual trust to communicate effectively, or even at all? In Northern Ireland, where I understand the concept of no surprises first originated, a long, painstaking, but ultimately successful process to build trust and develop the no-surprises approach began with the use of intermediaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para23"><a name="10020467000037">There is also a lack of a process for dealing with genuine disagreements-about timing or route, for example. The option of going to court to challenge a police decision is a non-option; it is impractical, due to legal costs and too long a timescale. A mediator from, say, HMIC could help to resolve such problems. I urge the Minister to take another look at that recommendation. We have heard about the Spanish system, which is an effective and quick way of resolving such disputes.</p>

powerful, intimidates peaceful protesters, and, in itself, can lead to violence that might not otherwise occur. We all saw the images from the G20 of protesters, hands in the air, chanting, "This is not a riot," confronted by phalanxes of officers in full riot gear who adopted an aggressive stance-indeed, some hit protesters with the edges of their shields. None of that does anything for the image of our police service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para26"><a name="10020467000040">Obviously, we do not wish to see officers or protesters hurt, but the current methods may perversely lead to that outcome, as violence might be provoked rather than dampened down. There is a lot to be learned from Northern Ireland, where senior officers led by example in policing at the front in ordinary uniform. They proved that it could be done by taking a well-considered risk in trying to avoid confrontation. I particularly commend Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, whom we found very impressive.</p>

 If I read the hon. Gentleman correctly, he is suggesting that on the mainland, not in Northern Ireland, all riot situations should be policed by uniformed officers without riot gear. Is that correct?</p>

 No, that is not what I am saying. My position on that will become clear later in my speech. In short, the real problem at present is that there is no gradation; we either have police officers in ordinary uniform or police officers in full riot gear. There is no gradual change up or down in the policing of demonstrations. We have complete escalation and very little de-escalation. I shall describe all that in a little more detail later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para27"><a name="10020467000043">I was commending Assistant Chief Constable McCausland of the PSNI, who very much embraces the approach I am describing and demonstrated it himself to his own officers. He wrote:</p>

All these issues are consistent with the concerns expressed by the HMIC about the need to reinforce the traditional British model of policing by consent, rather than drifting towards what it described as a paramilitary model that is more familiar overseas. I entirely share its view that an approachable, impartial and accountable style of policing by consent that is based on minimum force is preferable, and is more consistent with the human rights of those involved in protests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="100204h0001.htm_para29"><a name="10020467000045">Part of the problem is escalation. We see police in ordinary uniform or full riot gear-there is nothing in between to give tactical options for either a gradual increase in firmer policing, or, more importantly, for de-escalating from confrontation. HMIC called on the Home Office to "actively support" the traditional policing model based on the minimum use of force. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that the Home Office fully shares HMIC's view.</p>

property. This is a grey area. For example, how can we ensure respect for the rights of animal welfare activists who wish to protest outside a shop selling furs in a large, now private-formerly public-shopping area, or for the right of peaceful assembly by protesters who wish to use a council park? I saw that myself last year when a protest march against Conservative Barnet council's plan to axe sheltered accommodation wardens had to rally outside the council-owned park's gates because we were not allowed to go inside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para2"><a name="10020467000048">On policing proper, the police starting point seems to have been that any protest is almost certainly unlawful, to some degree. At the minimum, it will usually cause obstruction of the highway, for example. The problem is that the police, in some cases, assume that this unlawfulness should be prevented, per se, without balancing that unlawfulness with the corresponding rights to freedom of assembly and expression guaranteed by articles 10 and 11, as I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para3"><a name="10020467000049">Police officers are trained to use their discretion when conducting ordinary police work-whether to arrest someone or just give them a telling off, for example-but that does not seem to apply in matters relating to demonstrations. The basic discretion of the police officer needs to be used better in policing protest. A good example of this was the Tamil protest last year. There was a lot of obstruction, but little trouble. That indication of a change of approach was welcome. Of course, that protest created great inconvenience, including to people in the House, but in the end it was dealt with fairly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para4"><a name="10020467000050">On the general legal policing framework, our main concern is that there are too many broadly-defined powers available to the police that can be used to restrict protest unfairly and unnecessarily. In scrutinising legislation, we have often been critical of the Government for relying on the argument that broad powers are consistent with the Human Rights Act because all public authorities must act compatibly with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para5"><a name="10020467000051">I will argue later that police training in human rights has clearly been inadequate. In addition, the Government's approach puts the onus on those whose rights have been infringed to pursue matters in the courts. This is the wrong way round; legislation should be drafted in precise terms to make the parameters of police powers clear, both to the police and the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000054">Human rights training should be part of the ordinary training, instruction and education of anybody in public services. It should be a theme running through existing training and education, and should not be taught separately. If it is to have an impact it has to be in the right context. The context is where a particular issue arises. So when we talk about public order training, about which I will say a little more later, we should stress that human rights should not be taught separately from that, but should be part of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000055">I should like to mention the abuse of counter-terrorism powers, which is of particular concern to our Committee. During our inquiry, the use of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 was already subject to review because of widespread concerns that the power was being overused. Although there might be circumstances in which a protest could conceivably be used to mask a terrorist attack or be a target of terrorism, we received no evidence at all to suggest that that had happened or was even likely. In our view, counter-terrorism powers should not be used against peaceful protesters. That view was also expressed on a number of occasions by successive Ministers and senior police officers when appearing before the Committee. Nevertheless, section 44 was still being misused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000056">Last month, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the Gillan case that the section 44 power was incompatible with the European convention. In that case, a protester and a journalist were stopped and searched outside an arms fair at the ExCeL centre. Neither could reasonably have been considered terrorists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para9"><a name="10020467000057">The Walter Wolfgang case is another example.

The offence is meant to relate to people committing or preparing an act of terrorism, but we have all heard examples of journalists and others being prevented from taking photographs of police officers or buildings and asked to hand over equipment, even though the current guidance makes clear that section 76 is</p>

I find it hard to visualise a protester who has misbehaved successfully running away from the police, perhaps squirting water at a police officer from a fake flower buttonhole, wearing oversized giant clown shoes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para16"><a name="10020467000064">A similar abuse of power is the taking and retention of photographs. Last year, the Court of Appeal ruled that that was contrary to the Human Rights Act if the person photographed is not suspected of committing an offence. HMIC also raised concerns about the role of forward intelligence teams, which are increasingly used to photograph protesters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para17"><a name="10020467000065">All the cases that I have mentioned provide evidence that police forces are cavalier in their use of these broadly defined powers, with disregard of individuals' human rights as a consequence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para18"><a name="10020467000066">One of the most important legislative defects that we identified concerns the policing of protest around Parliament, a subject with which all hon. Members are familiar. When the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 was passed, it was intended to give teeth to the sessional resolutions passed in both Houses about maintaining access to the parliamentary estate at all times and to provide the police with the power to remove Brian Haw from Parliament Square. It has manifestly failed on both counts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para19"><a name="10020467000067">Nevertheless, the 2005 Act succeeded in criminalising far too many peaceful protesters who refused to give advance notification of their protests to the police. That was counterproductive and disproportionate. It is not possible to force people to talk to the police and some who may otherwise have done so now refuse to do so under compulsion, on principle. This bad law led to confrontation and the criminalisation of peaceful protests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para20"><a name="10020467000068">The most notorious such case was that of Maya Evans and Milan Rai, who were prosecuted for reading aloud at the Cenotaph the names of British soldiers and Iraqi civilians killed during the conflict in Iraq. Moreover, the law was not applied consistently. The police had discretion if certain things were, in their view, a publicity stunt. For example, a gang of Tories dressed as Father Christmases with Gordon Brown masks was allowed to picket without notice at Downing street without being arrested. I suggest that the police got things the wrong way round. What those Tories did sounds far more like a demonstration to me than the reading out of the names, which sounds more like a publicity stunt to draw attention to the 2005 Act and its shortcomings.</p>

We were pleased that the Government accepted this recommendation and introduced amendments to the 1986 Act in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill. We made some detailed comments on the Government's proposals in our report on the Bill and I tabled amendments on behalf of the Joint Committee to be debated during the Public Bill Committee. The Government also tabled amendments which specified the entrances to Parliament to which the police must maintain access and increased the area in which the new regime is planned to operate.</p>

The Minister knows that this matter was dealt with in the Wright Committee report. The solution to this matter-it is within the scope of the issues that we are discussing-is to accept and support the recommendations of that Committee.

When we talk about important provisions covering protests around Parliament, which go to the core of our democracy, it is not fair or appropriate to have no debate on the Floor of the House, or in Committee. That can be rectified on Report, and I hope that it will be. We spent a whole day in Committee arguing about ratification of treaties, which is an important matter, and the net result was that we had no time to deal with this matter, yet the debate went short the following day. It was bizarre that we could not debate it then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para22"><a name="10020467000078">On police tactics and training, it is now generally accepted that public order training and guidance does not adequately take account of the human rights issues associated with policing. We were pleased to hear that ACPO guidance is being redrafted, that the Home Office is producing a code of practice and that there is to be specific training not just for officers in riot control, but-of equal, if not greater, importance-for police commanders at all levels. Command training is essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para23"><a name="10020467000079">I agree with the general plea from the police that the guidance must be a workable, easy-to-use document with clear principles, not a telephone directory or a manual prescribing precisely for every conceivable circumstance. The police need discretion, but that discretion needs clear and user-friendly guidance if it is to work. The Home Office has talked of publishing guidance for consultation in the spring; perhaps the Minister will tell us how the election will affect that timetable, and assure us that time will be found for parliamentary engagement on this important issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para24"><a name="10020467000080">On particular aspects of police practice, we yet again saw evidence during the G20 protests of some police officers not displaying their identification numbers, and refusing to identify themselves when asked. Identifying police officers is essential to ensure that they are accountable for their actions. We recommended that displaying identification numbers or providing identification on request should be a legal requirement for police officers. The Government's response was to agree with our view on the importance of police identification, but to maintain the current position-that identification is a disciplinary rather than a legal matter. We remain unpersuaded. Making identification a legal requirement would send a strong signal to officers about the importance of this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para25"><a name="10020467000081">The Home Office suggested that failure to provide identification was a rare problem, and that may be so, but when it occurs, or is reported, it is in the most controversial and extreme circumstances, such as the fatal incident at G20 or the Countryside Alliance protest outside Parliament, going right back to the death of Blair Peach. Will the Minister provide us with some figures on the frequency of complaints and consequent disciplinary action on this issue, and update us on the long-awaited and now promised publication of the Cass report on the death of Blair Peach?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para28"><a name="10020467000084">Finally, the containment tactic, kettling, has been the subject of much debate. We concluded, and were criticised for this, that it could be a useful tactic, but only if used proportionately, when absolutely necessary, and in accordance with human rights principles; for example, to stop violent protesters from dispersing through a city. So far, however, the tactic has been deployed without regard to the rights of contained individuals, who have included not just peaceful protesters, but bystanders, such as Ian Tomlinson, with fatal results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para29"><a name="10020467000085">At G20, we heard of a diabetic who was not released when he needed insulin.

We heard of the crowd being charged and pushed back by police, but with nowhere to go back to. The root of the problem seems to be that the police see the crowd as an amorphous mass of trouble, rather than as a gathering of individuals, each with his or her own separate human rights, and for whom different considerations may apply from person to person.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="100204h0002.htm_para30"><a name="10020467000086">We share the views of the HMIC that police commanders must be trained to use containment flexibly as a crowd control tactic; there must be a strategy for releasing people who do not pose a threat of violence; and facilities such as water, toilets and medical assistance must be provided to those contained for several hours.

we allow people to make comments, for example, about gay people, if they are Christians, without the police coming up to them and questioning them, we must dilute the way in which the law operates at the moment? It is disappointing that the Government's response did not properly engage with the real problem or give good reasons for not proceeding along the lines that we have always suggested.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman is a profound defender of the right of free speech, and he has made his point. The Government made some arguments in their response-for example, on people with disabilities-but having someone arrested for calling a police horse "gay" is ludicrous. Perhaps the police need better guidance, at the very least, on the use of law. The issue will continue to be debated, and needs to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para0"><a name="10020467000092">The police have a difficult job in handling major public order incidents, often involving quick decisions aimed at protecting lives and property. By and large, they do an excellent job in balancing the competing rights of protesters, those protested against, journalists, bystanders and others, although as the G20 protests demonstrated individual protests can raise significant concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para1"><a name="10020467000093">We have aimed to assist the police by ensuring that they police protests in accordance with human rights. We are confident that the Government and the police now share our objective, based on a return to the British model of policing, including the minimum use of force. I believe that the police have already taken on board some of the lessons, based on the different approach to the climate camp last summer at Blackheath. We believe that the main issue is that the guidance and training available to police forces, commanders and officers have not taken sufficient account of human rights. Inconsistency between forces, some of which are ill-equipped to deal with major public order issues because of their small size, is also an issue. I hope that our successor Committee in the new Parliament will scrutinise action by the Government and ACPO to ensure that these problems are overcome.</p>

Politicians should not influence operational decisions by police officers, but we were struck by the fact that clearly expressed ministerial views on how legislation, such as counter-terrorism powers, should be implemented did not appear to be influencing police action on the ground. A bigger role is being given to ACPO to ensure that police forces follow national guidance. We need to look closely at ACPO's developing role as a national policing agency and accountability mechanism, in what can be a specialist area of policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para4"><a name="10020467000097">It was entirely clear from my visits to the Heathrow climate camp, and subsequently from reports of what happened at Kingsnorth, that the police had immensely abused powers such as that to stop and search and that their intention was to disrupt the protests, rather than to maintain public order. There were also some rather extraordinary claims at Kingsnorth, with the police claiming through Ministers that injuries had been caused-the implication being that the protest had been violent and that the protesters had caused the injuries. It turned out that the injuries were health and safety problems and that police officers had injured themselves getting in and out of their cars, had suffered from toothache  or, in one notorious incident, had been stung by a possible wasp.</p>

 Yes, I have always wondered what an impossible wasp would be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para5"><a name="10020467000100">Although the situation has now moved on, things did not improve to begin with. The hon. Member for Hendon said that I was involved in trying to bring the protesters and the police together for a meeting the day before the Bishopsgate climate camp. The climate camp was  entirely peaceful, and the disorder broke out at a different demonstration, near the Bank of England. The demonstration at Bishopsgate remained entirely peaceful for a long time, and there was no serious police intervention until 7 o'clock, when the police suddenly surrounded the demonstration and pushed the demonstrators back. Eventually, after about 11 o'clock, the police threw themselves into an operation that basically involved violently breaking up the demonstration, even though people had shown no violent intent all day. In fact, for most of the day, the demonstration had looked like a festival, with songs, dancing, seminars and  food stalls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000101">What most disturbed me was my phone conversation with a senior Metropolitan police commander at 11 o'clock. I asked, "What are you doing? Why are you following this tactic?" and he replied that section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 had been invoked, on the grounds not that there was violent disorder or serious damage to property, but solely because there had been serious disruption to the life of the community. The question then is what that disruption was. Why did the disruption suddenly start in the evening? What is more, we are talking about the City of London, where, as everyone knows, nothing much happens after business closes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000102">As the hon. Member for Hendon said, the police attitude seemed to be that any demonstration on the street was technically illegal and technically disruptive because it was technically obstructing the highway. That, apparently, justified any action, no matter how disproportionate, to break up the demonstration. It was entirely over the top; it was not just unnecessary, but dangerous. The lives and limbs of the demonstrators, and indeed some police officers, were put at risk simply to clear the streets, as if that was a justification. However, we have moved on.</p>

 Can I just finish the point? I do not want to break off without saying what the improvements have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000105">First, we have had the report from Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, which clearly moves in the direction of saying that the right to peaceful protest-not technically lawful protest-should lie at the heart of the police approach. That is an enormous and important advance on the part of the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para9"><a name="10020467000106">Secondly, we had the Tamils' demonstration, which was policed in an entirely different way.

Member for Hendon if he did mention it. The attitude of the police there was very different, and communication between them and the protesters was much better. Although there were still points of tension, what happened at Blackheath was a vast improvement over what had happened at Bishopsgate and Kingsnorth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para11"><a name="10020467000108">I shall give way to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds if he still wishes to intervene.</p>

 On the Committee's report, there are still points at issue between the Government and the Committee. The hon. Member for Hendon was right to start and end with the communication and dialogue between the police and the protesters. I am not sure about the police, but the Government have not quite grasped the importance of communication in defusing situations and in reminding both sides why they are there. The protesters want to protest, and the police want to ensure that the protest does not become disorderly or violent. If the two sides stay in communication, they will remember that, rather than getting into a conflict about the process, about who said what and about the policing itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para12"><a name="10020467000111">I return to the meeting that I organised between the police and the climate camp protesters on 31 March last year. The police seemed unwilling to engage directly with the protesters, while the protesters were reticent about telling the police their plans. The Committee rightly picked up on the unwillingness on both sides to communicate, but it has not quite picked up on the reason why the protesters were unwilling to communicate their plans to the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para13"><a name="10020467000112">That unwillingness came from the protesters' previous experience, particularly at the Heathrow climate camp, where they believed that the police had tried to disrupt the protest once they became aware of the protesters' plans. For example, the protesters believed that the police attempted to persuade landowners in the area not to allow protests on their land, even though the protesters were trying to go about their business of protesting in a lawful way by asking for permission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para14"><a name="10020467000113">That is the key point. The lack of trust that built up over the years between the protesters and the police caused the protesters' reticence about talking to the  <br>

police. That reticence is still there because of that lack of trust. The situation is very brittle and fragile. Given where we are, it would be easy for the progress that we have made to be undermined by a further breakdown in trust as a result of other incidents. Examples include the pre-emptive action by the police at Ratcliffe power station and the use of pre-charge bail conditions against both protesters there and protesters who came into this building. That appeared to be an attempt to make it unlawful for protesters to organise protests or to communicate with one another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para15"><a name="10020467000114">Documents in which ACPO issues guidance and includes environmental protesters in a list of terrorists have also come into the public domain. Such instances tend to undermine the degree of trust that is slowly being built up between peaceful protesters and the authorities. I urge the Government to bear that in mind in dealing with policy. If communication starts to break down again, the whole thing will go into reverse, regardless of what the reports say. Reports are one thing; practice on the ground is another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para16"><a name="10020467000115">I should mention in passing that I agree with the Committee on the need to review the status of ACPO. One of the themes of my life last year was coming up against ACPO over and over again, as if it were not just a regulator of the police and a kind of alternative inspectorate, but a kind of legislator. ACPO policy seems to have the same force within the police as secondary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para17"><a name="10020467000116">We need to get a grip on ACPO and its various subsidiary agencies, which deal with domestic extremism. At the very least, we need to subject it to the Freedom of Information Act and treat it as a public authority, to go back to another of the themes of the hon. Member for Hendon. Ultimately, we should say that if it is to be a sort of national policing body, it needs a national-level accountability mechanism.</p>

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="10020467000117"><a name="100204h0003.htm_spnew9"><a name="10020467000330"><b>Dr. Harris:</b>
 I think that it is true that ACPO has never responded to the Government by saying, "No, we don't need this law," and I do not think that the Government have ever said they disagreed with ACPO about whether a law was needed. That is part of the problem. ACPO is a natural lobby, and it should be treated as merely a lobby; it lobbies Governments for the police to have as many powers as possible, and Governments seem very willing to give them those powers.</p>

 Obviously, we must listen to the police when they talk about what powers they feel they need, but we must go back to what the hon. Member for Hendon said, which I think my hon. Friend agrees with, about the key point being that the powers should be narrowly drawn. They should not be over-broad, and should be specific to the need. We should not rely on the rather odd argument that the police can be given sweeping powers-but that it would be unlawful for them to use them contrary to the Human Rights Act 1998, and therefore it does not really matter that they are sweeping.</p>

 I am sure that what we do not need is a system of directly elected sheriffs, which would mean that we were in great danger of breaking up something very important in our constitutional policing structure-the fact that operational decisions about who should or should not be arrested remain with police offers and are never influenced directly by politicians. The issue that I am raising at the moment is about what happens to the anomalous national bodies that do not fit, and never will fit, into the existing structure. We need something specific to deal with them.</p>

 I agree with the hon. Gentleman, who is developing a theme from my report. It is bizarre that ACPO should be a limited liability company; presumably, it is required to file accounts at Companies House as an annual report but not to give an annual report to Parliament. Perhaps there should be a statutory body that would report annually to Parliament about its activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para18"><a name="10020467000122">Personally, I have a lot of confidence in ACPO's new head, Sir Hugh Orde, whom I met when he was the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

One of the areas of most concern is a police tactic that I think can legitimately be called kettling. It happens when containment is pushed in on the demonstrators. The demonstration is contained in a smaller and smaller area; that raises the pressure and the temperature, and it is kettling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para20"><a name="10020467000125">Throughout the debates on the issue-and the hon. Member for Hendon may be right about there being exceptional circumstances in which containment is necessary to prevent further harm-that aspect of the tactic has never been properly explained. I have seen it, and have seen film of it, and it seems inexplicable to me. It always leads to more trouble and raises the temperature. It always increases the risks for all concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para21"><a name="10020467000126">As for media reporting, the Committee came to the conclusion that although accounts of the run-up to the G20, for example, included a good deal of ramping up of the expectation of violence, that was largely down to the activities of the media and not the police. However, the problem was that the police did not take the opportunity to reduce the temperature. It was being raised by the media, but what was the police response? I have still not seen a satisfactory answer from the Government, or from the police via the Government, to the Committee's point about that. It seemed very specific to me: the media strategy of the police should be aimed at calming everything down, and taking active steps to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para22"><a name="10020467000127">Will the Minister confirm that the Government's position, which seems to be the same as the police position, is that current regulations on police numerals are sufficient, because under those regulations it is already a disciplinary matter not to wear them?

duty at demonstrations. Behind the issue is culture, and its somehow being acceptable for police officers on duty at demonstrations to be what someone called a designated hitter, with the job of applying violent methods so that they are hidden and unattributable. I think that that lies behind the numerals issue, and we need to address it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para23"><a name="10020467000128">The Committee rightly raised the question of protests around Parliament, and further legislative action is being taken in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill-to which we shall return on Report, so I do not want to say much about the matter now. The Committee was rightly concerned; not only had the previous powers been removed, but new ones, which were vague, unclear and possibly very broad, had been introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para24"><a name="10020467000129">I would go further than the Committee. First, there is an argument that all the powers already exist to ensure that there is access to Parliament. Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986 and all the legislation about demonstrations already give the police sufficient power to do what we want them to. Even if that is not the case, the only gap is specifically about what the police can do when access has been blocked. However, the new version that has been passed in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which we should revisit, seems to keep the regulation in place in advance of any trouble. That is still prior restraint of demonstrations and assemblies. I fail to see the justification for having extra prior restraint around Parliament, as opposed to extra powers to clear the way and ensure that Members of Parliament can get into the building.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="100204h0003.htm_para25"><a name="10020467000131">The most disturbing aspect of all incidents such as the climate change camp and other demonstrations, and the confrontation between the police and demonstrators, has been the excessive use of counter-terrorism powers against those demonstrators. I do not deny that there has been progress, but I was disturbed to hear what the hon. Member for Hendon said about the Government's response to the Gillan case. This is about the abuse of stop-and-search powers. More than that, it is about whether it is legitimate at all to have stop-and-search powers that can be exercised without any reason or underlying evidence, but merely on a hunch. The Court was absolutely clear on that. Its conclusion was that section 44 is not an adequate law because it does not give people sufficient advance knowledge or warning about what the powers of the police are, and when they will be used. It gives the police a vast opportunity to act arbitrarily.</p>

 One would hope not. The point is that the Court struck down section 44 on its face- not as it was applied, not given the circumstances of  the case and how it was operated, but on its face.  That seems to be a very clear judgment, and I would  be fascinated-perhaps horrified-to learn of the Government's reasons for appealing against that judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para0"><a name="10020467000136">I will finish with a couple of other matters. The hon. Member for Hendon was right to draw attention to the potential for the use of civil injunctions in preventing protest. It appears that around the time of the Kingsnorth protest the Kent police encouraged the power companies concerned to use civil injunctions as a way of preventing that protest from going ahead or being effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para1"><a name="10020467000137">The Government's response seems to be entirely inadequate. As the hon. Gentleman says, special procedures are already in place for certain sorts of circumstances where injunctions are applied for without notice, or only on one side. It would be entirely practical to extend that procedure as the most minimal of safeguards against prior restraint of demonstrations and free speech, to any circumstance in which article 10 or article 11 rights are engaged. This is not about disagreeing with the Government-I simply cannot understand their objections to doing that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para2"><a name="10020467000138">My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) mentioned section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. I agree with him. The present offence under section 5 is one of negligence. One could be found guilty of a crime for insulting someone in circumstances where it is likely that someone would be distressed. There are various defences, but that is basically the offence. My hon. Friend, and the Committee, do not suggest that the rather more serious offence in section 4A of intentionally causing that distress should be changed, but section 5 seems to be an example of an overly broad criminal offence that should be reviewed. As my hon. Friend says, one important aspect is the fundamental idea about whether we have a right not to be offended. I do not think that we have such a right. People take offence at all sorts of things, often in political arguments. If free speech is about anything, it is about the right to make political points that other people find offensive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para3"><a name="10020467000139">Finally, I want to refer to what the report says about the forward intelligence teams that the police use at demonstrations, especially when they photograph demonstrators. I have been photographed on demonstrations several times. One demonstration was on the middle east, and the other was about student fees in Cambridge. That was such a quiet and civilised demonstration that it did not even leave the pavement. People walked quietly from the Guildhall in Cambridge to one of the open spaces where, on the other side of the road, police officers with long lenses were photographing us all as if we were some kind of public menace. Perhaps we were a public menace, but we were not doing anything at the time to suggest that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para4"><a name="10020467000140">When challenged, the police said, "Well, it was possible that you might be committing a criminal offence". We could not work out what the criminal offence was, but all of us on that demonstration were immediately suspects, simply because we disagreed with a Government policy. That is the basis of the Wood case and it is why that case went against the Government. That sort of activity is designed to intimidate and to undermine people's  <br>

desire to protest. If we cannot sort out that issue and the underlying attitude of the authorities that assumes that there is something wrong with people just because they are protesters, we will never be in a position to say that we fully accept and respect the right to protest.</p>

 We have already had a forensically interesting debate and I will start my remarks by highlighting, unambiguously, the excellent work that police officers perform week in, week out, month in, month out, policing protests and events of all kinds. Even at the G20 protests, where the news was dominated by some tragic incidents, we should remember that more than 35,000 protesters demonstrated in London, requiring 10,000 police officer shifts. Despite the scale of the disruption, businesses in the City reported minor damage and non-protesters were certainly able to go about their lives with little or no major disruption of any kind. However, the Opposition believe that it is right that when serious public order incidents occur, a thorough investigation should and must be conducted by the Home Office, or in particular by the Independent Police Complaints Commission or Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. If appropriate, action should be taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para5"><a name="10020467000142">Following the G20 protests and other high-profile events referred to, such as the protests at Kingsnorth power station, there has been considerable scrutiny of how we go about policing events. Last June, the Select Committee on Home Affairs published its report, "Policing of the G20 Protests". The Government published their interim response to that report on 24 October and their final response on 15 December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000143">HMIC conducted its own investigation on the way in which protests are policed. Its interesting report, "Adapting to Protest-Nurturing the British Model of Policing", was published on 24 November. HMIC's review of the policing of protests found that there were an inadequate number of trained public order commanders. Its report found that 16 to 22 per cent. of forces feel unable  to provide a minimal ACPO or National Policing Improvement Agency-accredited command structure for policing events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000144">My understanding is that a normal command structure on average would consist of two advanced public order commanders-gold or silver commanders-and two initial commanders, known as bronze commanders. The report found that there were less than adequately trained public order commanders in charge of operations in major forces, including the Greater Manchester police and the West Midlands police. Can the Minister confirm what her view is on that evidence and what action her Department has undertaken to remedy that alleged shortfall?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000145">In respect of rank-and-file officers, HMIC found that 22,500 officers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are trained to level 2 out of the three tiers of public order operational effectiveness. Level 2 is the standard level in the use of public order skills, tactics and equipment. The proportion of officers in forces trained to level 2 across England and Wales is, on average, just over  15 per cent., but the figures vary across force areas, from 8.7 per cent. in the South Wales police to 39 per cent. in Northumbria. Obviously, part of that difference  <br>

reflects the challenges that the different forces face geographically. Some areas, and particularly metropolitan forces, will have more large-scale events and will as a consequence train more officers to deal with them. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the Home Office has assessed or will assess the number of officers in each force trained to level 2 for public order policing. If she and her Department are not doing that, what information does she have on it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para9"><a name="10020467000146">HMIC acknowledged the very significant cost of public order training.

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para11"><a name="10020467000148">One of HMIC's recommendations is for the service to adopt a set of fundamental principles on police officers' use of force that runs through all aspects of policing. Will the Minister elucidate on what she understands is the core set of fundamental principles on police officers' use of force?

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para14"><a name="10020467000151">Clearly, it is of the utmost importance that the work is completed as expeditiously as possible to ensure that the changes in guidance and their implementation are embedded. There a simple reason for that: whoever is in government, we have the Olympics coming up in 2012, which will undoubtedly provide a severe, stern and serious test of policing capability in respect of public order offences. It is essential that our officers have had time to take on board any changes that have been suggested, quite properly, in the past 12 months, so that those changes can bed in and so that everyone-public and police, as well as Government-understands exactly what the score is. We also need the necessary resources to ensure that the adequate level of training is achieved. I shall be charitable to the Minister today-we all understand the tight constraints on any public service budget, and the Home Office budget is what it is-but, on training, we need to get more bang for our buck, whoever the Minister happens to be at the time. Clearly, that is not a matter for a Minister in an office in Whitehall to direct for 40-odd forces, but we do need a slightly better understanding than we have at the moment of what the guidance is and who is driving it through and ensuring delivery, with the main thing in mind being the 2012 Olympics.</p>

provisions should be there; they do not need to be repealed. Section 43 allows the search of a person whom an officer reasonably suspects to be a terrorist. Section 44 authorises an officer to carry out the search. Section 45 confers on an officer the power to search, whether or not they have grounds for suspecting that a person has articles that could be used in connection with terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para16"><a name="10020467000154">In 2008-09, there were 256,026 stops and searches under section 44. That was a 36 per cent. increase on 2008. A further 1,643 stops and searches were carried out by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2008-09 under the powers in section 43. The report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights stated:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para17"><a name="10020467000155">Would the Minister like to add to that proposition, which has already been raised by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and which I am raising again now? Court's finding at least a little disturbing? Of the tens-nearly hundreds-of thousands of searches made under section 44, in no case had anyone been arrested for a terrorist offence. Does that not show that the powers are being used not for that purpose but for a whole range of other purposes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para19"><a name="10020467000158">Mr. Dismore: There is no argument about section 43, which allows for stop and search on grounds of reasonable suspicion; it is fine. The problem with section 44 is that no reason is needed for such searches. I recently discussed the matter with the borough commander in my area, and I discovered that half a dozen sites in my constituency are classified as section 44 sites. I find it remarkable that they should be considered terrorist targets, never mind that they should be subject to section 44 search powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para20"><a name="10020467000159">The real problem is the overly broad nature of section 44. Nobody objects to section 43 powers being used if there are grounds for suspecting someone of engaging in terrorist activity. It is not a problem. The difficulty is that, with a quarter of a million people-I think that that was the figure-being stopped under section 44 as opposed to being stopped under section 1 or section 60, when people can be stopped with cause, the powers of section 44 have been misused but without detecting a single terrorist.</p>

It is incumbent on the Minister to say whether that is an appropriate description. We wait to hear from her. The argument is certainly being kicked around the block. I make no judgment on that, but I am sure that the Minister will have a pretty much definitive view on what action, if any, she thinks might need to be taken.</p>

On  30 June 2009, the Minister for Crime, Policing and Counter Terrorism wrote to the Joint Committee on Human Rights to inform it of the implication of the Wood judgment. He said that all police forces needed to review their policies and procedures. What role is the Home Office taking in providing further guidance on that point?

At the end of the day, although brickbats and abuse are thrown at the police if they breach the law-if individual officers overstep the mark-we have to set that in context. The vast majority of police officers who engage in public order policing behave impeccably and with courtesy and fair-mindedness, and they apply the law to the letter. We should not let press reports or anything emanating from the House suggest otherwise. Those who transgress are in a minority. Everyone who believes that policing is crucial to the way we live, and that it helps to secure life and limb and to defend homes, families and streets, must remember that although there may be alleged transgressions, they are few.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Streeter. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on the work carried out by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in respect of policing and protest and particularly on the Committee's deft ability to produce a report and still take account of an event that took place a day or two after it was published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para33"><a name="10020467000173">We heard that the Committee took written and oral evidence from a wide range of witnesses and examined the way in which protests are policed in a number of other countries. That detailed evidence gathering is reflected in the tenor of the report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para34"><a name="10020467000174">Some Ministers may find scrutiny uncomfortable, but it is an essential process, especially in the area of policing. If the police service and the Government are to learn lessons, particularly when things go wrong, we should not be afraid of scrutiny. Personally, I welcome it, and I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism does too. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell), the Under-Secretary of State, give their apologies for not being here today. They are busy in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="100204h0004.htm_para36"><a name="10020467000176">How officers police protests is hugely important, and the issue has attracted considerable interest in recent months. As the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) said, in the vast majority of cases the police get it right. None the less, all it takes is one wrong move for the public, understandably, to lose confidence. When the public lose confidence in the police, it can undermine the British policing model, which is built on the principles of policing by consent and community policing. We have seen such principles amplified in our approach to neighbourhood policing, in which police officers are very much embedded in the community, rather than appearing only when a crime is committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para1"><a name="10020467000178">As the Committee will be aware from the letter of  13 January, my right hon. Friend the Minister welcomed the Joint Committee's report on behalf of the Government, as well as the other reviews that have been published on this issue in the past year. Our response to the Committee's recommendations is based on the HMIC report, "Adapting to Protest: Nurturing the British Model of Policing". That title sums up the sentiment at the core of the Home Office's attitude to policing. The report was published last November, and the Government's position on the policing of protests was set out in the White Paper "Protecting the Public: Supporting the Police to Succeed", which was published in December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para2"><a name="10020467000179">As we said in the White Paper, the public have the right to expect the highest standards of policing, and we have to support every officer in delivering those high standards. None the less, it is important to put the policing of protests into a proper context. The overwhelming majority of officers do a professional job in what can be testing circumstances. Examples of good practice include the sensitive policing of the Tamil protests around Parliament. Difficult challenges were presented by the English Defence League demonstrations, which saw thousands of people gathering in some of our cities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para3"><a name="10020467000180">As the Government made clear in the White Paper, we welcome the HMIC report as a major contribution to the future direction of the policing of protests. We are committed to working with the police and others to ensure that the recommendations are properly acted on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para4"><a name="10020467000181">The White Paper endorses the values championed by the HMIC review and reaffirms the key principles of the British policing model. As I have said, community policing and policing by consent underpin the policing of protests as well as our general approach to policing. We agree with the Joint Committee that human rights awareness must be a core part of policing protest. A human rights-based approach, however, is not a soft option; it does not mean anything-goes policing. It upholds our democratic principles, supporting the founding tenets of British policing and, crucially, providing a practical framework for the police to resolve any areas of conflict.</p>

hallmark of an open and democratic society. We agree with the Joint Committee that the policing of protest must be founded on good communication and dialogue between the police and protest groups, drawing on community-style policing, which is the foundation of what we do. It is key to a no-surprises policing policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000185">The Government are not saying that protests will be unfettered. If, for example, there is a threat of serious public disorder, the Public Order Act 1986 specifically allows the police to intervene and impose conditions on protests to prevent serious public disorder, serious disruption to the life of the community and serious damage. That is based on a senior officer's reasonable belief, taking into account the particular circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000186">It is very clear that we need to ensure that such a decision is made at an operational level-by that, I mean at the time and on the judgment of a professional police officer. The 1986 Act needs to be read against the Human Rights Act 1998 whenever the police consider using their powers in such a way. Clearly, the police must have guidance and training. The principles also provide clarity on issues that continue to raise legitimate concerns, such as the proportionate and appropriate use of police stop-and-search powers; the use of force; the application of containment; how police and protesters can improve their communication with one another; how chief constables can ensure that officers in uniform are clearly identifiable at all times to the public whom they serve; and what images and data on protesters the police can gather and retain. I will touch on the points raised by hon. Members in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000187">ACPO and the National Policing Improvement Agency are already well on the way to updating guidance and training. As the HMIC makes clear, it is all very well providing guidance and training, but the guidance and training need to be targeted, practical and informed by front-line officers who are facing the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para9"><a name="10020467000188">Transparency is key to building confidence and to working towards a no-surprises policing policy. Given the national public order and interoperability challenges, forces across the country need to use and comply with guidance and training. We often have situations in which police are moved from one force area to another to police a protest. If they work under different guidelines or have a different approach, that could cause great difficulty and mean that they were not doing their job so well. It is important that we have some consistency across the 43 forces in England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para10"><a name="10020467000189">We agree with the HMIC recommendation that a Home Office code of practice is the way to achieve that consistency, and we are working with the police service to develop a code that supports common standards and gets the right balance in minimising bureaucracy and respecting key elements of the British policing model-operational independence, officer discretion, local innovation and political neutrality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para11"><a name="10020467000190">I have listened very carefully to the points that have been raised, and I am delighted to be able to answer them.

The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds talked very supportively about the hard work that our police do, and the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) raised other concerns that I will address later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para13"><a name="10020467000192">I hope that in my first comments I addressed the concern of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds about the core principles. Proportionality, legality and necessity are the principles behind the policing of protests. ACPO, the NPIA and the Home Office all have a role to play in ensuring that our police on the ground have the guidance and practical support that they need to act in that way.</p>

 The Minister is right, but what she is talking about are the restrictions on protests; the restrictions have to be necessary and proportionate. Will she also confirm that articles 10 and 11 are the key human rights principles here-that they guarantee the right to protest and that there is a duty to facilitate that right?</p>

I know that that is a sensitive area; as a constituency MP, I have had to deal with that issue in relation to a particular constituent. We know that photography can be a valuable intelligence-gathering tool. Of course, it works both ways-there are the photographs taken of protesters by the police and then there is the section 44 issue. However, photographs taken by the police can be a valuable intelligence-gathering tool, which allows officers to build up a clear picture of who is involved in planning and organising any criminal behaviour. It can also provide the police with valuable evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para15"><a name="10020467000196">The use of photography raises human rights issues. The courts have recently considered whether the taking and retention of photographs is compatible with the right to private life protected by article 8 of the European convention on human rights. The decision to retain images is a matter for individual police forces, informed by the legislative framework set out in the ECHR and the Data Protection Act 1998. The Home Office code of practice on the management of police information sets out the key principles to be followed in the retention of police data.</p>

We are holding "train the trainers" events to raise awareness and understanding of human rights issues for those who deliver command training across the police service.</p>

raised throughout police forces, and forces are now building the role of journalists into their training scenarios to increase awareness among front-line officers. As a former journalist myself, I am certainly very pleased that we are making it clear to police officers that journalists have a legitimate and proper role to play in covering protests and related issues, and that that role is separate from that of protesters. Crucially, as HMIC recognises, awareness-raising is already being translated into action.</p>

Unfortunately, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is no longer in his seat, but he can read my comments in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para19"><a name="10020467000200">As we said in our response to the Joint Committee, we consider that the civil procedure rules provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that those who are the subject of injunctions have the opportunity to make representations. We are not convinced of the need to amend the civil procedure rules and we believe that the Civil Procedure Rules Committee, which considers changes, would be unlikely to be convinced about the need for change on the basis of what appears to be an isolated case.</p>

 I do not think that it is an isolated case-that is the problem. Indeed, the BBC produced a programme about this issue of injunctions in the middle of last year. It found quite a few cases in which the civil injunction procedure was being used to restrain potential protests. The real question is this: is the state facilitating protest or preventing it? To an extent, that issue is mixed up with the issue of private land and private-public space. However, the fact remains that the safeguards  are simply not there in any meaningful way, and although it may be theoretically possible for people to come  back afterwards and challenge such injunctions, in  practice that does not work. There is no urgency about these things.</p>

 It is not that there is no urgency. If we are looking to change the law, whether through primary legislation or other routes, we have to be careful to ensure that we are not doing so on the basis of just one case. If the Joint Committee has evidence in relation to other cases, we will certainly look again at the issue of injunctions and I will certainly pass any such evidence on to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism. However, as I say, we cannot work on the basis of one case.</p>

 Perhaps I did not make my point clear, but it was about somebody who was, for example, in the situation that I described. If there is an issue about personal safety for an individual, sometimes the injunction needs to be put in place expediently and there is not time to give notice. There should always be as much notice as possible, but sometimes urgent situations arise and we need to ensure that we provide safety for people too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para21"><a name="10020467000208">I am keen to move on, because essentially injunctions are a matter for the courts to decide and we need to be mindful of the separation of powers in this country.</p>

 Of course it is a matter for the courts as to whether an injunction should be granted, but it is a matter for Parliament to decide the circumstances in which that power should be available to the courts. The hon. Member for Cambridge came up with what I thought was a very neat formulation, which is that a court should pay due regard to articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR. That would not necessarily bind a court, but it would mean that, for example in the circumstances that my hon. Friend outlined-a better example might be that of animal rights activists who have actively engaged in violence-the injunction could still be granted ex parte, but that should be the exception and not the norm.</p>

 The courts are obliged to take into account articles 10 and 11 of the ECHR in all cases before them, under the Human Rights Act 1998. In this instance, we are talking about procedure rules and there remains a role for without- notice injunctions. Ultimately the courts, which are used to all aspects of granting injunctions, will decide on injunctions. If the Joint Committee has further evidence in relation to this issue, we would welcome the chance to look at it. However, as things stand, we have no plans to change our position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para22"><a name="10020467000211">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of the use of technology. There is a real benefit to using technology, but we must not forget the basics and in this country the basics of policing are human-our police officers on the streets. Good communication is the key, in terms of face-to-face community-style policing, and that is how we in this country choose to police protests. We do not stand at a distance using water cannons, as police in other countries do, and we should not have communication as a specialist role; I believe that it needs to be embedded, as it already is, in the training of all police officers.</p>

protesters-was prepared to talk to the other. It was only when he tried to bring them together that there was any dialogue at all; it may have been a dialogue of the deaf, but at least it was a start. In Northern Ireland,  that very painstaking no-surprises process began through the use of intermediaries-Catholic priests, in that particular case.</p>

 Of course, the police should always be willing to talk to anyone. It distresses me sometimes when I hear of cases where a group of protesters, or any group, does not wish to co-operate with the police, because if we can engender dialogue we often break through these problems.</p>

 May I just finish my point? The existing public order framework operates effectively and it ensures the facilitation of protests in the vast majority of cases across England and Wales. Good communication and effective dialogue are key. However, we are not convinced of the need for mediators at this point, because we believe that the police are well trained in this area. Furthermore, I believe that the use of mediators can add complications and overly bureaucratic processes to what is essentially the current effective model of working, whereby the police enter into discussions with the people that they are policing and they are not seen as unable to do that. There is a danger in bringing in mediation. I know that the hon. Gentleman disagrees, but I will give way to the hon. Member for Cambridge first.</p>

 The problem, as I observed it in the G20 situation, was that both police and protesters assumed that any contact with the other side would reveal information to the other side, in some kind of tactical battle in which the police's main objective appeared to the protesters to be to prevent the protest from happening at all. Therefore, it is important that the starting point changes, and that the protesters are confident that the police's objective is to facilitate the protest and not to stop it.</p>

 Certainly the police's job is to facilitate protest-as long as it is peaceful. The police must establish that balance, on human rights grounds, between the rights of the wider population and the rights of the protesters. So, a certain level of disruption may be acceptable, but there must be a decision made on the ground about, for example, when it is acceptable for protesters to block a road and for how long. A protest may be peaceful, but it can be very inconvenient for other people. There needs to be a balance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="100204h0005.htm_para25"><a name="10020467000220">I am of the opinion that the problem must be solved by building trust rather than circumventing it.

 I disagree. In the vast majority of cases, there is trust between police and protesters. If we went down the path of suggesting that we need a third party as a routine matter of course because there is no trust, it would undermine the police and their training. One could also say that it would let the police off the hook of having to deal with communications. The police officers whom I deal with in my constituency, who pride themselves on their contact with the community and how they deal with protests and demonstrations, would be insulted by the idea that another party needed to come in and do that for them.</p>

Gentleman's general characterisation of riot police might inform his position; it comes from the perspective of the protester. I can give an example of my own. One nice sunny day, my children and I were heading to a park in north-east London. It happened to be the day of the London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham. As we entered the tube station on our way back, large groups of drunken fans were chanting at each other. Police in riot gear were keeping them apart, and I must say that I was grateful for their presence. It depends on one's perspective. I do not see a problem with having police present to maintain peace. We do not want riot police on the streets all the time, but it is important that they are there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para1"><a name="10020467000226">We need to balance consent and maintaining the safety of officers and the public.

 My hon. Friend misunderstands the position. The difficulty with police in riot gear is that it can sometimes provoke rather than calm things down. HMIC identified in its work that there is nothing in between to de-escalate confrontations. We start from ordinary policing and end up in riot gear, but there is nothing in between. Police can escalate, but have no training to de-escalate. That is what has been missing  so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para5"><a name="10020467000243">The European Court of Human Rights judgment is not final, and the UK will not be required to implement it by amending the law, pending our appeal to the grand chamber. We hope to persuade the Court that our domestic court's assessment is correct and that the powers are compatible with convention rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000244">It is important to emphasise that the effectiveness of section 44 powers cannot be measured simply in terms of the number of arrests resulting from stops and searches. The purpose of the policy is also to act as a deterrent to terrorists. Since mid-2009, however, stop and search in the capital dropped 40 per cent. after the Metropolitan police responded to concerns, including from the community, by changing how the tool is used. I have welcomed clarification given to constituents and locally about how section 44 is used, but I have learned from talking to my local police in Hackney that it is a valuable way to ensure that we are all safe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000245">In all matters of policing and human rights, we must balance the rights of the individual stopped or the protester against the rights of the wider community as well. It is about balance. It is important that we do not forget that when we discuss protests, we are not talking only about those who choose to protest but about the people whose lives their protests can disrupt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000246">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon discussed the balance between public and private space. We are committed to working with ACPO and wider stakeholders on the issue. We are tackling it in a revision to ACPO guidance and a Home Office code by July this year, as the White Paper outlines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para9"><a name="10020467000247">My hon. Friend also mentioned the amount of legislation and the need for clarity. One substantive change has been made to the Public Order Act 1986 in the past 10 years: the number of people constituting an assembly changed from 20 to two. The change had the full support of the police service, and the Government will constantly review the law-<i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> But that is only one change. My hon. Friend said that too many changes had been made to the law. The Government will constantly review the law and consult widely before introducing any new legislation. That includes consulting the police and making changes at their request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para10"><a name="10020467000248">The Government understand the complexities of modern policing and the judgments that police must make daily. In the arena of public order policing, the police must balance a number of competing rights, as I have said, and it is important that the legislative framework is clear to assist the police in carrying out their role. We will continue to work with ACPO to provide proper understanding and application of the law. As I have said, it is not good enough just to have law or guidance; it must be understood and implemented at a practical level by officers on the ground, at the sharp end of policing.</p>

We have provided Parliament with the draft text of an order showing what requirements must be met in relation to maintaining access to the Palace. We hope that it will address those concerns, and we look forward to hearing the Committee's views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para13"><a name="10020467000251">The Government's intention has always been to  come up with provisions that allow the police to  maintain access to Parliament in a way that does not disproportionately restrict protest, that is clear to those wishing to protest in the area and that is commensurate with Parliament's expectations. We welcome the continuing debate on the matter during the passage of the Bill and hope to bring Parliament clarity on the consequences of our proposals. We are confident that there will be plenty of time to debate the matter on Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para15"><a name="10020467000253">We discussed section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 and I will clarify the Government's position. We agree with the Joint Committee that there is no right under English law not to be offended. Such a right would undermine the right to freedom of expression. We must get away from the idea that section 5 is about simply preventing people from causing offence-that misrepresents the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para16"><a name="10020467000254">Although protecting freedom of expression is key, it must be balanced with the need to ensure that people, especially vulnerable members of society, are protected from gratuitous insults. I am worried that amending the offence as the Joint Committee proposes would send the wrong message that it is acceptable to insult someone.</p>

 I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon can no longer be here because he has a particular interest in this proposal. If he were here, I am sure he would ask the Minister whether by "gratuitous insults" she means somebody deliberately and intentionally causing alarm and distress. If so, that is covered by section 4(1)(a) of the 1986 Act. It would therefore not be affected by the suggested amendment to section 5.</p>

 Although this is not my normal area of work in the Home Office, I have looked at the issue closely because it interests me. One challenge, which was backed up by our consultation, is that removing the word "insulting" from the scope of the offence would send a signal that insulting a person is acceptable. That would have a negative impact on vulnerable members of society.</p>

considerations in relation to freedom of expression. We intend to develop guidance in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon will be aware that our response states that we are happy to share the draft guidance with the Joint Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para18"><a name="10020467000258">The right to freedom of expression, as contained in article 10 of the European convention on human rights, is an essential foundation of a democratic society. Although it concerns the Government if police officers use powers inappropriately in a way that impacts on a person's right to freedom of expression, we believe that the way to address that is to give officers targeted guidance, not to change the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para19"><a name="10020467000259">The courts have upheld that section 5 of the 1986 Act contains the necessary balance between the individual's right to freedom of expression and the right of others not to be insulted and distressed. Section 5 is engaged only when the words or behaviour are "threatening, abusive or insulting". It is possible to lawfully express views in public that some consider offensive without being threatening, abusive or insulting and, therefore, without contravening section 5.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para20"><a name="10020467000260">The hon. Member for Cambridge mentioned Kingsnorth climate camp. Home Office Ministers have given undertakings to Parliament that the lessons that can be learned from Kingsnorth will be identified and shared. The former Home Office Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) apologised for unwittingly providing inaccurate information to the House about bee stings.</p>

 I think it was wasp stings. I put it on the record that I accepted at the time and still accept that apology. The circumstances in which the hon. Member for Gedling came to make that statement have never been clarified entirely, but I accept that it was unlikely to have been his fault.</p>

<p><a name="st_81"><a name="10020467000262"><a name="100204h0006.htm_spnew20"><a name="10020467000378"><b>Meg Hillier:</b>
 I will pass on the hon. Gentleman's repeated acceptance of that apology and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling will be pleased. I am pleased that Kent police published the ACPO review into Kingsnorth and that the HMIC has picked up on the lessons in its report, "Adapting to Protest-Nurturing the British Model of Policing". Indeed, Kent police are holding a symposium on public order next month to learn the lessons. I am sure the hon. Member for Cambridge will be interested in the outcome of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para21"><a name="10020467000263">The hon. Gentleman was critical of ACPO and asked whether it should continue to exist in its current form. We believe strongly that ACPO is an important part of the policing landscape. We welcome the fresh thinking from HMIC and the new president of ACPO and his team on ACPO's role and on how ACPO can have the best possible partnerships with the Home Office and the Association of Police Authorities. We look forward to discussing any formal proposals that emerge from ACPO in due course. Parliament will have a role in any such proposals.</p>

Police Authorities to co-ordinate the direction and development of the service. It is not anomalous, but fits into a well-worn structure that brings together the key leads of the 43 police forces in England and Wales so that there are common standards. It is an independent organisation made up of representatives of the 43 police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para23"><a name="10020467000265">ACPO is instrumental in advising the Government on how to tackle serious and ongoing threats that put the public at risk. As such, on behalf of the whole service, it leads on the executing of major national projects aimed at developing the capacity of the service to meet the challenges of the rapidly changing world. Although policing is not my main area of work in the Home Office, I do work with ACPO leads. As a Minister, it is helpful to have access to experts in the area who have ready access to a network of other experts in the field. That enables Ministers to receive good advice from people who know what it is like to be a working police officer. It is important to have that mix and not just to make decisions from behind the Minister's desk in Whitehall, as the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds characterised it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para24"><a name="10020467000266">The hon. Member for Cambridge raised the issue of the police's role in relation to the media. The Joint Committee took evidence which showed that the  police give the media measured briefings. I therefore disagree with his characterisation. I see that he disagrees with me.</p>

 The point I was trying to get across was the Joint Committee's original point. It was a criticism not of what police said to the media in briefings, but of what action the police took to calm the situation having seen what the media made of those briefings.</p>

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="10020467000268"><a name="100204h0006.htm_spnew22"><a name="10020467000380"><b>Meg Hillier:</b>
 We are asking the police to do a great deal if they are to be held responsible for the headlines in certain newspapers. Speaking as a Home Office Minister, I can say that Government policy is often crudely misrepresented. I can do my best to change that, but I cannot tell a journalist how to do their job. We have a free press in this country. Whether or not we agree with the press, we have to allow it to do its job. We are in danger of overstepping the mark with regard to what the police can actually achieve. I am sure that police press offices up and down the country work to calm things down, but we have a free press and we must allow it to work unfettered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para25"><a name="10020467000269">The hon. Member for Cambridge mentioned containment. I would be grateful to hear from him examples of where police have moved in and closed an area so that we can raise them with ACPO. If he provides information to the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism, he will look into it. The hon. Gentleman also raised forward intelligence teams. The ACPO review of guidance on their work to date will be forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="100204h0006.htm_para26"><a name="10020467000270">The hon. Gentleman also raised the Wood case. That did not go against the Government, as he said. The case was brought against the Metropolitan police, who welcome the clarity that the judgment brings. It is important to put that on the record. As I said, we agree that photography can be a valuable intelligence-gathering tool, but it raises human rights issues. It is important that those issues are tested in the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para0"><a name="10020467000271">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds raised some useful points. I welcome his cross-party support for the valuable and important work of the police. It is important that we send a message out to the police that Parliament supports the work they do. I am glad that we can do that in this debate on a challenging area of policing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para1"><a name="10020467000272">The legal test for the use of force, which is one of the concerns the hon. Gentleman raised, is set out in the Criminal Law Act 1967. That applies to any use of force. The law is clear that any use of force must be reasonable and appropriate to the threat or perceived threat that officers face. The disproportionate use of force is unacceptable and any officer found to be using excessive force will be disciplined accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para2"><a name="10020467000273">Where there is doubt or concern about the use of force, the police should be scrutinised. That is rightly happening under the auspices of the IPCC and HMIC. Once again, I stress that most officers do not overuse force, but they are working in very challenging areas. At the sharp end of policing, officers need to know that they are scrutinised and will be trained to do the job properly. We need to be sure that we have safeguards in place for any officers who overstep the mark. We will continue to work with all police agencies and associations to ensure that the legal position on the police use of force is embedded in every area of policing from the first day of training right the way through. We will also ensure there is consistency in different areas of guidance that impinge on the use of force; for example, armed policing and officer safety training. Those will be cemented in the code of practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para3"><a name="10020467000274">The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of there not being enough trained officers. We take that very seriously, as do ACPO, which is working on building regional capability. The Home Office will be producing a code of practice on public order to ensure that the police have appropriately trained officers. That is core policing and, as I mentioned, it is important to have that across 43 forces, because of the need to move officers, from time to time, into other force areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para4"><a name="10020467000275">The HMIC is clear that the issue is not more training, but better training. ACPO and the National Policing Improvement Agency have already piloted a new command-level training approach. I am happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with guidance on that as necessary. We agree that guidance needs to be implemented, and that the Olympics will be a challenge in that respect, so we need to make sure we have got it right.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="10020467000276"><a name="100204h0007.htm_spnew0"><a name="10020467000381"><b>Mr. Ruffley:</b>
 If the Minister could provide some written material along the lines she has suggested, particularly in relation to 2012, it would be extremely useful for all parties.</p>

 As I am not the lead Minister in that area, I cannot promise exactly what I can provide, but I will pass the matter directly on to the Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism. There might be some minor issues concerning the security of the Olympics that we cannot reveal widely to the public, but if we can reveal that information to hon. Members, we will do so as appropriate. The intention is certainly to be open about the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para5"><a name="10020467000278">I was also grateful to the hon. Gentleman-harmony breaks out on this cold Thursday afternoon-for expressing his desire to have more bang for our buck, as he put it.  <br>

That is very much core to the Home Office's approach. We do not necessarily need to use more money to do these things but, in everything we are doing, we should weigh every public pound and use it as effectively as possible. The public purse is not an automated teller machine, even for policing, and we need to make sure that we balance money properly. We are working towards joint procurement strategies on police and public order equipment. There is greater collaboration between forces in line with the protective services agenda. I recommend that the hon. Gentleman looks at the White Paper, "Protecting the Public: Supporting the Police to Succeed," for more detail on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para6"><a name="10020467000279">I think I have covered most of the issues raised-I am just checking to see if there is anything I have missed. We agree that the Northern Ireland model is good, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, and the climate camp at Blackheath shows that we can have proper, proportionate policing and dialogue between the police and those involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para7"><a name="10020467000280">I hope that I have provided reassurance this afternoon about the Government's commitment to upholding the right to peaceful protest and to providing police officers with the support that they need. We in the Home Office and the police have undertaken to deliver a programme of work by summer this year that will directly address a number of the Committee's recommendations. We might disagree on some small areas, but I hope I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that, where the Committee has evidence on certain issues, we are always happy to consider that. Once again, I pay due respect to how the Committee has gathered the evidence and to the considered way in which it produced its report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para8"><a name="10020467000281">In the White Paper on policing, we pledged to work with the police and the public to ensure that the recommendations of the HMIC report are properly acted upon and to act as an agent for change.

 We have had a constructive debate and there has been a great deal of agreement. It is unfortunate that when winding up such a debate, one always wants to stress the points on which we have not agreed, to put down markers or have a second bite at a particular argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para9"><a name="10020469000002">I think my hon. Friend the Minister did not quite get what I was saying about the escalation issue in relation to protest. No one wants anybody to get hurt, whether it be a police officer or a protester, and what came out of the discussions that we had last week in Portcullis House was that policing can never be a no-risk occupation. There will always be an element of risk in policing, and the point made to me in Northern Ireland, and by those from the police service in our discussions last week, was that that was accepted. No one wants to take an unnecessary risk, but if things are done properly, it can sometimes de-escalate tension if certain risks are taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para10"><a name="10020469000003">I come back to the point that Assistant Chief Constable McCausland made to us about the challenge he gave to his officers when he said, "Look, I'm not asking you   <br>

to do something I'm not prepared to do." He went to the head of what was, I think, a very difficult loyalist march in a Catholic area and proved that with proper, no-surprises policing, and proper discussions between people who come from difficult and conflicting circumstances, such scenarios can be de-escalated, rather than escalated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para11"><a name="10020469000004">It is not a question of uniform or no uniform; it is a question of the policing approach. At the moment, the policing approach is all or nothing. That was brought home to us not just by our conclusions, but by the evidence that we were given, including from the police themselves and HMIC. It is important for there to be more sophisticated police training, particularly at the command level-bronze, silver and gold-to show that the objective is not to go straight to full-on riot policing, but to try to find ways of bringing tensions down, rather than pushing them up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para12"><a name="10020469000005">The hon. Member for Cambridge made the point that the way in which the containment tactic is used to push people together increases the tension, particularly if riot police hit people on the legs with the edges of shields to try to push them back when there is no space for them to go to. We saw that there were people with their hands up saying, "We're not part of a riot," yet they were still being treated as if they were. That is not de-escalating the tension-it is potentially increasing the tension and increasing confrontation where there was none to start with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para13"><a name="10020469000006">My hon. Friend the Minister and other hon. Members are absolutely right to say that the overwhelming majority of protests happen perfectly peacefully, with proper co-ordination with the police and without any difficulty at all. It is inevitable that we have to focus on when things have gone wrong, because by doing so we can try to improve things for the future and ensure that such difficulties do not arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para14"><a name="10020469000007">That is why, I am afraid, I have to come back again to the question of mediators or intermediaries. I fully accept my hon. Friend's point that the police want to be able and should be able to communicate directly with individuals, both on the front-line of the protest and at an organisational level. However, occasionally, as she accepted, trust has broken down to such an extent that there is no dialogue at all. The question is how to break through that lack of dialogue.</p>

The Northern Ireland experience shows that such an approach is not a one-off thing and that it takes time to build those difficult relationships. Building trust between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and some of the republican movement was a very difficult thing to achieve, but it was done through the use of intermediaries to start the dialogue. Direct contact then developed between the police and those involved.</p>

 We are talking at cross purposes here. The difference is that the situation in Northern Ireland developed over a long time; there was no sudden single event for which that approach was necessary. Those involved were dealing with communities that were entrenched over many years-in fact, for my entire lifetime, until recently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para16"><a name="10020469000010">We are talking here about individual protests that, as we say, are mostly peaceable. Sometimes those protests escalate, but who is able to communicate best on the ground? It should be our police. According to my hon. Friend's model, at what point would it be right to bring in a mediator? The fact that a mediator might be available could even escalate the problems further. We have the right approach and, as we set out in the White Paper, we are all about communicating, not de-escalating.</p>

 Of course it should be the police. My hon. Friend is right that in Northern Ireland there was a long history that had to be dealt with, but the other case is not a one-off. The same group of protesters, the climate camp collection, have had that problem time and again; that is why the trust has broken down. Although there might have been trust at first, it has dissipated and now has to be rebuilt. The question is how we rebuild it. There have been more than half a dozen of those confrontational demonstrations in which dialogue has not taken place.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="10020469000012"><a name="100204h0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="10020469000029"><b>David Howarth:</b>
 I would like to add another observation that I have made over the past few years about trust breaking down. The Minister referred to situations in which the police communicate perfectly well with demonstrators, but those tend to be traditional processions where the police understand what the demonstrators are up to and the rules of the game. However, when demonstrators are doing things other than taking part in a normal procession, and when their lifestyles and values are perhaps unfamiliar to the police, it is sometimes useful to have a mediator. In the situation I found myself in, I concluded that I started too late and that we needed a number of different rounds.</p>

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="10020469000013"><a name="100204h0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="10020469000030"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman makes his point well. We have seen new forms of protest evolve because the traditional forms of protest, frankly, do not attract any attention. It is inevitable that some people will be offended, as the whole purpose of protest, as I said earlier, is to cause some disruption; otherwise, no one would take any notice. What we have seen at the climate camp, and with similar types of activity, are new ideas on how to attract attention when protesting. We have an obligation, under human rights law, to facilitate protest, and sometimes that will be disruptive. The problem in this case is that the police cannot cope with something outside their expectations, and that is why we get that escalation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para17"><a name="10020469000014">We must try to get to a situation in which protesters are confident that, if they talk to the police, they will not immediately be prevented from doing what they want to do. The police might want to fiddle around the edges, and a bit of to and fro in negotiations is fair enough, but if they simply say, "No, you can't do that," there will be no dialogue-we will have a dialogue of the deaf. We need a way of brokering an agreement when new forms of protest are used that are outside the police's basic experience, as that will enable the protesters to make their point in an acceptable way and the protest to be policed in a civilised way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para18"><a name="10020469000015">The difficulty is how to get the two sides talking when there is absolutely no trust between them. Trust is what we have to build. Sometimes, a mediator can achieve   <br>

that trust to kick-start the process. The sooner the mediator can pull out and the trust can build and ferment of its own accord, the better, but how do we get the process started when there is no trust to start with?</p>

 I hope that my hon. Friend will acknowledge that in Blackheath the police are building bridges and trust with the climate protesters. There is a difference between building bridges on a soft basis and having hard mediators come in at the final point. Does he agree that it is important that the police understand the culture of the people they are dealing with and do not do that through an intermediary, which would put a distance between themselves and protesters, rather than having the contact policing that is central to our model?</p>

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="10020469000017"><a name="100204h0007.htm_spnew8"><a name="10020469000032"><b>Mr. Dismore:</b>
 As I said earlier, I appreciate what happened at Blackheath, as both the protesters and the police pulled back, which was good. I think that we would all agree that a protest on Blackheath is different from a protest in the middle of the City of London, with regard to potential disruption. It is good that relationships can be built. We are not talking about hard mediation, but about trying to get two sides talking. We have made our point, although my hon. Friend the Minister might not be wedded to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para19"><a name="10020469000018">The other issue that the Minister raised related to section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000-again. I am prepared to have a little wager with her that what will happen in the Grand Chamber is not what she thinks will happen. There is no question about the need for counter-terrorism powers to be used for counter-terrorism purposes. Indeed, Ministers-I am not sure whether she has said this today-have told our Committee that section 44 should be used strictly for counter-terrorism purposes only and not as a public order tool. The real problem is that it is being used as a public order tool  <br>

when there is no question of any terrorist threat at all and as a shortcut by the police to stop and search people because they have no other grounds for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para20"><a name="10020469000019">If the police have to have reasonable suspicion under sections 1, 60 or 43, that is fine. If they think that something is going wrong or that someone has a weapon, for example, they are entitled to use stop-and-search powers without having to use section 44 because they would have reasonable suspicion. The problem with section 44 is that the police can stop and search people with no suspicion at all simply because an area has been designated as potentially at risk from terrorists. Even though the overall area is now much less than the whole of London, which it used to be, some of the areas involved are still pretty broad.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para21"><a name="10020469000020">The real problem is not only that that undermines confidence in counter-terrorism legislation generally, but that it is over-broad. If 250,000 people are stopped under section 44 and not one is arrested for a terrorist offence-we should remember just how broad our terrorism offences now are-that indicates to me that section 44 might not have been used for its original purpose. That argument has been accepted by Ministers on previous occasions. Ministers have said that it should be used only for counter-terrorism purposes, but it does not happen that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"><a name="100204h0007.htm_para22"><a name="10020469000021">My final point is about civil injunctions; I do not think that the Minister understands what we are saying about those. Civil injunctions are about changing the rules of court, not changing substantive law. They are about trying to get a balanced playing field and a cheaper and more effective way of protecting people, and about the right to protest.</p>
