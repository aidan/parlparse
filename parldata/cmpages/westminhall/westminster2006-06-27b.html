 Although there have been several opportunities in recent months both here and in the main Chamber to debate police force restructuring, this is the first time that we shall consider it purely in a Welsh context. It is an opportune moment to have the debate, given the recent decision&#151;or non-decision&#151;about restructuring following the change of leadership at the Home Office and in response to the crescendo of criticisms and worries expressed in recent weeks by chief constables in Wales, police authorities, Members of this House and the National Assembly and many others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para1"><a name="06062727000011">This debate also provides the first opportunity to discuss properly the findings of the inquiry conducted by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, which reported in February on the proposed restructuring. Although the issue has moved on somewhat since then, the findings of the inquiry are still relevant and deserve a response from the Minister. Apart from the odd question at Welsh and Home Office questions, we have had little time in which to debate this important matter from a Welsh perspective.</p>

 Yes; I have just referred to the inquiry undertaken by the Welsh Affairs Committee and to the fact that it produced a report in February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para2"><a name="06062727000014">The proposal to create a single police force for Wales is the most far-reaching reform of policing in Wales for generations. What we shall be discussing goes far beyond purely overarching administrative and bureaucratic arrangements, which are of little interest to our constituents who care first and foremost about the delivery of high-quality policing in their immediate localities.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman may be aware that I, too, have worries about an all-Wales force, but several of them have been addressed. The issue of finance certainly remains outstanding, but does he agree that there are considerable savings to be made when there are four forces with four separate IT and administrative systems? Surely there must be scope for savings in those areas that can be transferred to front-line services.</p>

realising those theoretical benefits. However, I have big doubts about whether such detailed plans are in place, as I shall explain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para3"><a name="06062727000017">I may be wrong, but I suspect that the attachment felt to the four existing forces in Wales is nowhere near as strong as the feelings experienced for local hospitals or schools that are under threat of closure or change. Even so, people will accept change to the status quo in respect of policing only if&#151;it is a huge &#147;if&#148;&#151;there is a convincing case for reform. I have never opposed police force restructuring in principle. Reform of policing is an ongoing necessity in the light of new risks and challenges that emerge&#151;reforms in terms of how resources are deployed, achieving better efficiency, strengthening local accountability and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para4"><a name="06062727000018">No Member of the House could have credibly responded to the issues raised in Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary&#146;s report of last September by insisting on business as usual. It does hon. Members no credit when they wed themselves for eternity to structures that may or may not be out of date or may or may not offer the optimal arrangements for tackling the full range of law and order challenges, from local crime and antisocial behaviour through to serious and organised crime, terrorism and narcotics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000019">Three broad questions need to be asked at the outset regarding the proposal for a single strategic force for Wales. First, is the proposed destination the right one for Wales? Is an all-Wales strategic force the best possible option for meeting the evolving policing challenges in the years ahead, or could other arrangements do the job? My view is that, more than in any of the police force areas, the proposed restructuring for Wales is being driven by factors other than simply those concerned with tackling crime. Whatever Ministers currently say about whether the groundwork is being laid for the longer-term devolution of policing to the Assembly, I believe there is a strong political imperative driving the reform that may be overriding other factors and which may be leading us down the wrong path.</p>

 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a fourth question, which is that what is needed is also a time to bed in the current changes that are taking place within policing in south Wales? In my constituency of Bridgend and in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s neighbouring constituency of Ogmore, the South Wales force is bedding in community policing successfully with community liaison meetings and regular contact on the issues that communities want targeted. Would it not be more appropriate to bed in those processes first and get that confidence with community policing before we move on to the wider issues of an all-Wales force?</p>

 The hon. Lady makes a good point and, as ever, expresses herself well. That is the second broad question that I wanted to raise, which is whether the pace at which we are being moved towards the ultimate destination is appropriate in terms of securing the support of relevant stakeholders, including members of the public, and in terms of maximising the chances of the project&#146;s success so that the theoretical benefits can be achieved in practice. On this score, the Government&#146;s tactics and approach have, until recently, been hugely counter-productive, alienating many in Wales who would advocate some kind of positive change.</p>

So far, the unanswered questions over financial consequences, local accountability and the consequences for neighbourhood policing mean that to press ahead with the merger would amount to a reckless experiment which the people of Wales will be left to live with far beyond the life of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para7"><a name="06062727000023">I welcome the current delay in forcing the merger in Wales, but only if this means that there can now be serious reflection on whether this is the right destination and if there will be a much more serious attempt to resolve the outstanding details regarding the implications of the merger. I have never doubted that police force restructuring offers potential gains on a number of different fronts. However, not once in the past 10 months have I come even close to being convinced that the Government have a realistic plan for achieving those benefits in practice.</p>

I was told that would not be possible as the information about protective services was too sensitive. Could the Minister make available copies of any work done to evaluate the different options for Wales? Has the work been done? If not, could the Minister commit to doing it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000032">In other parts of Wales, too, there is a feeling that all relevant options have not been properly assessed. The Welsh Affairs Committee&#146;s report made the point that it is a pity</p>

Talented as they are, there is absolutely no way that Ministers, their officials, the chief constables and their authorities could have done all the necessary groundwork for such a massive reform in the few short months between the publication of the report &#147;Closing the Gap&#148; in September 2005 and the end of the year deadline for submitting business cases.</p>

I am sorry to say that in place of mature leadership we have had bulldozer tactics which, at times, have amounted to bullying and, in the case of the offer of extra money to forces volunteering to merge by the deadline, something akin to bribery. The Welsh Affairs Committee was very clear on the negative effect of the pace at which this reform was being driven. It stated:</p>

understandable that he should now take the view that police force restructuring is an unnecessary headache at this point in time. However, it is vital that the period before us is not just a breathing space for the new Home Secretary before he revisits the scheme and attempts to push it through in exactly the same way.

 I am not opposed in principle to restructuring. I made that very clear at the start of my speech. However, I need to be convinced that the restructuring will deliver concrete benefits in terms of policing in Wales. My point throughout has been that so far, I have not been anywhere near convinced that the plans for creating an all-Wales strategic force will achieve the benefits that we are led to believe are out there to be gained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000041">Back in February the Secretary of State for Wales, very much with his head in the sand, insisted that all concerns had been listened to and met with regard to an all-Wales force: accountability had been dealt with through the proposed regional police board structure, and the issue of financing had been dealt with through the provision of</p>
<a name="60627h0001.htm_brev6"><a name="06062727000475"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a pot of money to deal with the upfront costs of merging&#148;.</p>

 The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) makes a valid point. Many Members from all parties have been active in the past 10 months in asking pertinent questions. We hope that that is one of the reasons for the current delay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000047">The Association of Police Authorities estimates the cost of mergers to be in excess of &#163;525 million, and work done by Dyfed-Powys police authority indicates that the current plans would lead to an annual deficit of about &#163;50 million for an all-Wales force by 2012-13. Those figures mean that a merger will create a financial black hole that can be plugged only by cuts in the service and the loss of uniformed officers or a large increase in council tax, unless the Treasury can deliver a much more attractive offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="60627h0001.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000048">One of the key recommendations in the Welsh Affairs Committee&#146;s report was that the Government should provide further detail and information on how the costs of the merger will be met. I understand that, assuming that police authorities do not cut services, the average police precept would increase by more than 20 per cent., meaning rises of between &#163;15 and &#163;37 on a council tax bill on a band D property. The police levy on council tax has already soared since 1997, and much of it has been wasted on administration and paperwork. Council tax payers in Wales have suffered enough in recent years as a result of the botched revaluation and rebanding exercises. They must not be asked to foot the bill for the creation of an all-Wales police force.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. There is quite a difference between precepts in north and south Wales, which is why north Wales Labour MPs have campaigned hard on the issue. Extra money has gone into policing to deliver extra police on the ground, which is why it is important that there is ring-fencing to ensure that that continues.</p>

Last November, Unison said that 1,000 jobs could be lost, and others have put the figure between 800 and 1,000. That would be catastrophic for the quality of policing in Wales and the safety of our communities. Not one post should be lost as a result of the need to finance the restructuring. I, and I suspect other members, would like reassurance from the Minister on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para2"><a name="06062727000055">There is a very real fear that a merged police force will lead to a reconfiguration of uniformed officers in some parts of the Principality, with the hot spots in south-east Wales having an increase and rural areas a decrease. That concern is heightened by the matter of costs, which we have just discussed. The Secretary of State for Wales said recently that restructuring will not result in any shift of resources away from neighbourhood policing. Will the Minister explain the basis on which such an assurance can be given? Does he feel able to repeat that assurance to allay the fears of my constituents in Pembrokeshire, who regard an all-Wales force as a step backwards in community policing?</p>

It is no wonder that it has been rejected by the North Wales and Dyfed-Powys police authorities and has the support of virtually no Back-Bench Member in Wales, irrespective of party. I doubt whether the project can be rescued successfully, but I look forward to hearing from the Minister how he intends to do so and to his answer to the specific points raised.</p>

The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety is here today and will be looking into the matter. The message that he has already conveyed to us is that he is willing to listen and to take into consideration time scale and cost, as well as the important issue of precept differences, which needs to be resolved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000062">What matters at the end of the day is that we build on the excellent work at local level. Llanelli is one of the most deprived areas in the Dyfed-Powys area, but in recent years there has been a considerable reduction in crime. A lot of work has been done at a local level to deal with crime when it is committed, help citizens to protect themselves better&#151;home safety mechanisms and so forth&#151;and provide programmes that help young people to overcome some of the difficulties that have led them to crime in the first place. In the reorganisation, keeping that local police force is very important. As I understand it, that is the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000065">We are told that there are two main drivers for the change. The first is the inability of a smaller force to deal with terrorism in its modern form. I venture to suggest that that is not a sustainable argument. My argument is that there are several avenues of co-operation between the Met and the West Midlands force, together with other forces, assisting the North Wales and Dyfed-Powys police. We have seen it before. Unfortunately, 15 years ago there were terrorist incidents in Wales. There was a great deal of co-operation throughout the forces. For example, in Holyhead an anti-terrorist branch successfully combated some of the terrorist problems emanating from the troubles in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000066">What has happened with terrorism? Lord Carlile&#146;s recent report says that the smaller ports have scaled down their anti-terrorism protection to a large degree. I wonder why, if there is an immediate terrorist threat, which we have been led to believe is fundamental to the change, the cover of those ports has been scaled down? I also wonder why, if it is such a problem, our friends in Scotland have not bothered to address the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000067">The second reason that we are given for the reorganisation is that forces of fewer than 4,000 officers are unable to deal with organised crime.

Wales and Avon and Somerset. It netted some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK, who were hell- bent on bringing crack cocaine into south Wales, having flooded the market in the Bristol area. They were heavily armed and ready to do whatever was necessary to avoid being apprehended. In large part, they are now behind bars. That was possible because of the excellent understanding between Avon and Somerset, South Wales and Gwent police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000068">For some months, I have been asking for a comment from the previous occupant of the Minister&#146;s post about the success of that operation. We are led to believe that there will be a review of it some time during 2006, well after it was thought that the reorganisation would have gone ahead. I wonder whether that timing should have been brought forward. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000069">There is excellent day-to-day co-operation, both between the south Wales forces and over the border. I know it to be true of Dyfed-Powys and West Mercia. From my experience of dealing with legal matters, I have seen daily liaison between North Wales police, the Cheshire constabulary and the Merseyside force. The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire asked whether we could have more co-operation. Of course that would be a good thing and it should be nurtured, but even now there is excellent swapping of information, even on an hourly basis between these forces. So it is going on. It is not as if suddenly officers have been told that they must start communicating with officers elsewhere. It is happening as I speak, and it has been happening for a long time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000070">Reference has already been made to the manner in which the consultation was mounted. I am afraid that it is a good example of the conceit of consultation by the Government. First of all, they set an unrealistic time scale. That seems to be important. We have seen it before. They set an unrealistic time scale and give a single option to those who are being consulted that paints them into a corner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000071">Secondly, they do not provide the pertinent facts and figures truly to inform the consultation. That has even been confirmed by the hon. Members for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) and for Llanelli (Nia Griffith). We do not really know what the effect will be on the precept. We do not really know how much the reorganisation will cost. I have had answers from Ministers saying various things. So I am in the dark, even now, and more to the point, our local authority leaders are in the dark. We do not know exactly what the financial effects will be. They will drive any efficiency gains and will drive the performance of any force. That is important. The Government keep people relatively in the dark so that they do not have the facts during the consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000072">Then, the all-important one&#151;the Government ignore the results if they are unfavourable. I pray in aid the recent National Offender Management Service consultation in which everyone who responded&#151;I beg your pardon, Mr. Taylor, 96 per cent. of the respondents&#151;including the National Association of Probation Officers, the Prison Officers Association, the police and social services&#151;said, &#147;Do not make these changes, whatever happens&#148;. Yet the Government went ahead with NOMS. That is the ultimate conceit of such consultation.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000075">There has been a partial reprieve, perhaps because the Government are listening to arguments, but for all I know because Cleveland has taken the Government to the High Court for a judicial review of the process. That would have an impact on all forces in England and Wales. I know not what the precise reason is, but I am grateful that we at least have some time to talk at reasonable length. However, we still do not know the basic answers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para19"><a name="06062727000076">I refer to what Geraint Price-Thomas, the chair of the police authorities of Wales, said in a 27 April briefing to Members of Parliament:</p>
<a name="60627h0002.htm_brev3"><a name="06062727000480"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Additionally, we have also stressed the need for clear and definitive information from the Home Office on a number of key issues, namely around finance, funding, precept equalisation, governance and accountability. It was due substantially to a lack of such information that the police authorities were not able to fully consider the issues around the submission of a preferred option at the end of December 2005. Unfortunately, the situation in respect of both timescales and a lack of necessary information continues.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para21"><a name="06062727000078">On the cost of change, he said:</p>

The Home Office has stated that it would meet 100% of the net set-up costs. The exact levels of these costs, however, have yet to be determined between our Welsh project team and the Home Office. Significantly, the estimated cost of protective services submitted by the Wales project team has been reduced by 75% in the Home Office&#146;s assessment of our business case. This is an operational issue of grave concern to the chief constables and ourselves, as it strikes at the fundamental rationale behind restructuring.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000079">He also commented on the funding formula and the sparsity element in funding of Welsh police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000080">Only a few months ago, Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of police gave all four Welsh police forces a glowing report. They had improved in many ways, and they were good previously. During the past 15 years, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales in particular have consistently been in the upper quartile of semi-rural forces in England and Wales.</p>

It may be a volunteer who is involved, but a police contact is available. I went to Whitland not so long ago to see the situation for myself. The police are being as creative as they can about providing services locally, as they should be.</p>

In fact, I have lived in many police stations and I even had a train set in a jail cell at one time. Some people say that I should still be there, but that is another story.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000083">North Wales police have made their points on the restructuring clear. They have canvassed widely throughout north Wales. All six unitary councils that were contacted responded and said that they were strongly against the proposed merger. Four of them said that there would be a loss of services in north Wales. The bottom line is that two thirds of the population of Wales live in the south and the south-east. That must be considered. We are worried that money and other valuable resources will be shifted to what the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire described as the hot spots and that rural and community policing will suffer. I am sure that that is the last thing anyone wants. Four of the councils were concerned about loss of accountability. Three said that the merger was not justified. Three were concerned about the cost. Three were concerned about loss of local knowledge, and three criticised the consultation process. Mention was also made of the threat to community policing and to Welsh language policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000084">North Wales police also wrote to the town and community councils in north Wales. Ninety letters were received: 34 from the western division, 34 from the eastern division and 22 from the central division. Of the 90 letters, 89 were against the merger and one did not express a view. Again, 24 councils gave the cost of restructuring as a reason; 20 referred to the loss of services in north Wales; 14 mentioned the centralisation of resources in south Wales; 14 talked about the threat to community policing; 12 referred to the loss of accountability; and 12 criticised the consultation process. Points were also made about the loss of local knowledge and it was said that the merger was not necessary.</p>

We have heard what the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire said about the Dyfed Powys area. We know that Gwent is very unhappy.

He wrote to the Home Secretary and made telling points. He referred to the geography of Wales and the fact that it is unfortunately very difficult to travel from north to south. He said that there would be huge problems with travelling for a single police authority. In fact, the travelling distance between Holyhead and Cardiff is  <br>

slightly further than that from central London to Preston. That gives an idea of the likely problems. The clerk refers to the council tax equalisation problem and the likely capping criterion of 5 per cent., which will result in the black hole referred to by the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire. The clerk also refers to future funding and the annual deficit of &#163;29.9 million in 2009, rising in 2012 to just over &#163;50 million. We have to ask how that black hole will be filled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para30"><a name="06062727000087">The formula funding also concerns the hon. Gentleman, as do governance and the command structure. I remember asking the previous Home Secretary about the command structure when he made a statement about the matter, and he said that district councils would be the key to the command structure&#151;the basic command unit. Unfortunately, we have not had district councils in Wales for many years, which goes to show that the merger has not taken any of the Welsh concerns into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="60627h0002.htm_para31"><a name="06062727000088">I see that last week the other place passed an amendment that in effect says that the local police authorities will have to sanction any change. No doubt that will come back for further votes in this place, but I believe that it shows the great strength of feeling. In a fortnight from yesterday there will be a meeting with the Home Secretary attended by representatives of all the parliamentary parties in Wales. Clearly, when all parties in Wales come together round the table something is seriously wrong. I am sure that there will be further discussion, and I hope that we will get more information, because I have no doubt that the current situation is unhelpful. Proper decisions cannot be made because of the lack of basic information.</p>

Serious questions remain about the costs and financing of mergers, the impact on council tax, the timescales for transition and the governance arrangements. Opinion polls show overwhelming public opposition, only two police authorities have volunteered to proceed with mergers...and some have initiated legal proceedings to halt the process.&#148;</p>

It is time to consider whether another form of restructuring is possible, and I hope in the coming months that there will be a dialogue with the Minister and his colleagues, as I am sure that there will be. The strength of feeling in Wales is extremely high at the moment. There is a genuine feeling that community policing will go by the board and that the rural police forces, as they were, will be hammered. There is genuine concern that council tax payers will pay huge increases, only to be met at the end of the day with the effects of a &#163;50 million black hole that will mean either incredibly high council tax increases or a cut in services.</p>

Yet it contributes to the tune of &#163;144 million per annum to the Welsh policing budget. Why was it not immediately consulted when points were first raised? I hasten to add that it has been brought into the consultation now, but rather late in the day, considering that the whole thing could have been over&#151;done and dusted&#151;had police authorities not stood their ground in the face of some dubious tactics along the way and helped bring about the latest volte face.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para4"><a name="06062727000095">The Assembly&#146;s Social Justice and Regeneration Committee prepared a report which stated, in effect, that it preferred the status quo, but that if there was to be a change, a decent time frame for discussion and implementation was required. Its conclusions were that the merger process should be halted, that the consultation and time frame were inadequate, that everybody was in the dark on the finance and that regional police authorities might well be a way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000096">It is clear that the Committee was greatly concerned about local accountability. It stated that that was perhaps the essence of the exercise. It asked whether local authorities would be represented on an all-Wales strategic police authority, whether the authority would be restricted to elected representatives, whether the chief constable, the courts, the National Offender Management Service and the Police Federation should also be represented and what the constitution of regional boards should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000097">The Committee was concerned about staff numbers and how the change would impact on community safety officers and so on. It stated that the effect on precepts and on Welsh language policy, and the size and geography of Wales required consideration. Also, it referred to co-terminosity and what it described as the failure of the Home Office to deliver. That was from an all-party Committee with a Labour majority.</p>

If that consent breaks down, policing breaks down. As the Minister will know, 90 per cent. of crimes are solved as a direct result of information from the public. If the public feel alienated from the police, that all-important source of information will dry up and the police&#146;s performance will be severely damaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000107">The delay that the Home Secretary announced last week marked the latest chapter in a long-running farce that has typified the consultation process on policing in Wales. Last year saw story after story of Home Office incompetence, and the proposed merger of the four forces is no exception to that. It is a poor policy that is being hammered through at an impossible pace, after a meaningless consultation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000108">It is interesting that on Thursday&#151;30 June&#151;two by-elections will take place in Blaenau Gwent, and the one thing that unites all the candidates is their opposition to the proposal. They are reflecting the concerns of communities in Wales about what is happening to their policing. Policing is fundamentally important to their quality of life. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) said that things were improving in her community. When we see those improvements, we are determined to ensure that they continue and are not lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000109">The so-called consultation period lasted just under four months. I say &#147;so-called consultation&#148; because one month into it the Secretary of State said that there was only one option for Wales. That does not give people much confidence or enthusiasm about getting involved in the process. If the Government are to show a semblance of collective responsibility, when the Secretary of State says that there is only one option, it has presumably been agreed by the whole Cabinet, particularly the Home Secretary. It beggars belief that the consultation process, with all its expense and burdens on people to contribute and reply to it, and to attend meetings, was happening when it was fairly obvious that the decision had been taken already.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000110">We need to think about the speed proposed for that process. The last reorganisation of the police force, in 1964&#151;I think&#151;took eight years to achieve, but before the inevitable delay announced last week, the Government had planned to complete the process this time within a year, and to appoint a new police authority by the end of August and a chief constable for Wales a month later. In such a rush of activity they did not give people enough confidence that they had suitably considered the best way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000111">That farcical process can only have a negative effect on police officers in Wales. Stability is vital in all walks of life, but particularly in high-risk jobs such as policing. Yet the Government have done nothing to aid stability in police forces. Instead, our police must contend with a whirlwind of Whitehall legislation and a dizzying number of missives, directives and law changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000112">Last week, the chief constable of Dyfed-Powys said:</p>

We will have a 60-mile stretch of countryside without a single police cell in which to hold a potentially dangerous person, and the expense of solicitors travelling long distances to interview their clients. The people in that area in rural Wales are concerned that they are losing the security that they get from the police and the justice system, and that that process will accelerate if the proposal goes ahead.</p>

It showed how police authorities can and will work together when they are given the right encouragement. A lot of crime in mid-Wales is carried out by travelling criminals&#151;not that we do not have our own criminals as well. People come into the area and they think that it is so sparsely populated that their nefarious activities may go undetected. However, there is good co-operation between West Mercia and Dyfed-Powys, between Merseyside, Cheshire and North Wales, and between Somerset and Avon and Gwent.

surrounding the cost of the merger is extraordinary, and is evidence of how badly thought through, and rushed, the policy is. The four chief constables told the Social Justice and Regeneration Committee of the National Assembly for Wales that by 2012, on current Government calculations, a single police force would have an annual deficit of &#163;79 million. Different figures have been mentioned today, but it would be interesting for the Minister to tell us the most up-to-date one. Meeting the deficit that I have mentioned without additional Government funding would mean an extra &#163;71 on the bill of the average band D council tax payer, or 1,800 fewer police officers on the streets. That is the scale of the financial black hole that some police forces and chief constables have predicted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000121">The Home Secretary announced last week that the merger process will be delayed, and that is welcome. However, he gave no detailed estimate of how long the delay would last, or what the new merger timetable would be. Will the Minister provide the Government&#146;s revised timetable?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000122">There is enormous public opposition to the measure. The Welsh Liberal Democrats have conducted street polls in Wrexham, Merthyr, Cardiff, Newport, Maesteg and Llandrindod, all of which have shown overwhelming opposition to the Government&#146;s proposals. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has described how the consultation process produced exactly the same results on the streets of towns and villages in Wales. Many people throughout Wales&#151;myself included&#151;think that the merger will harm community policing, reduce local accountability and leach resources from low-crime areas. In short, it could seriously jeopardise the security of our communities, particularly in rural areas, and the largely excellent records of our four forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para29"><a name="06062727000123">We urge the Minister really to engage on the issue with the people of Wales, with the stakeholders, and with the public. We are determined&#151;as I am sure he is, in his own mind&#151;that the solution we reach should not be the quickest fix but the best system for ensuring that the resources for policing in Wales are used most effectively, that communities in Wales have a level playing field of policing, and that some areas are not left out altogether. I ask him to ensure that the process is complete and not partial, and that the people of Wales get the police service that they so justly deserve.</p>

Thomas of the Welsh Local Government Association, giving evidence to the Welsh Assembly&#146;s Social Justice Committee, described the consultation process as</p>
<a name="60627h0003.htm_brev2"><a name="06062727000486"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the best farce since &#145;Charley&#146;s Aunt&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para31"><a name="06062727000126">As hon. Members have pointed out, the Welsh Affairs Committee criticised the speed with which the process had been conducted. It was always unrealistic to expect that amalgamated forces could be in being by April next year. A pause for thought will be welcomed throughout the country, particularly by the police authorities who were facing impossible challenges in seeking to meet such a deadline. Part of the problem has been not just the speed of the process, but the lack of proper consultation, both with police authorities themselves and with the public who have largely felt shut out and who have expressed considerable concern about amalgamations. I welcome the fact that the Minister is now engaging in talks with Members and with the police authorities concerned, and the constructive nature of those meetings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para32"><a name="06062727000127">My second concern is about the absence of local accountability that would feature in larger forces. The arguments have been put powerfully before, but plainly in a force covering 8,000 square miles and serving 3 million people there is a grave danger that the leadership of policing will be much more remote from the communities that chief officers are meant to respond to and serve. There is also the danger of a democratic deficit, in that the formal representation on police authorities will be considerably diluted if there is a police authority in Wales of 23 members but there are already 22 unitary authorities in Wales, all of which should be represented if they are to have a stake in it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para33"><a name="06062727000128">There is a plainly a serious issue about the extent to which local people have any formal input in the direction of policing in Wales. That has not been sufficiently answered by the claim that neighbourhood policing will be developed or that basic command unit commanders will be responsive to local concerns. BCU commanders are responsible for tactical decisions, not strategic ones. Those will be set by the police authority and the chief constable jointly with the Home Office, which is exercising increasing control in the matter. It is influence over those strategic decisions that the community wants, not just good public relations on the part of their local police commanders or good neighbourhood policing, which they want too.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para34"><a name="06062727000129">The democratic deficit, the absence of local accountability as a result of creating these larger forces, is one of the most powerful reasons why the Government should rethink. Another powerful reason, and my third concern, is the cost. Concerns about that and about the potential impact on neighbourhood policing have been expressed from all sides. The Home Office&#146;s own business case estimates that amalgamating the four forces will cost around &#163;27 million, and any savings that will accrue&#151;which are not quantified but are merely asserted&#151;will take some years to come through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="60627h0003.htm_para35"><a name="06062727000130">There is the additional problem of precept equalisation, which could mean precepts rising by up to 15 per cent. in south Wales, for instance, according to the Association of Police Authorities. The Minister will doubtless have something to say about that.</p>

The Home Secretary said that he had not read the report, but it transpires that he has discussed it with the president of ACPO. I make the point seriously and constructively that the Minister should read the report, which points out that in three years&#146; time, against the background of frozen Home Office budgets, the effect of amalgamations on finance that will already be in short supply will result in serious funding shortfalls for the police, equivalent to 25,000 police officers. In Wales that would amount to 1,350 officers. The fear expressed in the report and shared by police authorities, chief constables and members of the public, not least in Wales, is that the costs that will have to be met directly from existing police budgets against a background of tight finances will mean cuts in neighbourhood policing. Does the Minister think that the figures given in that serious report by ACPO&#146;s head of finance are correct? What proposals does he have to deal with the matter?</p>

The contribution that &#163;500 million of costs will make to that problem could be severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para2"><a name="06062727000134">My fourth concern is that the Government have been reticent in considering alternatives. I hope that in the round of discussions that the Minister is having, he will be more open-minded about the alternative proposed by the APA that the Prime Minister himself seemed to endorse. That is the option of police authorities sharing services, which could yield savings that could be reinvested in protective services much more quickly than could any money through amalgamation, while preserving the local accountability that is so valuable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para3"><a name="06062727000135">The Home Secretary seems to be indicating that strategic forces are still the route that he wishes to take, albeit more slowly. I urge the Minister to consider not strategic forces but strategic capability: how it is possible to organise forces together more sensibly to close the gap, which we all agree must be done. I echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire that there is no dispute that there is a gap in protective services that will require closing. The question is how that can sensibly be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para4"><a name="06062727000136">I emphasise the importance of public consent in the process. The last time decisions of an equivalent scale were taken, back in the 1960s, there was a royal commission and full public discussion, and the process took a number of years. ACPO and the APA have expressed alarm about the general direction of policy as expressed in the Police and Justice Bill and shown by the increasing centralisation of policing.

independence of policing from partisan political interests. It is essential that the local nature of policing is preserved, as it is here that policing has its roots, and that is why local accountability between police authorities and chief constables is crucially important and should not be undermined by greater central control.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000137">Against a background of such increasing central control, developments such as the national policing plan, and the proposal, not yet formally announced in the House, to create a national policing board with the Home Secretary as chairman, concerns about the loss of local independence and accountability are particularly amplified. The Government should have pursued a different agenda, and I hope that the Home Secretary and the Minister will now pursue it. It is one of police reform, of ensuring that the police service is equipped to meet the challenges against the background of much tighter finance in the future, of work force modernisation, of driving forward the process of neighbourhood policing and of meeting the public demand for a visible police presence on the streets. Amalgamations will threaten that agenda and not meet public demand. That is why we have such concerns about amalgamations. I hope that the Minister responds constructively to all the points raised today.</p>

 I join those who congratulated the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb) on securing the debate. I cast no aspersions on hon. Members because of the lack of attendance at the debate, not least because, as has been said, the Committee considering the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Bill is sitting at the same time. Apparently, there are some minor attractions down in Blaenau Gwent, which will also have taken away some of our Welsh colleagues. I do not come to the room and think, &#147;Phew, there are only four hon. Members present; the subject of the debate cannot be much of an issue.&#148; I do not take that view at all.

I shall come later to the substance of the debate. According to my minor bits of research, the hon. Gentleman is clearly a born optimist. Apparently, he joined the Conservative party in 1997, which is almost a definition of optimism. He then became an officer in the Southwark and Bermondsey Conservative association. That is not, by any means, an area where there are rich pickings for Conservatives, so I am glad to see him in his place now as a Welsh Tory. Being a Welsh Tory is still, happily, a minority pursuit. I had to ask a colleague how many there were. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was on his own, but apparently there are three of them, which I am sure makes for good company.</p>

for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), who, having made it, went on to make some rather foolish partisan points, which detracted from our debate, about Blaenau Gwent and about the supposed incompetence of the Home Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000143">It is clear to me&#151;the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) finished his remarks with this point&#151;that there is a serious and detailed debate to be had. I do not think that I will pre-empt where we are going if I say that my view and that of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary remains that the destination should be a strategic force. That is not to throw it down people&#146;s throats, but it is our view. We have delayed things deliberately, in part because of the level of disquiet, but also because a range of issues remain to be answered fairly and because we want what I think everyone wants in the end&#151;to render to Wales the policing and police force that it requires for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000144">I am pleased that most if not all colleagues have not challenged the notion that there are serious gaps at level 2. We are really talking about how they should be filled. It should not be inferred that somehow we are moving to an all-Wales strategic force and then the border will go up, preventing any co-operation between that force and its English counterparts on the other side. To suggest that is rather foolish. I commend the progress, as outlined by Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate of constabulary, by all four forces and their co-operation not only with one another and with immediate border forces but, on specific issues, beyond that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000145">The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire said at the start that this was an important matter, and I agree. He said also, which may be a reasonable criticism of where we have been for the past couple of months, that a proper, detailed and mature debate on policing in Wales for the 21st century should not get lost in administrative and bureaucratic arrangements. We should not be locked into existing arrangements for the sake of it&#151;I cannot remember who said it, but someone said that only a fool would be wedded to those arrangements if they could see that they were not the main way forward. However, in our concerns about moving towards a strategic force, we have lost sight of the debate, the narrative and the argument on the relationship between neighbourhood policing, basic command units, strategic policing and how those elements serve our communities in Wales, as elsewhere. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000146">The hon. Gentleman also agreed that there were a number of theoretical benefits. He was not opposed in principle and said that there was no credit in wedding oneself to certain structures, regardless of reality, and I agree. We have moved on. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said during Home Office questions that he would no longer be seeking to lay any Home Secretary-initiated amalgamation orders before Parliament before the summer recess. He also made it clear that we are still seeking to secure the voluntary merger between Lancashire and Cumbria constabularies, although that has not-dissimilar attendant issues that we are trying to deal with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000147">One minor point: Lancashire and Cumbria were the only two forces that voluntarily declared that they would merge with each other. It is not accurate to say that they were the only two forces that agreed to a voluntary merger&#151;a pedantic point, but that claim is  <br>

simply not true. For some of the others, three of the four forces in an area wanted to merge voluntarily but the fourth did not, whereas in another area two forces wanted to merge but the third did not. It is therefore not true to say that Lancashire and Cumbria were the only two forces in the country that sought voluntary merger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000148">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made his announcement because, in the few weeks that he and I have been in our new posts, we have been engaging with stakeholders and listening to concerns. As with the tone of this debate, time and time again people have said that, whatever the respective merits, there should be discussion about alternatives and more time in which to have those discussions, and we have responded to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000149">If I may make a picky little comment about some of the remarks that we have heard today&#151;rather like what my right hon. Friend said to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs&#151;it is that half the speeches were written as though last Monday&#146;s announcement did not happen. However, I forgive people for that; they have their points to make and that is entirely fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000150">The effect of the announcement is to extend the period for objection, thereby allowing us to work closely with the wider community on developing answers to some of the issues. If we are to have a proper and honest process, I cannot give a definitive response about what that will do to the time scale, because that would pre-empt all that we are seeking to do with that engagement. However, let me say in passing that, as I understand it, if whatever we end up with for each area is significantly different&#151;that is an important phrase&#151;from where we are now, there will have to be a new period of objection, consultation and all those assorted elements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000151">So I can say, with a degree of confidence, that the process is not about either kicking the proposal into the long grass for ever&#151;&#147;Closing the Gap&#148; remains terribly important to level 2 services and other elements&#151;or some sort of flim-flam to get ourselves out of a hole until September or October and then doing exactly what we said we were going to do now. I assure hon. Members that neither scenario is the reality that will prevail, but there is a lot of distance between those two points and that is why I want serious discussion .</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000152">I want those who suggest that a federated model might work in Wales to tell me, in substance and detail, how they think it will work. I want people whose main objection has been to the timetable to tell me what would be a better timetable for Wales. I freely admit that more work remains to be done&#151;although most of it was laid out in the business case, save for the point about protected services. More work needs to be done on finance, council tax precepts and all the other elements. I freely admit that, but that is the work that we are seeking to engage in now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000153">I have already met the four Welsh chief constables and the relevant Minister from the Welsh Assembly to discuss those points. I have also met a group of north Wales Labour MPs&#151;I was going to say &#147;north London&#148;, so apologies for being metro-centric&#151;and I extend the invitation to come and talk to me about the issue in detail to the Liberals, Plaid Cymru and the Tories.

It is not the case that the all-Wales force is the only thing on the agenda because we want in the end to devolve all policing matters to the Welsh Assembly Government. Policing is and should remain a national, UK matter, and as far as I know, it will do so for the foreseeable future. Of course we must engage with the Welsh Assembly Government&#151;as hon. Members have suggested, they have a locus and a stake in the matter&#151;but this is not some elaborate ruse to devolve all such matters to them in the end, and they know that.</p>

Those points are entirely fair, and I am not a million miles away from what the hon. Gentleman said about work force modernisation, police reform and all the other elements that should perhaps be bundled up together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000157">The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire made three fair points about the questions that need to be answered. Is this destination the right one, or are there alternatives? I feel passionately that it is the right direction. There is time and scope to consider that now. He is right about not using it as a breathing space or a hiatus in which we do not think about the matter but hope that it goes away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000158">We need to engage properly. If there are alternatives, we should talk about them. The destination may well be the right one in the end, but to link to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s next point about the pace of reform, some kind of confederation on the way to a potential all-Wales force may be the way to go. I simply do not know, and everyone here gets nervous when people start speculating what the direction might be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para24"><a name="06062727000159">Is the destination the right one? That is an entirely fair point that we need to address now. The pace of reform is also a fair point. Another question is whether the merger will have consequences for policing in Wales which we have not thought through. That was an allusion to financing, policing and governance. There is also the point about council tax precept equalisation. All those points made by the hon. Gentleman were fair. Whether in the Welsh context or the wider context, we must consider them in some detail. However, I do not accept the point&#151;it cannot be right&#151;that all this is about is eradicating all the advances that have been made in policing in Wales and elsewhere at other levels. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para25"><a name="06062727000160">The strategic policing model that we are discussing, rather than undermining neighbourhood policing, will root it far more readily in communities.

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000161">Everyone agrees that community policing and neighbourhood policing are the right way to go and should be our focus. We have found that in our campaign in Blaenau Gwent, and I am sure that, if they were honest, others would say that they find that too. We are not creating strategic police forces to destroy interaction between police and their local communities. Such interaction must be central to all that we seek to do in 21st-century policing in Wales and everywhere else. I repeat that I am serious about discussing such things in detail. Now that we have the time and space, let us talk.</p>

 I demonstrated my credentials just before the debate when I turned off a fast-flowing leaky tap in the gents just down the corridor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000163">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate on the drought order for London. I oppose that order being granted, and the debate gives me the opportunity to explain why. The reason is Thames Water&#146;s poor record of stopping leaks in London and its intention to have a drought order imposed. I was angry that despite the wettest May on record, during which time a hosepipe ban was in place, just days into June Thames Water said that it would apply for a draconian drought order. Such an order would let it restrict water use as it sees fit. At its very worst, residents could be limited to standpipes for their supply. I can see the restrictions starting in August when Parliament is not sitting, so that the matter cannot be raised then, and so I wrote to the Leader of the House demanding a debate ahead of any decision on the drought order. I also wrote to Mr. Speaker, who allowed me this hour-and-a-half debate. I am grateful to him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000164">Thames Water is a privatised monopoly. It has been allowed by the regulator to put up its prices by 24 per cent. on top of inflation, a rise that was supposed to take place between 2005 and 2010. Thames took the opportunity to do that nearly all at once, with a 21 per cent. price rise last year and another 4.3 per cent. rise from April. Its profits have soared, up 31 per cent. to &#163;346 million last year. A &#163;270 million dividend went to its German parent company RWE, which has taken &#163;1 billion in dividends out of Thames Water in its five and a half years of ownership. The <i>Evening Standard </i>reports that RWE&#146;s five-man board got &#163;24 million remuneration last year, with them and other top executives also making multi-million pound share killings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="60627h0004.htm_para29"><a name="06062727000165">RWE bought Thames Water for &#163;4.5 billion five and a half years ago and is looking to sell it for &#163;8 billion, a tidy bit of speculation if it comes off. Despite those riches sloshing around, it failed to stop 894 million litres of water a day leaking from Thames Water&#146;s pipes. That is enough to fill 350 Olympic-size swimming pools every day. Thames Water has failed to meet the target level for leaks set for it by the water regulator for five years running, and despite the targets set last year for leak losses being far too great at 860 million litres a day, Thames Water leaked 894 million litres. To put that into perspective, 2.8 million homes could be supplied by the leaked amount.</p>

Thames Water says that by 2009 it hopes to have replaced 1,000 miles of London&#146;s 3,000 mile, 150-year-old Victorian network But only 135 miles of mains were replaced last year. Thames Water&#146;s excuses, such as blaming London&#146;s clay soil, are feeble. London has always had that type of soil, and certainly did in 2000  <br>

when RWE bought Thames Water. That is a greater reason to get on with the job and install more durable pipes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000179">Even if Thames Water was to meet its Victorian network replacement target, it would still leave another 2,000 miles of leaking pipes, and beyond that, whatever part of London&#146;s other 7,000 miles of mains is faulty. No date has been set to get the whole job done. I note with disgust that the Victorian pipe replacement programme is on hold in my Leyton and Wanstead constituency, as in neighbouring areas such as Walthamstow and parts of Ilford. There are great swathes on hold across the whole of London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000180">As I said, Thames Water is a privatised monopoly, which has been rapacious at its customers&#146; expense since privatisation. The water regulator seems to think that his role as the protector of London&#146;s public interest in its water supply&#151;supposedly his main purpose&#151;is best served by letting Thames be a greedy business. He has got it wrong. He is trying to ride two horses at the same time and I am afraid that they have gone off in different directions. It is time to make the public interest primary. Londoners are beginning to lose faith in him doing that. His relationship with Thames Water is far too cosy. He is too easily conned by the Thames Water argument that what is good for its business is good for the public. That is plainly not so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000181">If the regulator cannot do his job, then London&#146;s public interest protection should be handed over to the London Mayor. He would certainly do it. Londoners will now look at the regulator closely. For a start, he should require that future price rises are restricted. Then he needs to set targets for leak stoppage that are considerably hiked from the current ones. He should fine Thames for such a poor performance, including&#151;there should be legislation if needed&#151;the directors. Any fine should be ring-fenced so as to be reapplied to stopping leaks; they should not just go to the Treasury for general use, as seems likely to be the case at present. Will the Minister pledge that a fine, if imposed, would be ring-fenced? Otherwise the fine is just a punishment and Londoners get punished along with Thames Water. Thames Water now has a credibility gap. This drought order should not be granted, because of the poor water management. If Thames Water cannot do the job, the company should brought back into public ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000182">I understand that an independent public inquiry has to consider the drought order application. Will the Minister explain the arrangements&#151;how, where and when will it take place? How will the public be able to make their representations? Or will he be advising Thames Water to withdraw their drought order application? I hope that that will be the case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000183">There is a strong case for promoting water conservation. If the Government share that view, they should put their money where their mouth is, with tax incentives to consumers&#151;for example, by subsidising water butts for people to use in their own garden or save-a-flush crystals. I am not impressed with &#147;Don&#146;t wash your baby or yourself&#148; exhortations. We have come a long way in improving individual hygiene over the last century and we want no deterioration in public  <br>

The supply pipe is the short section of pipe from the mains to a home and is the customer&#146;s responsibility. A great deal of leakage nationally is located there, although in London it is mainly Thames&#146;s own pipes that leak. That is a point that needs to be picked up nationally. Again I suggest to the Government that letting home owners fix those leaks for which they are responsible is a good purpose for a tax incentive.</p>

However, demand-management measures are not the only issue, as presented by some Ministers, Thames Water and the water regulator. The high level of leaks by the water company has a negative impact on the public&#146;s attitude to sensible water use. The promotion of water efficiency is fatally undermined by the leaks. In the age of global warming and future water shortage, individuals have a responsibility, but the responsibility of leaky Thames Water is even greater.</p>

We want individuals to promote water efficiency, and there are many measures that can be introduced to assist that, but those measures will fail if Thames Water and all the other water companies do not get a grip on the high level of leaks, which are far more damaging. We cannot afford that failure in the age of global warming.</p>

desalinisation plant that is strongly opposed by the London Mayor. I know that such plants can be of great use and that they are important in some third world countries, where they are needed to convert sea water to drinking water, and for agricultural use. The Mayor&#146;s argument, however, is that they are not appropriate here in London. His reason is their high energy use; he talks of the plant pumping out 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, thereby contributing to climate change. Nevertheless, there needs to be investment in future water supplies, so instead he favours effluent re-use.</p>

a number of the leaks. There have been reports of heavy leaks that have not been dealt with for weeks, certainly days, on end. Thames Water should be required to deal with those immediately&#151;on the same day, or the next day&#151;which would be far more effective than imposing a drought order.</p>

In one of the by-elections, an independent candidate is going round turning all the taps on as a protest against Thames Water. That is appalling. I utterly condemn that. However, you will start to get that type of bloody-mindedness if Thames Water does not start dealing with the leaks. The leaks are appalling. The Government need to give a clear message that dealing with them is overwhelmingly the top priority. Not granting this drought order and not making it easy for Thames Water would also reinforce that message.</p>

Does he have&#151;as I do&#151;a constituent who on the one hand, is unable to use his hosepipe and on the other hand, cannot get a leak stopped?

 The hon. Lady makes an excellent point and reinforces the points that I am making about priorities. If the Minister is minded to grant a drought order, there will be incredible annoyance in London. Further, at the public inquiry about which I hope to hear, a lot of Londoners will want to make representations, to hear exactly what Thames&#146;s plan is and to learn what sort of improvements they can expect.

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000205">The hon. Gentleman is a little unfair in citing the wettest May of all time as a reason not to impose the drought order. This is an area of technical expertise far beyond me, but I am conscious of the fact that we have had, over a period dating back to November 2004, some of the lowest groundwater levels since the 1920s and some of the lowest river flows on record. There is clearly a serious drought, but he is exactly right to identify failures of water management as a contributory factor to the response to that&#151;be it a drought order or even a hosepipe ban.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para29"><a name="06062727000206">Thames Water is clearly in a league of its own. Ofwat&#146;s target for Thames Water by 2010 is that it be leaking only 205 litres per property per day. That is 30 litres per property per day more than the worst performance of any other current water company. There are historical reasons for that&#151;the London water infrastructure is in a different state from that in other parts of the country. Nevertheless, the trend does not seem to be in the right direction. Again, from Ofwat&#146;s figures, we can see that Thames Water is leaking 200 million litres per day more than it was leaking in 1999-2000. So six years on, we are in a worse situation. There comes a point where we have to ask whether the current regulatory regime is tackling the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para30"><a name="06062727000207">Since the debate on 13 June, Ofwat issued a statement, on 21 June, which said:</p>
<a name="60627h0005.htm_brev8"><a name="06062727000500"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We view as very serious Thames Water&#146;s significant failure to achieve its leakage target&#148;</p>

It said that the position was unacceptable, but did not say what it intended to do about it, and we await its proposed measures with interest. However, if the regulatory regime has not managed to turn around the position over six years, perhaps we need to start looking at different approaches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="60627h0005.htm_para32"><a name="06062727000209">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the staggering price rises suffered by Thames Water customers, which were 21 per cent. in one year, an average of &#163;44 per property. That is happening in a scenario in which &#163;1 billion of dividends has been taken by RWE over five years and a &#163;24 million remuneration package has been paid to the RWE board. If we look at Thames Water, let alone the parent company, we see that operating profits reported for the past financial year were up 6 per cent., at &#163;385 million. Incredibly, directors&#146; bonuses last year increased from &#163;228,000 to &#163;615,000, with the total remuneration of the four executive directors up 62 per cent., at &#163;1.26 million. If their water leakage record were improving by similar percentages, the residents of London would be much happier. Bill Alexander, the chairman, was paid just under &#163;800,000 and retiring managing director, John Sexton, received &#163;415,000. Those accounts were revealed only three months after the staggering 21 per cent. price rise for Thames Water customers.</p>

 The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point, and I believe that there is room for reviewing the regulatory regime. If primary legislation is required, perhaps we should start considering it. The importance of climate change is twofold. First, as he rightly said, there is the interconnection between water usage and general energy and resource use, which contribute to climate change, but there is also the impact that climate change will have on the situation. It is possible that the drought  <br>

that we are now experiencing is partly the result of climate change and that the situation will get worse as extremes of weather become the norm. He is right to address the interconnection between climate change and water usage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para1"><a name="06062727000218">Clearly, leakage is a key issue. The hon. Gentleman produced the astonishing statistic that the leaked water would be sufficient to supply 2.8 million homes. With proper water management and efficiency, perhaps we would not have to impose hosepipe bans and drought orders at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para2"><a name="06062727000219">Part of the regulatory regime deals with what is called the &#147;economic level of leakage&#148;, which appears to be an acceptable rate of leakage. An Ofwat report states:</p>
<a name="60627h0006.htm_brev1"><a name="06062727000505"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that companies should compare the cost of reducing leakage and the value of the water saved...Operating at the ELL means that the total cost of supplying water is minimised and companies are operating efficiently. By setting leakage targets at an economic level, or a proxy for the economic level where this has not been adequately assessed, helps to ensure best value for customers.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para3"><a name="06062727000220">In fact, it does not. The economic level of leakage indicator as the primary target for water companies is reaching the end of its useful life, as I said in a previous debate. On that occasion, the Minister did not take up my point, but perhaps he will today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para4"><a name="06062727000221">I asked the Minister a question about Thames Water&#146;s failure over time to improve its leakage position. He replied:</p>
<a name="60627h0006.htm_brev2"><a name="06062727000506"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It is Ofwat&#146;s responsibility as the economic regulator to take action, and it has powers under law to do so.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000222">As we have seen, those powers are limited. It cannot, for instance, address issues such as profits and dividends, or redirect money to dealing with water leakages. He continued:</p>
<a name="60627h0006.htm_brev3"><a name="06062727000507"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Those powers are contained in the Water Act 2003, which the Conservatives inexplicably voted against.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000223">I am sure that that will be explained in a moment. He went on:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para7"><a name="06062727000224">Is the Minister able today to give us an update on what action he expects Ofwat to take and whether he will encourage it to take it? As has been said in this debate, there is a growing sense that the existing regulatory regime may not be delivering, and therefore his expectations of Ofwat are crucial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000225">The Minister&#146;s reply was somewhat complacent. How many years can this sort of thing go on? The Government&#146;s position contrasts with their approach in other areas of public service and public utilities. Turnaround teams go into failing NHS trusts. There is great intolerance of financial indicators being missed for more than one year at a time, and extreme action is taken. Such action is devastating my local NHS, which missed financial indicators. In education, special measures are taken for schools that are regarded as failing, and that is right.</p>

years on, Ofwat is running out of tools with which to improve Thames Water. There may be room for new legislation&#151;there certainly is a need for a new approach to the regulatory regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000227">Then there is the broader issue of water efficiency. Thames Water is partly responsible for encouraging it, but it is also a Government responsibility&#151;indeed, it is the responsibility of us all. What steps are being taken to reverse the worsening situation that Water UK has recorded in respect of demand management? It states in its latest report that between 2002-03 and 2003-04 domestic water demand went up from 1.56 litres per pound of gross domestic product to 1.59 litres. In other words, the situation was getting slightly worse. Water demand, both domestic and non-domestic, in litres per person per day rose from 149.1 to 150.3, again a slight worsening of the situation. Overall, demand management is failing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000228">What are we doing to promote dual flush loos, given that 33 per cent. of potable water is flushed down the toilet in this country? Is there a beneficial VAT regime as there is for energy efficient installations? Are there grants comparable to those for the Energy Saving Trust? We discussed that in the last debate. Such things do not seem to be available at the moment. What about sustainable drainage systems?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000229">I have come across a list of recommendations from the Environment Agency that is as long as your arm. It suggests a whole range of measures that could be taken to promote sustainable systems that would encourage the proper drainage of water into the water table rather than out into rivers and the sea. It addresses issues such as the building regulations. The Department for Communities and Local Government is planning an enormous new house building programme, much of it in the south-east. What would the Minister do to encourage it to ensure that those houses will be entirely supported by sustainable drainage systems and not by hard standing that allows water simply to flow into the drains and out into the rivers and the sea?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000230">What are we doing to support rainwater harvesting systems? Is there a beneficial rate of VAT for those as there is for energy-efficient materials? Are there grants comparable to the Energy Saving Trust grants for rainwater harvesting systems? I know that there are not, because I am trying to fit one in my house at the moment and it is extremely expensive&#151;I was about to use unparliamentary language there. The capital costs of these schemes is not huge in the context of a whole house. If it were compulsory in the building regulations and if new house builders had to add that cost into the total building cost of a house it would not be a great burden on them, but it is quite a burden for a household to find that money on a one-off basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000231">I should like to hear what the Government are doing to encourage those rainwater harvesting systems. Again, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, there are grey water systems and even the euphemistically termed black water recycling and reuse systems that could be encouraged more. I should like the Minister to answer all those questions. Then perhaps we will start to get to a situation where drought orders like the one that is being proposed will not be necessary, even when there has been a natural drought and a shortage of water. That will be a service to Thames Water&#146;s customers, to its shareholders and to the environment too.</p>

 London&#146;s climate is changing, and we now have less rain in London than there is in Rome. That is a startling fact. As we all know, the south-east is one of the driest parts of Britain, yet while we are getting less rainfall&#151;something that is reinforced every year&#151;we are also, bizarrely, seeing an increase in flooding. The Thames barrier, which only 15 years ago was expected to be raised once every six years, is raised on average six times every year. Forecasts are that it will continue to be raised more frequently still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000233">Even if Thames Water was ahead of the game, it would still have a huge challenge to meet the problems that London will face in the coming years. Given that the forecasts are so challenging, it is extraordinary that of all the water companies in Great Britain, Thames Water has the most appalling record. To be fair, some water companies are responding well to these arid conditions. Some are efficient and provide a good service for their consumers and investors, but Thames Water is an exemplar of how water companies should not be running our water supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000234">However, Thames Water alone is not responsible for this state of affairs&#151;it is not a company operating in a free market in its purest sense and this is not something in which Government intervention is unknown. It is a company operating within a tightly controlled statutory framework in an extremely regulated environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000235">Since the water companies were first privatised, the Labour party has been in control of that regulatory environment for the majority of the time. It has been in office for nine years&#151;longer than the preceding period during which the water companies were first privatised. Back in 1997, when Labour came to power, it said in its manifesto:</p>
<a name="60627h0006.htm_brev5"><a name="06062727000509"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Labour is determined to see significant improvements in the way the water industry serves local people, contributes to its communities and looks after the environment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000236">I would not disagree with a word of that, and I do not think that anyone who had a hand in the legislation that took the water companies into the private sector anticipated that the framework under which it was privatised would remain carved in stone for ever after&#151;that there would not be some further adjustment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para19"><a name="06062727000237">Certainly since the early 1990s, we have known much more about climate change. We are much more aware of the effects of global warming and the urgent need to respond and change our habits in the face of that if we are to rise to its challenge. Therefore, Thames&#146;s record is totally unacceptable. According to its latest figures, the Thames Water daily leakage rate would cover 18,000 football pitches every day. That is colossal. We know that for three years running it has missed its leakage targets, which in themselves I do not believe to be that stretching or ambitious. I would like it to go further and faster, yet over the past three years the Government seem to have sat back.</p>

Gentleman also asked earlier what the Government are going to do: are they going to send in turnaround teams? It is a misunderstanding of the nature of the industry to say that the Government could or should send in turnaround teams, but they could and should be doing a great deal more.</p>

<p><a name="st_38"><a name="06062727000240"><a name="60627h0006.htm_spnew5"><a name="06062727000577"><b>Martin Horwood:</b>
 The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood. The idea of putting in a turnaround team is quite viable when we consider that some water companies such as Wessex Water and Dwr Cymru have an impressive record of tackling their leakage problems, and therefore they might be able to supply consultants to go in and support Thames Water in tackling its problems more efficiently.</p>

<p><a name="st_39"><a name="06062727000241"><a name="60627h0006.htm_spnew6"><a name="06062727000578"><b>Gregory Barker:</b>
 Yes, but the notion that the turnaround teams are going to be sent in from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or Whitehall is ludicrous. I hope that there will be a case for best practice being shared through the industry, but the water industry is not the NHS. It is not a wholly owned public service in that way, so it is dangerous to embark on inappropriate comparisons and parallels. Certainly there is a need for turnaround, which goes without saying, but it requires a private sector solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000242">During our last debate here a few days ago, I challenged the Minister to tell us what the Government thought of Thames Water&#146;s repair rate. What discussions have the Government had with industry to take an independent view on whether Thames&#146;s repair rate and the excuses that it has consistently proffered for the last three years&#151;if you will excuse the pun, Mr. Taylor&#151;hold water?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="60627h0006.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000243">It seems that the Government have no idea of what industry is capable of. Having sat down with the chief executive of a leading engineering company, I know that many in the private sector think that Thames has been wholly unambitious and could do much more if it embraced the latest technology and new management techniques to run its business more efficiently. But Thames has no incentive to do so if it can passport the dividends that are flowing back to Germany to pay its senior directors so well. Now that they can sell Thames at a significant profit, they also have no incentive to do so if their returns are fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para0"><a name="06062727000253">Ultimately, DEFRA has responsibility for the regulation of the water industry, if it is not being regulated sufficiently or changes are required to the statutory terms of the regulator to encourage more investment. There is concern out there about a mono-focus on price that is to the detriment of long-term investment. The investment that water companies can make is tightly controlled and set by the regulator, but I hear nothing from the Government about their view on whether those bands of investment are adequate to deal with the problem.</p>

Our system of regulation anticipates fines for poor performers, but I see nothing in the overall weighting of fines versus returns to shareholders to indicate that they are a sufficient penalty to encourage Thames to get a grip. The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) is right: after a number of years of taking the money and getting off lightly from the Government, RWE is thinking that it will sell the assets, move on and leave the situation to somebody else, now that the Government are finally waking up from their slumber.

We cannot allow a situation in which someone is unable to pay for water, the most basic commodity for human life. However, metering undoubtedly plays a key role in encouraging more sensible, sustainable consumer use of water. I would therefore like to hear from the Minister where the Government are now, after nine years, in their thinking on metering, particularly in London.</p>

I would also like to hear what the Government think about overall water consumption in London.

street and the Cabinet Office there is the ridiculous farce of totally unsustainable use of water. What on earth is going on in Downing street? Does the Minister not think it incumbent on the Government to set an example?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000259">In closing, I will raise two more points. First, with Thames Water applying for a drought order, I do not share the view of the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead that it should be resisted. The order is a necessary evil. It is very sad that we have got to this situation, but now we are there we have to look for strategic and long-term planning. However, in considering a drought order, has the Minister assessed the impact that this will have on small businesses?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para7"><a name="06062727000260">The Federation of Small Businesses has sought legal advice and believes that about 250,000 workers in 25,000 businesses across the area could be affected by a drought order. What assessment has the Minister made of that impact and of the effect on London tourism, which is worth a huge amount of money to the country?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000261">Finally, is the Minister still absolutely certain that building 120,000 new homes in the Thames Gateway is the right response to yet another summer of drought? Is it right to tell Londoners that they have to save more water, turn off their hosepipes and even face the threat of standpipes, but at the same time to increase overall demand for water by building more housing in the Thames Gateway? We want more housing, but we have to have housing that is sustainable. We have to prove to existing residents that there is enough water to go round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000262">The Minister has a lot on his plate and I look forward to hearing the response.</p>

 It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton, and that of Mr. Taylor. I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) on securing the Adjournment debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000264">Consecutive below-average monthly rainfall for a year and a half, including two dry winters, has brought about a drought situation in large parts of the south-east. May&#146;s rainfall has helped to fill reservoirs, but has not and was not expected to affect groundwater levels significantly. Much of the south-east depends on groundwater. All droughts are different in terms of their duration, severity and extent, but when a drought affects the capital city it inevitably attracts a great deal of attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000265">For the record, London&#146;s water is supplied by four water companies&#151;Thames Water, Sutton and East Surrey Water, Three Valleys Water and Essex and Suffolk Water. Sutton and East Surrey Water was granted drought order powers in May, enabling the company to limit or prohibit non-essential uses of water. The powers are being implemented in those London boroughs supplied by the company. In granting Sutton and East Surrey such powers, I emphasised that I expected the company to use them responsibly and proportionately. I said that I wanted to see the powers used in a way that maximised  <br>

water savings while minimising the economic and social impacts on people and small businesses that relied on water for their livelihood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000266">Yesterday we received an application from Thames Water for a drought order to restrict non-essential uses of water in its London supply zone. That zone includes most London boroughs and parts of surrounding counties, including Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent and Surrey. I wanted to make those points, because the concept of a London drought order is not entirely accurate. Each company supplying London will take the steps that it needs to, according to its drought plan and its water resources position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000267">Clearly, we cannot stop droughts occurring, but we can and do plan for them. We ensure that water companies plan rigorously and thoroughly for drought, although not to the extent that they can meet all demands at all times. That would carry a formidable cost burden for customers and a high price for the environment. Water companies produce both water resources plans and drought plans. Water resources plans look ahead 25 years, with the aim of reconciling anticipated demand with supply. Drought plans balance a water company&#146;s duty to maintain public water supplies with the need to avoid or minimise any potential damage to the environment. They contain various actions that the company can deploy, depending on the length and severity of the drought. Hosepipe bans are the first step to curb non-essential uses of water. When a drought intensifies, companies may seek powers to restrict further water use through drought orders, as we are seeing this year. The ratcheting up of drought measures is designed to avoid supply restrictions at a later date if rainfall continues to be deficient.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000268">I should like to answer as fully as possible all the contributions made in what has been a very interesting debate, but let me tackle the issue of leakage generally before talking about Thames Water. Overall, water companies have made some good progress in reducing leakage from its peak in 1995-96. Leakage rates are down by about 20 per cent., and leakage levels from the pipe network are comparable to the lowest levels achieved in Europe and America. That has been achieved through a combination of mains repair and, where appropriate, mains renewal programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000269">I have said in a previous debate and on other occasions that Thames Water&#146;s leakage levels are unacceptably high. That is still the case, and the Government are very disappointed by the company&#146;s performance. In the first instance, that is a matter for Ofwat, the economic regulator. It has said that it views the matter as very serious and that it will scrutinise carefully the company&#146;s annual return before deciding on regulatory action. As hon. Members know, Ofwat has responsibility for setting leakage targets and has powers to deal with poor performance. It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt Ofwat&#146;s response on that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000270">My hon. Friend referred to profit levels. I have to make the point back to him that, since privatisation, water companies have invested &#163;55 billion in water and sewerage assets. The figure was &#163;3.6 billion in 2004-05 alone. Capital investment on that scale has been possible only because of funds from shareholders and borrowing in the markets. The Government recognise that companies  <br>

have to make a return on their capital&#151;that profits are necessary&#151;but it is for Ofwat, in setting the price limits, to strike a balance between the needs of customers and the needs of investors, and that is what Ofwat does under the statutory obligations imposed on it.</p>

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="06062727000271"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew1"><a name="06062727000585"><b>Gregory Barker:</b>
 Without pre-empting Ofwat&#146;s specific response to Thames, will the Minister tell us whether he believes that Ofwat, in the light of the challenges of climate change and the developments in the industry, is&#151;I am trying to avoid saying it&#151;&#147;fit for purpose&#148;? Does he believe that Ofwat has exactly the right terms of statutory obligation to allow it to regulate the water industry in a way that is appropriate, given the way in which we would like the industry to develop in the 21st century?</p>

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="06062727000272"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew2"><a name="06062727000586"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 Ofwat has substantial statutory powers in this regard, and we expect it to give full and appropriate consideration to Thames missing its leakage targets and to come up with a balanced decision on what should be done. Those powers, including the power to fine a company up to 10 per cent. of turnover, were included in the Water Act 2003. We believe that that was an important measure. It was something that the Opposition party voted against.</p>

<p><a name="st_48"><a name="06062727000273"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew3"><a name="06062727000587"><b>Harry Cohen:</b>
 I note my hon. Friend&#146;s point about shareholders and companies investing those billions. However, they would not be able to do that if not for the price rises. Therefore, I would make the case that, to a large extent, it is Londoners who have put that money in. I want to ask him about the fines&#151;the concern that I expressed in my speech; it must be a matter that will colour Ofwat&#146;s opinion. Will they go directly to the Treasury for general use and not for sorting out the water problems in London? If that is the case, is change envisaged?</p>

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="06062727000274"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew4"><a name="06062727000588"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 I was coming on to that very point. Before I do, let me complete my train of thought on leaks. Ofwat has set targets that require Thames further to reduce its leakage rates by 7.6 per cent. by 2010. It is important to mention that Thames continues to be set demanding leakage targets by the regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000275">As for the powers that Ofwat has in respect of leakage, it can initiate enforcement action under section 18 and progress an enforcement order requiring that specific steps be taken. As my hon. Friend is aware, since 1 April 2005, under the powers of the 2003 Act, it has the power to impose financial penalties of up to 10 per cent. of company turnover. If in future Ofwat wishes to impose financial penalties based on leakage targets, it would have to undertake consultation on the proposal to set leakage targets as standards of performance. As I said, it has the power to initiate enforcement action and progress an enforcement order which would require a company to take specific steps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000276">In the first instance, Ofwat has to make a choice of action. My hon. Friend is right to say that the proceeds of fines are surrendered to the Treasury. However, Ofwat does have that other enforcement action option. For example, it could direct a company to carry out a specified programme of leakage repair or pipe replacement, if necessary, backed by fines. I do not want to pre-empt the decisions that Ofwat, as regulator, will want to take.</p>

 The Minister has spoken comprehensively about the powers of Ofwat. My question was not only about its powers but about its remit. Does he believe that the remit is appropriate and fit for the challenges going forward? Can he tell us something about the remit? The 2003 Act was a gigantic piece of legislation. I cannot recall the detail, but I do not think that we had a particular problem with this aspect of the Bill. The Minister will recall that fluoridation was the most controversial element and the reason why we were unable to support the Bill on Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="06062727000278"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="06062727000590"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 I shall talk about the remit in a moment. First, let me say a few words about climate change and some of the comments made by hon. Members during the debate about that. I emphasise that all companies have to make an assessment of the impact of climate change as part of their 25-year water resources plans. They will continue regularly to update those plans on the basis of different views on climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para19"><a name="06062727000279">Let me just correct my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead in one of the comments that he made about Thames applying for a drought order that could allow for standpipes. That is not the case. A drought order restricts non-essential usage, and it is an emergency drought order application that would allow the use of standpipes. In a modern age, I would not expect any water company to move down the route of standpipes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para20"><a name="06062727000280">My hon. Friend also talked about supply pipe leakage. Water companies already operate schemes to assist with the repair and replacement of consumers&#146; own supply pipes that leak. This makes up a significant proportion&#151;around 30 per cent.&#151;of the total amount of leakage in all water companies. They are already carrying out work in this area. My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) mentioned the prospect of drought orders in the run-up to the Olympics. I emphasise that water companies, including Thames Water, are preparing a 25-year water resources plan. These aim to balance supply and demand and to improve security of supply ready for 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para21"><a name="06062727000281">The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) made a point about tourism, but I see no reason why tourists who want to come to London for the summer should be worried about water supplies. The drought order that Thames is currently applying for should not affect the tourist industry and a clear message should go out to tourists, &#147;Please come to London, have a great summer here and do not worry about the water.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000282">My hon. Friend referred to Thames&#146;s desalination proposal and the issue of effluent re-use. He will be aware that an appeal is currently under way on the desalination proposal, so it would not be appropriate for me to comment. Effluent re-use is a method already used by other water companies, particularly by Essex and Suffolk. The Government are supporting water re-use technologies such as rainwater harvesting, grey water use and the recovery of effluent in appropriate circumstances. The code for sustainable homes will promote the use of alternative water sources. The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) referred   <br>

to that and to tax breaks. The Government&#146;s scheme of enhanced capital allowances providing tax relief for businesses investing in sustainable water technologies including rainwater harvesting is, I believe, an important initiative.</p>

 We are currently considering that issue. The hon. Gentleman also raised a general point about what he seems to see as the failure of water management and the overall regime. This is a point also alluded to by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle. I want to assure everyone that the Government are not complacent in this matter, but we do believe that we have a well-defined regulatory regime with clear responsibilities. We have an economic regulator in Ofwat and an environmental regulator in the Environment Agency. We do not have a command and control structure. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead would perhaps prefer that we did and that we had direct control of the water industry, but that has not been the case since privatisation. That is why the concept of turnaround teams is not appropriate. Thames Water or another water company are independent water companies in a different position from a school or hospital. I hope that the hon. Member for Cheltenham appreciates that difference.</p>

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="06062727000285"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew9"><a name="06062727000593"><b>Martin Horwood:</b>
 I thought that the Minister was in favour of the independence of schools and hospitals. On the regulatory regime, I asked a specific question about whether the concept of economic levels of leakage had reached the end of its useful life as an indicator that was driving the area of target setting. Will he comment on that?</p>

<p><a name="st_55"><a name="06062727000286"><a name="60627h0007.htm_spnew10"><a name="06062727000594"><b>Ian Pearson:</b>
 Economic levels of leakage is a concept that has stood the test of time and is currently adopted by Ofwat. We discussed leakage rates and targets at the water meeting that the Secretary of State and I had with water companies, Ofwat, the Environment Agency, CCWater and others on 1 June. We agreed then that we want to review leakage rates and the leakage process. It is right that we have a look at that given the overall level of public concern, but I would not want the hon. Member to think that we do not think that there is utility in the current system. We believe that looking at costs and benefits to consumers is important and Ofwat has statutory responsibilities to ensure that the consumer receives a fair deal from the water industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000287">I was also questioned on the overall regime more broadly by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle. I emphasise again that under a Labour Government we have moved away from what was an ad hoc planning regime prior to 1997 to a regime whereby companies produce drought plans and 25-year water resource management plans that will be placed on a statutory basis from 1 April 2007. That will give greater opportunities for the Secretary of State and DEFRA to be able to influence plans and it will ensure greater public accountability of the planning system.</p>

 It would be helpful to move on and answer some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions before we run out of time. The hon. Member for Richmond Park referred to discharges of sewage into the Thames. There is an issue with storm water discharges including sewage overflows into the Thames. As she will be aware, a major study by a joint group including Thames Water, the regulators and the Government has looked at solutions including their cost to customers. We are working towards an early decision on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para24"><a name="06062727000290">I will move on to the comments directly raised by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle. First, I will address metering. Recent suggestions in the press that national compulsory water metering is being considered are completely unfounded. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I said at the meeting with the water industry on 1 June, the water savings group is looking at accelerating metering in areas of water stress. Retaining regional variation is essential to any proposals, as are the need for proper public scrutiny and the protection of vulnerable groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para25"><a name="06062727000291">The water savings group, which I chair and which includes representatives of the environmental and economic regulators&#151;the water industry and the Consumer Council for Water&#151;will report further in the summer on its metering proposals for water-stressed areas, and it will do so fully and publicly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000292">The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle on one hand criticises the Government for having a lack of vision and, on the other, says that on balance the overall framework is right. He acknowledged in his quote from the article in the <i>Financial Times</i> that &#163;17 billion of investment is going into the water industry in the period 2005 to 2010. He also said that fines are not sufficient, but I must point out that he voted against the Water Act 2003, which introduced the system of fines to give that option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="60627h0007.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000293">The hon. Gentleman said that there are no incentives in the system for Thames Water or others to run their businesses efficiently, but I cannot see how he can say that and then say that on balance the overall framework is right. The price cap regime provides strong incentives to companies to improve their efficiency, as does shareholder pressure. As I said to him when we last debated the issue, if expertise from other sectors can usefully be applied to the water industry we are certainly prepared to examine it and encourage the dissemination of new technologies to the industry.</p>

He also raised the issue of reservoirs. The Government have a twin-track approach to water supply, which requires demand-side management options, such as helping to encourage behavioural change, alongside the use of new technologies to control leakage. Such options need to be fully deployed before new supply measures are adopted, because new and enlarged reservoirs are potentially costly and have long lead times. There are proposals in the industry&#146;s 25-year water resources plans for five new and three extended reservoirs. Four of the new reservoirs are planned for the south-east. The 25-year plan is rightly  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para1"><a name="06062727000295">I shall finish by outlining the process for the Thames Water drought order application, as my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead asked me to do. The statutory process requires the company to advertise its proposals in the area in which the restrictions would apply. People will have seven days from the date of advertisement to object to the Secretary of State, which they may do by e-mail or letter. From his speech, it is clear that when he sees the advertisements he will know what to do.</p>

The inspector will examine whether the legal criteria have been met, which is a prerequisite for recommending that a drought order should be made. In addition to the objections made, the hearing will address other issues, such as whether the best use has been made of the resources available to the company, both service and groundwater, and the matter of leakage. The inspector will produce a report with recommendations, which will be considered by my officials. It will then be up to the Government to make a decision.</p>

She is 75 per cent. Mediterranean and 25 per cent. English. Her mother was Greek, so she gets 50 per cent. of her background from Greece, and her father was 50 per cent. Italian and 50 per cent. English. It has been extremely difficult to find suitable bone marrow to match her heritage. Indeed, it has sadly proved impossible thus far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000301">When the Crizzle family was advised in January this year that it was unlikely that a suitable bone marrow donor would be found, Jeanette&#146;s husband, Adam, decided to give up his job not only to care for her but to launch an international campaign to try to find a suitable donor. The purpose of today&#146;s debate is not only to highlight the unusual plight that Jeanette finds herself in, given her unusual background, but to praise Adam for the tremendous campaign that he has launched and to prompt the Government to take further action to try to encourage wider bone marrow donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000302">Adam gave up his job and launched an international campaign, starting with e-mails and internet activity among his friends and acquaintances. The school where Jeanette worked, Bedford preparatory school, has swung in behind the campaign, as has the Anthony Nolan Trust. Mobile clinics have been established in Bedford, Kettering and elsewhere to try to encourage people of Mediterranean origin to become bone marrow donors. An extensive media campaign has been launched that has achieved terrific coverage, not only in the regional media but further afield. Initiatives included publicity on London&#146;s Greek radio and trying to tap into communities in Greece, Italy, the United States and Australia, all in a search to find a suitable donor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para7"><a name="06062727000303">It has been a remarkable effort, reflecting Adam&#146;s positive philosophy on the dilemma in which he and his family have found themselves. To quote from one of the many e-mails that he has launched as part of his campaign:</p>
<a name="60627h0008.htm_brev0"><a name="06062727000514"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I have had a few people contact me to ask if I would join them in a demonstration with placards outside No. 10 Downing Street, to highlight the lack of funding and support for cancer research in general. Having reflected upon this suggestion, I found the words of Marcus Aurelius coming into my mind: &#145;How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.&#146;</p>

<a name="60627h0008.htm_brev1"><a name="06062727000515"><ul><p class="tabletext">Even though I sincerely appreciate the sentiment of people wanting to highlight this cause, I would prefer another approach. Ultimately, I believe that the way forward for a campaign of this nature is not through protest but by debating in a courteous and effective manner.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000304">That is the tremendously impressive and positive approach that has coloured Adam&#146;s campaign throughout.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000305">The highlight of the campaign so far has been a meeting with the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), on 19 April, which was held at the Department. At that meeting, Adam was able to present a report to encourage the Government to undertake an initiative to promote the benefits of bone marrow donation among 16 to 18-year-olds. I am pleased that the Department has decided to take up that initiative and I praise the Department and the Minister for so doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000306">The Government&#146;s positive response was confirmed in a letter from the Minister to me on 12 May, and on 8 June Adam Crizzle was invited to an important meeting with NHS Blood and Transplant to plan the details of how such an education initiative could be launched. I understand that an educational pack&#151;with a website alternative&#151;is to be launched in September 2007, which will be targeted particularly at sixth formers.</p>

<p><a name="st_60"><a name="06062727000307"><a name="60627h0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="06062727000599"><b>Mr. Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b>
 I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate; I also attended the meeting with the Minister. On the point about education, does he agree that because of the difficulty in filling donor places in the Asian community, it would be good to concentrate initially on areas where there are ethnic minorities?</p>

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="06062727000308"><a name="60627h0008.htm_spnew3"><a name="06062727000600"><b>Mr. Hollobone:</b>
 I am grateful for that intervention and I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s attendance at the meeting in the Department. I share his concern that there are too few donors from ethnic minority communities. There is also a wider issue, which is that there are too few donors, full stop, from any community. I shall develop that point later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000309">An important part of any debate about bone marrow donation is the general misconception among the population about how easy it is to become a bone marrow donor. Since Jeanette was diagnosed with myeloid leukaemia in October 2005, it has become obvious to Adam that there is a terrible misunderstanding of what is involved in being such a donor. Most people assume that being a donor involves a major operation, and that is one of the chief reasons why people are not offering themselves as donors, and why the suffering of so many cancer patients continues. One of the main purposes of Adam&#146;s campaign is to change people&#146;s conceptions of how difficult it is to be a donor. Initially, donors have to give only a 4 ml blood sample. After that, there are two methods of bone marrow donation: the traditional bone marrow harvest and the newer, increasingly used, peripheral blood stem cell donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000310">The former is a medical procedure that involves a hospital stay and a general anaesthetic. The newer method provides an alternative collection that many donors find simpler. The donor has some injections in the week before donation, to encourage blood stem cells to move from the bone marrow&#151;where they are  <br>

first created&#151;out to the circulating bloodstream. They are then collected on a blood separator machine in a collection lasting for up to five hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000311">Mr. Mark Satchell, a UK donor in June 2004, recently said:</p>
<a name="60627h0008.htm_brev2"><a name="06062727000516"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;There&#146;s not much to say about the actual process except how easy it was. It was really no different to giving blood, except it lasted for four hours&#151;but there was no discomfort or pain. To anyone thinking of becoming a donor, who may be put off by the thought of the procedures you need to go through, I would say it&#146;s much easier than you would believe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000312">If the general UK population understood that point, far more people would come forward to be donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000313">That was confirmed by an exercise conducted at a school in Bedford by Mike Mallalieu, the head of science, who undertook a presentation and two questionnaires for sixth-formers in the school. Before the exercise, the first questionnaire found that 25 per cent. were prepared to be a donor, and 65 per cent. were not sure. After the presentation, when it was made clear how easy it is, 89 per cent. said that they were prepared to be bone marrow donors, and only 3 per cent. were not sure. Those findings so impressed the Department of Health that it has decided to take up Adam&#146;s initiative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000314">There are 9 million bone marrow donors on registers worldwide, and their details can be accessed through Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide. However, in the UK there are only 371,000 donors on the Anthony Nolan Trust register, and 2.1 million blood donors on the NHS blood and transplant and British bone marrow registers. During the last three years, however, there has been an increase of only 100,000 blood donors coming forward to be bone marrow donors as well. I am one of those: last month I signed on to the British bone marrow register at my regular blood donation session.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000315">The problem is that a person cannot become a bone marrow donor on the Anthony Nolan Trust register if they are over 40, or on the British bone marrow register if over 44. I would like urgent attempts to be made to raise those age limits, because I think that hundreds of thousands of people over the age of 40 or 44 in this country would come forward to be donors if they understood how easy it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000316">Of course most people on the register are never required actually to donate their bone marrow. For example, of the 371,000 on the Anthony Nolan Trust register, only about 300 a year are called on to be donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para19"><a name="06062727000317">My hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) made an excellent point. In this country, most donors are white and caucasian. There is a particular lack of donors coming forward from mixed-heritage backgrounds, and Jeanette&#146;s case sadly illustrates that. Any efforts that can be made to encourage donors from ethnic minority communities would be welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para20"><a name="06062727000318">We must not lose sight of the fact, however, that there are not enough bone marrow donors, full stop. Indeed, on the British bone marrow register, there are 273,000 donors, which is only 1.2 per cent. of the 22.5 million people in this country aged between 18  and 44.</p>

My fundamental point is that the Government need to get across how easy it is to donate bone marrow, and if they can do that, hundreds of thousands more people will come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000320">I know that Adam would want me to use this debate to thank the many people who have helped his campaign and offered assistance to Jeanette, not least those at Kettering general hospital and other health practitioners; the Anthony Nolan trust; the Leukaemia Society; Chris Godwin, the head teacher at Bedford preparatory school; Mike Mallalieu, the head of science at Bedford high school; the shadow Minister for health, my hon.

 I congratulate the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) on securing the debate and welcome the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone). They both attended a meeting earlier this year with the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), to discuss awareness of the need for donors of bone marrow and what is involved, which was covered by the hon. Member for Kettering. That is an important part of how we can encourage an increasing number of people to come forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para24"><a name="06062727000323">I shall talk later about the opportunity presented by the work that is being undertaken with the valuable input from Mr. Crizzle in respect of a school pack aimed at 16 to 18-year-olds, which will deal with bone narrow donation and the range of possibilities whereby young people, as they become adults, can perhaps regard that as part of their citizenship and that of their families and communities. One thing for sure is that none of us know when we or our families will need a donation of some sort, whether in relation to bone marrow, blood or organs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para25"><a name="06062727000324">Over the past few years, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central has contributed greatly to raising the awareness of such issues and the ways that health professionals can broach them with their patients, as well as how we can get the message across more widely. It is important to use multi-media opportunities, an area that we need to know more about. The issue is particularly important, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Kettering, for people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. We live in a more diverse society and our blood is a mix of all sorts of genetic heritages and international links in one way or another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000325">The British Bone Marrow Registry is managed by NHS Blood and Transplant. It also operates on behalf of blood services in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Furthermore, I am talking about what we must do not nationally, but internationally. We must raise consciousness in other countries through Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide, an internet-based organisation with more than 10 million registered potential donors. I am pleased to say that we are one of the largest contributors to that internet registry of opportunities for people to receive donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000326">The BBMR contains details of potential stem cell donors and donors of stored cord blood units. It recruits stem cell donors from active blood donors between the ages of 18 and 44. I shall touch again on the point raised by the hon. Gentleman about the age thresholds within the area. Cord blood units are collected from the placenta of new-born babies in National Blood Service partner hospitals. The NHS cord blood bank, which is run by NHSBT, was established in Edgware in 1996. It is one of 10 internationally accredited cord blood banks to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000327">I understand that 122 cord blood units have been issued for transplantation. Some 37 per cent. of cord blood units issued came from BME donors, and 44 per cent. of the patients receiving cord blood came from BME communities. That shows how science gives us another opportunity to supply demand in areas in which, 10 to 20 years ago, the chances of success using that sort of donation were not as great as they are today, with advances in technology and skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para29"><a name="06062727000328">The BBMR works closely with other registers, including the Anthony Nolan Trust and the Welsh Bone Marrow Donor Registry. They can make reciprocal arrangements when seeking matches, which is important in terms of what is happening in our island and around the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para30"><a name="06062727000329">The BBMR is directly funded by a grant from the Department of Health. During the past three years, it has received &#163;10 million in revenue to fund the addition of 120,000 potential stem cell donors to the registry. At least 4,500 of those donors come from black or minority ethnic communities. Funding for 2006-07 has recently been agreed, and &#163;1.82 million in revenue has been allocated to support the register and increase donations from BME donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para31"><a name="06062727000330">As a result of Government funding, the BBMR has one of the best-quality registries in the world, although that is not to say that more cannot be done. We must examine how and where we need to increase donor numbers, particularly from communities that are not as well represented as they should be. At the same time, it is fair to recognise the achievements that have been made, and the fact that our register has such a high and internationally trusted reputation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para32"><a name="06062727000331">Two primary concerns guide the BBMR&#146;s strategy. The view at a recent World Marrow Donor Association meeting was that the majority of non-BME patients may find some type of donor, as there are several valid ways to make transplants more widely available. However, a higher proportion of BME patients and patients of mixed race have less chance of finding a perfect match. In this diverse world in which diverse families live, we need to address that. As the BBMR grows, the chance of a newly recruited donor adding a new phenotype or individual characteristic to the registry falls. The more that we can do to increase take-up, the more opportunities there will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para33"><a name="06062727000332">Mr. Crizzle&#146;s report on the availability of bone marrow donors for UK leukaemia sufferers of Mediterranean origin was important, because it rightly focused on the need to recruit more donors to the UK registries&#151;the Anthony Nolan Trust, the BBMR and the Welsh Bone Marrow Donor Registry. He concluded, and we agree, that that can best be done by raising awareness of bone marrow donation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para34"><a name="06062727000333">We can make more treatment available and put more money into cancer research, but if we do not have the donations, which are the complementary part of the process, in some respects it will not matter how much we have in those areas. We need that important part of the jigsaw.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para35"><a name="06062727000334">Experience tells us that raising awareness increases take-up. Analysis shows that the register has recruited 8 per cent. of active blood donors to join the BBMR in the past three years, and the BBMR represents more than 20 per cent. of our active blood donor base. That is quite important, because it was felt that if we could get people to donate blood, the next step&#151;this follows on from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s example from his own experience&#151;would be for them to explore the opportunities of making even more of a contribution to their fellow citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para36"><a name="06062727000335">For that reason, NHSBT deliberately recruits to the BBMR from the active blood donor base. Because donors are already fully screened and have made a commitment to give blood, they are more likely to donate bone marrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para37"><a name="06062727000336">During the calendar year 2005, 195 donors were matched to patients. Of those matches, 166 went ahead, 10 donors were deferred for medical reasons, five withdrew and 14 were cancelled for patient reasons. However, we need to focus on recruiting people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and to expand the number of phenotypes present on the BBMR. Awareness, education and working directly with those involved are part of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para38"><a name="06062727000337">A point was made about age limits. Although donors will remain on the BBMR until the age of 60, clinical evidence from the national marrow donor programme shows that the best outcomes are achieved using male bone marrow donors between the ages of 25 and 40. Although the BBMR&#146;s policy is to accept anyone who is eligible to join the register, it is considering how to use that evidence to target specific groups of donors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="60627h0008.htm_para39"><a name="06062727000338">I understand that discussions are taking place between the UK bone marrow registries on the possibility of raising the age at which bone marrow donors can be recruited. Consensus between the registries has not yet been reached, but NHSBT continues to look at that area. Given where we are, it is important to target and focus where we can.</p>

It also works closely with other organisations to increase donations from black and minority ethnic groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para1"><a name="06062727000340">As part of the &#147;One Blood&#148; campaign, working with organisations such as the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust has produced good results. Through the scheme under section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968, the Department of Health makes funding available to the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust. I understand that in 2005-06 it organised 43 clinics and registered nearly 4,000 people with the Anthony Nolan Trust and the BBMR. That shows that our involvement with voluntary organisations is helpful, because often they have more reach, particularly if there are faith or cultural issues to overcome or, as the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, misconceptions about what bone marrow donation means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para2"><a name="06062727000341">We are looking forward to how we can develop the concept of the education pack. Work is going on to develop the pack, and Adam Crizzle is involved in that process, for which we are thankful. It is hoped that in 2007&#151;probably in September, the start of the academic year&#151;the pack will be launched. In the meantime, it will be developing and we will be thinking about ways in which we may be able to use some of the information that we have learned from the process. We may want to consider ways in which we can reach young people, particularly in other environments that they might be tuned into, to take the pack further and not have it just as a school-based policy.</p>

 Can the Minister help on this point? The Government have just passed regulations relating to transplants. Unfortunately, the issue of bone marrow has been caught up in those regulations, which means that anyone under 18 who wants to donate bone marrow must now be approved by a separate registrar, which is a hurdle. Will she consider that point?</p>

 I am happy to look at the point further and to write to the hon. Gentleman; I know that there are issues in terms of donations. I do not know whether this issue is appropriate in this case, but there are concerns about the question of adults as opposed to children and limited capacity in terms of donations being taken from them.</p>

I pay credit to the fact that, in that difficult situation, the family has taken the opportunity to be positive and constructive about what they can contribute to ensure that, for Jeanette and others, there are more possibilities of donation in the future. They should be very proud of that.</p>

 My constituency is not altogether unique, although I believe firmly that it is the centre of the universe. It contains two major towns that are both linked and divided by their history. There is nothing quite as short as the collective memory of the people of the United Kingdom, but it is useful, when thinking about the problems of employment, to look back and see where we came from.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para4"><a name="06062727000346">Crewe, for example, exists entirely because of the economic and political demands of the early 1800s and the railway industry. The developments of the not only turbulent but energetic Victorian engineers meant that the expansion of the railway required not only depots but provisions and a work force. At that time we manufactured our own trains; would that we returned to that in the present century, but that is another story for another day. However, Crewe was built between the early 1830s and the early 1890s precisely to provide a work force, a set of skills and a set of provisions for a burgeoning industrial situation. Indeed, large numbers of people in my constituency at that time would have been Liverpudlians, attracted by the wages and permanency of a job in the railway industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000347">Nantwich, on the other hand, although it considers itself distinctly a cut above Crewe, owes its existence to a different industrial scheme. It provided salt, originally to the Roman army and probably to work forces across the county even before that. In other words, the United Kingdom has developed largely because of the economic demands of its population and the geographical results of that pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000348">When we consider employment, particularly the attraction of the United Kingdom for overseas workers, we sometimes forget that such migration has been going on not for years but for centuries. I suspect that the reason my hon. Friend the Minister does not have&#151;if he will forgive my saying so&#151;a southern English accent is that, like my parents and grandparents, he was attracted to the south-east of England largely out of political and economic necessity. That continues to this day. However, I have become increasingly concerned about the safeguards that are in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para7"><a name="06062727000349">In the 21st century, the United Kingdom ought routinely to be able to protect its work force, particularly under a Labour Government, even a new Labour Government. We ought to be able to point to rules that can be defended in any court in the land as providing equity of treatment and safety in the workplace. Yet it has become increasingly clear, even in a stable backwater&#151;whoops, wrong word&#151;such as Crewe, that we still have the capacity to attract an entire work force who, on the face of it, have little in common with Cheshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000350">In the past five years, we have incorporated within our numbers large groups of workers from eastern Europe. Those groups are largely Polish workers, but there are also people from other eastern European countries. Those workers are from a variety of professions and have a variety of skills. I have mentioned before my horror when I discovered that we had a neurosurgeon working in a yoghurt factory which has difficulty finding a full work force because many of my constituents do  <br>

not particularly want to work there. It is a non-unionised establishment, which is not exactly indicative of the very best of what British industry can offer its workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000351">I have had occasion in the past five years to notice not only the silent growth of the eastern European work force but the way in which they have been exploited. I have raised the matter in the House before because I was enormously concerned about not just the influx of workers who were facing real social problems but the behaviour of employment agencies in my constituency. At the risk of being boring and going over the same territory again, I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that employment agencies are growing fat in this land. In a society that thinks it can cheerfully move from having stable work forces to contracting out, employing temporary workers and attracting anybody who wants to come in and do the job without a long-term or permanent guarantee of protection, the middleman&#151;it is always a middle man&#151;will inevitably begin not only to supply workers but to dictate the terms and conditions under which they work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000352">I became concerned about the matter because as soon as a nation entered the European Union, agencies would quite legitimately go into an area to advertise for workers, making it clear that, in their view, there was a constant stream of employment, and thus attracting large numbers of people to Cheshire. There is nothing wrong with that, so long as the terms and conditions associated with the work that has attracted those workers are spelled out for them and the workers are at least guaranteed some equality of treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000353">What is the point of a society that insists on fair treatment and equal pay&#151;at long last, dear Lord, it is accepted that we should have a minimum wage, which is something that I have long waited for&#151;yet which manages, by avoiding many of our legal qualifications, to pay some people under the rates that are acceptable for everybody else? What is the point of a society that manages frequently to exploit&#151;I use the word advisedly&#151;the work force it has attracted?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000354">I hardly need point out to my colleague the Minister that one easy way in which employment agencies can get round many of our laws is to declare that their workers are self-employed. That is an absolute abuse. Agencies advertise for people, bring them in, get them to sign contracts&#151;now in the language of their origin, thanks to a grant from Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#151;charge them for transport, put them into their own property, much of which is overcrowded, dictate to them what work is available, provide the transport to take them to that work, bring them back if no work is available and manage to charge them for those services at rates that leave many of them virtually penniless at the end of the week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000355">Those agencies are, quite legitimately, waxing wealthy. One can see large numbers of people waiting outside their doors at the end of the week for some kind of settlement and know that they continue to encourage people to come not just to Cheshire but to the United Kingdom generally, because of the way our work laws are being interpreted. One also knows from the refusal&#151;it is a genuine refusal&#151;to allow the trade unions to get into contact with many such workers that the conditions under which the workers are employed are not those that most of us would find acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000356">There has been a targeted effort in my constituency to recruit a lot of foreign workers, but it is extremely difficult to get in touch with those who have sufficient command of the English language, and the problems that have been experienced in recruitment have been greater than with a normal work force. There is a growing feeling that our employment laws are being at best exploited, if not broken, that the protection offered to such workers is minimal and that local authorities are increasingly faced with problems, but also that only in some cases are Her Majesty&#146;s Government taking active measures to assist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000357">The first thing that happens is that a local authority finds itself with the social problems associated with large numbers of workers, many of whom do not speak the language or understand what is available for them. Social services have then had problems involving migrant groups that have occasionally been reported for difficulties with small children and which, when inspected, have been found to be living in extraordinary conditions that are not conducive to a good home life. The numbers have grown in my constituency. I hesitate to point that out, because one London Member to whom I said that I thought I had well over 3,000 people pointed out that he thought he had nearly 30,000 people of different nationalities, which is rather a different size of problem. To me, however, it does not matter whether it is one worker or 30 workers being exploited; I have a responsibility to ensure that the situation is changed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000358">Crewe and Nantwich has responded well. It has not only designated individual officers, but done its best to deal with some of the social problems. However, the problems are now becoming bigger&#151;there are problems of accommodation, language and inclusion in schools. In a county that is eternally seeking to shut down its primary and secondary schools on the assumption that we have fewer children, it is bizarre suddenly to find an influx of Polish children completely changing the numbers in a school almost overnight. All the careful planning and commitment of, in many cases, fraught negotiations between the local education authority and the parents are thrown completely to the winds when a large group of immigrant children appear out of the blue and need to be not only accommodated but integrated into the school stream, putting considerable pressure on the teachers concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000359">Today I want specifically to follow up the points I raised in my original Adjournment debate. I recently questioned my good friend, my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke), who has recently been in the news as a most vocal and intelligent contributor to the discussion of our political future. When I asked him what was happening between the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions about employment agencies and their recruitment policies, he said it was an urgent need that had to be addressed and:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para20"><a name="06062727000362">I have a series of short and, I am sure, simple and easily answered questions for my hon. Friend the Minister. If it is true that at present migrant workers comprise at least 10 per cent. of the UK&#146;s work force, and the Health and Safety Commission has set up, so far as I can see, five work streams to look at the evidence that is available, the numbers and the way in which people are being treated&#151;so there is research and analysis, an action programme, a multi-agency joint enforcement pilot, work with the local authorities and the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004&#151;that is admirable, but I want to know what is happening. It is all very well having these working parties, but what are they doing to report back to the Government? How much joint working is there? Where is it happening and what are the results?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para21"><a name="06062727000363">I am told that the particular joint workplace enforcement pilot mentioned in my previous Adjournment debate by the Minister concerned, was set up, operated for a fortnight and was then&#151;I use this phrase advisedly&#151;stood down temporarily. How long is a temporary stand down? What does it mean? Who is involved in that decision and why? If there is some point in getting Departments to work together&#151;and I am sure there is&#151;then why on earth, having set up something that looked as though it was going to come up with some answers, have we allowed it to be temporarily pushed into recess?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000364">Just as important is the fact that the Government&#146;s interest in these issues must include illegal and migrant working, because both of those are relevant. How many such workers are there here? Which of them are legal or illegal? To what extent are we getting accurate information from the various sectors concerned? Because of the appalling deaths of the young Chinese workers in Morecambe bay, agriculture and the food sector received a degree of inspection that they more than warranted, but they are not the only sectors that need to be investigated. What is happening in the health sector in a country that is encouraging large amounts of private health care? Many people working in that sector are low paid and inadequately trained, and increasingly they are foreign workers. This is almost inevitable, but what controls are there over their background, their training, their essential health, safety and welfare information and their ability to talk to the people they are supposedly looking after?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000365">We know that there are large numbers of foreign workers in construction. One only has to go into my local supermarket to discover that whatever the language is that is spoken at the tills, it is not even the idiosyncratic English of south London. The construction groups which are making an effort to communicate basic principles of construction health and safety, targeting Polish and Turkish workers, ought to be asked to increase that work. They should also be asked whether their actions have been successful and how far they cover the work force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para24"><a name="06062727000366">I could happily go on, but the multi-agency joint enforcement pilot is an example of the sort of things that should concern us. Perhaps the Minister will tell us today what the Government really want to do. If we are to continue to attract workers, we have a responsibility for them. We also have a responsibility to our own work force. We have a responsibility to our local authorities and to the people of this country to explain how our views of the economy are governed by our constant need to attract those people who previously came only from other parts of the United Kingdom, but who now come from all over the world. I hope that we will do that on a balanced, sensible and responsible basis and I want the Government to assure me of that today.</p>

 It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Caton, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) on securing the debate. As she said, she had a similar debate on employment agencies 364 days ago. She raised a number of issues then, which the Department has or is about to address, and I will update her on aspects of that in a moment. I took the opportunity to read that speech this morning and I hope I can reassure her about some of the progress, giving due acknowledgement to the seriousness of the matter. If we have further information and if I do not respond to all her points, I will write to her. However, I hope that I can cover most of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para25"><a name="06062727000368">I start by stating clearly that the Government condemn any abuse or mistreatment of workers, whether UK nationals or migrant workers. We take very seriously such issues, and have and will mobilise the resources of the various enforcement agencies that have been established to tackle such illegal practices. I will say a little more about the enforcement agencies later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000369">I want to make it clear that the Government are keen to ensure that all workers, including agency temporary workers, have appropriate protections. We aim to do that by effective implementation and enforcement of the existing legislation and rights for the benefit of workers and companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000370">We set out our plans in more detail&#151;in particular, our intention to do more to protect vulnerable workers, crack down on the rogues and support good employers&#151;in our recently published policy paper &#147;Success at Work&#148;, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. However, it is important to remember that agency workers in the UK are already protected by specific legislation governing agency work and also share a number of key employment rights with permanent employees. All are covered by the national minimum wage, working time and health and safety legislation, and social security provisions such as maternity and sick pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000371">In the UK, the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and associated regulations set the standards for the conduct of the industry. The current regulations came into force in April 2004 and include updated versions of pre-existing requirements and new protections, appropriate for today&#146;s flexible recruitment market.</p>

We aim to do that so that the vast majority of agencies, which comply with their legal and moral requirements and would not dream of undertaking such practices, are not adversely affected. We want to target practices pursued by the rogue element of the industry, not the normal conduct of reputable agencies, so we will consult with a wide range of stakeholders to produce a package of proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para31"><a name="06062727000376">We propose action in five key areas. We are aware that some agencies mistreat workers in effect by making it a condition of offering them work that they pay for additional services such as accommodation and transport, often at exorbitant rates. Some agencies try to evade existing controls by providing services through associated companies in which they have a financial interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para32"><a name="06062727000377">It is already an offence to make an offer of a job conditional on a worker paying for other services. However, we have promised to consider whether we should strengthen that by including a right of withdrawal, subject to an appropriate notice period, from any service after a work seeker has taken a job. We will also explore whether it would be possible to deal with associated companies without making it impossible for legitimate agencies to offer the option of services that we know workers value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para33"><a name="06062727000378">We also want to tackle cases in which vulnerable workers, especially those from overseas, are given loans to help them to take up temporary employment, with repayments at high levels of interest, which are deducted from their wages without the workers&#146; consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para34"><a name="06062727000379">We already require that in the case of a loan provided by a UK agency to a work seeker to enable him or her to take up a position with a hirer, the work seeker cannot be required to repay a greater sum than the money loaned. While we are unable to control situations in which a work seeker takes loans at high levels of interest outside the UK, we will consider whether we could strengthen existing legislation&#151;for example, by preventing loan repayments from being deducted from wages by a UK agency without the express consent of the work seeker.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="60627h0009.htm_para35"><a name="06062727000380">We have noticed cases of heavy goods vehicle drivers without proper driving qualifications trying to gain employment and seeking to work longer driving hours than is legal. In a very few cases, we have evidence that agency staff colluded with workers to evade the law. Existing legislation already covers those issues, and legitimate agencies ensure that workers have appropriate qualifications and do not ask them to drive for an excessive number of hours.</p>

We plan to explore the issue further in discussion with stakeholders and Government colleagues, as we would not want to place additional heavy burdens on legitimate firms.

<p><a name="st_71"><a name="06062727000395"><a name="60627h0010.htm_spnew2"><a name="06062727000610"><b>Dr. Vincent Cable (Twickenham) (LD):</b>
 I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate, partly because it is of intrinsic importance to many of my constituents, and because when I first came into the House in 1997, this was the subject of the first Adjournment debate that I initiated. I have had 40 since then, but the subject has a certain sentimental appeal and, more than that, it is possible to say that although the problem about which I am concerned&#151;security of tenure&#151;has not been solved, there has been at least a growing awareness of the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000396">When I first raised the subject, in connection with a dispute involving residential boat owners and the Port of London Authority, and the underpinning problem of lack of security of tenure, it was clear that the Government were not aware that there was an issue, and correspondingly, they did not respond sympathetically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000397">Recently, the issue has made it on to the map, and there has been a Government consultation paper, &#147;Security of Tenure for Residential Boats&#148;, to which I am sure the Minister will refer, which accepts in many ways at least the fundamentals of the argument. It sets out the issues involved very fairly, and there has been subsequent consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000398">Frankly, I am disappointed that the Government have not gone as far in response to the consultation as I think they should have done on the issue of security of tenure, but, none the less, there is clearly an awareness of the problem and a willingness to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000399">Perhaps I might locate this general issue in my constituency. I have the names and addresses of approximately 150 residential boats, housing about 250 adults, in the Twickenham constituency. They are scattered along the Thames on the Middlesex bank from Isleworth opposite Kew gardens, along the Twickenham bank through Hampton Court, right across the south of Hampton. There are five main communities, the largest being Taggs island, and such exotic places as Swan island, Burgoyne quay, Thistlewaite marina and others. There are probably 100 smaller moorings that I have not captured in those figures. My guess is that there are some 250 residential boats in my constituency, and possibly 400 people who are directly affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000400">Of course, Britain is a country of boats. An estimate is that there are some 450,000 boats in the UK, but only a small proportion are used for residential purposes. There are disputes as to how big the population is. The Government&#146;s paper cites a figure of some 10,000 to 15,000 based on statistics that they acquired through one of the regulatory agencies. The Residential Boat Owners Association, with which I have discussed the issue, thinks that there are about 15,000 residential boat owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000401">The British Marine Federation&#151;the industry, if I can use that term&#151;uses a much smaller number. It says that about 2,000 are recognised, but of course that is part of the problem. Many boats are not recognised because their tenure is not secure. Their owners operate in a grey economy. Indeed, the fact that the official estimate is so low palpably illustrates the problem.</p>

<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>27 Jun 2006 : Column 62WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000402">British Waterways, which deals mainly with canals, came up with a figure of 6,000, but that did not include the boats in the Port of London Authority, which governs the waterway up to Teddington lock in my constituency. To give a rough idea of the magnitude involved, there are probably about 10,000 boats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para19"><a name="06062727000403">The population is diverse. On the Twickenham stretch, we have what some people call floating palaces&#151;very well upholstered boats&#151;but there are many that provide modest and low-cost accommodation. There are different types of tenancy arrangement&#151;leases, licences and renting arrangements&#151;and two navigation bodies: the Port of London Authority for the tidal waters below Teddington lock and the Environment Agency for those above it. My constituency does not have canals, which are covered by British Waterways, nor does it have Crown Estate properties. Four different navigation authorities are involved, so this is not a simple issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para20"><a name="06062727000404">To give more of a human flavour, I have come to know many of the boat owners. It is increasingly apparent that what 10 years ago was primarily a lifestyle choice is now becoming an important form of tenure for people on low incomes who are trying to get established in an expensive part of London. I went to one quay recently where the majority of residents are young professionals. There are teachers and social workers who are unable to afford commercial rents in south-west London. As providing a &#163;250,000 mortgage on a salary of &#163;25,000 is absolutely hopeless, they got together a bank loan and some savings to buy a boat. That is the only kind of home they can afford.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para21"><a name="06062727000405">The Government acknowledge in their White Paper that residential boats are becoming a small but significant&#151;I believe that that is the phrase the housing Minister used&#151;part of the housing market. The Mayor of London has also taken up the issue, because he recognises that it is important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000406">That was brought home to me some time ago when a boat sank. The owners survived, but lost all their possessions. Because their boat sank, they became homeless, which was quite a problem for the local authority, which had not previously realised that people who live on boats have homes and could therefore become homeless. It fought the homelessness claim, but eventually the couple were rehoused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000407">The case underlined the fact that if those 250 families, or whatever the number is, had to be rehoused in some other way, that would bring considerable pressure to bear on social housing in the area. Residential boat ownership provides an important social function as well as an economic one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para24"><a name="06062727000408">The people who live on residential boats have a big problem that is preventing that sector of the housing market from expanding: lack of security. It is recognised&#151;the Government acknowledge this in the White Paper&#151;that this is the last segment of the housing market to enjoy no security of tenure. Park homes and mobile homes are now covered, and Travellers are protected, but this segment enjoys no security. The practical implication is that residents are exposed to the risk of summary eviction. Of course, eviction must follow the course of law, and there are contractual arrangements of varying quality, but many residents are subject to eviction at short notice. I have something of a quarrel with how the Government have dealt with that.</p>
<br>

<notus-date day="27" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>27 Jun 2006 : Column 63WH</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para25"><a name="06062727000409">In the White Paper, the Government appear to have bought the argument from people in the industry who provide moorings that existing law&#151;the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999&#151;is largely sufficient to provide security. The people with whom I have discussed that, at federation and individual boat-owner level, argue that it is completely inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000410">I do not know whether the Government are keeping up with the case law, but we had a recent case in my area where four boat owners were evicted. The case went to Kingston county court and the judge took the view that although he was highly sympathetic to the individuals concerned and felt that they had not been properly treated, the law providing security of tenure was sufficiently weak that he could not, under the law, protect their position. He allowed the eviction to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000411">I note that in some of the literature there is a certain sarcastic tone in some of the industrial side&#146;s contribution to the debate, questioning whether boat owners have ever had such problems with the law. I can cite a specific case, and I am sure that there are many others. That lack of security and the exposure to the risk of eviction create secondary problems, as boat owners are often exposed to arbitrary, large and sometimes capricious increases in rent. I have seen cases where the rent was increased by 200 or 300 per cent. and the occupiers had little power to resist it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000412">The problems do not simply relate to the companies that provide the moorings, which argue that they are often intermediaries against the navigation authorities. The Environment Agency and the Port of London Authority have a mandate from the Government to pursue sound finance, increase their income and reduce Government subsidy, and one way they do that is by trying to squeeze a bit more rent out of people who have moorings, which often manifests itself in large rent increases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para29"><a name="06062727000413">The practical problem for boat owners is that they have little bargaining power when such demands are made. Boat owners do not have a forum within which they can negotiate. Many of them feel harassed. When I tried to get a bit of publicity for the issue, I was struck by how many were reluctant to appear in local newspaper pictures. They did not want to be identified and were afraid that in some way their landlord, or the owner of the mooring, might take action against them. They did not necessarily think that they would, but there was apprehension as well as lack of security and of the ability to stick up for themselves, which was rather worrying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para30"><a name="06062727000414">A further consequence of the lack of security is that there is no pressure on the operators to improve their facilities. On one quay in my constituency, there is one toilet and shower between 17 boats. That is not quite as disastrous as it might appear, since there are chemical toilets on the boats, but none the less the provision is poor and the boat owners have little leverage or bargaining power with which to strengthen their position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para31"><a name="06062727000415">Perhaps the most fundamental point is that expanding the sector is very difficult. If people are going to invest in a boat, we are talking about quite large sums of money. They would like to get a  <br>

mortgage, but they cannot because they are on short-term lease or letting arrangements. In any event, banks will not provide a conventional mortgage-type arrangement, so it is very difficult for people who want to move into the sector to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para32"><a name="06062727000416">I recognise that there is another side to the story. I have read the submissions of British Waterways and the British Marine Federation, which speak for the owners of the moorings. They have a case, which we need to understand. The commercial side of the business is saying that if security of tenure is given, the provision of commercial moorings will be inhibited. The owners have a choice. They can, in certain circumstances, provide residential or recreational boating facilities. If they are going to have a lot of hassle from the residential boat owners, they will simply switch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para33"><a name="06062727000417">If the Government succumbed to the pressure for security of tenure, all they would do is reduce supply. Basic economics suggest that we cannot disregard that argument. However, the conclusion that I would draw is that any action to improve security of tenure must be accompanied by planning provision&#151;in other words, to safeguard moorings for residential boat ownership&#151;otherwise it will operate in the way that the pessimists predict.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para34"><a name="06062727000418">My final comments&#151;I will try to draw to a conclusion rather quickly&#151;turn to the Government&#146;s proposals and the reactions to them. The Government have offered four options, from the status quo to full security of tenure, with two intermediate possibilities that involve what effectively amounts to self-regulation through best practice or model agreements&#151;variants of the same general idea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para35"><a name="06062727000419">The argument for security is provided by residential boat owners, who believe that they should have treatment consistent with that of other forms of house tenure. They believe that they need the security to invest and because they need to be protected from harassment and a weak bargaining position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para36"><a name="06062727000420">Very striking in the Government&#146;s summary of their consultation is the fact that the debate has become worryingly polarised. Of the 77 residential boat owners who were consulted, 72 opted for the fourth option, security of tenure. Every single one of the residential boat owners that I have consulted came to the same conclusion, which is that without security of tenure, they can do little. On the other hand, on the commercial side, there was complete polarisation too. I think that only one of the 39 respondents thought security of tenure acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para37"><a name="06062727000421">There is a schism between the different sides of the industry, which is worrying if we want to achieve consensus. I can understand why the Government are attracted by the two voluntary regulatory options&#151;the second and third ones. I think that the Government wish to proceed that way. Since the Minister appears to be moving in the direction of model agreements and best practice, perhaps she will tell us how that will be disseminated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para38"><a name="06062727000422">We are dealing with a fragmented activity, which takes place all over the country and involves small moorings. If the process is to be initiated by the Government, how will they spread it? Are they going to take responsibility? How will they ensure that, beyond purely token initiatives, best practice will spread?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para39"><a name="06062727000423">I have two final points. One of the positive things to come out of the Government&#146;s exercise is the recognition that we are dealing with a wider problem than merely security of tenure. I read of two Government initiatives in the White Paper and welcome them. First is the acknowledgement that we are not simply dealing with tenure arrangements, but that there is also a shortage of moorings. That must be addressed partly through planning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para40"><a name="06062727000424">I would welcome some indication from the Minister that the Government plan to produce planning guidance to encourage local councils&#151;indeed, strengthening their position&#151;to provide residential boat-owning accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para41"><a name="06062727000425">The second, and perhaps in the long term most important, point is that the key players are the quangos, the regulatory bodies and navigation authorities&#151;the Port of London Authority, the Environment Agency and the waterways agency&#151;which, from the tone of their comments, are rather hostile to residential boat owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para42"><a name="06062727000426">At best, the authorities tolerate the residential boat owners, but they certainly do not see them as an integral part of canal conservation; they regard them as a bit of a nuisance. The Government response says that they intend to write to them, or at least contact them, and discuss with them how they can improve their practices to make residential boat owning a more secure and viable form of living.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="60627h0010.htm_para43"><a name="06062727000427">I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is an exercise she intends to undertake and give us some indication of how she intends to do it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para0"><a name="06062727000433">I want to make two brief points. First, the Government themselves have acknowledged in their document that residential boat owners represent the only tenure type in the United Kingdom without legislative protection. Therefore, the onus has to be on those who would deny legislative protection to explain why that group should be the only one not have it.</p>
<br>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para1"><a name="06062727000434">The only reason given both in the documents and by the operators themselves is that if legislation were introduced to give security of tenure and other protection, the consequence would be fewer available lettings. That may be true, but it is the argument that landlords have used over the past 100 years to try to prevent protection for tenants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para2"><a name="06062727000435">As Governments&#151;particularly the Labour Governments&#151;have never been persuaded by those arguments in the past, I am interested to know why they seem to be so willing to be persuaded by them now. Is there evidence in support of that view or is it an assertion that the Government appear to be endorsing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para3"><a name="06062727000436">The final point&#151;it is on the final page of the Government&#146;s document&#151;is what they say in rejecting legislation at this stage:</p>
<a name="60627h0011.htm_brev0"><a name="06062727000521"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;In the longer term...we will only look at implementing legislation if deemed necessary by increasing levels of complaint and no redress.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para4"><a name="06062727000437">The responses to the Government&#146;s own consultative document&#151;72 residents opting for option 4 and a small number going in any other direction&#151;show that there is real concern that is not being addressed. If that response is not considered sufficient, it would be helpful if the Minister said what type of complaint is required in response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para5"><a name="06062727000438">I conclude by saying that this is an important matter.

 I thank the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) for raising the matter in debate and the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) for making his comments. I will do my best in the time available to respond to the points that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para6"><a name="06062727000440">I understand that the hon. Member for Twickenham has raised these issues on a number of occasions, and he said in his second such Adjournment debate that he remembered the first fondly. I thank him for his comments, and say that his points and the issue are taken seriously. The Government&#146;s response has moved along in line with responses that he and others have made on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para7"><a name="06062727000441">Some of us might recall that the issue of security of tenure for the boat owners was raised during the passage of the Housing Act 2004, as well as before that in relation to a number of matters, which the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions and debates on the matter show.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para8"><a name="06062727000442">At that time, the problem centred around harassment and terms of contract. There were other issues that also concerned boat owners, and some of those are outlined in the document that we spoke about during the consultation. As a result of those issues being raised, and following an undertaking given in another place during the 2004 Act&#146;s progression through Parliament, the Government undertook to investigate those matters further.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para9"><a name="06062727000443">There was a considerable correspondence from all sides, which helped to inform our consideration. The consultation, which the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea referred to, proceeded following discussion with stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para10"><a name="06062727000444">A full public consultation was published in November and, as has been said by Opposition Members, we have posed four options to address the problems identified. They range from maintaining the status quo to introducing legislation. I have to correct the right hon. and learned Gentleman, who says that the Government have ruled out the legislative option. That is not true. That is kept under review, and I will come on to it in a moment. It is important that we look at the matter in the round. Security of tenure would be a significant step, and one that the Government could consider in line with other options.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para11"><a name="06062727000445">We received 135 responses to the consultation exercise, including many from the constituency of the hon. Member for Twickenham. As he said, and as was expected, there was no overall consensus on the way forward. Indeed, he referred to the issue becoming increasingly polarised. There was little common ground between responses from residents and those from mooring operators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para12"><a name="06062727000446">The response did show helpfully a number of similar contractual disagreements between residential boat owners and the mooring operators. They indicated to the Department that the situation was further complicated because not all parties were sure of the role played by the navigation authorities&#151;the hon. Gentleman referred to them&#151;in enforcing controls. I can confirm that we will be making contact with the navigation authorities to discuss that matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para13"><a name="06062727000447">The responses suggested also that although contractual problems are not widespread, there does need to be far better communication between the parties concerned. There is a misunderstanding of the rights and responsibilities of each party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para14"><a name="06062727000448">The hon. Gentleman was a bit dismissive of some current legislation. Perhaps it is worth touching on some of it. He said that the Government have &#147;bought&#148; the argument that existing legislation is sufficient. That question was asked in the consultation document. It is unfair to say that the Government &#147;bought&#148; the argument. When posing questions and asking for responses, the Government must consider all arguments put to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para15"><a name="06062727000449">The occupants of residential boats have the benefit of protection under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. I appreciate that that Act does not cover all the areas about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned. However, under the Act, &#147;acts likely to interfere&#148; with peace or comfort are classified as harassment. That has been raised before, and it is worth noting that that Act covers that concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para16"><a name="06062727000450">The 1977 Act also covers illegal eviction. If residents believe that they have been harassed or subject to an illegal eviction, they should contact their local authority for help, guidance and assistance. The Department might be able to improve contact with local authorities to assist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para17"><a name="06062727000451">In addition, the Office of Fair Trading, local trading standards departments and other regulators are responsible for enforcing consumer protection legislation, in particular the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. Those apply to written agreements, and either party can go to court if they feel that unfair terms exist, so as to rectify the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para18"><a name="06062727000452">Consultation raised some general concerns about the working of the OFT and protection from eviction legislation, but no evidence was produced to show that they are not working in regard to residential boat owners. The hon. Gentleman gave specific examples. If he lets me have them, I shall pass them on to my colleague in another place, who will look at the issues raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para19"><a name="06062727000453">From the consultation, it seems to us that many residents are not aware of the existence of relevant legislation or of the involvement of the OFT. We need to consider whether the problem is with the existing legislation or with its implementation and residents&#146; understanding of what is available to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para20"><a name="06062727000454">The issue of the number of moorings was also raised in consultation. As has been indicated by the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. and learned Gentleman, the demand for existing moorings is high, and there needs to be an increase. It also became clear that new legislation further to control the activities of mooring operators for residential moorings could lead to a short and medium-term reduction in the number of available residential moorings. The majority of mooring operators made it clear that new legislation would make it harder for them effectively to manage their businesses and the surrounding environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para21"><a name="06062727000455">Along with all the other responses to the consultation, we took note of those concerns because residential moorings constitute only a small part of many operators&#146; businesses. The concern is that those moorings could be removed or the number reduced, and holiday and pleasure moorings increased. So, there would be reduction in the number of such moorings, even though we need an increase. There is concern that legislation could exacerbate, rather than address, some of the issues before us. We might be able to deal with some of the concerns raised by increasing the number of moorings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para22"><a name="06062727000456">As we have only recently realised this ourselves, I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has set up a working party on the issue of moorings. My Department has worked closely with DEFRA on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para23"><a name="06062727000457">There was consensus over the issue of planning permission for new moorings or marinas, or the continued use of existing sites. The existing planning policy guidance note 3 on housing requires assessments of housing need to underpin local plan policies. PPG3 is clear that local authorities should consider the needs of specific groups, but does not identify them separately. We are currently undertaking extensive reform of the planning system, which will give local authorities the opportunity to take into account community participation at a local level and will mean that the needs of residential boaters can be identified more easily by the authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para24"><a name="06062727000458">I would encourage the hon. Gentleman to talk to the local authority and residential boat owners in his constituency in order to urge them to engage with their local planning authority. By bringing both sides together, a greater awareness should be created within local authorities of the concerns, demands and needs of residential boat owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para25"><a name="06062727000459">The responses received highlighted the need for better communication between parties; a clearer understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved; and the need for an outline of the responsibilities for enforcing authorities. Where do we go from here? Our concern is whether legislation would resolve the issues or create an overall better deal for residential boat owners. I am not 100 per cent. convinced that that is the case at present. Consequently, we have decided that these issues are best addressed not in legislation but in guidance. In our response to the consultation process, published in May, we made a commitment to develop best practice guidance and a model agreement for mooring operators to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para26"><a name="06062727000460">Together, these will set out our expectations and show mooring operators that our plans are not intended to be detrimental to their business, but that high regard needs to be given to residential boat owners. That is in line with the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda. In addition, we will continue with the ongoing planning reform so that additional suitable moorings can be developed, and we will include the planning aspects of residential houseboats in the best practice guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para27"><a name="06062727000461">We have to recognise that those operating moorings are managing a business. Like all businesses, they need to set targets for ensuring there are reductions in the number of complaints; that they improve their performance on resolving disputes; and that greater importance is attached to resolving matters in a timely manner. We want to help them achieve that. The next step for us is to begin work on the best practice  <br>

guidance. We have had indications from a number of organisations of their willingness to be involved in developing that guidance, including the Swan Island Residents Association based in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency. A number of organisations have suggested what should be included in the guidance, and we welcome this and look forward to working with them and other stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para28"><a name="06062727000462">We are now seeking to bring together a working group, including other Departments with an interest in this area, later in the year. I would be happy to keep hon. Members informed of progress. We will be writing to all interested parties in the coming months to set the process in motion and engage with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para29"><a name="06062727000463">We will be looking for the working group to take a view on the scope of the guidance and ensure that it addresses the needs identified through the consultation. If we can bring together stakeholders to agree the guidance, that will carry far greater weight in the sector and will give boat owners the protection that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para30"><a name="06062727000464">I accept that action in this area has been sought for a number of years. We are now making progress, but the priority must be getting the document right. I trust that it will then strike the right balance between protecting houseboat residents and ensuring that mooring operators can run their business in a way that is fair to residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="60627h0011.htm_para31"><a name="06062727000465">I am not able to give a date at present, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that this is not something that we want to delay. I have asked officials that among the early issues for agreement of the working group should be the scope and framework of the document, and we will place copies in the Library of the House.</p>
