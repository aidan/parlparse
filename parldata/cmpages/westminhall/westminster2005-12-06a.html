<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51206h01_spnew0"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Cox  (Torridge and West Devon)</b>  (Con): I am very grateful and delighted to have secured this debate at a time when the subject is so topical. The effects of bovine tuberculosis in my constituency, across the south-west and throughout the country are becoming a subject of increasing public notice. Between January 1996 and August 2005, 123,800 cattle were compulsorily slaughtered as a result of bovine TB. In 2003&#150;04, bovine TB cost the United Kingdom &#163;88 million. The figure was &#163;92 million in 2004&#150;05, and I understand that it will be similar this year. The incidence of the disease in cattle is rising at an annual long-term rate of 18 per cent. According to the Government, if the disease continues to spread at the present rate, the number of slaughters will rise from the present level of 23,000 a year to 66,000 a year in just five years and the annual costs of testing and compensation alone will be &#163;145 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para0"><a name="stpa_0">Last year in my county of Devon, there were 396 new-herd incidents. However, I have been given access to the state veterinary service figures for 1 January to 1 December 2005, and they are shocking. The number of new-herd breakdowns in Devon has gone up from 396 last year to 669 in just those 11 months. The number of reactors slaughtered has risen to 6,056 and the number of slaughterhouse cases is 99. That increase from 396 to 669 in the number of confirmed new-herd incidents in Devon represents a rise of nearly 70 per cent. If anything demonstrates clearly that the economic cost to the country of bovine tuberculosis and its present almost uncontrolled spread is becoming financially unsustainable regionally and nationally, it is those figures. They are a call for action from the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para1"><a name="stpa_1">I know that the Government have not been entirely idle, and it would be wrong to suggest that the Minister&#039;s Department has been doing nothing. There are programmes afoot to look into the question of vaccination and to examine the efficacy of different tests. At the heart of the Government&#039;s policy&#151;the subject on which I wish chiefly to dwell&#151;have been the random badger culling trials, which concluded just a week ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para2"><a name="stpa_2">The human costs of bovine TB, let alone the financial costs, have long been unsustainable. Bovine TB has a slow attritional effect on the morale of farming families. One in five calls to the rural stress information network&#151;to whose work I pay handsome tribute&#151;arises as a result of the direct or indirect effects of bovine tuberculosis. Each of us who lives in rural communities knows that the disease has many farming families in its seemingly relentless grip and we know of the strain that that imposes.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para3"><a name="stpa_3">As well as the human costs, however, there are the economic costs. The Exeter university report in May concluded that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;there is little disagreement that the total cost of a TB incident generally exceeds payments for the livestock slaughtered.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para4"><a name="stpa_4">I must tell the Minister that those effects will be exacerbated by the Government&#039;s proposals to introduce tabular valuations. The university of Reading found that 79 per cent. of dairy farmers and 65 per cent. of beef farmers suffered net losses from TB breakdowns of up to &#163;17,000 per farm. Therefore, it is incumbent on all hon. Members, especially the Minister and the Department, to examine carefully the assumptions on which current policy is based. For some eight years, random badger culling trials have been at the heart of those assumptions. I wish to examine those trials. In 1997, Professor Krebs&#039;s commission found:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">&quot;There is strong circumstantial evidence to suggest that badgers represent a significant source of mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51206h01_spnew1"><b> Angela Browning  (Tiverton and Honiton)</b>  (Con): I apologise that, due to other commitments, I must leave the Committee early. Having set up the Krebs commission when I was a Minister, I can tell the Committee that the intention of the last Conservative Government was that the Krebs report should identify radical change to deal with this matter. That was eight years ago.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51206h01_spnew2"><b> Mr. Cox </b> : I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention because that is precisely what I wish to address. What was the purpose of the Krebs trials? What was their function? Professor Krebs never doubted that the badger represented a significant source of infection in cattle. He said that the strongest evidence came from the four cases in large areas of high herd breakdown incidents where herd breakdown rates were lower following badger removal. That evidence has been amply confirmed this year in the Republic of Ireland&#039;s four-areas trial, to which I shall return.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The Krebs trials were initiated with the principal aim of determining, if possible, not the qualitative contribution&#151;not the fact that the badger was an influence in the spread of the disease&#151;but the quantitative contribution, and the effectiveness of various methods of culling. Professor Krebs did not argue, nor, to my knowledge, has any sensible commentator ever argued, that the presence of infected wildlife was the only factor in the epidemiology of the disease. The question that no science has apparently yet been able to answer is that of extent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para6"><a name="stpa_6">The advice to the Government of the Science Advisory Council sub-group on bovine TB just two months ago was that the relative roles of cattle transmission and wildlife are still impossible to determine. However, it concluded that, in the current circumstances, cattle-to-cattle transmission was probably the dominant factor. It is important to be careful in examining what that might mean. The geographical spread of bovine TB within the UK may well be currently influenced by cattle movements.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51206h01_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ian Liddell-Grainger  (Bridgwater)</b>  (Con): Would my hon. Friend care to reflect on the fact that, during the foot and mouth outbreak when there were no cattle movements, TB still continued its spread across the country through some other medium?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 203WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51206h01_spnew4"><b> Mr. Cox </b> : I fully agree, but my intention at the moment is to examine the review of the Government&#039;s advice and the status of their thinking. For now, I shall not deal with whether I agree with the conclusions of the Science Advisory Council; I shall come to that at the end. I am examining the way in which the policy has developed within the Department, and I ask the Minister whether some of the assumptions that I am making and whether some of the inferences that I am drawing from the published material are incorrect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para7"><a name="stpa_7">I do not believe that the Minister or the Department dispute that whether cattle transmission totals 50 per cent., 60 per cent., 40 per cent. or more or less than that, the presence of a pool of infection within this country&#039;s wildlife&#151;particularly in hot spots such as Devon&#151;is a significant source of infection. I am fortified in that statement by correspondence from the Minister, which has been given to me by my constituent, Mr. Tony Yewdall. His family farm lost some 90 cattle over a period of two years, and I know that the Minister is familiar with Mr. Yewdall. In that extensive correspondence, the Minister did not seek to deny that the badger is a significant source of infection and likely to be implicated in the breakdown on the Yewdalls&#039;s farm, which, in common with many in the same predicament in my constituency, operates a closed herd.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para8"><a name="stpa_8">Let us consider the Krebs trials. Will they be an effective way to determine the effectiveness of the culling and the quantitative contribution of the badger? Professor Godfray, who was commissioned by the Government to examine and inspect the Krebs trials, has concluded that they will not prove anything conclusive about the effectiveness of culling. Indeed, Professor Bourne, chairman of the Independent Scientific Group, told the Select Committee in 2004 that the trials&#039; validity would apply only to the cull in the specific manner in which it was done in them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para9"><a name="stpa_9">There are at least serious doubts about the manner in which culling has been carried out in the suspended reactive and proactive triplet areas. In an answer to my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) on 8 December 2003, the Minister accepted that, in the poorest conditions, culling efficiency might be as low as 30 per cent. and it remains far below the 100 per cent. advised as essential by Professor Krebs if significant conclusions were to be drawn.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para10"><a name="stpa_10">In his original report, Professor Krebs recommended that the reactive trial should involve the removal of
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">&quot;all badgers, including lactating sows, from all social groups from territories including the breakdown farm.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para11"><a name="stpa_11">He went on to stipulate
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;sufficient follow-up to ensure that every member of every social group which could have caused the initial breakdown has been removed&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para12"><a name="stpa_12">and that recolonisation of setts should be prevented for a reasonable period. There are strong grounds for believing that none of those conditions has been met. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons has pertinently observed of that failure:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;If the object is to control a disease by slaughtering potentially infected animals in a defined area, it is optimistic to expect this to work when a substantial proportion of them survive to spread the disease.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para13"><a name="stpa_13">The importance of achieving 100 per cent. efficiency, which Professor Krebs initially regarded as crucial to the effectiveness of the trials, was emphasised by 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 204WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Mr. Alick Simmons, the head of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#039;s veterinary endemic animal disease and zoonoses division. In his evidence to the Select Committee in May 2004, he said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;I think we have had a series of analyses done by various different scientists which show that if you remove all of the badgers from a particular area, then the effect of that on the incidence in cattle is quite dramatic, and I do not think there is any suggestion that we would consider anything else.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para14"><a name="stpa_14">Thus there are serious questions about the effectiveness of the Krebs trials but, to conclude the trials, farmers throughout the country and in the south-west have been told endlessly to wait.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para15"><a name="stpa_15">The badger population is currently estimated at well over 500,000. It has enjoyed protected status for many years and is not threatened. Indeed, the badger&#039;s status, given its lack of endangerment, is unique. That is entirely right. The badger is a unique and beautiful animal and occupies an affectionate place in the hearts of the British people. Gratuitous cruelty to animals is a disgusting practice and deserves the opprobrium and contempt that it receives when it is discovered. But bovine TB is a killer of badgers, too. Those with the disease can die a gruesome and harrowing death. I have read accounts by scientists of its pathology. A recent article by Dr. John Gallagher described the lungs of a diseased badger:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">&quot;But whilst in cattle very few bacilli are found in these destructive lesions the opposite occurs in badgers. As badger lesions mature vast numbers of bacilli can accumulate as necrosis gradually increases. Occasionally, massive colonisation can be seen in the tubules of damaged nephrons giving the appearance of a broth&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para16"><a name="stpa_16">within the lungs of the infected animal. In parts of the country such as Devon, bovine TB is endemic in the badger population. We have a responsibility to deal with it in both the cattle and the wildlife population to the ultimate benefit of both.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"><a name="51206h01_spnew5"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien  (Eddisbury)</b>  (Con): Unfortunately I, too, have to leave before the end of the debate. In the southern part of my constituency which borders on that of my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), we have a hot spot in the Audlem and Market Drayton area. It first appeared during the foot and mouth crisis, which rather reinforces the point that was made earlier. Does my hon. Friend recognise the need for a systematic testing of road kills, particularly in the light of the evidence he has just cited, because they are one of the best available sources of evidence to show the spread of TB and how it may not just be the result of cattle transmission?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51206h01_spnew6"><b> Mr. Cox </b> : I could not agree with my hon. Friend more. It is obviously vital that all instruments and tools available to us should be examined and expanded. I understand that the recent figures show that one in seven badgers from the road traffic accident testing were infected. Plainly we need to look at those tests much more carefully and expand the testing if possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para17"><a name="stpa_17">On the strength of the Krebs trials, which the chairman of the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB described as &quot;of limited application&quot;, there has until recently been no development of a coherent and comprehensive strategy for the reduction and elimination of the disease that includes the vital wildlife factor. It is not surprising that events are reaching the pass that the statistics are showing.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 205WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para18"><a name="stpa_18">Yet I do not want to paint a wholly gloomy picture. For on to this dark horizon, there came a ray of light. It seemed as if at last, for the Government and the Minister, the reality, although long obscured, had begun to dawn. There was the Government&#039;s strategic framework for the sustainable control of bovine tuberculosis. Many deride that document, regarding it as something that, after eight long years, is full of pious sentiments promising little in the way of immediate action. However, in the spirit that I intend to adopt for the purposes of this debate of trying to credit constructive action where credit is due, I do not think that all the criticisms are necessarily merited.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para19"><a name="stpa_19">Having spent the last eight years in the pursuit of sound science based on the random badger culling trials, the framework acknowledges, just as Professor Godfray had warned over 18 months before:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">&quot;In this area, scientific results are always likely to be subject to debate and variable interpretation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">Decisions may have to be made taking account of scientific uncertainty. In considering the evidence on badger controls, we will, as well as assessing the scientific merits of options, need to focus on costs, practicality of delivery, conservation implications, and take in to account wider public opinion.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">Partnership was essential to an effective strategy. There was to be an annual conference of stakeholders. A new national advisory body and a regionally tailored approach according to disease incidence and risk. Thus where there were areas of grave and intense infection, different measures might be called for.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">There was to be an overall approach to the problem. Piecemeal solutions were to be rejected in favour of a combination of measures to tackle the disease that would encompass pre-movement testing, animal husbandry and measures to reduce the incidence of bTB in wildlife&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para20"><a name="stpa_20">I do not believe that anybody could seriously object to any of the sentiments outlined in the framework document. Partnership: yes. We can also say yes to an overall, comprehensive approach that deals with both cattle and wildlife transmission. We can also say yes to a regionally tailored approach designed to target those areas where the infection is at its most intense, because in those areas there will be one risk assessment and in the areas that are relatively or entirely clean, the risk assessment will be different. That makes sense, and I understand it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para21"><a name="stpa_21">I also understand the other sentiments in the document, which states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">&quot;How we tackle the threat from the wildlife reservoir, particularly badgers, is difficult to resolve scientifically.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para22"><a name="stpa_22">It has taken the Government eight years to arrive at the conclusion that the science will not prove anything and that we shall have to proceed on the basis of scientific uncertainty. I applaud them if they have genuinely recognised that we shall have to use the best available evidence and assess risks in different areas, knowing that we cannot foresee the precise effects of the treatment that we prescribe in a particular area. As the document says,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">&quot;Scientific certainty and consensus are not always achievable. We need to find the means of interpreting science when there is conflicting advice.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para23"><a name="stpa_23">I have to tell the Minister that it is his job to make such judgments. As the document says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">&quot;Sometimes decisions need to be made on the basis of the best available scientific evidence and in the light of outstanding uncertainty.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 206WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para24"><a name="stpa_24">The document then adds:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">&quot;It is important not to exclude the possibility of continuing to seek to control bTB through cattle based measures alone . . . In the case of bTB around 24,000 cattle are slaughtered each year to help control the disease, causing hardship to farmers and economic costs to Government and industry. We would not expect a limited/localised badger culling policy to be popular across the whole of society&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para25"><a name="stpa_25">Finally, the document spoke of equity:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15">&quot;Government must ensure that costs of controls are fairly distributed amongst beneficiaries. This is particularly sensitive given the existence of a wildlife reservoir of disease that is not currently controlled by Government (due to the uncertainty of the evidence) and that farmers are not permitted to control themselves.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para26"><a name="stpa_26">In other words, the strategic document contained the clearest concession that there is an issue of equity and of basic, fundamental fairness in expecting the farming community to bear not only the cost of the pre-movement tests involved in controlling this disease, but the economic and human costs of being denied the right to defend their property and to protect themselves against a disease that, as the document said,
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">&quot;farmers are not permitted to control themselves.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para27"><a name="stpa_27">There is an issue about allowing this situation to continue and about loading ever more responsibilities on the farmer without tackling the wildlife reservoir of disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para28"><a name="stpa_28">On 27 June, I attended a meeting with the Minister, along with constituents and representatives of the National Beef Association. The message from that meeting was unmistakable and was consistent with the strategic framework document, which said that it was important not to exclude the possibility of concentrating on cattle transmission alone. The interpretation of all those present was that the Government were moving slowly but ineluctably toward the inevitable conclusion. There was a lively discussion about the means by which a limited and humane cull might be carried out. The constructive engagement of the farming organisation was enlisted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para29"><a name="stpa_29">Then there was the scientific advice that the Government received. Just a few weeks ago, in September, the Scientific Advisory Council offered this cautious recommendation:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;Infection of cattle through cattle-to-cattle transmission and from wildlife reservoirs may occur in parallel. Where this occurs, both routes may need to be addressed for effective control . . . the results of the Irish Four Areas trial are unlikely to be directly and quantitatively applicable to mainland GB but provide strong evidence that in some circumstances proactive culling may provide a substantial contribution to control . . . culling may contribute to an effective control strategy in some heavily infected and geographically distinct and isolated areas, but only when coupled with other control measures.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para30"><a name="stpa_30">It explained that the efficacy of culling would depend on local and geographical factors. Those are the very issues with which the national and regional policy sketched out in the strategic framework is concerned; hence the need for regionally tailored policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para31"><a name="stpa_31">Finally, we have had consistent assurances from the Minister since the summer&#151;repeated in this House&#151;that an announcement could be expected in the autumn. I am willing to call December autumn if he will make his announcement now. Timing does not matter&#151;as we know, we can suspend it in the House&#151;so I shall be delighted if he will do so. I plead with him to show the

<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 207WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
members of farming communities who have travelled a great distance to attend this debate that although the Government are moving slowly, they are going to take precise and specific action. Last month, the Minister said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">&quot;I expect that some of the announcements that we will make later this autumn will be about what more can be done to prevent the spread of TB between cattle as well as how we may address the wildlife problem.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 17 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 1089 .]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para32"><a name="stpa_32">All those statements, and the whole current of Government policy, seem to have been leading to a measured response to the problem of uncertain evidence and the long- neglected right of farming people to have their livelihoods and property protected in a manner in which they can have confidence. I accept that it is essential to assess risk and cost when considering that necessary buzzword in administrative law&#151;what is &quot;proportionate&quot;. The Minister has repeatedly said that that is what he is engaged in.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para33"><a name="stpa_33">As the Government concede, however, in a genuine partnership, basic considerations of equity and fairness are at stake. Why should farming communities have to bear the cost of new cattle control measures, such as pre-movement testing, reduced compensation and the continuing and dramatic losses and effects of BTB while unable to protect themselves, their living and their animals from the reservoir of disease that everybody accepts exists? A limited resumption of culling must be available as a tool in any co-ordinated and comprehensive policy if it is veterinary opinion that circumstances on the ground call for it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para34"><a name="stpa_34">I accept that the Minister&#039;s Department has the spectre of a High Court judge looking over its shoulder, but I ask him to consider the terms of section 10(2) of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;A licence may be granted to any person by the appropriate Minister authorising him, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Act, but subject to compliance with any conditions specified in the licence&#151;(a)  for the purpose of preventing the spread of disease, to kill or take badgers, or to interfere with a badger sett&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para35"><a name="stpa_35">In other words, the Act clearly permits the Minister to issue a licence for the taking or culling of badgers to prevent the spread of disease. Subsection (9) of that same section says that that consent
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;shall not be unreasonably withheld&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para36"><a name="stpa_36">Thus, in a court, the onus would be on the Minister to prove that his consent to the licence had been reasonable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para37"><a name="stpa_37">Every farmer has rights to the peaceful enjoyment of his property under article 1 of protocol 1 of the European convention on human rights. Under the jurisprudence of that convention, a fair balance must be struck between the individual and the interests of society in protecting the badger. It was never the intention of Parliament that farming communities should be denied the opportunity of dealing with the wildlife reservoir if there were a prospect that that might be effective. Given that the Government seem to be unprepared to act even in the extreme circumstances described in the SAC&#039;s advice, a blanket policy denying all applications for a licence would stand a strong chance of being found to be unlawful. I hope that such action will be unnecessary.

<a name="51206h01_para38"><a name="stpa_38">Only the week before last, the <i>Farmers Guardian </i>announced that the Department had stated that the Minister&#039;s announcement could be expected today, so we have arrived at the end of a long and tortuous road&#151;or have we? What new twist of the screw or the knife is to be inflicted on an anxious and expectant farming community? There are worrying developments, with which I ask the Minister to deal. In January 2006, the new EU food hygiene regulations come into force, which will require that dairy producers isolate and discard milk from TB reactor cows. What will that mean for producers in the south-west, where large herd breakdowns take place? We are in December, but there is no guidance from DEFRA on how to deal with the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para39"><a name="stpa_39">If there is to be a partnership, let there be genuine and greater flexibility to enable farmers to recover more quickly from a breakdown. Allow them to volunteer inconclusive reactors for slaughter. Where there are large herd losses, use the gamma interferon test to accelerate the diagnosis of infected cattle, and allow fast restocking. Where whole herds are removed&#151;as has tragically been the case in my constituency and other constituencies throughout the south-west&#151;if cattle-to-cattle transmission is the cause, fast restocking should be allowed after disinfection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para40"><a name="stpa_40">The feeling of the farming communities whom I represent is running very strong. They are law-abiding, courageous and decent people whom it is a privilege to represent, but they are at the end of their tether. They are stretched in every direction by one pressure on another and they cannot endure indefinitely. The human cost and misery of the tragedy, unfolding silently, unnoticed by a wider public, throughout the countryside, can no longer be ignored. If the Government fail to fulfil the hopes of an expectant farming community that, at last, pragmatic considerations have prevailed, they will rightly think that Nero himself could not have shown more shocking indifference to the fate of farmers, cattle and badgers alike.

<p>
<a name="51206h01_para41"><a name="stpa_41">I have received many letters on this subject from constituents&#151;farmers, vets and others who have witnessed the burdens placed by bovine TB on farming families. I shall read only one. Mr. R. E. Colbear of Northlew near Okehampton says:

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="51206h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) on securing the debate and on his rhetorical flourishes in advancing the case on behalf of his constituents. It is very important that we discuss agriculture and particularly livestock industries in the House, but we rarely have an opportunity to do so. It seems to me there has not been a debate on this issue in Government time since before the election before last, which speaks volumes about the importance that is now placed on what is still, for many of us in the west country particularly but also for people in other parts of the country, an important industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para44"><a name="stpa_44">This is an emotive subject for obvious reasons. None of us wants damage to be done to the wildlife in our areas, or rash decisions to be taken in dealing with this disease. As the hon. Gentleman said, there are many uncertainties. We are still vague about the transmission and the epidemiology of the disease, despite the best endeavours of many people over a long time. We know, however, that bovine tuberculosis is present in cattle herds and in the badger population and other wildlife populations, and although we cannot yet prove definitively the transmission between the two, the link is at least logical, given trials elsewhere and the experience of many of our farmers, whose herds are closed and have not been moved on and off their farms yet who see new instances of bovine tuberculosis in them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para45"><a name="stpa_45">It is clear that the major vector is cattle to cattle; everyone should accept that. Nevertheless, it is clear that other transmission methods enable the disease to get into our cattle population. That creates problems for the economy and for the welfare of the animals. I shall deal with the economic problem in a moment, but I want to stress welfare, because this is an animal welfare issue. Some 20,000 cattle are slaughtered every year. I do not happily accept the slaughter of cattle on that scale to eradicate disease; I know the effect that it has on the farmers involved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para46"><a name="stpa_46">I also believe that this is a welfare issue for the badger population&#151;a key issue that has only just begun to surface in the public consciousness. Why on earth are we allowing an animal that we consider to be sufficiently important to list as a protected species to suffer and die from tuberculosis without doing anything about it? This is key to disease control.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para47"><a name="stpa_47">Economically, the compulsory slaughter of cattle is costing the country roughly &#163;19 million each year, as we have already heard. That is a huge sum of money that benefits no one. We should try to eradicate the disease rather than continually deal with a recurrent infection rate. The economic effects on each farmer are enormous. The compensation that they receive for their cattle is not important. What is important is the effect on their farming enterprises and the knock-on effects of the ban on movements off their farms that cause them all sorts 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 210WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
of short-term management and husbandry problems. There are all sorts of economic and social effects on the farmers involved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51206h01_spnew8"><b> Bill Wiggin  (Leominster)</b>  (Con): Has the hon. Gentleman had a case in his constituency like the one in mine, where people living in Pensax have been so intimidated by Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs officials&#151;I have written to the Government about this&#151;that they dare not release their cattle or even answer the phone? That is the extent of the problem, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for talking about welfare.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51206h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : Some of my constituents have had very unfortunate relationships with DEFRA officials, whose response to the disease has meant that there has been no plain sailing in dealing with it. There have been delays, particularly in dealing with bureaucratic aspects, which have caused those constituents a great deal of distress and have damaged their businesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para48"><a name="stpa_48">I have outlined the economic and social effects on the farming population. I now return to the question of welfare and the disease that is endemic in the badger population. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said, it affects badgers far more than cattle. Another knock-on effect, which I shall not dwell on, is the illegal cull of badgers that is undoubtedly going on all the time. I do not condone it, but it is happening. Some of the road kills on our lanes&#151;in Somerset, there is a dead badger on practically every lane&#151;were not hit by cars, but were put there having been otherwise destroyed. Those are the lengths to which people will go if they feel that their concerns are not being properly addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para49"><a name="stpa_49">For a long time, I have advised people that they should have patience on this issue, and I have advised care and consideration for the processes that the Government have had in train. In some ways, I have defended the Government&#039;s position because I thought it important to get the scientific evidence that the Krebs trials were supposed to produce&#151;in less time than was taken.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para50"><a name="stpa_50">I have always wanted to see the holy grail of an effective vaccine for the cattle population and for other wildlife, and I am interested in the prospective trial of the BCG vaccine on badgers. If there is any evidence that it provides effective damping of the infection rate in the badger population, it should be used more extensively and quickly than is envisaged. Surely, we have learned from foot and mouth that if we get a ring of protection around infected areas and reduce the transmission of the disease within the relevant population by vaccination, we can then start to deal sensibly with the infected animals within the ring.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para51"><a name="stpa_51">It seems to me that long-term considerations have outgrown their usefulness because we need to deal with the crisis on our hands that affects our farming communities and our cattle and wildlife populations. That has been emphatically brought home to many of us not only by the farmers whom we represent but by the veterinary surgeons, who have an interest in having a disease-free animal population, and who take no joy from telling people that they have to put down their cattle or take other measures.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para52"><a name="stpa_52">The time has come for targeted badger control in infected areas&#151;not across the whole country. I do not want to see a slaughter of badgers; they are an adornment and decoration to the countryside. I know that many people feel great affection for the species, but we have to deal with infected areas and individuals effectively. Given the prevalence of the species&#151;certainly in Somerset, and, I suspect, the whole of the west country&#151;I have no doubt that we will see recolonisation in a short time if such control is used, as there is only one natural predator of badgers: the motor car. The badger is an effective species, which clearly enjoys and proliferates in the ecology still available to it, so let us not be concerned about the future health of the population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para53"><a name="stpa_53">Pre and post-movement testing on mature cattle that are moved from farm to farm should be introduced as a matter of course, although we need to reach a satisfactory conclusion on who should pay for it. Putting more burdens on the agricultural community is probably unsustainable, but we need to put that testing regime in place. We need to maintain the research base for the reasons I gave: to discover the epidemiology and for vaccine effectiveness and production.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para54"><a name="stpa_54">I do not know why there was such a small control experiment of post-mortem testing of road kill badgers, which was not done in some counties. Indeed, my county was excluded. That is a huge available resource. If there were post-mortem testing of road kills, we would have a much clearer idea of the extent of the spread of bovine TB in the badger population. That is an elementary step towards understanding the disease and its spread.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"><a name="51206h01_spnew10"><b> Mr. Philip Hollobone  (Kettering)</b>  (Con): I would like to support the hon. Gentleman&#039;s comments about the routine examination of road kills. Fortunately, in Northamptonshire, there are very few cases of bovine TB. The Leicester animal health division of the state veterinary service reported only 39 bovine TB cases this year. There is no call locally for a targeted cull in Northamptonshire, but there would be popular support for the routine examination of badgers that fall victim to road kills.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51206h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : That is interesting because that area is outside the main current focus, and I welcome what the hon. Gentleman said. It is not just badgers; we must be wary of widespread infection in other wildlife species. At least as a precautionary measure, we should be doing occasional post mortems of other road kill species&#151;deer, in particular, in my area.

<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51206h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : Have I just said what the hon. Gentleman wished to say?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51206h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger </b> : As a fellow Somerset MP, I am aware that there is a large red deer population on Exmoor. During the foot and mouth epidemic, to which I alluded earlier, there was no cattle movement. One of the issues that we explored, and I know that the hon.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 212WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Gentleman supports it, was the wholesale checking of all deer that had been killed on Exmoor. Would he concur with that? I think that he probably would.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51206h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : Given that that is what I just said, the hon. Gentleman can be confident that I will agree with him. There is a large deer population, not just on Exmoor and the Quantocks, but in my area&#151;although not red deer, sadly. If they are potential vectors, we ought to know whether bovine tuberculosis has entered the herd.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para55"><a name="stpa_55">The last point that I should like to make concerns compensation. We continue to be told that the Government intend to move from a system of 100 per cent. valuation to a tariff or tabular system. That has potential problems. I can see its attractions from the Treasury&#039;s point of view, but I fear for its consequences for some of our farmers. Can the Minister consider the difference in value between different breeds of cattle? I am thinking particularly about some of our rare breeds, which have huge potential value, although their market value is not always recognised in the same way. We must at least have variations within that tabular approach to allow for the difference between a pedigree herd and a superannuated milker&#151;without being unkind to the black and whites in my constituency. There is a big difference in potential valuation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para56"><a name="stpa_56">I should also like to re-emphasise the urgency of the matter. When I asked a question on 20 October, the Secretary of State replied:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">&quot;Although I recognise that there are serious problems in areas such as the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituency, he knows that that is not the case in other parts of the country.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para57"><a name="stpa_57">Yes, I do, but it is my constituents that I am concerned about, because I am paid to represent them. She went on:

</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para58"><a name="stpa_58">I agree with that as well, but if that anxiety is expressed by the Secretary of State, it must now be translated into action by coming to a decision. Frankly, we have waited long enough for that decision. I hope that today is an opportunity for the Minister to stand up and tell us what he is going to do about bovine tuberculosis. If he does not, many people who are concerned about our agriculture industry, and the welfare of our wildlife, will want to know why he is continuing to dither.

Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox) that I have to attend the Standards and Privileges Committee shortly. I shall make a short contribution because, like my hon. Friend who represents a neighbouring constituency, I have seen the situation in the west country aggravated by the spread of this disease in such a short space of time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para59"><a name="stpa_59">One of the reasons why the previous Conservative Government commissioned the Krebs report was that we realised that there had to be a fundamental change in policy if the geographic spread of this disease was to be curtailed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para60"><a name="stpa_60">When I was elected 14 years ago, my most northerly parish, Morbath, which borders Exmoor, had just had its first case of bovine tuberculosis. However, the disease is now well down the Exe valley. Indeed, I say to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)&#151;he too is a neighbour of mine&#151;that if he had farms in his constituency, I think that the disease would now be in his constituency too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para61"><a name="stpa_61">The aim of the Conservative Government in commissioning the Krebs report was to stop the geographic spread; we hoped that Krebs would come up with an alternative policy that could be implemented. I understand the difficulty that the Minister has; indeed I have spoken to him privately about that and about what I believe to be necessary, and I now do so publicly. The political will is needed to do something about this disease, which affects farmers to the extent so eloquently described by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon&#151;the impact on farmers and their families has to be seen to be believed. It is not just about the money, although that of course is important in any business, but about the sheer desperation that people suffer when they are restricted, when they can see their whole livelihood being taken away from them and feel totally impotent to do anything about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para62"><a name="stpa_62">I have sat in the Minister&#039;s chair, and I know that when one is dealing with badgers, which are a protected species, one has to jump through lots of hoops. My hon. Friend mentioned the powers that the Minister has to take action. As a Minister, I issued licences for the killing of badgers but, in order to do so, I had to try to get the permission of all sorts of groups of people, such as badger groups and the official badger panel, that were set up when the species was first protected. I am sure that, at the time, their establishment was well intended. Those groups are there to introduce checks and balances on ministerial decision making but, in a case like this, they hamper the Minister in doing what is the right thing to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para63"><a name="stpa_63">The Minister will know, because I know that he has seen the data, that there have been experiments and trials around the world, not least the one in the Republic of Ireland, which I have visited twice, once as a Minister and once since. We do not have to reinvent the wheel in the UK. We are part of the European Union, so surely we can respect the scientific analysis of a trial carried out in another EU country, without saying that we have now got to spend years trialling the same thing ourselves. There should be a much faster process by which we can say what works and what does not. I know that, in the absence of concrete scientific evidence, the situation is difficult, but it cannot be left as it is. The disease will soon become endemic in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para64"><a name="stpa_64">My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone) said that there are just a few cases in Northamptonshire. Give it five years, and he will not be standing up here and saying that there is no public feeling for action, because we have seen the same situation in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. As the disease has spread, we could predict what would happen.

<p>
<a name="51206h01_para65"><a name="stpa_65">This debate, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon, is timely because, after eight years, we are now waiting to see what the Government will do to make a difference to the farming community. I urge the Minister to act on this matter. If he does, he will have the support of many people in the House. I am sure that, with his persuasive powers, he can convince even the people who sit behind him in the Chamber that this is not just a slaughter policy; it is about the farming community and what it is suffering and the huge slaughter of farm animals. However, it is also about the welfare of the badger. It was once suggested to me that somehow tuberculosis does not affect badgers as it would any other species&#151;human or animal. That is rubbish. They drag themselves around the countryside and become weak.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para66"><a name="stpa_66">I love British culture, but I am worried by an aspect of it to do with animals&#151;&quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; approach to badgers. That must be changed. If people care about moles, rats and badgers, and other parts of our heritage, the well-being and health of badgers and wild creatures should matter. The Minister is best placed to make that case as the foundation for a change in policy. If that is to succeed, I am convinced that selective culling will be needed. When we commissioned the Krebs report, it was with the assumption that it would result in a need for culling to produce a cordon sanitaire around parts of the country to stop disease spreading down through the south-west peninsula or further north.

<p>
<a name="51206h01_para68"><a name="stpa_68">The figures that the hon. Gentleman has brought before us, which have been available for some time and which show the rising tide of a terrible disease, cannot be disputed. As has been said, recent Government policy has been predicated on the Krebs trials. I had Krebs trials in my constituency: we have triplets in trials in South-East Cornwall. Everyone with any knowledge at all of the Krebs trials has no doubt of their proper intention. They were a real attempt to reach a scientific analysis. However, there are, and have been for some time, questions about the likely effectiveness of the outcome of the trials. If they are to be published, it will be interesting to see what, after such a period of time, they will definitely have established.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para69"><a name="stpa_69">I was grateful to the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning) who reminded us how long the process, which was set up in her time as a Minister, has been going on and what has been achieved. I am sure that she and her Devon colleagues know that the situation in Cornwall is just as dire. The so-called hot spots are becoming almost a rash, and we must consider where we are, rather than where we want to be or where we hoped or thought we would be.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para70"><a name="stpa_70">The science is not exact, and it might not be for some time. The number of incidents has risen significantly, particularly in the south-west, at huge financial and personal cost&#151;we must emphasise the personal costs to farmers and their families and those who work for them; they are under enormous stress&#151;and no effective vaccine is in prospect. However, farmers have also to face other things that compound their problems, such as low market prices; the unprofitability of their enterprises; the introduction of the single farm payment, which will cause concern in the next year or two; and the increasing incidence of bovine TB outbreaks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para71"><a name="stpa_71">The situation is increasingly desperate. Liberal Democrats represent many rural areas, and it is sad to see a lot of empty seats opposite us. The Government have to recognise that, in rural areas, the cry for action is becoming louder. Given the fact that farmers have gone through BSE and foot and mouth and the desperate problems of low prices and outbreaks of TB, how many of them will decide that enough is enough and that they cannot continue? Despite all the social, financial and family implications that will inevitably follow, how many will give up?

<a name="51206h01_para72"><a name="stpa_72">In the past two months, I have received a huge number of letters and e-mails from constituents, and I know from colleagues in Cornwall and other parts of the south-west that the situation needs to be properly addressed. As my hon.

My party had supported the Government&#039;s intentions in the Krebs trials, and had been keen to ensure that animal welfare was at the heart of policy making. However, in view of the crisis, I asked my party 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 216WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to do something that took a lot of persuasion&#151;to adopt a policy on selective culling. Such a move had been rejected a number of times because we had genuinely hoped that the Krebs trials would produce a scientific solution, that vaccine might be the way forward and that we would finally overcome the terrible disease. However, the situation had become so bad that if livestock farming were to survive in this country, even with long-term solutions in place, we had to get on top of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para73"><a name="stpa_73">It is always said that bovine TB is a highly emotive issue, and that was true when my party discussed it. Some 10 weeks ago, we decided to adopt a new policy that had three elements: an immediate and focused programme of badger control in the hot spot areas to prevent or control cross-contamination between badgers and cattle; the introduction of pre and post-movement testing of cattle&#151;that is not wholly supported by some of my constituents, which I can understand given the costs of testing, the impact on the value of animals and the effects on farming, but we felt that it was important if we were to support selective culling.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51206h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Heath </b> : It is an important component. The hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton) spoke about the situation in Cheshire. It is almost certain that that was caused by cattle-to-cattle transmission due to the movement of herds from the west country to Cheshire, rather than any spread through the badger population. We must be aware of that and be prepared to do something about it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51206h01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Breed </b> : I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention; I entirely agree with him.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para74"><a name="stpa_74">The third element was that the Government have a further role to play in providing immediate and increased support for the development of a vaccine. There may be some elements of work on the BSG that could be useful. However, having spoken to a number of companies that are involved in vaccine development, it is clear that they will require significant Government support if they are to advance the programme. The likely profits that will be generated from a vaccine when it ultimately is obtained are not likely to encourage those companies to put an awful lot of their money into research and development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para75"><a name="stpa_75">It was with a heavy heart that my colleagues came to the conclusion that the situation was so desperate and had reached such a crisis, especially in the south-west, that culling was perhaps an inevitability. That was not because mass wholesale slaughter of badgers is a good thing; that would not take place. There would, however, be selective culling in known and persistent hot spots, especially in the south-west, to get on top of the situation while medium and long-term solutions are devised. As has been said by all hon. Members, we, the farming industry and many individual farmers are looking to the Minister and the Government to accept that the time has come for action, however unpalatable that may be, which it is for many. If the situation is not tackled now in a positive way, we will see a continuing spread of the disease, continuing misery in the farming industry, and perhaps we will be no further forward than we are now.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para77"><a name="stpa_77">There has been a developing hot spot around Market Drayton in my constituency. I spoke to Heulwen Charles of the National Farmers Union yesterday, who estimates that 25 per cent. of the dairy farms around Drayton have been affected by TB. Since I became a shadow Minister, I have made it my business to go around the country. I have been to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon, I have seen Mr Yewdall, and I have asked more than 600 parliamentary questions on this matter. I would like to thank the Minister and the civil servants for the manner in which they have answered my questions because we have flushed out a huge amount of information, some of which I shall touch on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para78"><a name="stpa_78">Conservative hon. Members wish to see a healthy prosperous cattle industry alongside a sustainable, managed and healthy wildlife population. At the moment, we have neither. DEFRA&#039;s consultation document of last year stated that we will spend &#163;2 billion of taxpayers&#039; money over the next 10 years not curing TB. In the Minister&#039;s own words, in a parliamentary reply:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">&quot;The Government recognise that eradication of bovine TB is unlikely to be achieved in the next 10 years using current control methods.&quot; .&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>31 January 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1465W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para79"><a name="stpa_79">The numbers are staggering. Another parliamentary reply states that, in 1997, we slaughtered 3,760 cattle. The latest figures up to the end of October show that, this year, we have already killed 25,757 cattle. By the end of the year, that figure will represent a 700 per cent. increase on 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para80"><a name="stpa_80">The phenomenon occurs because we will not bear down on disease in both sectors. There is disease in both cattle and wildlife. Transmission may be cattle to cattle, cattle to wildlife, wildlife to wildlife or wildlife to cattle. The phenomenon that demonstrates that is closed farms. A Mr. Evans from Yockleton near Shrewsbury sent me an e-mail last week. They have had a breakdown, with serious badger activity on the farm, and that farm has closed after operating for more than 100 years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para83"><a name="stpa_83">The Minister told me in a written reply of the extraordinarily high level of infectivity of badger urine when badgers have renal TB. He stated:

He also acknowledges the cruelty to badgers. In another reply, referring to an animal that may have had late-stage TB, he states that
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34">&quot;there would undoubtedly be an effect on the quality of life of such an animal.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i>10 December 2003; Vol. 415, c. 523W.]</p>

<p>
<a name="51206h01_para86"><a name="stpa_86">We so nearly got rid of the problem. In the 1930s, 40 per cent. of dairy cows were considered tuberculous. By using the tuberculin test and slaughter, before we had a wildlife reservoir, we got the figure down to 0.01 per cent. of animals tested in 1972. In 1971, a badger with tuberculosis was found in Gloucestershire next to a farm where two heifers had gone down with TB.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para87"><a name="stpa_87">We have seen what happens where we do bear down on disease in wildlife. In another written reply, the Minister said:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">&quot;Just killing more and more cattle was the approach we used forty years ago before we knew the badger was a maintenance host . . .

<p>
<a name="51206h01_para102"><a name="stpa_102">He has made up his mind. He has not told Parliament why he has, in effect, repealed a section of British law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para103"><a name="stpa_103">I have tried to help the Minister. I have met scientists at Warwick university, who are convinced that they can get round one of his biggest problems&#151;his fear of unnecessarily culling healthy badgers. Those scientists are convinced that polymerase chain reaction technology&#151;PCR&#151;could identify sets where diseased badgers live, because badgers live in social groups and use latrines. In his reply to me, however, the Minister was looking for an excuse not to accept advances in technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para104"><a name="stpa_104">I went to Michigan to see how the Americans have handled TB, and they dismissed the Minister&#039;s reply as quibbling. They are convinced that there is real use to be made from identifying TB around badger setts, which could help us to take out the diseased badgers and leave healthy ones. We all agree that we want to leave the healthy ones, partly because they are a barrier to the spread of disease by diseased badgers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para105"><a name="stpa_105">There are real lessons to be learned in Michigan. I was astonished by the severity with which the federal and state authorities treated the disease. The lessons are simple: bear down on disease in cattle using fast, accurate and modern means of diagnosis. In Michigan, the authorities gave cattle a skin test and used gamma interferon and PCR. They have rigidly enforced, but workable pre-movement testing and movement restrictions. I went there thinking that pre-movement control was probably a political gesture on the part of the farming community to get action from the Government on wildlife, but it is more than that&#151;it is an integral part of the community success in getting rid of disease in cattle. The farming community recently went for two years without a single herd going down.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para106"><a name="stpa_106">However, the authorities also took vigorous, if unpopular, action to bear down on disease in wildlife. The white-tailed deer is iconic, but the culling of deer by means of hunting exceeds the culling of cattle. There is a huge public education programme, and the white-tailed deer population has been reduced by half. People were astonished by the grotesque level of disease in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para107"><a name="stpa_107">To take the necessary measures, the Government must keep the confidence of the farming community. It is vital that they do not chisel on compensation, as has perhaps been proposed with the tabular valuation. That runs directly counter to the experience in America, where farmers really co-operated. Reducing the disease is simple, and that will reduce the cost, which will help the Treasury.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para108"><a name="stpa_108">It is not only the cattle industry, the beef industry and the dairy industry that are at risk. As the US chief vet in charge of TB said, bovine tuberculosis is a serious zoonosis, which is dangerous to humans. It has already been transmitted to dogs and cats, and some humans have picked it up from cattle.

The actual figures are that there were 396 confirmed new incidents last year and 350 confirmed new incidents between January and October this year. I think that the figure that he gave of 600-and-something was not confirmed. However, there is no doubt that there has been a significant increase, as he said. The current trend nationally is about 18 per cent. a year.

However, he was also gracious enough to acknowledge that the Government have not been idle&#151;I think that those are the words he used.

Details of how that will be applied will form part of our forthcoming announcement, which is also likely to contain details of changes to the way in which compensation will be paid, an expansion of the use of the gamma interferon test as a supplement to the skin test and an update on research, including that into vaccines.

That brings me to the thorny issue of badgers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para117"><a name="stpa_117">It has long been accepted that, in this country, badgers are the main wildlife hosts for bovine TB. The problem for the Government, in formulating policy, was that no proper scientific work had been done to study the role that badgers play in spreading the disease to cattle, or what wildlife controls might help to reduce the level of the disease in cattle. That is why they set up the Krebs trials, which started in 1998 and are almost complete. The final season&#039;s culling has finished and data will continue to be collected, but because of the urgency of the situation, I asked the Independent Scientific Group, which runs the trials, to provide us with its interim findings as soon as possible, which it has agreed to do. Those findings are currently being peer reviewed. They will help to inform the nature of the announcement that we intend to make soon.

Friends&#151;that December still constitutes the autumn. It was always our intention to make an announcement before the recess, and we intend to stick to that. It is going to be made slightly later than we had originally proposed because of the interim findings from the ISG and the need for them to have a rapid peer review. However, that will be completed on time. A number of hon. Members have tried to tempt me to make an announcement here today, but I beg their patience for a few more days. They will understand, when they see the interim results from the trials, the reason for us wanting to wait for them before making an announcement.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51206h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> : It certainly will. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged himself, there is still quite a lot of uncertainty about the science. He used the phrase that he hoped that policy would be based on the best available science, and I can certainly reassure him that that is the case. However, that leads me on to some of the simplistic solutions that are sometimes volunteered, including, I am afraid to say, by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who gave the impression that targeted culling of infected badgers is a solution. I do not want to have to wait to make a policy announcement on badger culling until the PCR tests, for which the hon. Member for North Shropshire called, are available. That would mean that we would have to wait too long. Given that, any badger culling policy will not be restricted to badgers that are infected. I do not have a problem with that, but there must be honesty in the debate that that is what would happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h01_para119"><a name="stpa_119">The other thing that Liberal Democrat Members need to be aware of is that, although the science is uncertain, the overall burden of scientific evidence seems strongly to suggest that for a badger culling policy to be effective, it must be intensive and widespread, and that localised, targeted culling&#151;whatever one wants to call it&#151;at best, probably does not help. Most of the evidence so far seems to indicate that the sort of limited culling that is advocated by the Liberal Democrats would make things much worse.

<a name="51206h01_para120"><a name="stpa_120">I think that I am right in saying that, in his previous life, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was a lawyer.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51206h01_spnew30"><b> Mr. Cox </b> : Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"><a name="51206h01_spnew31"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> : Indeed. In that case, I have even more reason to feel grateful for his free legal advice about the pros and cons of badger culling policy. Let me assure him that, in my brief experience as a Minister, I always listen carefully to the advice that our lawyers give me, but then I make a decision based on what I think is the right policy. As he pointed out, it is possible to get legal advice that would militate in favour, as well as legal advice that would militate against, a badger culling policy, for different reasons. What is important is that Ministers make the decision based on what they believe the right policy is.

As we have repeatedly said, if the evidence suggests that badger culling would be a successful, cost-effective and sustainable tool in our battle against the terrible disease, the Government will not shy away from recommending it.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="51206h02_spnew0"><b> Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have secured this debate. Most discussions so far about broadband Britain have focused on technical infrastructure, and more attention must now be paid to the content that will fill the new high-capacity pipes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para0"><a name="stpa_122">First, it is important to set the scene. We can be proud that broadband is available to 99.6 per cent. of the population of the United Kingdom&#151;the highest coverage in any G7 country. However, that does not mean that the task of constructing the infrastructure is complete. Most broadband users can access speeds of only 512 kilobits per second. That is not true broadband, but it is a darn sight faster and broader&#151;10 times faster, in fact&#151;than dial-up. True broadband should have the ability to stream moving images, and that requires a stable data transfer rate of at least 2    megabits, perhaps 4 megabits, per second. The challenge that faces the Government and the telecoms companies already involved in development is to make such feeds widely available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para1"><a name="stpa_123">The ability to access still and moving images is one of the key advantages of true high-speed broadband, and I want to focus on the audiovisual content. Hollywood movies, soap operas and high-level sport will continue to play a large role, but the potential of broadband networks will not be fully realised if they are used simply as an additional platform for the distribution of traditional television channels, or as an alternative to the video rental shop.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para2"><a name="stpa_124">By a happy coincidence, at the same time as broadband is cutting audiovisual distribution costs, the costs of professional-quality AV production are also falling. Some of the digital video cameras on sale in the high street are equivalent to the BBC&#039;s most sophisticated colour equipment of only a few years ago. Furthermore, the podcasting phenomenon has already demonstrated that there is a large public appetite for do-it-yourself content, produced by individuals outside the mainstream media. There is, therefore, good reason to expect the audiovisual markets of the future to be very different from those with which we are familiar. It is feasible to anticipate the development of a rich ecosystem of niche content providers serving local communities and minority interests, rather than the mass national audiences that we have today&#151;and even those have shrunk, thanks to the diversity of TV channels now available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para3"><a name="stpa_125">That development represents a particular opportunity for the UK economy. We already have a strong creative sector that accounts for more than 8 per cent. of gross domestic product. In addition to the economic benefits, it has huge potential to enrich individuals&#039; quality of life. However, the European Commission plans to regulate all audiovisual services, and that is a matter for concern. Specifically, it will shortly present proposals for the revision of the so-called television without frontiers directive. The legislation will establish an effective single market for traditional TV services by forbidding any member state to block the reception or retransmission of broadcasts made in conformity with the law of all the other member states. So far, so good. However, in pursuit of that 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 226WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
objective, the Commission will lay down minimum standards for national legislation in a number of areas, the three most significant of which are advertising, protection of minors and European content quotas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para4"><a name="stpa_126">The Commissioner responsible for the rules, Mrs. Viviane Reding, has announced her intention to amend their scope so that they apply to all services that involve the delivery of moving images to the general public across electronic networks. As we move to a world in which every citizen is a potential content provider, the plan presents huge scope for unnecessary constraints and unintended consequences. That is inevitable, as the regulation is happening to an industry that&#151;for all practical purposes&#151;does not yet exist. Nobody knows what successful business models will look like in that fast-moving sector. The Commission is nevertheless suggesting a leap in the dark.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para5"><a name="stpa_127">Such a leap is, in fact, completely unnecessary. None of the justifications that Mrs. Reding has advanced for additional EU regulation stand up to scrutiny. Let me take three points. First, there is no need for EU action to ensure that there is a level playing field between traditional broadcasters and providers of new on-demand services. All European countries agree on the need to prevent children from having access to unsuitable material, and to avoid exposing consumers to untruthful advertising. In other words, they will try to ensure that new on-demand services respect the same public policy objectives as traditional services, whether or not they are forced to do so by European Union legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para6"><a name="stpa_128">In most EU member states, on-demand services are already subject to some form of control. In the UK, for example, a successful self-regulatory regime&#151;the Association for Television on Demand&#151;has already been established by the industry in question, and the internet is not excluded from the jurisdiction of the Advertising Standards Authority. If any gaps are revealed as the sector develops, they can easily be filled by national legislation, which is better able to accept rapidly evolving circumstances than inflexible EU regulation. I think that that is what is called subsidiarity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para7"><a name="stpa_129">Secondly, although underlying public policy objectives need to be the same in both areas, the principle of technological neutrality demands that traditional broadcasters and providers of on-demand services are not regulated in the same way. By definition, the latter offer greater opportunities for user choice and parental control. Password controls can be used to ensure that children are protected. Such protections are unavailable on traditional TV. The 9 o&#039;clock watershed is almost irrelevant as younger children stay up later. And what protection is that? Has anyone here seen the latest episode of &quot;Rome&quot;? Consequently, it is far from self-evident that on-demand services should be subjected to requirements designed for a world where user choice was limited to a small number of licensed broadcasters, where the broadcasters rather than the viewers decided what their audience would watch, and where a large part of the population watched the same thing at the same time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para8"><a name="stpa_130">Thirdly, there is the freedom to provide services across borders, which should be the Commission&#039;s central concern. That freedom is already guaranteed for on-demand services by another piece of EU legislation, the so-called e-commerce directive. Mrs. Reding argues 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 227WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that that guarantee is not firm enough; member states may still block foreign services in certain circumstances. However, no amount of Brussels harmonisation will remove the need for service providers to continue to tailor audiovisual services to national languages and cultural preferences. The guarantees provided by the e-commerce directive are therefore proportionate to the foreseeable scope for cross-border trade in services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para9"><a name="stpa_131">In fact, the only argument in favour of the Commission&#039;s proposals appears to be bureaucratic neatness; it looks untidy if EU rules apply to one type of audiovisual content but another escapes. Although that argument may appeal to some of the more Cartesian controlling minds in Brussels, I should like to enter a plea for good old Anglo-Saxon pragmatism: &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it.&quot; That viewpoint is shared by practically all the UK organisations that would be affected by an extension in the scope of EU legislation&#151;and many of their European counterparts. In the UK the broadband stakeholders&#039; group, the ICT trade association Intellect, the Internet Service Providers Association and ATVOD, the self-regulatory body that I mentioned earlier, are united in their opposition to    such a move. In the EU, the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association and the European Competitive Telecommunications Association also oppose it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para10"><a name="stpa_132">It has therefore been gratifying to note the Government&#039;s response to the final round of consultations conducted by the European Commission prior to the adoption of its proposal. In short, the Government appear to concur that Mrs. Reding&#039;s plans are completely superfluous. Does the Minister agree with that summary? Does he further agree that those plans stand in direct contradiction to President Barroso&#039;s better regulation agenda, which requires new EU legislation to respond to a clearly defined need, to be proportionate and to be accompanied by a reliable impact assessment? Will he provide an assurance than the UK will maintain robust opposition to the extended scope of EU legislation when the proposals are discussed at the Council of Ministers, which he will attend?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para11"><a name="stpa_133">Sometimes we can see bad legislation only with the benefit of hindsight, but in this instance we can it coming like an express train. I hope that the Minister can reassure me, the telecoms industry and future users of this new medium that he will stop this bad legislation in its tracks.
</p>

<p><a name="st_37"><a name="51206h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Alun Michael) </b> : I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) for the way in which he introduced this interesting debate on a challenging policy issue. I am particularly pleased that he acknowledged at the start the enormous success that we have had in recent years in moving from the rear of the pack in the broadband race to pole position. Broadband is now available to 99.6 per cent. of the UK population&#151;the highest level of any G7 country. We can both celebrate that development.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 228WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para12"><a name="stpa_134">The hon. Gentleman said much that was positive and much with which I can agree. He also said a great deal about ambition, which fits with the work being led by my colleagues at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and with the ambitions of the Government&#039;s digital strategy, on which I am the lead Minister. For those reasons, I shall focus on the way in which we need to revise European legislation on this issue, and I hope that my comments will command the hon. Gentleman&#039;s support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para13"><a name="stpa_135">Essentially, we need converged light-touch regulation fit for a converged world, but I suspect that we are unlikely to reach that stage in one leap. Indeed, when the pace of change is so fast, it might turn out to be a leap in the dark. Let me explain. Since it was last revised in 1997, the television without frontiers directive has delivered significant economic and cultural benefits to consumers and producers. Europe has benefited from a single market in TV services&#151;however imperfect&#151;and that has also enabled the industry to prosper. Consumers have benefited from an increased range and variety of programming and from the various protections under the directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para14"><a name="stpa_136">However, times have changed. Over the lifetime of the directive, we have seen massive technological advances and the convergence of different media and technologies. In the light of that, and of the fact that parts of the directive are getting on for 20 years old, the European legislative framework for broadcasting needs to change. We would have had to reassess it anyway to see how well it was standing up against the requirements of the television industry and consumers. However, because of the acceleration of technological change and the major challenge of convergence, it is not enough to ask whether the directive is achieving its goals of promoting trans-frontier broadcasting in tandem with cultural diversity and the development of the European programme industry. We have to go much further&#151;a point on which the hon. Gentleman and I also clearly agree. We have to look 10 years ahead and persuade politicians across Europe, and&#151;this is sometimes an even bigger challenge&#151;administrations across Europe, to understand and anticipate a world that they can hardly imagine in their wildest dreams, and to ensure that our European legislation will be fit for purpose then, not just in the present era.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para15"><a name="stpa_137">We therefore welcome the re-examination of the directive. We want a flexible and proportionate directive that adheres to the better regulation principles being propounded by President Barroso, as the hon. Gentleman said. That will allow e-industry to grow and ensure that the regulations are future-proofed as far as possible. That task is not easy, and it is made risky by the enormous pace of change in the technological base of the industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para16"><a name="stpa_138">The preamble to the 1997 revision of the television without frontiers directive actually mentions
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46">&quot;the opportunities for growth&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para17"><a name="stpa_139">in the audiovisual sector
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47">&quot;opened up by new technologies&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para18"><a name="stpa_140">But the difference between 1997 and 2005 is that we were then predicting convergence in a general sort of way, whereas today we are in the middle of the reality of convergence and, as both the hon. Gentleman and I have said, we can see that pace increasing rather than 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 229WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
decreasing. In today&#039;s world, television and on-demand services can be delivered down telephone lines, and viewers can have access to TV over the internet. The development of both fixed and mobile telephony is accelerating those changes. We can therefore be clear about one thing: convergence and the blurring of boundaries between previously separate media will continue and will produce new challenges&#151;almost daily, probably.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para19"><a name="stpa_141">Those challenges go to the core of the way in which broadcasting is regulated. What do we mean when we talk about broadcasting? What distinguishes broadcasting from other forms of communication? In the UK, we have tried to cope with that by having a technology-neutral definition of what a television service is, and have tried to make it future-proof by providing flexibility in the Communications Act 2003 to amend the definition should technological change require it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para20"><a name="stpa_142">Defining the scope of future regulation is at the heart of this issue. The Commission proposes that a revised directive should be underpinned by the new concept of &quot;audiovisual content services&quot;, with different regulation for what are termed linear and non-linear services. Linear services are conventional TV-like services, whereas non-linear services are those pulled down by viewers, such as video on demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para21"><a name="stpa_143">I see the key objectives of television without frontiers as to secure a genuine single market, to drive enterprise and to protect consumers and cultural diversity. In order to design changes that will work, we have to ask ourselves certain questions. I hope that many of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns will be answered by the reassurance that we are asking the right questions, as that is the only way to get the right answers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para22"><a name="stpa_144">We should be asking the following questions. Can the distinction between linear and non-linear be made, or has it already been overtaken by technological change and new business models? Can we bridge the clear differences of view between traditional broadcasters and the providers of new services? There are some opportunities here. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Commissioner Viviane Reding; she and I co-hosted an event in July for the chief executives of a variety of organisations across Europe, at which there was an exciting debate in which it became clear that leading figures in the industry not only see the impact of convergence, but are starting to engage with issues of content. That goes across the scope of television, mobile telephony and the internet. The question that I posed&#151;can we bridge the clear differences of view between traditional broadcasters and the providers of new services?&#151;remains a challenging one for them as well as for us.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para23"><a name="stpa_145">My third question is: should we&#151;indeed, can we&#151;level regulation down rather than up? We are keen on the model of light regulation and proportionate regulation, but it takes a good deal of effort at the design stage. I might return to this issue if provoked.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para24"><a name="stpa_146">My fourth question is: can we design a system of co-regulation and self-regulation that achieves virtue with the minimum of red tape for the good guys while coming down heavily on the small minority of bad guys? In other words, can we create a system with the light-touch effectiveness of the antisocial behaviour order instead of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 230WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the pedantic and expensive bureaucracy of the traditional court system? I dare say that I might get into trouble with the lawyers by making that point, but that is the way in which we should proceed. My fifth question is: can co-regulation and self-regulation bridge the divide between traditional broadcasters and the providers of new services?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para25"><a name="stpa_147">Finally, given that the ultimate in self-regulation is the use of the off switch, we must consider how far we should regulate for protection and how far we should provide audiences with the tools to control what they want to watch, what they do not want to watch, and what they do not want their children to watch. I am sure from the hon. Gentleman&#039;s introductory remarks that he will agree that that question must be part of our approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para26"><a name="stpa_148">In considering those questions, part of my answer is to point to examples of success. One of the best examples is what we have done in the UK to prevent access to child abuse and child pornography. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that, and said that it was an issue on which we could all agree. It is, but agreeing that one wishes to eradicate something is not the same as doing so. In this area, the strength of legislation often flies in the face of Edward Gibbon&#039;s advice that legislation often fails to prevent what it forbids.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para27"><a name="stpa_149">This is not a case of the industry saying, &quot;It can&#039;t be done,&quot; although one would have to go back only a short time to find the industry and those who had a particular interest in the internet saying that it could not and should not be done. We do not want the Government to produce heavy legislation under pressure from child protection non-governmental organisations and Members of Parliament, who are frequently swift to call for light regulation or no regulation until it comes to something they do not like, in which case they demand immediate legislation
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para28"><a name="stpa_150">Instead, the industry, the NGOs and the Government have worked with the police to produce a light-touch example of effective co-operative action that has achieved more in a year without legislation then we could have achieved in five years with it. I can confirm that that is the approach that we will be arguing for in the Council of Ministers. Clearly, it has limitations, but it has much to commend it. In a market that is moving very rapidly that approach has even more to commend it, because the time that it takes to produce national legislation&#151;never mind European legislation&#151;means that the industry and the technology is likely to have moved on a considerable distance by the time of implementation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para29"><a name="stpa_151">It is not for me to say much about the potential challenges for advertiser-funded broadcasting. The potential impact of personal video recorders has led to a great amount of debate among providers of free-to-air broadcasting. On one hand, there is the question of whether some of the rather detailed quantitative rules in the directive might be relaxed; on the other hand, there are divided views on the acceptability of new product placement techniques. I am sure that the latter issue should be thoroughly considered as part of the process.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 231WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para30"><a name="stpa_152">One strength of the current directive is the clear and distinct difference between programming and commercial promotions, so that audiences know when they are being sold something, and when they are receiving an independent communication. That separation maintains the confidence of consumers in the editorial integrity of programmes. One major challenge is to maintain that distinction in any new arrangements, given the range of questions and complications that we have already spelt out in the course of this short debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para31"><a name="stpa_153">We must also examine costs and benefits. As the hon. Gentleman said earlier, with any new regulatory instrument it is important to weigh up the benefits against the costs and burdens, so we will have to scrutinize carefully the Commission&#039;s promised full regulatory impact assessment of its forthcoming proposal. Just as we apply that sort of impact assessment to our legislation in an increasingly stringent and professional way, we wish to see that become ever more effective with European legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para32"><a name="stpa_154">New legislation must be effective and enforceable. However, if we are to deliver the Lisbon agenda, it must also be flexible to encourage the growth of European businesses and markets. I have frequently made the point that the growth of our GDP across Europe has been some 40 per cent. dependent on information and communication technologies in recent years. However, the level in the United States is some 80 per cent. I suspect that if we could find a UK figure&#151;these are figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#151;we would come somewhere between the two. That shows the benefits of our more open market and greater competitiveness&#151;although that is still not at the level seen in the United States and some of our competitor countries in the far east and elsewhere. There is a big 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 232WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
challenge to ensure an effective focus on the Lisbon agenda&#151;which was, incidentally, the focus of debate in the European Telecommunications Council that I chaired last week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para33"><a name="stpa_155">If we fail to ensure that regulation has a light touch where possible, is fit for purpose and addresses the realities of technology and industry, we will fail Europe, and Europe will live in the past instead of competing dynamically with economies such as the USA, never mind China, India, Korea and Japan. There is still some way to go in resolving the detail of the directive, but when the Commission has published the draft we shall be in a better position to consult stakeholders, respond properly to the proposals and debate the issue properly, thoroughly and in detail with parliamentarians.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para34"><a name="stpa_156">In areas such as i2010, the policy that we agreed last week, and which Viviane Reding, the Commissioner, has actively promoted during the UK presidency, I found her to be extremely forward-looking, and to have real vision about being ambitious for Europe. I am sure that we will be able to persuade her that the process of revising the television without frontiers directive must be dynamic, forward-looking and imaginative, and must find new and non-bureaucratic ways of achieving appropriate regulation and avoiding inappropriate regulation and bureaucracy. That can be achieved if we use our strengths and talents to the full across the different sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h02_para35"><a name="stpa_157">In the short period since I took on this brief, I have been impressed by the amount and quality of the engagement between officials in the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with industry leaders in this important and challenging area of policy. I share some of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concerns, but I am optimistic that we will be able to deliver the type of legislation that he seeks, and I look forward to debating the issues with him over the months to come.

<a name="time_9">
<a name="51206h03_time0"><h5>12.58 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_38"><a name="51206h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Graham Allen  (Nottingham, North)</b>  (Lab): While health, education, the police and local councils now all work closely together in partnership to tackle our social problems locally, one institution stands aloof, not pulling its weight&#151;the legal system. It often uses judicial independence and impartiality as an excuse to avoid the social responsibility that we must all share. That is an attitude as damaging and corrupting of social justice as was the canteen culture of the police&#151;which, to their credit, they are changing. The legal system, too, must change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para0"><a name="stpa_158">That is felt at its keenest in constituencies such as mine and the Minister&#039;s, where despite the personal commitment and professional dedication of local professionals and practitioners, the culture of the legal system stands in the way of the comprehensive, multi-agency approach that we are all trying to build. Things need not be like that, and the Lord Chancellor needs to reposition the Department for Constitutional Affairs as a public service&#151;customer-driven not producer-driven, freeing our talented local professionals to engage with our communities, not staff a system that looks down on them. That needs vision at ministerial and departmental level, and there are several strategies for achieving it. I want to talk about one of those strategies today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para1"><a name="stpa_159">Several weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit Red Hook in Brooklyn. Having had the usual problems of overburdened magistrates, ineffective results and high recidivism rates, the deprived neighbourhood of Red Hook established the Red Hook community court in 2000. The court emphasises rehabilitation, prevention and community involvement rather than punishment alone. Defendants were brought in one after the other before Judge Calabrese, and they had a personal and direct relationship with him. What I saw illustrated the emphasis on mediation and the strong commitment to helping with the lives of those, often young, people rather than simply locking them up to reoffend later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para2"><a name="stpa_160">Community courts are about taking proactive steps to prevent antisocial behaviour and criminality. Community justice involves identifying, acknowledging and addressing the range of problems that contribute to entanglement in the criminal justice system, rather than simply focusing on the crime itself. A single judge hears multi-jurisdictional cases in one court and becomes an integral element of the community. He can hand down sentences of up to one year. He goes to community meetings; indeed, he initiates them&#151;an experience that has not ended civilisation as the judiciary knows it, or called his integrity or impartiality into question. A judge whose tiny staff take polaroids of damp and squalid housing conditions in the community and bring the municipal landlord to court is seen to be delivering justice impartially in the community. In some people&#039;s eyes, that is the first time that that has ever happened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para3"><a name="stpa_161">The results are as follows. Some 75 per cent. of defendants complied with sanctions in Red Hook, compared with 50 per cent. at the traditional court in downtown Brooklyn, the re-arrest rate among drug offenders who had completed a community court-monitored treatment plan was 29 per cent. lower over three years, and the annual arrest rate of defendants 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 234WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
who had completed at least 90 days of court-mandated drug treatment fell over three years from 2.3 annual arrests before the intervention to 0.9 annual arrests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para4"><a name="stpa_162">Justice is seen to have a real impact on the community. The average arrest-to-arraignment time was 18.9 hours, compared with 29.2 hours at the downtown Manhattan court. The arrangements deliver justice swiftly. With results such as those, the community court movement began to expand, and the empirical research on those jurisdictions reinforces the successful data coming out of Red Hook.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para5"><a name="stpa_163">The Department for Constitutional Affairs conducted a study of the US community courts and released the results in May 2005. It found that the community courts had less backlog, the community was more satisfied and defendants were more compliant with sentences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para6"><a name="stpa_164">The movement to create community courts in the UK is building. Lord Falconer, the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, observed:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">&quot;Involving the community in deciding the priorities of the centre will mean that local people will see their main concerns being tackled with real and visible payback for the crimes that affect their way of life in their neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para7"><a name="stpa_165">I agree wholeheartedly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para8"><a name="stpa_166">That ties in perfectly with neighbourhood policing and all our other local initiatives to put a human face on public services. The public respond whenever we do that, especially in the criminal justice system. In Nottingham tenants, residents, beat officers, neighbourhood wardens, probation officers, the Crown Prosecution Service and many others to whom I have spoken welcome the idea of a community court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para9"><a name="stpa_167">The very nature of community courts encourages an atmosphere in which a greater number of parties become involved in the process, and leads to wider justice for all. If a youth breaks someone&#039;s window, justice might involve getting the perpetrator to apologize to the owner and to work in community service projects to fix what they have broken. Rebuilding respect for the criminal justice system so that it is seen to deliver for people in local communities is radically different from the alienated process to which we have become accustomed in magistrates courts and other courts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para10"><a name="stpa_168">In community courts, those who violate the law see how their actions adversely affect other members of society. In addition, members of the community are more confident about giving evidence and helping to prevent problems from recurring. I am sure that witness intimidation is as big a problem in the constituencies of other hon. Members here as it is in mine, and it has to be tackled at the local level. Once we can administer justice at that level, community confidence will begin to be rebuilt. In community courts, those who are wronged also get a greater sense of justice because they are involved with the system, and feel better compensated by the unique process that the court offers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para11"><a name="stpa_169">Neighbourhoods&#039; positive sentiments towards community courts are corroborated by the evidence collected, again, by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. The Department&#039;s research found that community residents&#039; perceptions of safety had risen and, even more remarkably, that a majority of residents were willing to pay slightly increased taxes or to transfer 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 235WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
money from other criminal justice agencies to fund the continuation of community courts. As a result of all that enthusiastic support for this innovative justice system, the United Kingdom&#039;s first community court opened its doors in January at the north Liverpool community justice centre. In the first six months after the court&#039;s introduction, north Liverpool experienced a decrease in crime, compared with the same time frame in the previous year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para12"><a name="stpa_170">Although Judge David Fletcher, who runs the community justice centre, is disparaged by some of the more conservative elements in the judiciary, he has emerged as an engaged community leader and personifies the success of the community court. My right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs has described him as having
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">&quot;a very unique role of building community relationships across north Liverpool, as well as passing sentences and following cases through after conviction.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para13"><a name="stpa_171">That personal element of the community courts prevents defendants from becoming alienated from the process and allows for true rehabilitation so that they have the option of becoming productive members of society. My right hon. and learned Friend has also said that the centre in Liverpool is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">&quot;already making a difference by listening to local people and giving them an opportunity to get involved in reducing local crime.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para14"><a name="stpa_172">If we are to generate capable charismatic judges who roll up their sleeves, step outside the comfort zone of a cosy judicial career ladder and are proactive in our communities, the Department needs to initiate fundamental cultural changes. It needs to start by revamping the monochrome judicial training and ensuring that judges have a lifetime engagement with the communities that they are meant to serve.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para15"><a name="stpa_173">Over 18 years I have put a great deal of effort into trying to meet the judiciary in my own city, and I have managed to meet judges and others on only a handful of occasions. However, within five minutes of entering the judge&#039;s jurisdiction in Brooklyn, on my way to Red Hook, I was sitting at the top table watching him administer justice. He showed photographs to a defendant who was going through a drug rehabilitation scheme, but who was wobbling and perhaps thinking of leaving the scheme to go back on to the drugs. The judge showed the defendant pictures of himself taken 40 days earlier and asked, &quot;Is that the sort of thing you want to return to? Do you really want to go back to looking like that?&quot; That sort of direct follow-through communication with defendants should be looked at and replicated in the UK. Ensuring that our judges are more in tune with their communities does not for one second mean that they are less impartial or less independent; it simply means that they are more capable of delivering the justice that we need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para16"><a name="stpa_174">Community courts are gaining momentum in the United Kingdom, and many more communities, including those in Nottingham, are ready to embrace this innovative system of justice at a lower level. Although I would prefer there to be a single judge, if that option were available, we can look at other levels, too. The Salford community justice initiative recently 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 236WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
opened, and community justice panels in Chard and Ilminster are now operational and continuing the trend of success that the community courts have repeatedly shown since their creation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para17"><a name="stpa_175">We are serious about getting the legal system to be a part of Nottingham. This morning the idea of community courts will be discussed at our local criminal justice board. We have seen the adverse effects of antisocial behaviour and criminality and the need for an integrated way of tackling those growing problems. On Monday on one of my local estates we shall launch Operation Kingdom: a multi-agency approach, with the addition of dozen extra police officers, will go in to fill a vacuum created by the very positive arrests of some of the key villains in the east midlands. We are going in there with housing, social security, CCTV operatives and additional police personnel to ensure that that community can be helped to rebuild itself now that those significant arrests have taken place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para18"><a name="stpa_176">That community, and Operation Kingdom, would be a classic case for assistance at judicial and legal level. But at the moment those connections are not there. What would the people on the Bestwood estate give to have an active involved judge repairing the damage done by a decade of criminality by one key family? We need such people in our communities. We need the Minister to make every intellectual effect to see how she can spread those pilots further.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para19"><a name="stpa_177">A community court in Bestwood, or in St. Ann&#039;s or the Meadows in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell) and for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) could be the spark that really makes our communities&#039; fight-back unstoppable. We have had some adverse publicity in the city of Nottingham, some of it self-generated, but that would be a demonstration that Nottingham itself had thought this through, got everybody around the table and found another way to fight back and regenerate our communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para20"><a name="stpa_178">In October, just to show that we are serious about this idea in our city, we had the privilege of playing host to district attorneys from Red Hook, who came to examine our magistrates and exchange notes on the best ways to deal with crime. They met our chief Crown prosecutor Kate Carty, and helped us to understand the steps that we need to take to make community courts a working reality for Nottingham. I invited those two female DAs from New York to the House of Commons and we had a chat here about the exciting possibilities, and how they had changed the community in Red Hook. The Crown prosecutor and I also took our case for community courts to Baroness Scotland, who is the relevant Home Office Minister. She, too, gave us encouragement and listened carefully to our ideas about the possible way forward for community courts in Nottingham.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para21"><a name="stpa_179">I do not know whether I should have declared an interest at the beginning and I apologise if I have transgressed in any way, but I am the chairman of our local regeneration partnership in Nottingham, One Nottingham, which is the local strategic partnership charged with the regeneration of our city. Our priorities, too, tie in closely with ensuring that the legal system and the criminal justice system are a part of the revival and are not aloof and watching from afar. While maintaining their judicial integrity and independence, they should be in there with us helping us, as any other 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
public institution would, to revive and revitalise some of the deprived areas in my constituency. The community court is a perfect fit in that regeneration strategy and it helps the legal system to play its part as a full and active partner in regenerating our communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para22"><a name="stpa_180">One Nottingham stands ready to hold the ring for any proposals coming forward for our city. We would be available to discuss with Ministers or officials how that might best be done. To show the seriousness with which we are preparing for that possibility, a conference will be held in March in the city of Nottingham under the umbrella of the Magistrates Association and a local trust in order to take those ideas forward. I do not know whether it is right for me to invite my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister to address that conference, but I shall ask her diary secretary whether she is available. As always, she will be very welcome. We were sad that she was unable to attend a day that we had planned for her in Nottingham; it would have included a discussion about the concept of community courts. I blame my former colleagues in the Whips Office for that misadventure, but I hope to make up for it on another occasion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para23"><a name="stpa_181">It is understandable that the Government want to see the completed results of some of the UK pilot programmes. However, if she does not know already, the Minister needs to be told that we stand ready to move whenever we are given the signal. Empirical data and community feedback show that community courts are having some success. The sooner we in Nottingham can begin to take those strides forward, curbing antisocial behaviour and criminality in our communities, the better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para24"><a name="stpa_182">Some may say, &quot;We can&#039;t afford a community court; we&#039;ll have to pay for a judge, and the housing and accommodation.&quot; But our communities, who already pay billions of pounds as a result of petty criminality&#151;the costs of the police service, the Prison Service, drug rehab, the broken families, the poor, and low educational attainment&#151;would not agree that we cannot afford those courts. They would probably say that we cannot afford not to have them. Indeed, the quality of life of those in my constituency who live in the large former council estates in the outer city is diminished daily. They live in fear of the crime caused by the local yobs and the dealers. They, too, would probably say that we cannot afford not to have those courts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para25"><a name="stpa_183">I look forward to the day when my constituency can witness an innovative court with a spirited and positive judge like the one whom I saw in Red Hook, and probably like the one in north Liverpool. We have the support of our local community and our regeneration body, and we are supported also by the Government&#039;s vast research on the matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para26"><a name="stpa_184">Nottingham is more than ready to become a pioneer in the revolutionary field of community justice. We ask only that the Government give us the opportunity, as soon as possible, to establish a community court in Nottingham. We, too, can then begin to have a positive impact on regeneration. We do not want justice to be an alien concept unrelated to everyday life; we want justice to be delivered locally, and to be seen to be delivered locally. We hope that that will help rebuild confidence not only in our judicial system but in our social system. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 238WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We believe that the courts and the law have a central role to play in the regeneration of our communities, and community courts are a key way of demonstrating that.

<a name="time_10">
<a name="51206h03_time1"><h5>1.18 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_39"><a name="51206h03_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Ms Harriet Harman) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) on choosing to debate community courts. I admire the way in which he argued his cause. He made a strong case&#151;and what we heard about in my hon. Friend&#039;s short speech is just the tip of the iceberg. I know from discussions that I and my ministerial colleagues and officials have had with him that his work on this subject is based where it should be: he listens to what people are saying in his local community. The policy development is not being undertaken in an ivory tower, but is based on what his constituents are saying to him. It is therefore hugely important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para27"><a name="stpa_185">I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#039;s patient and measured approach. I appreciate that it must be hard for him&#151;seeing the needs of his constituents and the downright urgency of the agenda that he is putting forward&#151;when it sometimes takes a while to get ancient institutions to step forward and work together in different ways. I congratulate him on his patient persistence in taking this matter forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para28"><a name="stpa_186">My hon. Friend made a point about the culture of the legal system, on which I can only agree. It is hard to believe that if we asked members of the communities whom we represent to design a system for resolving disputes and identifying criminal responsibility, they would conjure up the current system. I think that we all believe that many changes are needed&#151;although many are already under way. The fact that something has been as it is for many hundreds of years is not a reason not to consider what it could do better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para29"><a name="stpa_187">My hon. Friend is right to say that we need to look at the courts and the legal system as a public service; the Secretary of State, Lord Falconer, strongly agrees with that point. That service is there to prevent crimes from being committed by acting as a deterrent, and to bring offenders to justice and punish them when crimes are committed. It is also there to resolve disputes within families that cannot be resolved outside court, and to resolve civil cases. Therefore it is a public service, and it needs to look outward more. That is the culture that Lord Falconer is leading forward from his position as Secretary of State.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para30"><a name="stpa_188">My hon. Friend made several points about Red Hook. His point about multi-jurisdictionality&#151;if that is not too long a word&#151;was well made. Why do we have such a clear sense of the different silos of the civil and criminal jurisdictions? Many of the issues about which my hon. Friend spoke stray across those jurisdictions. He talked about people going out and taking photographs of damp conditions. There might be damp conditions in a block of flats. There might also be criminality there, problems with children not attending school as much as they should, and family problems. I agree with his suggestion, and thank him for making it, that we need to consider what the problems are and make the courts work to solve them, rather than making individuals or agencies go from pillar to post.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para31"><a name="stpa_189">In the domestic violence court in Croydon, there are sometimes families who have family problems involving contact with children and decisions about property, as 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 239WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
well as domestic violence issues. Why make one family go in front of two judges? Why not have all the facts go before one judge? That will happen in Croydon: one family, one judge. That idea needs to take root throughout the legal system&#151;basing work around the problem, rather than making people go from pillar to post.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51206h03_spnew1"><b> Mr. Allen </b> : The multi-jurisdictional aspect is not merely internal to the law. In places such as Red Hook one can get drug rehab, child care and health care in the court building, and there is a children&#039;s court there, too. All sorts of facilities are satellites round the court, because it has become such an engine for the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para32"><a name="stpa_190">In the UK we have the LIFT&#151;local improvement finance trust&#151;project in the health service, which means that a new building may contain not only a health centre, but a gymnasium and a local police station. I do not want to give my right hon. and learned Friend ideas&#151;but on second thoughts, perhaps I do. Perhaps the Department for Constitutional Affairs should have a budget for an equivalent to the LIFT project, and consider doing similar experiments in the UK.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"><a name="51206h03_spnew2"><b> Ms Harman </b> : That is an interesting point, which I will consider. My hon. Friend makes the point that in that community justice centre&#151;it is not really a court building; it is more than that&#151;there is drug rehabilitation provision and the like. I hope that as well as spending all the time that he does in his constituency and visiting Red Hook, he will visit north Liverpool community justice centre. I have not been to Red Hook, but I have been to north Liverpool, and his description of the judge at Red Hook reminded me of Judge David, as the community groups call him, of the north Liverpool community justice centre&#151;out and about in jeans and a T-shirt with the community groups at the time of night when the community is particularly beset with problems because of kerb crawling and prostitution. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Judge David Fletcher for taking on his shoulders the responsibility for everyone&#039;s hopes and fears for community justice, and for his commitment to that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para33"><a name="stpa_191">When I was in Liverpool and met the community groups, I was struck by the fact that they have a sense of owning the judge, and why should they not? He is supposed to be providing justice in their community, and he does not fight shy of that; he knows that his working relationship with them helps him to understand what he has in front of him, and the right way to solve the problems. That is why, upstairs from the courthouse, there are drug and housing projects. On the same site there is a youth activities centre. That model is being developed there, and many of the community&#039;s hopes, and our hopes, rest on it. As I said, I hope that my hon. Friend will visit the centre.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 240WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para34"><a name="stpa_192">My hon. Friend asked whether the initiative would be too expensive. Much of this initiative is about people seeing their work differently. Obviously, the more money that can be spent on it the better, but there is a possibility of change just because people see that they can do things differently. The domestic violence forum in Southend said that the judge from the family court was prepared to attend a meeting of the forum to hear about the effects of domestic violence, and that its members felt much more confidence as a result. I am sure that as a result, many more people were prepared to report domestic violence, because they felt that that person understood what was going on. My hon. Friend is right to say that this is a question of public confidence. He is also right to say that we need an opportunity for the wisdom of the community, which best knows the effects of the problems and how they can be solved, to be fed into the process. That means the judge and the community meeting, knowing each other and working together regularly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para35"><a name="stpa_193">My hon. Friend said that this initiative could unleash the spark that made the community fight back. We all know the reality of communities who just feel beaten. The community must be engaged to solve problems, but people will engage only if they feel that there are some prospects and some hope. My hon. Friend is right about that. He has asked for a community court in Nottingham, and he made a very powerful case. He also said that a conference was being prepared. Can it be on a Monday? It is much easier to escape the Whips on a Monday morning, and then I would be delighted to go. Community courts work well if the agencies are engaged&#151;my hon. Friend has worked incredibly hard to make the agencies work together in Nottingham&#151;and if the community is optimistic and prepared to engage. Again, he has led that process with his colleagues in the city.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para36"><a name="stpa_194">I am sure that my hon. Friend&#039;s powerful case will elicit a positive response. I am also sure that in the meantime, what he is already doing is effecting change. He wants more and faster change for his constituents, and we in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, with our colleagues in the Home Office, want to work with him to help to deliver that, but make no mistake: he is already effecting change through those arguments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h03_para37"><a name="stpa_195">We must consider what people want from the justice system and measure it not against what it used to do and what it does, but against what people want. Timeliness is an issue. People do not expect an ordinary assault to take eight months to come to court; they think that it is probably more reasonable if such a case comes to court within four weeks. That is the measure of the gap with which we have to deal. My hon. Friend is a champion of trying to remould the justice system into something that people want&#151;and after all, they should have what they want. The justice system exists in their interests and they are paying for it; it is a necessary public service. We look forward to working with my hon. Friend in partnership on the public service reform agenda for the justice system.

<a name="time_11">
<a name="51206h04_time0"><h5>1.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_42"><a name="51206h04_spnew0"><b> Dr. Vincent Cable  (Twickenham)</b>  (LD): I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate on a subject that causes a great deal of grief to many of my constituents and, I am sure, to many others across the country. It is not a conventional political issue, but none the less it causes a great deal of local concern and there is an element of ministerial responsibility. There are two related problems: the issue of post codes and post towns, which, under the current system, is not open to change, and that of the postal address files&#151;the so-called PAFs&#151;which, in theory, can enjoy some flexibility but in practice enjoy little.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para0"><a name="stpa_196">Looking back over the <i>Hansard </i>reports, I have discovered a long history of local concerns about addresses. It reached a peak in 2002, so much so that there was an exchange between Postcomm, the post office regulator, and the Post Office, which was persuaded to introduce a more flexible system&#151;a code of conduct&#151;for changing the postal address file at least. I have some feedback on how that system is or is not working.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para1"><a name="stpa_197">From the outset, I want to say that I fully understand the need for a standardised system. We have 28 million or 30 million homes in this country, with hundreds of millions of letters flying backwards and forwards. It is obviously important for the efficiency of sorting and distribution that there is a standardised system of post codes that can be read by machine. I fully understand that and why there need to be rules and an element of inflexibility. My basic concern is that the way in which the system operates is wholly inflexible and I want to ask the Minister whether there is anything that he can do. He is indirectly accountable for the Post Office and one stage removed from the regulator. Can the Government do anything to help deal with the problem?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para2"><a name="stpa_198">It might be helpful if I split the problem into two halves. The first is the issue of post codes and post towns, which are the inflexible part of the framework. The Post Office and the Royal Mail are clear that only in the most extreme circumstances can those be changed. That presents some serious practical problems, and I will enumerate a few that arise in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para3"><a name="stpa_199">One cluster of houses&#151;about 250 homes&#151;was transferred to my borough of Richmond and my constituency about 12 years ago. The address of those homes is Twickenham road, Twickenham. However, the Post Office requires the post code to be TW13. That requires the homes to be referred to as Hanworth, Feltham&#151;the post town of Feltham is in another constituency and another borough, Hounslow. That causes a great deal of confusion. Delivery people&#151;both postmen and delivery companies&#151;see the road signs for Twickenham, but they have a letter addressed to Feltham so they do not know what to do with it. A great many letters and deliveries go astray, leading to confusion and inefficiency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para4"><a name="stpa_200">Feelings were sufficiently strong for residents to petition and they involved me in the process. We took the matter up with the Royal Mail and invoked the support of the consumer watchdog, Postwatch, which was strongly supportive. We received an unequivocal 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 242WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
negative from the Royal Mail. All we were doing was asking it to update the post town system to reflect the change of administrative boundaries; it would not do it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"><a name="51206h04_spnew1"><b> David Mundell  (Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale)</b>  (Con): I want to mention a specific point about the regulations that apply to Postwatch, and in my case to Postwatch Scotland, which arose when I was taking up an individual case. The residents in the upper Tweed part of my constituency have an ML12 post code, which relates to the post town of Biggar, and although there have been no issues such as those set out by the hon. Gentleman about delivery problems, there have been numerous other problems such as identification with the wrong local authority region, being omitted from telephone directories and the effect on insurance costs. Postwatch is unable to support a referendum among local residents if it does not solely relate to the quality of the postal service. That is a deficiency in the regulations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"><a name="51206h04_spnew2"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : The hon. Gentleman is right. I entirely recognise the problem that he describes. I am, perhaps, somewhat more fortunate than him in that the consumer watchdog took up an identical case in my constituency and Postwatch was severely ticked off by the Royal Mail, which wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">&quot;I am . . . surprised that Postwatch have offered their support given the contents of the Code of Practice.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para5"><a name="stpa_201">The Post Office consumer watchdog was very firmly put in its place by the producers on that occasion. However, that is just one example; there are others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para6"><a name="stpa_202">In my constituency, there is a cluster of homes around the historic palace of Hampton Court. The residents live in the borough of Richmond, in the Twickenham area, but they are regarded by the Post Office as belonging to a Kingston post code&#151;KT8&#151;and are assigned the post town of East Molesey, which is a different community across the river in a different county, having no historical connection whatever. That causes great confusion. There is also part of a community named Whitton on the fringes of my constituency that has been allocated the post town of Hounslow, causing many comparable problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para7"><a name="stpa_203">What are the problems? The hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) listed some of them. First, a great deal of mail and delivery goes astray. Residents such as those involved in the Twickenham road case cited examples of crucial legal documents, bank statements and bills being returned to sender because the postmen did not know what to do with them. Several residents have described being offered books of stamps by way of compensation. That is ironic because the whole justification for the Post Office maintaining its inflexible system is to maintain efficiency. This is an inefficiency for which there is, apparently, no redress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para8"><a name="stpa_204">As the intervention of the hon. Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale suggested, post codes are often linked to commercial services with the result that references in the Thomson directory are misleading. Insurance is often based on post codes. In one area of my constituency, the crime rate is quite low due to good, safe neighbourhood policing, but residents are given home and car insurance quotations on the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 243WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
basis of their post code, which is in a different borough that has a much higher level of crime. Therefore, they pay a direct financial penalty as a result of the arbitrary allocation of a post code.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para9"><a name="stpa_205">There are more serious matters. After I had secured this debate, I received an e-mail from a Leeds councillor whom I had never met, but who had a very informative point. He wrote:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">&quot;I have several parts in my ward which, though in the Leeds . . . area, have Bradford postcodes. This causes confusion&#151;sometimes highly dangerous&#151;where people are taken to the &#039;wrong&#039; A&E Dept in emergencies, have calls transferred to the wrong police division, and are initially refused Council services&#151;not to mention the predictable problems with mail&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para10"><a name="stpa_206">Quite apart from the matters of commercial service, postal delivery and emergency services, there is the subtle psychological issue of identity. I do not represent an area where that is a powerful concern, but I believe that the Isle of Wight, for example, is not recognised by the Post Office, which regards it as part of Southampton. There are parts of Wales and, no doubt, Scotland that have English post codes and post towns. People in those areas value their identities and are disconcerted by that discrepancy. There are all sorts of reasons why a degree of flexibility should be introduced into the system governing post codes and post towns, while recognising the need for standardisation. A better balance should be struck.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para11"><a name="stpa_207">The second problem relates to an area where there should be more give in the system but, in practice, there is not. That is the system of Post Office address files under which a geographical identity can be added or subtracted. Subject to the rules suggested by the Post Office regulator, the Royal Mail will add those extra details, subject to a referendum. A change can be accepted if 50 per cent. of people vote in favour of it. Indeed, there is now a negative procedure in which a change that the Post Office recommends will be accepted if no more than 20 people object to it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para12"><a name="stpa_208">Despite the fact that there is now a democratic way of changing people&#039;s postal address file names, it does not work at all well in practice. There are some happy examples, however. A small town near Barnsley in Yorkshire managed to change its postal address file name as a result of a campaign led by the umpire Dickie Bird, an example that is often cited to me as a model of what is possible. A counter example from Whitton, a town in my area, has aroused very strong feelings and has given rise to a petition of several thousand signatures, which I shall deliver to the Minister and the Royal Mail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para13"><a name="stpa_209">My constituency is made up of many urban villages and towns. Whitton has a very strong sense of identity and history. It has five schools, four churches and a railway station. Ordnance survey maps going back 150 years refer to it. At its centre is the famous Kneller hall, the home of the Royal Military School of Music. There is a very powerful community association and a very active business association. There are also annual carnivals and much else. Its name, however, has been removed from the postal address file, which has had very serious consequences.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 244WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"><a name="51206h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Alun Michael) </b> : Such is the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s remarks that I hesitate to intervene, but does he accept that Whitton has never been on the Royal Mail&#039;s postal address file and so has never been eliminated, as he says it has been in his rather dramatic press release? Does he also accept that correspondence advising the citizens of Whitton how to petition and allow the change to be implemented has never been pursued, and that it would be more sensible to use the process rather than to petition?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51206h04_spnew3"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : The right hon. Gentleman is wrong about several facts, but we shall return to them. We used the process, but the Post Office refused us support for the change. That is why the democratic election choice was impossible, although we would be very happy to use it. The local council supports it, the MP supports it, which is one of the conditions, the chamber of commerce supports it, and the local community very much wants to have a ballot, as the code requires.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para14"><a name="stpa_210">The Minister is right to suggest that I used slightly colourful language in saying that Whitton was &quot;eliminated&quot;, and that it was probably never included in the first place, but the situation has become more serious in that increasing numbers of commercial vehicles are using the postal address file while Thomson directories&#039; maps, for example, no longer refer to Whitton. The telephone directory gives Twickenham, a town four miles away, as the address. Local atlases do not refer to Whitton at all.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para15"><a name="stpa_211">Some of the practical problems that arise as a result are quite serious. Delivery vans often turn up in the borough looking for, say, Kneller road in Whitton, but all the directories refer to it as Kneller road in Twickenham, so they look in Twickenham, which is four miles away. Deliveries very often go astray, and a great deal of inconvenience is caused to businesses and individuals. Associated with that is a very strong sense that the identity of a community is being lost, and all the community groups are now pressing for a change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para16"><a name="stpa_212">The Minister said that the local communities have not used the appropriate methods, but there has been extensive correspondence, which I can show the Minister, in which the local community associations and I have pressed the Royal Mail to hold a ballot to make the necessary change. The Royal Mail has simply refused to support the change. The reasons that it has given, which the consumer watchdog describes as inflexible, bear no relationship to the standard arguments that it advances about the need for a sophisticated computer-based sorting system. It refers to the confusion that could arise among the manual sorters. It refers to confusion that could arise among the manual sorters. It is difficult to understand the arguments. Indeed, the post office consumer body, which has no axe to grind&#151;there is no reason for it to support us&#151;takes much the same view. However, if the Minister thinks that all that is required is for the local community to activate the process, we shall be delighted to do that. The key bodies, the council, the chamber of commerce and I are all in favour and anxious to achieve the necessary change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para17"><a name="stpa_213">To conclude, I ask two things of the Minister. First, is it possible to have some flexibility in relation to post codes and post towns, rather than the current rigid 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 245WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
refusal to contemplate change? I understand about economies of scale and the need for standardisation, but surely some kind of cost-benefit analysis must be made. There are severe costs in some cases&#151;the 250 homes in Twickenham road that I cited make a good example. Can we not have some mechanism by which the Royal Mail is required to evaluate costs and benefits, and to allow a process of change?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para18"><a name="stpa_214">Secondly, we seem to have run into the buffers in relation to the PAFs&#151;I mentioned the example of Whitton. There is a process for change, but if the Post Office refuses to contemplate it, it is difficult to use it. Can the Minister help by finding a way around that obstacle?
</p>

<a name="51206h04_time1"><h5>1.46 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_47"><a name="51206h04_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Industry and the Regions  (Alun Michael) </b> : I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the debate, and I shall try to address all the points raised by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). However, I urge him to be more accurate in future press releases, rather than chasing the quick headline.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para19"><a name="stpa_215">I share instinctively his view of the importance of place, and his feeling that identity as a community and as a society depends largely on having a sense of place. It follows that, as community animals, we will want any post code to reflect both place and community. However, let us reflect on purpose: what is the post code for? What is the point of a post town?
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para20"><a name="stpa_216">As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, the Royal Mail manages a massive operation that extends to every house and business in the United Kingdom. Its operational success is based on the efficient use of postal addresses, particularly post codes. Some 84 million postal items are delivered every day, and more than 950 million parcels every year. To meet its obligation to provide a universal postal service, Royal Mail has given every house and business in the UK a postal address. There are 27.5 million addresses and 1.7 million post codes, one for every 15 UK addresses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para21"><a name="stpa_217">Why has Royal Mail specified a correct way of addressing post to help its operations? Every delivery point in the UK has a postal address. Customers are encouraged to use the correct postal address, for the simple purpose of avoiding delays. A minimum amount of information is required by Royal Mail for accurate sorting and delivery: the addressee&#039;s name, the house number or name, the locality name, the town and the post code. The post code enables small numbers of adjacent properties&#151;sometimes a single property&#151;to be identified. The Royal Mail&#039;s postal address file&#151;the PAF, to which the hon. Gentleman referred&#151;also includes other information relevant to a postal address, such as the names of businesses. The file is subject to continuous updating to reflect changes in postal address information such as new housing developments and the renumbering of buildings or renaming of roads.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para22"><a name="stpa_218">A post code is not a definition of personal or communal identity, it is a sorting and routing instruction. Its sole purpose in the postal context is to help to identify the most efficient route for delivering 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 246WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
mail to customers. Society might use it in a variety of other ways, but that is what it is for, and why it was designed in the first place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"><a name="51206h04_spnew4"><b> David Mundell </b> : Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51206h04_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael </b> : No. The hon. Gentleman really ought to check protocol before he seeks to intervene in an Adjournment debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para23"><a name="stpa_219">The post code allocated to each district and address is linked to Royal Mail&#039;s network of sorting and delivery offices. It was never intended to signify a geographically definitive address by local authority or other administrative boundary. Indeed, it is not a geographically accurate description of where a property is located, which explains some of the examples given by the hon. Member for Twickenham. It might include the name of the town where the delivery office is situated, which might be several miles away, or even in a different county.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para24"><a name="stpa_220">I said that I instinctively shared the hon. Gentleman&#039;s affection for the identity of place, and the situation can be even worse, in that the town referred to by the post code might even be in a different country. Places such as Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant have what appears to be an Oswestry post code and address. That can be a bit disconcerting, unless one accepts Owain Glyndwr&#039;s world view, in which case not only Oswestry, but Exeter, Gloucester and Leicester as well, are in Wales. However, the post code is not about perception or community, or even national identity; it is about delivery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para25"><a name="stpa_221">The hon. Gentleman referred to the use of the name Whitton, but that has never been a post town, as used by Royal Mail under the postal address file; it is used as a locality in the Twickenham post town area, so it follows that it has not been &quot;eliminated&quot; as such. Currently, it is used only it is if required to identify similarly named streets in the Twickenham area, such High street, Whitton, Twickenham.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para26"><a name="stpa_222">Royal Mail received a request from a resident of the Whitton area in November 2004 asking for Whitton to be reinstated in the addresses of the area. It was explained that Whitton was not required as part of the postal address for the efficient delivery of mail, but that the code of practice allowed for its inclusion if certain criteria determined in the code were met. The three criteria are that inclusion of the name would not have an adverse affect on Royal Mail services&#151;in other words, that the primary purpose of using names was met&#151;that support for the change is obtained from customer representatives for the area, and that a clearly defined set of geographical boundary data are provided.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para27"><a name="stpa_223">That would have allowed Royal Mail to undertake a consultation with affected residents, and if less than 20 per cent. objected, Whitton would have been included as a locality in the Twickenham post town area. Royal Mail never received a response to its letter. The residents of Whitton still have that option available to them. The hon. Member for Twickenham might feel that he gets a good deal of publicity locally by drawing up a petition, but as I have said, there is an avenue open to him to achieve the change, if it has the support that he claims.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"><a name="51206h04_spnew6"><b> Dr. Cable </b> : May I point out for the record that there was extensive correspondence with Royal Mail in 2003, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Dec 2005 : Column 247WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
the year before that letter was sent? It explored all the options, but Royal Mail specifically refused to allow a democratic ballot.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"><a name="51206h04_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael </b> : I have given the hon. Gentleman the reply, and I think that he is wriggling. I suggest that he use the process, rather than asking for it to be changed. It would make provision for Whitton to be included, if such a change had the support that he suggests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para28"><a name="stpa_224">As I said, I instinctively accept that there can be problems with other uses, or the sense of location, if the purpose of the post code is misunderstood. That can sometimes affect the perceptions of an area. If other organisations&#151;whether private or public, or in central or local government&#151;decide to use post codes for other purposes, they must recognise and take account of the limitations of the PAF and post codes. Postcomm&#039;s 2003 consultation on the issue concluded that it was not reasonable to hold Royal Mail responsible for the use to which other bodies put the information that it provided. If there is evidence of a problem caused by the way in which the PAF is used by third parties, it should be brought to the attention of the authority with responsibility for the service in question.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para29"><a name="stpa_225">The UK post code system was developed by Royal Mail in the 1960s to sort mail more efficiently, and to cope with population growth and increasing mail volumes. Efficiency is achieved by using the one-line post code as a shortcut for the full postal address. In an electronic age, the advantages of that must be manifest to everybody. If other organisations use the post code system for other purposes, they need to understand properly the way in which the post code system is constructed. They also need to understand that although flexibility seems attractive, it would result in a large number of complaints if it led to confusion in the delivery of mail. Mail with a post code can be sorted more quickly, accurately and efficiently. The alphanumeric combination used in the UK post code structure has proved robust, resilient and easy for mail users and the public to remember. That is why the UK has one of the highest levels of post code use in the world.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para30"><a name="stpa_226">Royal Mail continues to develop and maintain high standards of post code compliance. That has a direct influence on its mail processing efficiency. Its automated sorting systems, address interpretation and optical character recognition machinery function by matching addresses against the postal address file. The routes taken by the men and women who deliver our post throughout the country are similarly devised on the basis of the postal address file.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para31"><a name="stpa_227">The code of practice was adopted by Postcomm in 2001 to govern changes to Royal Mail&#039;s post code address file. It was reviewed in 2004 and adopted by Royal Mail. Under that code of practice, changes can be made for two reasons: first, to maintain or improve the service offered by Royal Mail&#151;I am sure that that would have the support of everybody in this Chamber&#151;and secondly, to reflect consumer demand. In the first case, Royal Mail can review the way in which it routes its mail to provide a better service. That may happen as a result of the siting of a new delivery office, new housing or business development, or the renumbering of buildings or renaming of roads by local authorities. In such cases, Royal Mail reviews existing post codes or addresses to maintain efficient handling and delivery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para32"><a name="stpa_228">Under the code of practice, Royal Mail will also consider requests from customers for changes to postal addresses. Locality information can be changed if the request is widely supported by customer representatives, such as Postwatch, local authorities, parish or district councils and Members of Parliament. An acceptable and clearly defined set of geographical boundary data must be available and there should be no significant level of objection from those affected by the proposed change of address.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para33"><a name="stpa_229">In that event, Royal Mail writes to all affected addresses to advise them of the proposed change, giving customers who are likely to be affected the opportunity to register concerns or objections. As I have already indicated, if fewer than 20 per cent. of those affected register objections, the change can be made with immediate effect under the fast track system introduced in the code in 2004. If 20 per cent. or more of those affected raise objections, Royal Mail will carry out a poll of all households affected by the change. The decision on the change is based on a simple majority ruling. Royal Mail aims to conclude such polls and implement any address changes within two months of the ballot.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para34"><a name="stpa_230">Changes to post towns affect a large number of addresses and have widespread implications. A post town acts as a clearing point for a particular district, so it is the basic unit of the postal delivery system. However, as I have indicated, that has implications for the perceptions of identification of localities, which sometimes go across not only local authority boundaries but even national boundaries. Royal Mail will consider requests for changes to post towns only when an area is being recoded to meet an operational need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para35"><a name="stpa_231">The post code forms the basis of Royal Mail&#039;s distribution network. Any change to post codes could compromise Royal Mail&#039;s operations, resulting in a poorer service to customers. We should be hesitant about introducing anything that would undermine the consistency of the service. Royal Mail will consider making changes to the last two characters of a post code in exceptional circumstances, but before it does, it requires evidence that all those affected by the change are in favour of it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206h04_para36"><a name="stpa_232">It is for the individual initiating such a request to obtain the necessary support. That is because Royal Mail&#039;s primary concern is to ensure that it can deliver mail efficiently to its customers. It will not consider making changes to the postal addresses that do not serve to improve its operational efficiency. I am sure that the hon. Member for Twickenham and others will, if they consider that process, accept that the first and most important consideration must be that Royal Mail is able to deliver an effective service in undertaking its responsibilities to deliver to all properties throughout the country.
