<a name="50406h01_head1"><h3 align=center>Tax Credits</h3>




<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>, That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;[<i>Mr. Jim Murphy</i>.]



</p>




<a name="50406h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>



<p><a name="50406h01_spnew0"><b> John Thurso  (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</b>  (LD): I am delighted to have secured this debate and to be able to highlight problems that are causing misery and hardship not only in my constituency but, judging from the number of Members in the Chamber, in all constituencies. Citizens Advice Scotland sent me a briefing earlier this week saying that the problem is causing real hardship. It also said that the problem is working against both the Government&#039;s policy of social inclusion and against the Scottish Executive&#039;s policy on debt relief and debt help in Scotland. Citizens Advice has also produced a leaflet; I do not have a copy, but I understand that it is entitled &quot;Debt Problems and Tax Credits&quot;.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para0">I start by stating what it is that I seek to achieve this morning, and what it is that I do not seek to achieve. I say immediately that I do not seek to question the policy of tax credits. Indeed, I welcome the real help that the policy has given to many of my constituents; many hard-up families are undoubtedly better off for it. I appreciate the help that the system has given them. No; I seek to highlight what I believe to be a serious deficiency in the administration of the policy, which is causing severe hardship to a small but significant number of my constituents. That small number of people have just as much right to be properly treated by the system as those for whom there has been no problem.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para1">I shall focus on the question of overpayment. I am not speaking of overpayments that have come about through any fault of the claimant, nor those that have resulted through fraud or attempted fraud. I speak only of overpayments caused by Revenue error. Overpayments can come about in a variety of ways. For instance, income might have risen by more than &#163;2,500 during the tax year, but the claimant did not inform the Inland Revenue; or the claimant did not inform the Revenue of a change of circumstances; and the information supplied by the claimant could have been incorrect. Lastly, it could be caused by official error&#151;a miscalculation on the part of the Revenue. It is on that last point that I shall focus.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para2">I draw attention to two points. The first is that when claimants have done everything in their power to advise the Revenue of a change of circumstance or have said that they think something has been done badly or incorrectly, the system, like some Orwellian photocopier, keeps churning out awards and demands and completely ignores the contact that the claimant has made. The second is the sheer volume&#151;
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew1"><b> David Taylor  (North-West Leicestershire)</b>  (Lab/Co-op): I do not want to anticipate the hon. Gentleman, but I wonder whether he would include in that list of 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 438WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
examples the steady stream of families that return money that they are pretty certain they are not entitled to, only to be reassured that it is part of their entitlement&#151;and then, to their chagrin, they are landed with an overpayment assessment at the end of the year. Such circumstances are pretty difficult to understand.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew2"><b> John Thurso </b> : The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on one of the main problems that I seek to address today. I have confined myself to three examples, but I suspect that hon. Members on both sides of the House will have 20, 30 40 or even 50 examples in their caseload. The problem is that people have recognised that they have been overpaid and have sought to give the money back. In one of the cases to which I shall refer, a lady tried to repay the money by cheque and was told that there was no facility for receiving it. Ultimately, after having insisted and been told that the money was hers, she eventually spent it. Such people find themselves in hardship and debt as a result.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para3">The second point is the sheer volume of errors, either human or computer, that now seem to occur within the system. I begin by asking the Minister some simple questions. First, is not the credit system designed to help those who are worst off and most dependent on help? Secondly, are not those people, by the very nature of their circumstances, among the most challenged? They often live in the most difficult circumstances, and the system should be a lifeline, rather than a torpedo. Thirdly, is it reasonable to expect such people to second-guess a system whose complexity is such that even trained accountants and Revenue personnel find it difficult to understand the problem at the heart of each case?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para4">The problems first started to come to my attention several months into the 2003 financial year. There was a steady stream of complaints from those who had previously received working families tax credit. As a result of the migration from that credit to the working tax credit and the child tax credit, one or other of the two entitlements was getting lost and families were suffering. At the time, I put that down simply to a change in the system and I did my best to deal with the problems, as I am sure that other hon. Members did.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para5">At this point, I must pay tribute to those who work on and service the hotline for MPs, because my office and I have had a phenomenal service from them. They have taken tremendous care and made a great effort. Sometimes, they have been on the telephone with my office for more than an hour at a time, and they have worked hard to make corrections and issue emergency awards to relieve hardship. In a way, it is a testimony to the difficult nature and depth of the problem that, notwithstanding their effort, I have had to refer so many cases to Ministers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para6">Over the past year, the issue of overpayment has come very much to the forefront of my work. In the overwhelming number of cases that have been brought to my attention, the error has occurred when claimants&#039; circumstances have changed. For example, one partner has gone back to work, or the wife has come off maternity leave. The claimants have notified the changes to the Revenue, which has noted the additional income for the spouse who has gone back to work, but it has somehow deleted the income for the spouse whose circumstances have remained unchanged. That seems to be one of the root causes of the problem.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 439WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para7">In a parliamentary question, I asked the Chancellor


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;how many (a) working and (b) child tax credit award notices issued to couples in 2003&#150;04 omitted the earnings of one of the partners resulting in an overpayment which the Revenue is now seeking to recover&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para8">The Paymaster General started her answer with the helpful comment:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The information requested is not available.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para9">She then went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Inland Revenue is aware of a small number of occasions in 2003&#150;04 when a tax credit award notice omitted the earnings of one partner. No separate records are available of precisely how many cases were involved.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 1 March 2005; Vol. 431, c. 1064W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para10">On 10 January, the Paymaster General made a statement in answer to another question. She said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;By the end of December 2004 about 78,000 taxpayers had returned Form TC846, or had otherwise been recorded as requesting the write-off of their overpayments on grounds of official error. About 41,000 requests had been decided by that date, and about 1,600 families had their overpayments written off for that reason.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, 10&nbsp;January 2005; Vol. 429, c. 129W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para11">Pursuant to my earlier question, I asked further


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;whether the omission of earnings of one partner on tax credits awards issued in 2003&#150;04 occurred as a result of (a) human processing error and (b) a computer systems failure.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para12">In response, the Paymaster General said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This error occurred when staff did not follow the correct procedure to update the tax credits computer system with more recent information&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, 4&nbsp;April 2005; Vol. 432, c. 1176W.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para13">That was the critical part of her answer, which changes the nature of the problem, from a software or computer problem, for which the Revenue had agreed to waive the overpayment, to a human error, for which the Revenue will not make payment. That might explain why, of the 78,000 taxpayers returning the form and the 41,000 requests decided, a mere 1,600 people had their overpayments waived.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew3"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman endorse the view of a number of organisations campaigning on the issue that the right to recover overpayments resulting from official error ought to be ended and, rather wider of that point, that there ought to be statutory tests for recoverability, which should not operate in a framework that owes too much to the discretion of the individual assessing the case?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew4"><b> John Thurso </b> : I agree with the hon. Gentleman. One of the things that strikes me most when comparing the social security system with the tax credit system is that in each case the social security system has a proper appeal procedure, ending in an almost judicial process, whereas there is no such process in the credit system. Each decision is entirely down to the choice of the particular official dealing with the case. It would be much more helpful if there were at least a proper set of guidelines or, at best, a formal system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para14">I asked the Minister another question. The Paymaster General referred to &quot;a small number of people&quot;, but what is a small number? If my case work is anything to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 440WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
go by, the number may be small to the Treasury, but not to those who are affected by it&#151;in fact, the issue is the biggest in my case work. I have to deal with the full range of issues, right across the spectrum, as, I am sure, does every hon. Member. However, tax credits has more files than any other item. Why are the details not being kept? I have experience of being a non-executive director of a plc and if we behaved like that, we would be brought to book by the authorities, because we would be required to keep such details and information. At the very least, we would be lambasted by a consumer organisation, and no doubt the Government or this place would be seeking to legislate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para15">I shall refer to the three cases that I have chosen as examples. I shall not use the names of the constituents, because I have not had an opportunity to ask them about that, and it would not be fair to use their precise names. However, I am in correspondence with the Paymaster General in connection with all three cases, and would be happy to give the Minister the names afterwards if he so wished. I was going to call the cases Mr. and Mrs. S, and so forth, until I discovered that the first two surnames both began with S, so instead I shall refer to them as case A, and so on. I also thought of referring to them as Mr. and Mrs. Caithness, Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland, and Mr. and Mrs. Easter Ross, but I shall stick with case A.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para16">In 2003, the husband was in work. The wife notified the Inland Revenue of her return to work following the birth of their baby. Both their P60s, and seven payslips for the two of them, were handed in to the Inland Revenue office. The wife&#039;s earnings were recorded but, unbeknown to the couple, the husband&#039;s earnings were deleted. The couple took on a new housing commitment: they bought a house, and took on a mortgage based on their income as calculated in light of the award. They did not enter into that commitment lightly, and it is not something that they could get out of lightly.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para17">In 2004, the couple were told by the Inland Revenue that there had been an overpayment of &#163;2,444. The Revenue admits the error, but the Paymaster General told me in a letter of 10 March that the Inland Revenue did not think that it was reasonable for the couple to believe that their award was correct when only one income was shown on the form. I have here the actual form from which it is supposed they should reasonably have deduced that there was a mistake. It has the wife&#039;s name quite clearly on one side, and underneath it says that she works 16 hours a week. The husband&#039;s name is underneath, and the form says that he works 40 hours a week. Under &quot;total income&quot; they have given the correct total for the two of them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para18">The form asks the couple to tell the Revenue if their annual income gets above a certain amount&#151;and a figure of &#163;7,560 is given opposite the section filled in by &quot;Mrs. Sutherland&quot;&#151;as they may receive too much tax credit and may be asked to pay back the amount awarded. There is nothing in the form or in its layout to suggest that that figure refers to the combined total of the two incomes, which is stated on the form and which is, in fact, correct. The couple were, in my view, reasonably entitled to feel that they had been given a correct award. As I said, they took on a mortgage as a result of that reward, and are now in severe difficulties in attempting to deal with the situation that has come 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 441WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about. I do not believe that the ordinary literate and numerate man or woman on the street can reasonably be expected to find their way around a system with that degree of complexity.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para19">The second case is of a husband who was made redundant in 2003. He informed all the relevant authorities, and he received jobseeker&#039;s allowance and a tax credit award. In May 2004, he started a new job, and all the authorities were informed of the change of circumstances. A steady flow of letters arrived from the Inland Revenue&#151;in fact, he received seven in one day. He came to a clinic that I held in a village hall near where he lives, and produced a paper bag, from which he tipped a phenomenal pile of papers. I thought that I had problems filling out and dealing with my own tax demand, but when I saw the sheer complexity of his case, I thought to myself, &quot;One would really need to employ an accountant to go through all of that.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para20">The situation went on from there. It culminated, on 21 September 2004, with the couple receiving a demand for repayment of a child tax credit of &#163;2,248.71 and of a working tax credit of &#163;1,528.99. In a subsequent telephone call to the Inland Revenue, the couple were informed that the overpayment now stood at some &#163;3,800&#151;nearly &#163;4,000&#151;for the one tax credit, and at &#163;2,300 for the other. Again, the Paymaster General has received details of this case. The couple are still awaiting a full explanation and clarification of their position. Between 5 February and 7 February this year, the couple received a further nine different award notices from the Inland Revenue, and on 26 February a further eight award notices were received. If the test is one of reasonableness, is it really reasonable that a constituent should be expected to deal with that volume of paperwork coming through their letterbox?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew5"><b> David Taylor </b> : All this seems so familiar to those of us who were practising accountants when self-assessment was introduced. Eventually, the Inland Revenue got on top of that, and I hope that it will do so in this case. However, is it not unreasonable that of the 7 million families in the country, the 3 million that receive tax credit to the extent that it wipes out their tax liability should be provided with such impenetrable statements and that there should be no obligation to calculate separately and notify any alleged overpayment?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew6"><b> John Thurso </b> : The hon. Gentleman again makes the exact point about the sheer complexity of the system. Let us not forget that that system is designed to help people who are most disadvantaged and on the lowest incomes. Although I do not for a moment suggest that they are of any less intellectual value than anybody else, such people, by their very nature and the circumstances in which they find themselves, are least likely to have either access to the professional help that is needed or the time to deal with such problems.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew7"><b> Mr. John Burnett  (Torridge and West Devon)</b>  (LD): The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) made the point that the accountancy profession mastered self-assessment. The private sector is involved in that, because it is financially worth its while. However, in this matter, as my hon. Friend implies, there is little incentive for the private sector to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 442WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
give assistance because the people involved&#151;the claimants who have been wronged&#151;do not have the money or resources to pay for the relevant advice.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew8"><b> John Thurso </b> : My hon. Friend has again put his finger on the button. Before I come to the third case, I should like to refer to what the ombudsman said to the Public Administration Committee on 2 December 2004:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;If you have six different award notices and you have no real idea which of those, if any, is right, having a debate about whether you reasonably believed that that was the right figure is not helpful in those circumstances.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para21">There is a wide opinion, shared on both sides of the House and among professionals, that there is a very real problem that has to be dealt with.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para22">I shall touch on the third case. It involves a couple, one of whom has knowledge of the tax credit calculations through his employment; he works in a citizen&#039;s advice office. At the end of November and the beginning of December 2003, he started to telephone the tax credit office to say that he believed that an error had been made in the calculation. No adjustment was made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para23">On 12 January 2004, he confirmed in writing to the tax credit office his belief that the calculation had been wrongly made. He was particularly concerned not to build up overpayment, and he made five subsequent telephone calls. In the first, he was told that the case would be looked at. In the second, he was told not to worry, that the matter would be sorted out in April and that the Inland Revenue would treat it as a loan. In the third call, he asked whether he could repay by cheque, but was told that there was no facility to enable him to do that. The official responding to the fourth call said that there was no knowledge of any difficulties with the case at all. During his fifth call, made in April 2004, he was told by the Inland Revenue that it would now update its records.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para24">It finally transpired that a zero had been mistakenly left off his recorded earnings. In August last year, the Revenue admitted that error, but informed my constituent that it did not think it reasonable for him to believe that his award was correct. In fact, he had spent five months asking the Revenue to check the calculation. Last month, he received notice of a new award and, at the same time, a demand for an overpayment of &#163;4,779.29.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para25">I have given only three examples, but I suspect that all of them could be replicated in the casework of other Members here. The examples that I have given represent only the tip of the iceberg of what I have in my office; some 25 or 30 other cases are currently under way, and they have three things in common. First, the claimants did everything by the book. Secondly, the error, whether human or computer, was with the Revenue and thirdly, the resulting stress and hardship has achieved the diametric opposite of the intention of the policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para26">The Minister might wish to tell me how many of my constituents have benefited from the policy; I am happy to accept that and will not dispute it. He can, if he wants to, blame it all on the claimants. However, because I suspect that he is in politics for pretty much the same reason that I am&#151;to help those who need it most&#151;he could accept that there is a real problem causing genuine hardship for a small but significant number of our citizens, and could use the power of his office to deal with it.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 443WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para27">The test is reasonableness. Is it reasonable to award desperate and hard-up families life-giving succour one day, only brusquely to withdraw it at a later stage&#151;so increasing their difficulties&#151;all through administrative incompetence? Is it reasonable to issue forms so complex that trained accountants and the Revenue&#039;s own staff have difficulty dealing with them, and is it reasonable to operate a system with a fault level that would not be tolerated in any other organisation? I would say no to all three of those questions; it is not reasonable.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para28">I end with the case of a young mother who was so desperate because of the circumstances that she found herself in that my office staff feared for her life. Finally, in desperation, they phoned the officials involved to say that that was their belief. The hotline responded magnificently; emergency aid was given and all was well in that case. However, I wonder how long it will be before somebody in such desperate circumstances does resort to desperate measures. I hope that the Minister, having heard the cases that I have described and the examples given by other hon. Members, will realise that the problem may be small, but it is very significant for those whom it affects. Please will he think about what can be done to put right the appalling problem of overpayments and seriously consider waiving the payments in those cases in which the fault is clearly not on the part of the claimant, but has arisen from an error in the system, be it human or computer.

</p>




<a name="50406h01_time1"><h5>9.58 am</h5>



<p><a name="50406h01_spnew9"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones  (North Durham)</b>  (Lab): I think that my second or third contribution to a debate in the House was on Second Reading of what became the Tax Credits Act 2002. I supported it then as good policy, and it is nice to see the difference that it has made to many families in a short time. I concur with the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) about the assistance that it is giving&#151;certainly in North Durham&#151;to many hard-working families, taking away the stigma of claiming benefit and allowing them to go to work. Along with the record increase in child benefit and other policies of this Labour Government, it has made a real difference in my constituency and everywhere else. I make no apology for the policy. We should be proud of it, and should champion it from the rooftops.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para29">I am annoyed, however, when a flagship policy such as this, which is making so much difference&#151;I meet people every day who have benefited from it, especially young women who would not previously have been able to go to work, but who now can&#151;is damaged by administrative incompetence. When I was in local government, I was always annoyed when people got sent round the system. People such as those who have just been described should not have to go through so many difficulties to claim a benefit that should be their right.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para30">I wish to raise four cases. When I asked for examples, my office staff said, &quot;How many do you want?&quot; The other issue, which I am sure many hon. Members have realised, is that officers are inundated with inquiries. They spent a lot time dealing with these cases, some of which involve desperate people. We are not talking 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 444WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about people who can accept that one week their income will drop by &#163;10 or even &#163;20. They live on tax credits and rely on them for budgeting their family income. It is unacceptable for people to be treated in this way.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew10"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does my hon. Friend agree, as I do, with the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) that the staff who support the MPs&#039; hotline are top quality people with good communication skills who deal with these issues in an accurate way? Is it not a pity that those characteristics are not more widely shared among the operational staff in the Inland Revenue?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew11"><b> Mr. Jones </b> : I do, but it is sad that constituents have to come to their MPs to get an answer to these problems. When they ring the Inland Revenue they do not get the same service as we get, which is not right. They should be able to get answers to their questions and be dealt with properly. I shall give examples of people who are still waiting for replies to letters several months down the line.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para31">The hotline has been useful, but both the Inland Revenue and the Department are not very good at replying to Members&#039; letters about these cases. It makes it difficult for MPs because, as the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said a few minutes ago, we are dealing with people who want help. They cannot wait for two or three weeks. I have an abhorrence of debt, which is shared by most people in working-class communities. It is wrong that such people, through no fault of their own, end up thinking that they owe the system money. I shall make a suggestion in a minute: the Minister might find it controversial, but it needs to be considered.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para32">I want to focus on four cases, which touch on similar issues to those raised by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. I also want to describe how these people have been treated by the system before my office became involved. The first case is that of Mark McGough and Victoria Kerry of Catchgate. They contacted me in December 2004 when their payments suddenly stopped without explanation. They contacted the tax credit office, which told them that it was because there had been an overpayment. On further inspection the tax credit office explained that the overpayment had&nbsp;occurred because the calculation assumed that Mr.&nbsp;McGough and Miss Kerry had no income. That was totally incorrect, as they were both in work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para33">Their award notice clearly stated their correct income and so they assumed that the tax credit that they were receiving was correct. The information on that form was used by the tax credit office to calculate their tax credit. A mistake was made by the Inland Revenue and my constituents were not responsible for the overpayment. It could be argued that they should have raised the matter. But how could they? The notice they received was correct and stated their correct income.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para34">I am pursuing this case because I believe that in such cases the money should be written off. My constituents were in no position to suggest that their payments were incorrect. The people who I have been dealing with are simple, hard-working and honest individuals. They have been honest with the Inland Revenue in terms of providing information. They have not tried to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 445WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
manipulate or hoodwink the system. They have been open and honest and have got into these situations through no fault of their own.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para35">The second case is that of Mr. and Mrs. Hall of West Pelton. They have had a difficult time with the tax credit office. They originally contacted me in July 2004. They had received numerous conflicting claim notices, which led on two or three occasions to the withdrawal of credits with no explanation. I asked the tax credit office to investigate and in August I received a reply, stating that everything had been resolved, and that the Halls would receive regular payments from then on. However, there was no explanation of the mistaken stopping of the other payments. All that was said was that&#151;I hate this explanation, as I did when I was in local government&#151;the system had a failure in it. That is not acceptable. I want to know the reasons for the payments being stopped, and I think that the people concerned deserve to know them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para36">That state of affairs continued until December and January, when the Halls suddenly received an overpayment notice, although they had been receiving regular payments for the previous six months. The tax credit office appears confused about how that happened. It is another instance in which Mr. and Mrs. Hall have been entirely honest and up-front, and have provided the system with all the relevant information, but have been given no explanation for the overpayment. That is another matter that I am still pursuing by letter, although I have yet to receive a reply.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para37">The next case that I want to mention concerns Miss&nbsp;Julie Simm, of Perkinsville in my constituency, who contacted me to say that the tax credit office said that she had been overpaid. She had supplied all the correct information about her income and her partner&#039;s income, and therefore could not understand why she had been told that an overpayment had been made. Again, the cause was error on the part of the tax credit office.The remarkable thing about the case is that, before Miss Simms received the notice, she realised that she was being overpaid and contacted the tax credit office to inform it of that. Nothing was done; it took 42 days to reduce the payments, so an overpayment was accrued.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para38">I wrote to the Paymaster General on 19 January and received a reply last week, which is, I think, unacceptable. Her letter really just supported the system, stating, in effect&#151;this is the traditional response from the tax credit office&#151;&quot;Yes, we did make a mistake, but you should have noticed it, so it is not now our fault.&quot; Well, my constituent recognised the mistake and told the tax credit office, which did nothing about it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para39">She thus accrued an overpayment, whereas if the office had acted when she contacted it she would not have done. I do not think that she should have to pay the overpayment, just because of the inefficiency of that office. I have written to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and look forward to a reply&#151;which I doubt will arrive this side of the election, but may possibly come later in the year.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para40">The next case I want to mention concerns Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong, of the Gardens, Chester-le-Street, and it is another extraordinary one. The couple have been honest with the Inland Revenue; they received their regular payments, and realised that in one month they 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 446WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
received two payments. They contacted the tax office and said that they thought that they had been paid twice. Mrs. Armstrong was told that the two payments were correct, because of an underpayment earlier in the year owing to the birth of their fourth child.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para41">Mrs. Armstrong accepted that explanation and used the money in good faith as part of the family budget, as, I think, anyone else would in the circumstances. Subsequently, the tax credit office contacted the couple to say that there had been an error and, therefore, an overpayment. It had sent an overpayment notice, telling them to pay the money back. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) raised the issue of professional advice; Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong obtained such advice from Hazel Tindale of Book Keeping Services Ltd., who acted on their behalf. She wrote on 20 August 2004 and, lo and behold, is still waiting for a reply to her letter. So the Inland Revenue still ignores individuals, even when they contact professional services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para42">The Armstrongs appealed, but their appeal was rejected because, as the tax credit office said in its letter,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We have decided that the overpayment was not due to a mistake on our part&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para43">That is unacceptable, particularly as the tax credit office admitted to the Armstrongs in the same letter that they were paid twice. Clearly this was the tax credit office&#039;s mistake. Mrs. Armstrong told the tax credit office that she believed that she was not entitled to the money, so I do not know how it can reject her appeal.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para44">I wrote to the Inland Revenue in October 2004 and again received a letter in December&#151;two months later&#151;from Barrie Rushton, the assistant director of customer relations at the tax credit office, who promised to have the case reviewed. However, the overpayments team refused to review the case when he referred it to them, reiterating the point that was made earlier.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para45">Despite several phone calls from my office to the MPs&#039; hotline to try to secure a review of the case, the tax credit office continues to say that the overpayment is the Armstrongs&#039; responsibility, and continues to reduce their monthly payments to recoup the money. As I said, the Armstrongs did everything in their power to tell the Inland Revenue that they thought that they had been overpaid, so I repeat that the money should simply be written off in such cases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para46">I said at the beginning that I am proud of the tax credit. I suppose that I am because it has genuinely helped many poor and hard-working families in my constituency. These cases discredit the system, even if they are in the minority, although I have lost count of the number of cases that I have in my office. I strongly suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that we write off the money in cases where people have been totally honest and up front and have given all the information to the Inland Revenue that it requires. Overpayments have been made through no fault of their own. If we do not write this money off for these people, they will have the hardship of having their monthly incomes substantially reduced to recoup the overpayments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para47">As I said, these people have already suffered a great deal of heartache and frustration. They have had to ring the Inland Revenue constantly and have sometimes had to employ people to do that on their behalf, but they 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 447WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have got nowhere and have simply been sent around the system. It always makes me angry when one gets sent round the system time and time again.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para48">I urge the Minister to resolve these issues, otherwise a flagship policy will be dented and people will continue to suffer hardships through no fault of their own.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew12"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I remind hon. Members that the winding-up speeches should start at 10.30 am.

</p>




<a name="50406h01_time2"><h5>10.13 am</h5>



<p><a name="50406h01_spnew13"><b> Mr. Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b>  (Con): I have consulted my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young), and I believe that only two Back-Bencher speeches remain to be made. We have agreed how much time he needs, so I hope that I comply with his requests and his needs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para49">I genuinely wish to congratulate the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) on securing this important debate and on the manner in which he introduced it. I express my appreciation for the remarks of the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr.&nbsp;Jones). This is a matter of pressing importance to far too many hard-working, decent and honest families.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para50">My wife is my constituency secretary, and hardly a day seems to go by without a telephone call from another family in desperate circumstances. It is interesting to note that so many of these cases are dealt with on the telephone because their sheer complexity is overwhelming. They would overwhelm me; I cannot cope with my tax return, and I certainly could not cope with the working families tax credit if it got into the sorts of difficulties that my constituents have so often experienced. It also takes a considerable amount of time to sort out these difficulties.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para51">I do not know what the problem is, but I am more sceptical about the whole tax credit system than the hon. Member for North Durham. I am not sure whether the problem lies in inadequate systems, particularly in information technology, or in the poor training of staff. It has been suggested that it might simply be because the Inland Revenue is better at taking money from people than giving it away, and that it is &quot;a culture thing&quot;. That is quite a plausible explanation. Could it be that personal lifestyles are too complex to enable such a system to function at all? We have had problems like this in the past: there was a disability issue in my first Parliament&#151;1992 to 1997&#151;when I was overwhelmed by complaints about the way in which that system worked, but that could be sorted out because disability can be measured relatively objectively. We also wrestled to get the Child Support Agency right. The problem is that the sheer complexity of people&#039;s lifestyles cannot comply with carefully written statutory instruments, Government guidelines and codes of conduct.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew14"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I accept that that may be true in some cases, but in some of the cases to which I referred, people&#039;s circumstances did not change at all; I agree that there may be complex changes in some cases that make things difficult for the tax office, but these are just administrative mistakes.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew15"><b> Mr. Luff </b> : As it happens, most of the cases that I wish to raise&#151;coincidentally, like the past two speakers I also 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 448WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
have four cases to discuss, if there is time&#151;arise from simple maladministration by the Inland Revenue. I was very disappointed that the document, &quot;Tax credits: reforming financial support for families&quot;, which was published at the time of the Budget, appears to make no mention of the problems associated with the implementation of tax credits. It is a Panglossian document. Tax credits may have benefited many families, but they have brought nothing but heartache in these four cases.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para52">In the first case, that of Julie Brown, there has been a phantom overpayment. She has not received an overpayment but the computer thinks that she has. The result is that she received no money at Christmas or Easter. It is an absolute scandal for the poor woman. We have spent so much time trying to sort out her case, but she is at her wits&#039; end. We are told that another emergency payment has been sent to her, but she had not received it this morning. There is also the problem that emergency payments have to be repaid, which will further confuse the system. I desperately fear for the future of Julie Brown&#039;s case. We shall chase it up in three week&#039;s time. We have been advised to do so then because no giros can be issued for the next two weeks: apparently the computer is busy issuing new schedules of payment for the next tax year, so there is no prospect of any money for Julie Brown.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para53">Although many members of the hotline staff are excellent, and tribute has been paid to them, we sometimes find it difficult to persuade some of them that they are dealing with real human beings who are in desperate financial circumstances. I am not surprised, as they must be a bit battle weary by now with all the cases that they have to handle&#151;we all get case hardened&#151;but one of them suggested that Mrs. Brown should go to the Worcester tax office to sort things out. She does not have the money to go to the Worcester tax office. She survived Easter with a &#163;10 note kept for emergencies, just in case. She could buy nothing else: no petrol, no bus fares and no train fares. It shows how out of touch some of those people are that someone should suggest that she should travel from her town to Worcester to try to get her justice, which she deserves. She has received no overpayment, but the computer still thinks that she has.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para54">The next case that I want to raise is that of Mrs. Georgina Gadd, who has received an overpayment because of an unrecorded change of circumstances, which the Gadds desperately tried to tell the Inland Revenue about. In view of the time, I shall not weary the Chamber with the details of her case, but she has kept meticulous records since February 2003, when she first applied for tax credits. She quickly became aware that there was a mistake and on 25 June 2003 she called the Inland Revenue and expressed her greatest concern that she was receiving payments to which she was not entitled. Her notes state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I was then reassured that the payments I was receiving were correct and that I was fully entitled to the working tax credit. I was even told that quite a few people had contacted them thinking that the payments were too much but that it was a very good tax award for families with young children. I was told to expect a further tax form in the next few days.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para55">So a PR spin was put on what Mrs. Gadd knew was an overpayment. I have the details here: there was a succession of telephone calls, letters and formal complaints running through to 15 January 2005. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 449WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Mrs.&nbsp;Gadd&#039;s notes state that around that date she received a telephone call from the Inland Revenue apologising that she had not yet received a reply to a letter from September and that it was trying to sort out the complaint. The issue is to do with the nature of her husband&#039;s employment and earnings. The Inland Revenue also told her, &quot;Why don&#039;t you get in touch with your MP? If you get your MP involved, you might actually get it sorted out.&quot; That is why she wrote to me. In a letter to me she said&#151;and I think that she is right:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It would appear to me that the Inland Revenue are delaying replying to my letters and even ignoring some of my letters which enclosed bank statements&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para56">proving that she has spent the overpayment&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;until they have recouped the &#163;1000 overpayment despite the fact that according to their own code of practice, which they have admittedly failed to meet, and which I have proved to have made substantial effort to ensure that they held the correct information, they should look into waiving some if not all of this overpayment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para57">That is the point that I want to make to the Minister. These people, who have striven to be honest with the Inland Revenue, deserve an amnesty. Mrs. Gadd points out that she has had no tax credit since June 2003. That is devastating for a family with one wage earner, a small baby and a two-year-old child.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para58">A letter from another constituent arrived this morning. It is on a topical subject, but I do not have permission to name its author, so I will not do so. She is a single mother earning &#163;14,500 a year and she has two children, one at university and the other at sixth-form college. She is struggling to keep them in education, but she hopes to send her second child to university shortly. She has pointed out time and again that she is paying too much, and she wants to know how much she is overpaying so she can accurately budget for that, but the Inland Revenue will not tell her. Her letter states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I did receive a reply saying I would hear in 6 to 8 weeks, then a further letter telling me that the amount I was receiving was right, but I know fine well it&#039;s not because they still had all my details wrong and had me working for the NHS on &#163;10,384 which I was three years ago. I despair.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">However, I have been onto them again after 4 hours of trying today, to be advised that their computer is not working correctly and that, although on every occasion I have advised them of my change in circumstances, my old details are stuck in their system and that the computer is not accepting my new details, so until the computer is fixed I will still be getting a payment of &#163;267 per month which I know is too much for one child. I am very worried about all this&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para59">Her letter concludes:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I do hope you can help me. I am very worried about all this and could cry with frustration&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para60">I bet she could. She has tried in every way to get information from the Inland Revenue, and none of them has succeeded.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para61">We have talked about cases of overpayment&#151;a phantom overpayment, and two actual overpayments&#151;where people have behaved with absolute honesty and integrity, and been determined to sort things out, but where they have not received the level of service from the Inland Revenue that they are entitled to expect. However, it is also important to remember that some people are not getting the money to which they are

entitled. A constituency case of mine involving Sheila Christian Brookes highlights that we have worked hard on that, too. Many interventions and telephone calls have been made, and it was shown that she was owed substantial arrears:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We were told on 10 March that a giro was sent that day for &#163;1,577.31, and another for &#163;131.04&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para62">but the cheques never arrived. Apparently, they were returned to the tax office for unknown reasons, and


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;they can&#039;t try to re-issue the cheque as the computer is working on the new schedule of payments for the next two weeks and then there will be a backlog of cheques waiting to go out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Hotline assistant asks if we can remember to chase her again after two weeks!&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para63">What kind of level of service is that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para64">Although I am more sceptical about the whole tax credit system than the hon. Member for North Durham, I entirely agree that for many families it is working well and brings great benefits. However, I am desperately worried; these are four random cases, one of which happens to be in today&#039;s post. Along with civil service pensions, it is undoubtedly the biggest issue in my telephone call log&#151;although not in my postbag as, typically, these cases are not made in writing. We must have a better system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para65">The Minister must not just boast about the families that are benefiting&#151;although I am happy for him to do that, as an election is coming up, after all. He must also explain how the Inland Revenue will improve its systems, so that the decent, hard-working families that have been referred to today get the justice and the money to which we all believe they are entitled.

</p>




<a name="50406h01_time3"><h5>10.23 am</h5>



<p><a name="50406h01_spnew16"><b> Sir George Young  (North-West Hampshire)</b>  (Con): It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff), who has spoken so movingly on behalf of his constituents. I also commend the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) for his choice of subject and the reasonable and analytical way in which he spoke to it. I want to add a brief footnote to the excellent speeches that have been made.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para66">At the beginning of this Parliament, the single biggest generator of constituency casework was the Child Support Agency. That wooden spoon has now been transferred to the Inland Revenue, for all the reasons that have been mentioned in this debate. There is no disagreement about the principle here; nobody wants to go back to the old days, when people on supplementary benefit or income support received a range of payments, but when they moved into work that life-support system immediately fell away, which created the &quot;Why work?&quot; syndrome. The working families tax credit was introduced before 1997 in order to address that syndrome. However, we now have a fiendishly complicated system, and many of the cases that we have been talking about involve not only the Inland Revenue as it is often firefighting with other agencies&#151;having a dialogue about housing benefits, for example. Therefore, the Inland Revenue tax credit issue is frequently but one of a range of problems that people living in difficult circumstances are trying to confront.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 451WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para67">The debate has focused on what happens when things go wrong. I want to refer only to one case. Mrs. P, who lives in Andover, had her payments stopped. She came to see me, I took her case up with the Revenue, and I received a letter saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. understand that Mrs P is concerned that her tax credits for 2004&#150;2005 have stopped.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para68">Of course she was concerned, because in the previous year her annual payments were &#163;11,316. When that income stream falls away, one is concerned. The letter went on to state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;When claimants have been overpaid, we normally expect them to pay it back.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para69">We then went around the course of whose fault it was, and a letter arrived on 16 March stating:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We have decided that although the overpayment was due to a mistake on our part it was not reasonable for you to think that your award was correct&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The award notice asks you to check all the information and contact us if any of the details are wrong. The overpayment will be recovered from you.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para70">Not only has the income stream stopped, but she now apparently owes the Inland Revenue &#163;10,763.17 because of an overpayment due to a mistake on the part of the Inland Revenue. I see that those letters are all printed with &quot;Investor in People&quot; at the bottom. I wonder whether that award will be revisited.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para71">I think that I am right in saying&#151;perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) can confirm this&#151;that my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) said in a speech a few weeks ago that were our great party to be returned in the general election, we would write off overpayments that had been made by the Inland Revenue, save for those cases where there was evidence of fraud. I hope that my hon. Friend is able to confirm that, and that the Minister will then respond to the challenge of matching that commitment as we approach the general election. Clearly, many people have an interest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para72">In the next Parliament, we need to stand back and look at the financial interface between citizens and state to see whether there is a better way to achieve the principle to which we all subscribe. Can the interface be reduced by raising the tax threshold? Can we do more on the universal benefit front? Can the system be simplified in some way? Is there a better way of addressing the issues when things go wrong that does not involve all the palaver that we have heard about this morning? Clearly, we are not going to address these matters in the remaining stages of this Parliament. However, at the beginning of the next Parliament we all ought to stand back and look at the top-heavy, complex system and ask the basic question: is there a better way to achieve the goals that we all want to achieve?

<p><a name="50406h01_spnew17"><b> Mr. John Burnett  (Torridge and West Devon)</b>  (LD): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) on securing the debate. It is a measure of its importance that so many Members have turned up and spoken, notwithstanding the imminence of a general election.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para73">As my hon. Friend said in his excellent speech, we support the tax credits policy, but the administration of the policy is often incompetent and occasionally cruel.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 452WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Many hon. Members have spoken of particularly heartbreaking constituency problems, and I shall refer to just three from my constituency. Before I do so, I should like to pay tribute to the citizens advice bureaux&#151;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad that many hon. Members concur with what I have just said. The bureaux in my constituency&#151;the Bideford, Holsworthy, Tavistock and Okehampton offices&#151;are doing excellent work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para74">One case that has been drawn to my attention by the citizens advice bureaux involves an utterly honest individual, who I will call Mr. F. I have known him for some time. The CAB tell me that by the time that the credits were awarded, Mrs. F had decided to stop work in order to care for her husband. However, in the tax credit award it was stated that both Mr. and Mrs. F were working 40 hours a week. Mr. F immediately wrote back to say that neither he nor his wife were working. The letter was not acknowledged, but working tax credits were nevertheless paid to Mr. F&#039;s account. Mr. F automatically assumed that the contents of his letter had been taken into account and that the payments were his due entitlement. He received another letter from the Inland Revenue and he again wrote back saying that he was not working.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para75">Mr. F has also made it clear that he is suffering from depression. The Inland Revenue has said that he telephoned, but the CAB, which took up the case, has said that that is erroneous. It has said that Mr. F is unable to make telephone calls to official bodies because of his depression; that is why he consulted the CAB in the first place. Referring to the most recent telephone call that Mr. F is alleged to have made, the Inland Revenue claims that he had no intention of repaying any overpayments. Although it is instituting an inquiry into the matter, that false allegation has put Mr. F under renewed stress and may hamper his prospects of returning to work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para76">As I said, I have countless letters. Mrs. L wrote to me recently, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Please can you help me as the inland revenue office had made it impossible for me to survive?&quot;</p>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I appealed against this and the response was that even though they admit they made a mistake it was not reasonable of me to think that what they said I was entitled to was correct&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They say the overpayment was from 2003. They have never said how much I owe. I am now living on &#163;24 per week less than the government say I can live on.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="50406h01_para79">We must take up the gauntlet for our hard-pressed constituents. As my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross made clear, it is usually people who are already suffering hardship who are the beneficiaries of this policy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para80">The Economic Secretary and I have debated many financial, economic and Inland Revenue matters, and he knows only too well that I have often praised Inland Revenue staff for their expertise, integrity and conscientiousness. The MPs&#039; hotline is working well, and I am grateful to those who staff it. Nevertheless, there are inherent problems with these tax credits, and they must be resolved.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para81">I do not want to go over matters that have been discussed, and I have already alluded to cases of innocent overpayment, in which honest taxpayers make their circumstances quite clear, but are paid too much through no fault of their own, and the demand for repayment causes considerably greater hardship. However, I do want to say a few words about repayments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para82">I believe that paragraph 26 of the Inland Revenue code of practice on overpayments asks


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para83">and that it continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We may decide that you should not be asked to pay back all or part of an overpayment if you were paid too much because of a mistake by us and it was reasonable to think your award was right&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para84">I believe that that is a direct quote from the Inland Revenue because I am quoting from a letter dated 20&nbsp;January 2005, which was sent to me by Christine Nurse, the customer relations group manager at the Preston tax credit office. One of the points on which we look to the Economic Secretary for a response is what the Revenue considers to be its mistake.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew18"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Not one of the cases that I mentioned involved a mistake on the part of the individuals, who were honest and up front. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is about time the Inland Revenue applied the policy to which he has just referred?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew19"><b> Mr. Burnett </b> : I agree very much with the hon. Gentleman, and I want to know from the Minister the exact criteria for a repayment and his policy on what constitutes a mistake.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew20"><b> John Thurso </b> : I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. Is not the critical point the definition of reasonableness? Any reasonable human being, such as all of us here, would say, &quot;The Revenue has made a mistake; it should waive the payment.&quot; However, the definition of reasonableness at the Revenue somehow involves it saying, &quot;They ought to have spotted it on our form.&quot;
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew21"><b> Mr. Burnett </b> : I could not agree more with my hon. Friend; I concur entirely with what he has said. We look forward to hearing from the Economic Secretary in a minute or two.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para85">I want a response to that particular point&#151;a practical point on which so many thousands of our constituents want a response from the Minister. I should also like to know what preparation there was leading up to the introduction of tax credits, including what trials were made of the IT systems and especially whether the software was validated before introduction.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para86">My third question is about what training was given to hard-pressed Inland Revenue staff before introduction. My fourth is about when the consumers&#039; hotline will be improved. Finally, when will this system of tax credits function reliably?

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 454WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
presented his speech dispassionately, comprehensively and effectively. The hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones) gave powerful illustrations of situations in his constituency and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) made a powerful speech. My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) made a good supporting speech and underlined the importance of the situation and how it needs to be resolved. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). Sadly, I understand that he is leaving this place. He has made important and sensible contributions to the life of Parliament on many occasions, and I wish him well for the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para87">So much legislation results in unintended consequences. However, it is fair to say that one of the legacies on which the Government will be judged is the sheer complexity and micro-management that are their hallmark: a benefits system that relies on more and more means-testing and complicated tax credits. Since October 1999, the Government have introduced five new tax credits for families, scrapped four of them and introduced two new ones. That averages out at a new tax credit for families every six months.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para88">One result of that complexity has been the fiasco of overpayment that we have heard graphically discussed this morning. The saga began in April and May 2003, when computer system failures were responsible for overpayments to 455,000 households, and totalled &#163;94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million. The damage has been twofold. Not for the first time, taxpayers&#039; money has been wasted: only &#163;57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million of the &#163;94 million that was overpaid was recovered&#151;the rest was written off. Administratively, the cost of dealing with the error was estimated at &#163;10 million. As we have heard movingly and importantly, recipients of tax credits faced financial and emotional suffering as the overpayments were clawed back.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para89">A number of organisations have criticised the Inland Revenue for both its timing and the severity of the rate at which the money is being paid back. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has protested and demanded action to protect poor families. Barnardo&#039;s has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We are concerned that it&#039;s causing hardship for the poorest families when credits should help the Government in its fight against poverty. Coming in the run-up to Christmas, it is a difficult time for families.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para90">That point was echoed by the Child Poverty Action Group, which stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;These problems have resulted in many low-income families suffering hardship. Many claimants have seen awards adjusted automatically to recover overpayment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. without any explanation of how the overpayment arose, leaving some with weekly incomes substantially below income support levels&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para91">That has been talked about graphically in this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para92">The problem has certainly not gone away. In February, <i>The Guardian </i>reported:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Inland Revenue is expected to crank up demands over the coming weeks for hard-pressed families to pay back thousands of pounds worth of tax credits due to overpayments in the last tax year.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para93">Apparently,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Revenue is under pressure from Treasury ministers to prevent a repeat of the overpayments fiasco in the four years before 2003 when officials allowed claimants to keep up to &#163;2bn of overpaid tax credits. Under the new system, based on working 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</ul>



<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 455WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>tax credit and child tax credit, Revenue officials have been given orders to get tough with those paid more than they are due, even when it is a result of errors by officials or a computer glitch.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para94">Such reports are alarming and I hope that the Minister will confirm that they are simply not true. It is regrettable that I need to ask for that confirmation, but the Government&#039;s recent record does not fill me with confidence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para95">That record is demonstrated in the statistics, and the experiences of those working with victims of the overpayments fiasco on the ground. First, there are the&nbsp;statistics. By the end of December 2004, the Inland Revenue had received 78,000 complaints about the recovery of overpayments. Most said that the Revenue should reconsider on the grounds of official error, but in the 41,000 cases so far decided, only about 1,600 families have had their overpayments written off.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para96">Secondly, there are the experiences of those on the ground. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon alluded to Citizens Advice, which has been hard pressed on the issue. It has said that attempts to claw back the cash are continuing to push low income families into debt. Advice, the independent advice network based in Northern Ireland, claims that it has uncovered


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;shocking evidence of widespread errors&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para97">in the payment of tax credits. That underlines the points that have been made in this debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para98">It is all very well noting that the Government have made a mess of the overpayments. After all, they are ultimately responsible. The overpayments should not have been made in the first place, and they should not have been clawed back in such a draconian manner. Given that my and the Minister&#039;s positions may be reversed on 6 May, what would we do differently? I should like to suggest some constructive ways to deal with the problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para99">First, and most importantly, we would offer an amnesty to all families in respect of their child tax credit repayments for 2003&#150;04. Unless the overpayment was caused by fraud on the part of the claimant, efforts by the Inland Revenue to reclaim overpayments will cease. That will lift an enormous anxiety hanging over hundreds of thousands of families, and follows the recommendation of the Work and Pensions Committee that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Overpayments should not be recovered where to do so would cause hardship or damage work incentives.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para100">The aim now should be to get accurate entitlements this next financial year, rather than absorbing all the Inland Revenue&#039;s energies in trying to correct payments made in the first two years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para101">We would then implement a co-ordinated strategy to make the tax credit system simpler and fairer. I have three points on that. First, we would ensure that award letters explain more clearly how tax credits have been calculated. That would make it easier for people to judge whether the calculations were correct and to spot errors. I agree with the point about the sheer complexity and bureaucracy involved in trying to understand and find a path to resolve this problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para102">Secondly, we would make the Inland Revenue&#039;s code of practice fairer in respect of the recovery of tax credits overpaid owing to an official error. Claimants would 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 456WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
still have to repay erroneous tax credits if the Inland Revenue felt that it should have spotted the error in the first place. That implies that all claimants have a firm grasp on how to calculate their tax credits, which is an unreasonable proposition.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para103">Thirdly, echoing the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire, a tolerance limit would be introduced so people do not suffer severe financial hardship as a result of previous overpayment. Will the Minister commit himself to a strategy similar to the one that I have outlined?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para104">Whatever happens, this debate has been most useful in airing something that has gone terribly wrong and had heartbreaking impacts on thousands of our fellow citizens. Whoever happens to be in power after the general election has to reorganise this system, because it cannot continue in its present form.

</p>




<a name="50406h01_time6"><h5>10.46 am</h5>



<p><a name="50406h01_spmin0"><b>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury  (John Healey) </b> : I genuinely congratulate the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) on securing this debate and on the way in which he has consistently pursued questions on the tax credit system and problems, including overpayment, faced by his constituents. He introduced the debate in a measured way and set out genuine concerns about the administration of the system. I appreciate the tribute that he paid to those in the Inland Revenue who work on the MPs&#039; hotline. I will pass his comments to them and know that they will be welcome, because those people try their best to help all hon. Members to sort out the problems that arise with our constituents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para105">I appreciate also the comments made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) on the same subject. I pay tribute to his contribution to the proceedings of the House over the past eight years. I am sorry to see him go and will miss the debates that we have. I will also miss the combination of fair-mindedness and well-informed criticism that he always brings to bear on the scrutiny of the work of the Government and the Treasury.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para106">As my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General has said consistently to all hon. Members who have contributed to this debate, I invite all of them, if they have not already done so, to let me have the specific details of the cases that they have raised this morning. I do not want to pick up on individual cases, but will respond to some of the points that have been made this morning.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para107">On the point made by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, cheques will be accepted by the Inland Revenue in cases of overpayment. In the very early months there were a few cases where that was not taking place, but that is not so now.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para108">I say to my hon. Member for North Durham (Mr.&nbsp;Jones) that, in general terms, where a claimant is concerned that their payments are wrong and they are reassured by the tax credit office that they are correct, any subsequent overpayment should be remitted. We will go back and check such cases&#151;we are doing so&#151;including checking the tapes from telephone conversations that such claimants had with the Inland Revenue. Where claimants have been wrongly advised that their award is correct, I would expect any overpayment to be waived.

<p>
<a name="50406h01_para109">In respect of the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff), the Inland Revenue computer is being updated at the moment, as it normally is at the end of the financial year. However, payments can still be made.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para110">It may help the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) if I say that the Inland Revenue is simplifying the ways in which it handles claims regarding disputes on overpayments. I will say a little bit more about the new measures that are being put in place. In general, however, I say to all hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire, that if they will give me specific case details that have not already been submitted to my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, I shall ensure that they are carefully examined,, and undertake to check the progress that is being made.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew23"><b> Mr. Luff </b> : I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he has responded. It is very important if people who have been told that they cannot, at present, receive cheques can receive them. Obviously, from what the Minister has said, they are being misadvised by the Inland Revenue, and the MPs&#039; hotline is misadvising Members&#039; offices, too. How can those cheques be issued? What can we do, practically, to ensure that the money is available to our constituents?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew24"><b> John Healey </b> : The point that was raised by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was that one of his constituents tried to repay an overpayment to the Revenue by cheque, but was told that that was not acceptable to the Revenue. I am making clear that it is acceptable.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew25"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#039;s commitment to examine the cases in question, but I have raised them with the Inland Revenue and my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General, and the letter that I received back from the latter&#151;which took six months&#151;was just the usual civil service flannel, upholding the decision about repayments. Something needs to be done urgently about those cases. I shall certainly send my hon. Friend details not only of the four cases that I mentioned, but all the rest of them that I have in the office.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew26"><b> John Healey </b> : If my hon. Friend checks the record of the debate, he will see that I said earlier that I shall check the progress of any of the individual cases that he and other hon. Members raised, or any whose further details they want to submit, and reply to the hon. Members.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para111">The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, to whose continuing work on the matter I pay tribute, has raised half a dozen cases relating to overpayment with Ministers and the chairman of the Inland Revenue. He suggested that I might be keen to tell him how many families in his constituency benefit from tax credits generally. The figure is 3,800. The hon. Gentleman has tabled two parliamentary questions about the numbers affected throughout Scotland, and I can tell him that 375,000 families benefit from the child tax credit there. I appreciate the welcome that he gave to what he described as real help to many families in his constituency.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 458WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para112">The debate arises from genuine concerns about the administration of specific overpayment cases. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross was at pains, in initiating the debate, not to make it party political, although the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) ranged more widely and did not take such pains, so that I want to respond briefly to a couple of his points before engaging with the detail.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para113">Nearly 6 million families with 10 million children now benefit from a tax credit system introduced since 1997, which was not in place before then. Tax credits are central to Labour&#039;s social commitment to support the efforts of hardworking families, to our moral commitment to reduce and eradicate child poverty, and to our economic commitment to make work pay. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said that he is proud of the tax credit system, and all Labour Members are proud of it. I am proud, too. As a result of the Government&#039;s reforms to the tax and benefits system since 1997, families with children will be on average &#163;1,400 better off in October. The poorest fifth of families will be, on average, &#163;3,200 better off.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para114">As a result of Labour&#039;s anti-poverty programmes since 1997, almost 2 million children have been lifted out of absolute poverty. As a result of the Chancellor&#039;s successful management of the economy and labour market policies, including tax credits, 2 million more jobs have been created. The employment rate among lone parents has risen from 46 per cent. to 56 per cent. and the number of children living in households without work has been reduced by nearly 300,000.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para115">Although the debate is about problems that sometimes happen, and the personal distress that is caused by overpayments, the wider context for the debate is a tax credit system that has brought substantial increases in income to families that are on low incomes; that has contributed to a large reduction in the number of children living in poverty; and that has helped to create the highest ever employment level in the British economy.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para116">I do not underestimate the problems caused by overpayments. I have dealt with cases of overpayment myself as a constituency MP. However, it is important to examine them with a full appreciation of the way in which the tax credits system is designed to work. Some of the problems are the legacy of the well documented trouble experienced when the system was introduced in 2003. For instance, because of the early difficulties, the Inland Revenue made a large number of emergency manual payments to claimants. As it took a long time to get the manual payments on to the system, some cases resulted in overpayments at the end of the year, which now have to be recovered. There were also the much publicised early IT problems. However, most overpayments arise because a claimant&#039;s income has risen.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para117">The new tax credits, unlike earlier systems of support, are designed to respond to changes in families as they happen. They can be adjusted to reflect changes in the number of children in the family, in working hours, in child care costs or in family income. That flexibility has clear benefits for families and for claimants. For example, the Inland Revenue can increase a child tax credit award in year when told that a new baby has 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 459WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
arrived. That is why 230,000 families each year have their tax credit award revised in year following the birth of a child.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para118">The system is based on annual income, just like income tax. Therefore, when&#151;for whatever reason&#151;changes in income during a year have not been reflected in changes in the tax credit award, an adjustment may need to be made after the end of the year, just as it is in the income tax system. That might be to correct an overpayment or an underpayment, just as in the income tax system. If the Inland Revenue discovers an underpayment after the end of the tax year, it will pay it immediately in a lump sum. If there has been an overpayment, the Revenue will collect it from a continuing award, subject to automatic limits that are applied after a claimant&#039;s award for the coming year has been calculated. That is set out in the Inland Revenue&#039;s code of practice on tax credit overpayments under the heading &quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para119">Some of the problems associated with the recovery of overpayments have arisen because of unfamiliarity with the system. The Revenue has a responsibility for that, and is trying to fulfil it, to ensure that people have adequate information and there is strong publicity about the way in which it works. However, it is inevitable and right that adjustments in either direction will need to be made in a system based on annual income. It would not be fair to those who have received the right amount of tax credit if we did not try to recover money from those who have received too much.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para120">I have to say to the hon. Member for West Suffolk that a call for a sweeping amnesty has more to do with scoring points before the election than a serious proposal for Government. An amnesty across the board is not an appropriate way of dealing with overpayments. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 460WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
To say that the Inland Revenue should not be making overpayments in the first place is to show a comprehensive failure to appreciate the nature of the system and to undermine the principle of individual claimant responsibility.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew27"><b> Mr. Kevan Jones </b> : Will my hon. Friend give way?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h01_spnew28"><b> John Healey </b> : No. Forgive me. At the heart of the many points that have been raised this morning is the question of reasonableness. The test of reasonableness is important. People need to take responsibility for checking their tax credit awards, just as they should check their PAYE code, and they should let the Inland Revenue know if anything is wrong. However, I accept that there have been particular problems in the past year while people have come to terms with the new system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para121">When it became clear that the Inland Revenue was, as hon. Members have said, having difficulty in dealing with requests for official error relief within an acceptable time, my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General asked it to consider the scope for streamlining the process that is used to decide whether official error relief is due. It has reviewed the procedures, in the light of a few months&#039; experience, and I can confirm that it will change the targeting of the checks that are made to applications. That will reflect a better assessment of the types of award given in cases in which it was unreasonable to expect people to understand and to check the detail.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h01_para122">We estimate that that will allow the Inland Revenue to clear more than 50 per cent. of the cases quickly, and the backlog is expected to be cleared by the summer. I am sure that hon. Members will welcome that. I repeat my invitation to hon. Members to let me have details of the cases that they have raised. I trust that they will watch closely for the impact of the new arrangements over the next few months and I have no doubt that we will return to the debate if matters do not improve.

<p><a name="50406h02_spnew0"><b> Mr. William Cash  (Stone)</b>  (Con): I am raising questions relating to the dreadful and tragic death of Benjamin Moston. It is a serious case, which requires serious answers from the Minister as well as from Staffordshire ambulance service, not just an apology or an internal inquiry. I should state at the outset that I have genuine respect for those who work for Staffordshire ambulance service, which generally performs a role in difficult circumstances which deserves our thanks and gratitude. However, this deeply tragic case requires much more than an internal inquiry.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para0">On Sunday 13 February 2005, 10-year-old Benjamin Moston, the son of Mrs. Jayne Moston and Mr. David Layton of Barn Common, Woodseaves in my constituency, was showing signs of wheezing due to his asthma. He was given Ventolin by his parents, but that was having no prolonged effect. Benjamin required a repeat dose some 45 minutes later. At 6.08 pm Jayne Moston called the out-of-hours service, which is manned by Staffordshire ambulance paramedics. Her call took approximately 14 minutes to get through followed by a further 14 minutes relaying patient information together with symptoms present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para1">The paramedic answering the call told Mrs. Moston that someone would be with her shortly. It was explained to the paramedic that Ben was a severe asthmatic, he was wheezing and his Ventolin was having little effect. The parents believe that the paramedic wrongly categorised this call: instead of an immediate response it was categorised as a case to be seen within the hour. I understand that it was the paramedic&#039;s first shift as a call taker and required supervision. There was no supervision. At the paramedic&#039;s disposal is the triage software, which I understand was not used. However, the family have since been told that had it been used, it would also have failed them in triggering an immediate response for Benjamin&#039;s condition. I will return to the triage software later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para2">Also, situated four and six minutes away are a community first responder and Mr. Roger Thayne, the chief executive of Staffordshire ambulance service, who was on call. Those individuals should have been paged to respond, and it appears that due to human error this was not done. At approximately 7.01 pm, Benjamin&#039;s condition worsened, resulting in a second call which was a 999 emergency call made by Jayne Moston. The same information was relayed again about Benjamin&#039;s condition and it was made clear that a previous call had been made. Again, the first responders previously mentioned were not paged to respond. This call was taken by the call centre supervisor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para3">At approximately 7.15 pm, Benjamin&#039;s condition deteriorated rapidly. He became cyanosed, agitated and confused, and a further 999 call was made by Mr. Layton, Benjamin&#039;s father, informing the call-taker of Ben&#039;s deteriorating condition and asking where the ambulance was. They replied that the ambulance was in the area but could not locate the home address. This was due to its not being in the satellite navigation system, despite the road and houses having stood and been clearly mapped for many years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para4">At 7.18 pm, David Layton tried to attract the attention of the paramedic who was further up the street by waving his arms. The paramedic drove past and Mr. Layton had to give chase while shouting at the driver to stop. Tragically, by this stage, Benjamin had collapsed and apparently died in his mother&#039;s arms in front of his four-year-old sister and 21-month-old brother. David Layton informed the paramedic that Ben had collapsed and he was unsure whether he was even breathing. On arriving at the house at 7.34 pm, the paramedics immediately began cardio-pulmonary resuscitation&#151;CPR. At 7.35 pm, the trust doctor arrived on the scene, but he could not intubate and asked the paramedic to do so, which he did.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para5">It was some 15 minutes before Benjamin was attached to a monitor to ascertain heart activity and saturation levels, and some 25 minutes before any adrenalin was administered. The doctor observed by monitor that there was no electrical activity in the heart by then. It appears that the community first responder arrived at 7.35 pm after he had been paged at 7.23 pm. He is only six minutes away from Benjamin&#039;s home address. Another two paramedics and a doctor arrived at almost the same time; CPR continued and adrenalin was administered at approximately 7.45 pm.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para6">The doctor decided that Benjamin should be taken by ambulance to Stafford district general hospital. The ambulance left at 7.55 pm and arrived at 8.08 pm. The&nbsp;doctor continued to give CPR in the back of the ambulance, despite an apparent protocol that at least two or more persons are required during emergency life support for children.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para7">Benjamin was pronounced dead at the Stafford district general hospital at 8.30 pm. Mrs. Moston and Mr. Layton believe that Benjamin did not stand a fighting chance due to those errors. His asthma attack was no worse than any other he had experienced. It was simply that the early medical treatment that was required was not forthcoming.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para8">The lives of Benjamin&#039;s parents have been torn apart as a result of the tragic circumstances surrounding his death. They constantly relive his final hour and see his frightened face asking them to help him. No parent should lose a child, and most definitely not as a result of the failure to act quickly and with expertise, as we rightly expect from our emergency services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para9">I said that I wanted to make some important points about the triage policy, which can be described as an emergency transport request generally made through a 999 call but which might also include calls from GPs. The prioritisation of emergency calls to ensure that immediately life-threatening cases obtain the quickest response was introduced as a pilot in 1995&#150;96. There are three categories. Category A covers emergency calls that are classified as life threatening, and ambulance services are expected to reach 75 per cent. of category A calls within eight minutes.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para10">Category B is for non-life-threatening emergency calls, 95 per cent. of which should receive a response within the national 14 minutes in urban areas or 19 minutes in rural areas. Category C calls are regarded as non-life threatening and non-urgent, and are a large proportion of the work of the ambulance service. In some cases, telephone advice or referral to another agency may be adequate to meet the callers&#039; needs and may be a more appropriate clinical response.

<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para11">Why was not Benjamin&#039;s case immediately classified as Category A and an ambulance despatched with paramedics? This is one of the most critical questions. The answer that I will receive from the Minister goes to the heart of this tragic case. Above all, I insist on a full public inquiry and not merely the internal inquiries that have been suggested so far.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para12">In addition, I have been told of serious allegations about other deaths, including references to impending cases at Birmingham employment tribunal, which are connected to what are described to me as


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;deliberate reductions in emergency care resources&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para13">and a failure to anticipate rises in demand in 2003.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para14">I have also been told of allegations of threats and bullying to dissuade people from speaking out. I cannot verify those allegations now, but they appear to be part of the case before the employment tribunal, and in so far as they have a bearing on the question of resources, they are directly relevant to the tragic death of Benjamin Moston. In any event, I will not be satisfied with an internal review or one conducted merely by the strategic health authority. I want and demand a public inquiry in which all these matters and their interconnection, including the issue of resources, are fully investigated, and not merely an apology or internal inquiry. A child has died by error and by fault, and the parents deserve no less.

</p>




<a name="50406h02_time1"><h5>11.10 am</h5>



<p><a name="50406h02_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) on taking up this issue on behalf of his constituent, and express my great sadness on hearing the details of the case. I hope that he will pass on my sincere condolences to Benjamin Moston&#039;s family. This must be a very sad time for them and I am sure that they are devastated by what has happened, as the hon. Gentleman has said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para15">The incident has had a profound effect on the Staffordshire Ambulance Service NHS trust, which provides the out-of-hours service in the area. The chief executive of the trust has been to see Benjamin&#039;s parents; he has formally apologised on behalf of the local NHS and offered his personal condolences. The trust has been the highest performing ambulance trust in the country for many years, but we&#151;and it&#151;must recognise the importance of learning from such events.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para16">The staff of the trust are hardworking and diligent, but they would be the first to say that they owe it to Benjamin and his family to use this experience to do even better in the future and, if it emerges that their performance was less than optimal on this occasion, to do everything in their power never to let the same thing happen again. But I stress the &quot;if&quot;; the only way to find out whether their performance was less than optimal is to carry out an inquiry and face the issues honestly, and such an inquiry has not yet been carried out. Until it is, we should not speculate about where fault may lie but should stick to discussing the facts as we know them. It would be inappropriate for me to discuss the details of Benjamin&#039;s illness at this time, but I can tell hon. Members what I know of the events following his parents&#039; call to the out-of-hours service. What I am 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 464WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
about to say is based on what I have been told by Shropshire and Staffordshire strategic health authority and, of course, it is subject to review in the inquiry that I will talk about later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para17">I am told that the call from Benjamin&#039;s parents to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out-of-hours service, at 6.08 pm on Sunday 13&nbsp;February, was handled by a paramedic call handler who made a clinical decision, based on the information available, that Benjamin should have a home visit within an hour of the end of the call, which was at 6.21 pm. That is covered in the ambulance service trust&#039;s internal investigation report, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that decision at this time. At 7.01 pm, Benjamin&#039;s parents, worried that Benjamin&#039;s condition had deteriorated, made an emergency 999 call, and a community paramedic officer was dispatched to the Mostons&#039; home at 7.02 pm. The parents made a further emergency call at 7.18 pm to ask where the ambulance was. The paramedic arrived at about the same time as that second emergency call.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para18">On arriving at the scene, the paramedic found that Benjamin was in cardio-respiratory arrest and requested that an ambulance be sent as quickly as possible. The&nbsp;ambulance was mobilised at 7.27 pm and arrived at 7.34 pm. The ambulance trust&#039;s doctor arrived at 7.35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pm. At 7.45 pm, Benjamin was taken to Staffordshire general hospital; he arrived at 8.08 pm. Sadly, as we know, he did not survive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para19">I should point out that a coroner&#039;s inquest into Benjamin&#039;s death has been launched and is currently adjourned. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what its findings might be. However, I can reassure the hon. Gentleman and Benjamin&#039;s family that the local health community has taken this incident very seriously and absolutely understands the need to look into the matter with a view to avoiding similar incidents.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para20">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the ambulance trust immediately launched an internal inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the incident. The initial findings of the inquiry and the detailed action plan drawn up as a result have already been shared with the family. The investigation report will be tabled at the ambulance trust&#039;s risk and clinical governance committee, which reports to the trust board. The detailed action plan is already being implemented by the trust. The plan addresses areas such as staff training and the introduction of dual paging/SMS texting and clinical policies.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para21">I can advise the hon. Gentleman that on 1 April the trust moved to a single computer-aided dispatch system, which allows better control of the interface between the out-of-hours service and the emergency ambulance system. The strategic health authority, which is responsible for monitoring and improving the quality of health care in the area, has also commissioned an independent inquiry into the incident to determine any contributing factors and to recommend any actions that should be taken to prevent a similar occurrence.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para22">The inquiry is being undertaken by Dr. Matthew Cooke, accident and emergency consultant at the Heart of England NHS foundation trust&#151;formerly the Birmingham Heartlands and Solihull Hospitals NHS trust&#151;and national A and E medical advisor, and Dr.&nbsp;Richard Fairhurst, medical director of Lancashire Ambulance Service NHS trust.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 465WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para23">The inquiry is in two parts. The first will look at the out-of-hours service, which, although it is provided by Staffordshire Ambulance Service NHS trust, is in fact the responsibility of South Western Staffordshire primary care trust. The second will look at the response of the emergency ambulance service. It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the findings of the review, and the results will be presented to the boards of the PCT and ambulance trust in due course.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para24">Both the ambulance trust and the PCT will respond to any further recommendations that come out of the inquiry. I am also requesting a copy of the report so that any wider issues to do with either out-of-hours or emergency services can be considered, and any lessons that can be applied nationally can be disseminated.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Cash </b> : The Minister will know that I have called for a full public inquiry. I accept that there has to be a first-stage inquiry, but he has just said that he will call for a copy of the report&#151;I am glad to hear that. On the basis that that report will be made available to me and to others who have responsibilities in such matters, will he commit to the idea of a full public inquiry if, on reflection and in light of the report, it is clear that those matters need to be pursued in public?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : Yes, I am happy to commit to that. If on receiving the report there are still outstanding questions, and those directly involved and in positions of authority&#151;including the Minister who holds the appropriate portfolio after the election&#151;believe that questions may still be unanswered, clearly we will have to commit to further inquiries. It may well be that the hon. Gentleman, if he is returned after 5 May, will want to seek another Adjournment debate to discuss the matter in the Chamber. If I am still Minister after 5 May, I will certainly be happy to meet him to discuss the findings of the report and how matters should best be moved forward, after we have the results of the inquiry.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para25">I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that there is no cover-up and no lack of willingness on behalf of the trust, the local health authorities and the NHS to learn from events. In due course everyone will know exactly what happened and how such tragedies can best be avoided in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para26">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the policy on ambulance service and response. He and his constituents should be aware that there is substantial progress and high performance in their area. He mentioned the various categories of response; the NHS plan has an objective to improve ambulance response times so that 75 per cent. of 999 calls to life-threatening emergencies&#151;the category A responses that he referred to&#151;are responded to within eight minutes. The latest information for 2003&#150;04 shows that 75.7 per cent. of category A calls in England resulted in an emergency response arriving at the scene of the incident within eight minutes, which was slightly up from the previous year&#039;s figure of 74.6 per cent. In Staffordshire, 86.6 per cent. of category A calls received a response within eight minutes in 2003&#150;04.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para27">Other emergency calls, category B and C calls, should receive a response within 19 minutes 95 per cent. of the time in rural areas such as Staffordshire.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 466WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew3"><b> Mr. Cash </b> : The Minister will notice that I asked why this case had not been immediately classed as category A. Had the circumstances and procedures been followed in accordance with the category A system, eight minutes&#151;if that is the right figure&#151;would have applied, and we almost certainly would not be faced with such a situation.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : Clearly, that must be a key matter for the inquiry to determine. It must decide whether the triage process, as the hon. Gentleman describes it, was accurately followed, whether it is defective in some way for this particular type of condition, and whether the call should have been assigned to category A.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para28">For the sake of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents and their peace of mind, let me continue with the comments that I was about to make. In Staffordshire, 99.7 per cent. of category B and C calls are responded to within 19 minutes. That is far higher than the target, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that his local ambulance trust provides a high-quality service to his constituents. If errors were made on this occasion, they will be identified, made public and learned from, and we will move forward on that basis.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew5"><b> Mr. Cash </b> : Will the Minister take note of the allegations that I mentioned, which, as I stated, I cannot verify? In light of the fact that they appear to be related to what is going on before the Birmingham employment tribunal, which is a responsible tribunal, I hope that he will take note of the situation and consider also the allegation about deliberate reductions in emergency care resources. I am not in a position to verify that allegation either, but if there is a connection between the incident and the allegations, I am sure that the Minister will want to look into it.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I certainly do want to look into that. I was not aware of the allegations that the hon. Gentleman raised today, so I am not in a position to verify or deny them, but I will say that threats to stop people from speaking out are absolutely unacceptable. There are procedures to protect people who want to speak out about their concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para29">I shall write to the strategic health authority and the ambulance trust to bring to their attention the official record of today&#039;s debate, and I shall ask them to ensure that their inquiries consider the wider ramifications and the possibility that there are connections between this matter and the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve these matters collectively.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h02_para30">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my good will. I hope that he accepts also that I am determined to ensure that everybody gets to the bottom of this. That good will is shared by the ambulance trust and the strategic health authority, which are equally determined to get to the bottom of this and to ensure that Benjamin&#039;s parents receive all the answers to the questions that they are bound to be asking, for what little comfort it will give them. It may provide some closure for this event. Once again, I pass my deepest regrets to them for this experience. I hope that they are able to move forward.
</p>

information made available to him and, indirectly, to me and other people in appropriate positions of responsibility, he will have a public inquiry should the circumstances warrant it.

</p>






<p><a name="50406h02_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I very much hope that it will not be necessary to have any further inquiries because we get all the answers that we need from the inquiries that have been set up.

<a name="50406h03_head0"><h3 align=center>National Offender Management Service</h3>


<a name="50406h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50406h03_spnew0"><b> Mrs. Claire Curtis-Thomas  (Crosby)</b>  (Lab): As a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, I regularly meet people who work in the criminal justice system, and I am pleased to have secured this debate because everyone I have spoken to in the probation service and the Prison Service has told me of their deep concerns about the structure and implementation of the National Offender Management Service.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para0">The concerns that I shall raise are similar to those discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and others in an Adjournment debate on 16 March, but they were not adequately addressed because of time constraints, and I hope to receive more satisfying answers today.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para1">The aims of NOMS are laudable. How can anybody argue with the NOMS vision? We are told that it will:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Implement the orders of the courts and supervise offenders and those remanded in custody in such a way as to protect the public&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Provide a range of effective interventions and services that are designed to reduce reoffending&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Give offenders the opportunity to lead law abiding, productive and healthy lives&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Work in a way that treats offenders fairly and with decency.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para2">Protection of the public, a reduction in reoffending and the rehabilitation of offenders&#151;I cannot argue with any of that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para3">Similarly, discontent and decreasing morale among staff seem strange when one realises that there is fairly widespread acceptance of the objective of taking some responsibility for what happens to offenders once the court sentences them to different kinds of punishment.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para4">Everybody applauds the sentiments of NOMS, but people are concerned about the organisational structure that is proposed to implement it. The current division of responsibilities between the Prison Service, the probation service and others leads to inefficient and disruptive services, as I have seen for myself during my visits to prisons and probation boards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para5">Nor are the existing arrangements conducive to providing services that promote offenders&#039; rehabilitation and reduce their reoffending. No single organisation is ultimately responsible for the offender, which means that there is no clear ownership of the front line for reducing reoffending. Clear ownership is the goal that we all want to achieve, and the promotion of a single, integrated, seamless service that provides end-to-end management for offenders, whether they are sentenced to custodial or community punishment, therefore enjoys widespread acceptance and my support. The challenge, however, lies in how to achieve such integration to maximise the gains and minimise the risks involved&#151;and the current risks are exceptional.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para6">To explain the increasing concern felt by myself and others, it is important to put the introduction of NOMS in context. The decision to merge correctional services resulted from the review of those services led by Patrick Carter. The Carter report &quot;Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime&quot; found that although the Prison Service and the national probation service had achieved improvements,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;access to services such as drug treatment and education depends more on whether an offender is sent to prison or probation, rather than their individual needs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 469WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para7">So remedial support and action are based more or less on postcode prescription.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para8">NOMS has been identified as a way of remedying that. It came into existence five months after the Carter report had recommended its establishment and the Government had agreed to it in &quot;Reducing Crime&#151;Changing Lives&quot;. That was far too quick and meant that the Government&#039;s consultation strategy was patchy and ineffective and did not reassure people in the probation service that they had a voice or that their concerns would be heard.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para9">The Probation Boards Association vented its frustration in February 2004, when it explained that one of its initial reactions to the Government&#039;s agreement to introduce NOMS was


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;dismay that the Home Office appears to have taken far-reaching decisions without public or parliamentary scrutiny and consternation that those matters which have yet to be decided are offered only for &#039;comment or suggestion&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para10">Discussion with members of the probation service has provided me with a full picture of the Government&#039;s consultation strategy, and it makes that frustration perfectly understandable. In some cases, there was no consultation, and where it did exist, it involved sending just a few scant letters; there did not seem to be much of a coherent rationale behind them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para11">On 7 May 2004, under cover of a letter from Martin Narey, the Home Office issued information containing organisational and design proposals for consultation with probation boards and other interested parties. The overwhelming response to that consultation was critical of the brevity of the information that accompanied the proposals and the lack of any reference to local arrangements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para12">On 20 July 2004 the Minister withdrew the proposals and made various comments about how he saw the future of the National Offender Management Service. After that, it became increasingly difficult for the probation service and others, including me, to obtain meaningful information from anyone with any authority in the Home Office about the way forward for NOMS during the latter part of 2004.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para13">It would appear that no clear proposals were forthcoming and no responses were available to the myriad questions that were being asked. The Probation Boards Association, representing probation boards throughout England and Wales, became so frustrated that I understand it wrote to the Minister in January 2005 expressing its view on the lack of progress and the paucity of information.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para14">Whether those and other concerns were the trigger to action is not known, but a brief flurry of information followed, issued by the Home Office and containing various descriptions of a NOMS end-state diagram, NOMS design work and suggestions for service level agreements to be drawn up to guide the relations, including operational and budgetary matters, between probation boards and regional offender managers who had been appointed in the latter part of 2004.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para15">I know that the probation service is concerned that, despite a number of negative responses to the consultation, the end state of NOMS is no different in essence from the proposed system that was withdrawn by the Home Office in July 2004, following consultation. That lack of transparency on the part of the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 470WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government has been self-defeating. As is mentioned in the summary of responses from the consultation exercise, there is support for NOMS in general. Much of the resulting unease and discord stems from people&#039;s disappointment that they were not fully consulted and their concerns not acted on, as well as general confusion about the lack of forthcoming answers&#151;confusion which, as I said earlier, I fully understand.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para16">I think that the Government would like to argue that the lack of a detailed blueprint gives key stakeholders the chance to influence the shape of NOMS at a crucial stage of its development. However, from what I have just related it is plain that that is not happening. Views are sought, but, it appears, not translated into any operational procedure or design. As a result, the view of the National Association of Probation Officers is that support for the concept of NOMS is now virtually non-existent, with key stakeholders, including the trade unions, among those who do not support it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para17">There is a feeling that NOMS, as currently constructed, will not work. The Home Affairs Committee, of which, as I have said, I am a member, criticised the lack of consultation in our report on the rehabilitation of prisoners. The report states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We welcome in principle the introduction of the National Offender Management Service, although we regret the lack of prior consultation and the failure to publish a comprehensive business case. These failures have undoubtedly created unnecessary difficulties in developing NOMS. We welcome recent signs that the Government has recognised these problems. A more collaborative approach with those working in the Prison and Probation Services will produce effective change more swiftly.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para18">I should like to be thoroughly convinced that there will now be more thorough consultation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para19">I noticed that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), referred to the possibility of a new stakeholder forum during the previous Adjournment debate. I should like more information on that, as well as details of the outcome of the meetings so far of the NOMS joint consultative council. I am glad that my hon. Friend seems to have taken on board the fact that the initial lack of consultation and the speed of introduction have led to low morale among staff affected by NOMS. The object of inspiring commitment in staff has obviously not been achieved. I truly believe that unless stakeholders are consulted and their views taken on board, NOMS will not achieve its aims. Therefore, it is immensely important that the stakeholder forum should come into being and that the council should be used to maximum effect.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para20">On 6 January 2004 the then Home Secretary, my right&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), explained how the Government envisaged the service being provided at regional level. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We believe that the task of integrating the management of offenders is best achieved at regional and local level&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<p>
<a name="50406h03_para22">However, local arrangements were omitted from the development of the organisational structures, and, subsequently, more than 90 per cent. of the boards either suggested alternative sub-regional structures or felt that the current 42 areas, or something similar, should be retained. None of the union responses was in favour of the regional structure. Most felt that the 42 areas, or something like that, should be retained.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para23">One of my worries is the sheer size of each regional offender region. Liz Hill, the regional offender manager for my area is responsible for the north-west, while Carol Bernard is the ROM for the whole of Wales. ROMs will have major responsibility. By 2006&#150;07, they will be responsible for holding the budget for probation and prisons in their regions, commissioning services for prisons and local probation boards, holding both prison and probation areas to account for their performance, improving performance by developing contestability and allowing alternative service providers to compete for work so that regions obtain the best value for money in managing offenders.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para24">I do not understand how such a task can be managed at regional level. My area will include not only Merseyside, but Cheshire, Lancashire, Manchester and Cumbria, each with wide-ranging and varied offending problems. I fear that the regional structure will lead simply to increased bureaucracy, not better local results. What works in Bootle does not necessarily work in Crosby, and we must not lose sight of that in the re-organisation. I wish to receive reassurance that ROMs will work to make a strong, local focus possible within a regional structure, or else the structure will fail. As much commissioning as possible should be carried out locally rather than regionally to make delivery of contracts as relevant as possible to local people, their local problems and local issues.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para25">Following consultation, the Government decided to retain the current structure of the probation service only for the time being. The fact that regional offender managers are working with the 42 existing local boards seems to be an example of the Government&#039;s improved stance towards consultation, and I firmly welcome it. I was initially pleased by my hon. Friend the Minister&#039;s response in July 2004 to concerns about the move to a regional structure. He seems to have acted on consultation responses that included reservations about regionalisation, especially the replacement of probation boards populated by members of the local community with regional boards, which, it was thought, would disrupt links and reduce local accountability. The focus was to be end-to-end management of offenders and contestability, which also gave cause for concern.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para26">As well as the retention of probation boards, my hon. Friend explained that individual offender management would work at local level because it understands the importance of links at local level. I am keen to see how that will transpire in organisational reality. I am also aware that he emphasised that it was not a good idea to move to new regional boards for several reasons. However, regardless of his comments, it seems that NOMS is moving towards a more regional structure so, despite concerns expressed about such a move, plans have been postponed, not changed. Given that my hon. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 472WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Friend the Minister still intends to move towards a regional structure and to replace the probation boards, those real worries have not been addressed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para27">Such a change will be driven centrally and result in a lack of local accountability, and I want local accountability. I do not want to undermine the good multi-agency work that is happening in my constituency and throughout Merseyside. Will my hon. Friend clarify whether NOMS will move towards a more regional structure and, if so, what will it look like? If regionalism is the goal, the Government need to assure parliamentarians and key stakeholders that that will make improvements to what already exists.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para28">I should also like more information about the role and the powers of local offender managers. I am concerned that the Prison Service seems to have opted out of NOMS and, thus, that offender managers will not be able to affect the programmes in prison as they will have no authority over prison governors. Will my hon. Friend expand on the role and responsibilities of offender managers and explain how much influence they will have over the management of offenders in prison? I should be grateful if he told me whether he intends to remove local probation boards because it is important that they have power and resources to make links at local level. I, for one, am much in favour of local probation boards.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para29">Community involvement was seen to be an important feature of NOMS, as are restorative justice measures. On that, one charity said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;we support measures to treat civil renewal as a matter of building confidence, resilience and social capital so that crime can be reduced and lower level nuisances can be dealt with by civil and social measures, including restorative measures, without recourse to the criminal justice process.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para30">I say amen to that. I fear that the move to regionalisation could damage those links with the local community, and we must retain them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para31">I am not necessarily opposed to the inclusion of a regional tier; there is definitely a place for a regional section within the proposals, for strategic purposes alone. However, the form of regionalism that NOMS seems to be moving towards would undermine the strengths of the current system, particularly the criminal justice partnerships that have been established in all our communities and are beginning to work well.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para32">The criminal justice system has been moving towards a partnership approach to tackling crime and disorder since the introduction of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, in recognition of the fact that organisations and individuals can achieve more if they work together than if they work in isolation. The 1998 Act places a joint responsibility on local authorities and police to formulate and implement strategies to reduce crime and disorder in their area. They must do that in co-operation with a large number of organisations from the statutory, private and voluntary sectors. They must also consult the local community about their proposals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para33">Partnership groups make decisions on the setting of local priorities, targets, strategies and resources, and most have established a series of working groups to assess that process. Those working groups bring particular expertise to bear on a specific issue and make recommendations. Membership of the working groups will vary according to the issues that they address. They

&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 473WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
may contain a wider range of agencies than those represented in partnership groups, including agencies such as Victim Support and neighbourhood watch schemes. Vitally, they also involve members of the local community. Members of our local community are currently involved in criminal justice partnerships, which address problems caused by criminals operating locally. They are keen to ensure that such offenders are involved in restorative justice programmes that they have access to and have a voice in, and we cannot afford to lose that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para34">The probation boards operating in each of the 42 probation areas have boundaries that are contiguous with constabulary and court boundaries. That has encouraged the growth of local partnerships between a range of agencies and service providers covering the same area, from crime reduction and disorder partnerships and the local criminal justice boards to primary care trusts and local authorities. We are currently in a utopia of coterminous authorities, and we wreck that at our peril. The Carter report vision is for the continuation of such partnerships, and it highlights the need for improving shared information. I totally agree with that direction, as do the people I have spoken to and the responses I have seen in the summary of responses to the consultation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para35">My local probation service is outstanding; through my experiences with it, I am aware of the good practice that emerges through collaboration&#151;it has taken great pains to demonstrate that to me on more than one occasion. There is a lot of support for increasing the use of partnerships, although concerns have been raised about how that might happen in practice. In general, organisations appeared to be keen to work with each other, and to develop the work that has been done in recent years. The Probation Boards Association said that it would


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;welcome the increased use of the voluntary/not-for-profit sector in dealing with the needs of offenders and communities. These partnerships not only add to the capacity of probation boards to deliver services but play an important part in community engagement and awareness-raising.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para36">The second part of &quot;National Offender Management Service&#151;Next Steps&quot; summarises the response to the second consultation, which focused on the preferred organisational design of the new service. Despite the support that there is for increased partnership working, many respondents made it clear that they felt that there was no need for radical structural changes, and that the required changes in delivery could be brought about without so much upheaval to staff&#151;staff who have been involved in the process of change for many years. That process is not conducive to good, efficient working, or the improvement of morale.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para38">The local probation boards and the probation facilities feel disfranchised from the process of restructuring the probation services and are yet to be convinced that the models on offer will do anything to enhance the effectiveness of their role in relation to prisoners.

There is an element of d&#233;j&#224; vu about this whole debate. I, too, was dissatisfied with the Minister&#039;s responses to the last debate, and I asked him to reply to all Members present in writing, but I had not yet had a letter from him until he handed me today a copy of a letter dated 24 March. To the best of my knowledge, it has not yet arrived in my office, and even it does not fully answer all the questions raised in the debate. There have been answers subsequent to the debate and publication of the <i>Hansard</i> report of it, but the hon. Lady may, like me, not have had the advantage of seeing even that inadequate letter.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew4"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas </b> : NOMS, the probation service and prisons are not on many parliamentarians&#039; list of hot topics, but they are certainly on mine. A discrete number of colleagues in the House are interested in this matter, and we will not let it rest. We know that there are significant consequences to changing the probation and prison services. I want to ensure that any changes deliver a better service, and I will not stop until I have seen evidence of that and probation boards tell me that what is going to happen is better. Those people have the experience, and I am not going to argue with them because that experience has been gained over a long period, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire just said.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para39">Many respondents to the consultation pointed out that existing local relationships, both formal and informal, were important in ensuring successful management. As I said earlier, and as I intend to repeat, I want local people working with the crime and disorder partnerships, the probation boards, the youth offender teams and the youth justice boards to ensure that there is local accountability. That matters immensely to me.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para40">One of the strongest messages coming from the consultation was concern about regional rather than local delivery structures. Numerous respondents pointed out how integral local structures and partnerships were to criminal justice services, and it was felt that the NOMS design would reduce that. The NOMS design does nothing to enhance those organisations that were set up as a result of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and runs counter to many of the measures introduced under that Act that focused on local involvement and local agency working.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 475WH</b>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para41">Local arrangements supported by local people are necessary to ensure that work with offenders can be carried out effectively and in partnership with the range of other agencies which provide services to offenders. Furthermore, co-operation between locally managed probation services, the police and courts has been vital to crime reduction and the running of youth justice teams, which have been enabled by coterminous boundaries.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para42">I am extremely impressed with the work on Merseyside through multi-agency public protection arrangements, and there are currently interagency arrangements to tackle serious crime. Those arrangements bring together all the relevant agencies and organisations to share information on the minority of offenders who cause the most concern&#151;that is, sexual or violent offenders.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para43">Until the mid to late 1990s, joined-up work was patchy. Agencies tended to work in isolation and guard their information on offenders, often managed in isolated pockets of time. That would mean one agency closing a file, with another opening a new one. Now, there is file sharing, and things are much better. A different approach prevails, and we have seen good examples of it in Liverpool. One of the basic principles of sharing such information is illustrated by the Liverpool intensive supervision monitoring scheme, whereby the police and probation officers have access to each others&#039; computer files. Three levels of seriousness have been introduced to assist the process. Level 3 is the most serious and is reserved for the critical few who pose a risk to the community that requires input from a range of agencies. Senior managers come together locally to allocate significant resources to manage such individuals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para44">The scheme has been successful, as the 2003&#150;04 statistics indicate. Some 67 individuals were subject to a level 3 multi-agency protection panel, and only two were subsequently charged with a new serious offence. In areas such as Bootle, that meant a massive reduction in some drug-related crime; and by massive I mean 80 per cent. The agents involved in the exercise&#151;they are involved to this day&#151;say that that is the result of multi-agency working and local solutions to local problems.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para45">It is worth giving a real example. AA, who is just 20, has been in trouble with the law all his life and is serving a long prison sentence for violent muggings on trains. He has a history of psychological problems, made worse by drink and drug abuse. He has completed his intensive offending behaviour programme, acquired some educational qualifications during his prison sentence and faced up to the effects of his behaviour on his victims. He will soon be released on licence to complete his prison sentence under supervision in the community, which I applaud.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para46">A MAPPA meeting will therefore be called to ensure that all the supervision arrangements are in place, to monitor his progress. At such meetings, all agencies share information, assess the risk and agree actions to be taken by the various agency representatives. In AA&#039;s case, the agencies involved will work together, as they understand that although good use is being made of custody time, he must be supported in the community.

<a name="50406h03_para47">Merseyside has formed a strategic management board made up of the relevant senior agency representatives, as well as the prison and probation services and the police. The board includes representatives of Support After Murder and Manslaughter&#151;SAMM&#151;the director of social services, the area manager of the St. Helens youth offending team and the deputy director of nursing for Mersey Care NHS Trust, to name but a few. Those people will be lost the regional structure, but we cannot afford to lose them. They must stay in place.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para48">The head of St. Helens youth offending services has found that the work has informed his involvement with the strategic management board and feels that it has helped his understanding of issues involving victims of crime and the wider community. Where is there a place for such people in the current organisational structures for ROMs? I cannot see it. Does that mean that their role disappears, or does it mean that they are pulled into the centre of NOMS, a long way from Merseyside and the problems that my constituents experience.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para49">Carol Chalmers, who is the chief executive of victim support and witness services in Merseyside, also welcomes her part in the multi-agency partnership. She says that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;research has shown that a collaborative approach in addressing the issues surrounding serious offenders is essential to prevent re-offending re-occurring&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. public protection is dependant upon thorough co-ordination by all the key agencies.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para50">I have laboured the point about localisation of the structure long enough and should turn to contestability. The Minister wants to place contestability at the heart of NOMS to ensure the best services. In an interview with <i>NOMS Update</i> magazine in January, Christine Knott explained that ROMs were already forging links with the key people in their regions and would quickly begin working to separate offender management from interventions. That will mean that existing providers will compete with private and voluntary sector providers to supply interventions in the community, thus leading to secrecy rather than information sharing. If agencies have to compete for work, they will develop their own strategies and ways of preparing and pricing programmes. There will not be the sharing of best practice between providers that we have now. I have seen that kind of sharing in action; providers say, &quot;What is working with you? This is working with us.&quot; If they all have to contract for work, there will be no sharing of good practice. People will keep good practice to themselves in the hope that they can win further contracts, and I am deeply opposed to that.

Is she concerned, as I am, that the NOMS overhead associated with producing, considering and monitoring myriad contracts with public, private and voluntary sector providers will itself be a very substantial cost? Perhaps we may judge by early experiences in the related area of hostels facilities and management contracts. The experience there, according to people who have e-mailed me, is that the situation

<a name="50406h03_para51">That is just a scandal. We do not need to look into a crystal ball; we can look back at what happened in that area when there was contestability, outsourcing and privatisation. Is not that the case?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas </b> : I agree absolutely; that is my experience. We have seen repeated examples of that when we have privatised a service. Privatisation may provide a service at less cost, but that does not mean it is more effective. We cannot overestimate the sophistication of the programmes developed to address the criminal habits of some individuals. The programmes have to be specifically tailored for each individual at great expense to the taxpayers. That is as a result of the criminals&#039; action in the first place. The result is further expense to try to curtail and manage their behaviour in future. Experts currently put these programmes together, and they work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para52">A regional structure will incur greater costs, and those will have to be shared by each of the probation services, so we will get increasing costs and supervision. I want to know how that translates to the bottom line in terms of improved delivery. Quite frankly, I do not want any more managers in the system; I want more people out on the streets doing work with offenders.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para53">Many probation staff feel clearly threatened by the proposal to split the purchaser-provider functions, as do the trade unions. Nearly 60 per cent. of union responses were strongly against the proposal. One union said that the split would

<p class="tabletext">&quot;run counter to Patrick Carter&#039;s original aim of &#039;breaking down the silos of the services&#039; and will have a negative impact on staff and on the recruitment of staff, as well as on the principles of the service.&quot;</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para54">The move towards contestability seems to go against the principle suggested in the Carter report.

and I am proud to be so. This is an essential part of my job. Many of us do not like to think of prisoners coming back into the community and reoffending. I have been trying my damnedest to limit that eventuality in my community. That is why I have such a great interest in the subject, and I do not intend to relinquish that interest.

<p>
<a name="50406h03_para57">In a press statement, the National Association of Probation Officers said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The purpose of the National Offender Management Service, which is established in today&#039;s Bill, is to dismantle the Probation Service and introduce privatisation in order to drive down costs. This will be done through reducing terms and conditions of staff.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para58">That is not necessarily the case. However, the statement went on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This is unlikely to reduce re-offending and, indeed, could actually lead to an increase in crime, because quantity not quality will become the main principle.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para59">It is not the cost but the value that matters. There is therefore a belief that NOMS will cause disruption in the service while failing in its aim to reduce reoffending.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para60">As I have mentioned, one of the most effective methods of working in the probation service of late has been the multi-agency approach. I argued that that would be undermined if the boundaries of the probation service were changed. It will be more difficult to maintain links as their focuses will vary. However, multi-agency working, which we have been moving towards, faces a greater threat from the decision to move towards contestability through the separation of purchaser and provider functions. As one commentator noted:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There is a risk that this approach could be counterproductive if NOMS is to succeed in delivering end-to-end management of offenders that will rely upon co-operation between service providers from all sectors.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para61">There is much evidence to support the view that dislocating the work of offender management and interventions would adversely affect the provision of an integrated, coherent and effective service to offenders.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para62">I have said enough. My primary concern is that the NOMS service will be managed regionally. The dimension of locality seems to be missing. I have looked at the organisational structures&#151;I am something of an expert in those&#151;and cannot find anything that suggests that local providers will be able to determine what best suits local needs. That is what is crucial. Moreover, our probation boards are populated by local people who are&nbsp;accountable to local people and take great pride in the work that they do. We must not prejudice the involvement of local people in the action of the probation boards&#151;that is also crucial.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para63">I am implacably opposed to contestability. At the moment it is about reducing cost and not necessarily about improving the effectiveness of services. We cannot do that. We must continue with the good work established with a number of agencies since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was introduced, which is commendable. We have worked hard to involve local people in the management of local offenders, and we have to continue to do that. I cannot see NOMS, as constituted, enabling that process of local accountability one jot. I look forward to the reassuring words that I hope to get from my hon. Friend the Minister at the end of the debate, which will address not

<br>&nbsp;<br>
only my concerns but those of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire and of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), as expressed in recent debates. We must have overt and coherent answers to our concerns. If we do not, I have a long and interesting record of writing parliamentary questions about the matter.

</p>




<a name="50406h03_time1"><h5>2.39 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50406h03_spnew9"><b> Mr. Mark Oaten  (Winchester)</b>  (LD): I warmly congratulate the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas), who has spoken with enormous passion. Her anger and commitment have been made clear in her remarks. She need not apologise for speaking at length, because I have to say that I agreed with every single word. I have learnt a great deal. She is right to say that, cross-party, we all wanted to take a sensible way forward from the Carter review. We need one organisation to look at the whole criminal sentence process; many of us were concerned about the different parts of the organisation. When the National Offender Management Service was being talked about as a result of Carter, there was a sense that quite a bit of consensus could be achieved. As we know, a lot of the good will was lost over the birth of NOMS. There is no point in going over the history, but NOMS certainly did not start out well because of how it was managed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para64">However, I sign up to the underlying objectives and aims that people are trying to achieve. The hon. Member for Crosby was right to talk about the problems experienced after the launch, and about the lack of consultation. I was interested to hear her comments about the current stakeholder forum, and I hope that that represents a more constructive approach. It is a pity that it has come so late; we could have achieved much more in a different way if it had been there before. Never mind; it is there now, and let us hope that it is a building block for a better way forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para65">The hon. Member for Crosby was right to look harshly at some of the issues of structure. Structure is critical; it is important that we get the right level. I was taken by her illustrations of the fact that what works in Bootle may not work in Crosby. We all know about that principle from our experiences in different parts of the country. We have to have a strong local focus, and one way to achieve that is for a set of individuals to work in their communities at making people aware, particularly of work on probation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para66">That is why the probation boards have been so helpful in building those links. I see the structure issue&#151;whether there should be organisations in different regions&#151;and the probation board issue as one. My experience of meeting probation boards, such as the one serving my area in Hampshire and Winchester, is that good chief executives and individuals on them will go out and be advocates. They will, if you like, sell the service of probation&#151;and by golly it needs selling. It needs explaining, and it needs businesses and communities to be signed up to the work that is taking place. The person running the probation service in my area, and the chairman of the board, have done excellent work in talking to local newspapers, writing articles, holding receptions in their offices, bringing businesses in and persuading the community that they should be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 480WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
taking individuals who are part of community service. They have been the advocates. However, I have to say that we would not have gone to their receptions or events unless they had been locally focused and we had been on first-name terms with some of those individuals who, we felt, were embedded and knew about the community. The hon. Lady was absolutely right to raise that issue.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para67">She was also right to raise concerns about contestability&#151;horrible word. I am not ideologically opposed to the private sector being involved in running public services. I have never bought into the argument of public good, private bad. I have always been very open minded about how things should work. However, in some areas the private sector is not necessarily appropriate; sometimes, deciding whether to bring in the private sector is very complex. I have concerns about that, particularly in relation to prisons; the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) is right to say that the process starts with prisons.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para68">I am uneasy about the assumption that a failing prison may be ripe for contestability and for a private company to come in. Surely we should examine some of the reasons why prisons are struggling in the first place and the assumption that their problems can be solved by a different organisational structure. Such problems cannot always be solved in that way. Many prisons are failing because of issues of funding, location, the age of the buildings and pressures of overcrowding&#151;reasons that have very little to do with management and the individuals running through.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para69">I am also concerned about how things are being done, given the need for a level playing field. I have one specific question for the Minister. There appear to be different offender management targets in different prisons. I am told that public-sector prisons have the target of keeping overcrowding to under 24 per cent. However, the target for overcrowding in contracted prisons is 34 per cent. That seems bizarre; there are unlevel playing fields for contracted and publicly-run prisons when it comes to targeting. Will the Minister respond, or write to me, on that? That would be helpful. If we have unlevel playing fields on contestability, there will obviously be some concerns.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para70">I conclude with some thoughts about why it is so important to get matters right, and on the challenge for those working in probation and in the prisons. The hon. Member for Crosby said it may be that not all politicians want to talk about that. My party will talk about it in the next four weeks, during the general election campaign, although there is a risk in doing so. The other parties are already distributing leaflets misquoting things that I have said about whether prison works but I shall keep on talking about prison, and about the importance of getting this right, because if we are serious about tackling crime, one obvious way of reducing the number of criminal offences is to reduce the number of people who leave prison and reoffend.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para71">I need not bore those in this Chamber, who are all familiar with them, with the statistics: more than 50 per cent. of prisoners&#151;and more than 70 per cent. of 18 to 21-year-olds&#151;who leave prison reoffend. Prison is expensive, and we should get better value for money than reoffending rates such as that. Probation and prison working together can play a key role in tackling that reoffending rate, and they need to work better to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 481WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
enable individuals who leave prison to access housing and probation. Multi-agencies need to have a role in that too. The system needs to work better so that prisoners on probation and out in the community doing community service have good access to drug rehabilitation and alcohol programmes; we know that they are effective.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para72">Tackling the problem of education and training is critical to the process. Let me end with an anecdote that has troubled me enormously. I met a prisoner who was due for release and congratulated her on her release, but she said that she did not want to be released. When I asked why, she said, &quot;Because I am in the middle of a hairdressing course and I want to continue it. I am going to be released in three weeks&#039; time and the course in prison will finish in about four months. I have tried everywhere to be able to continue the course outside prison, and I cannot, so I would much rather stay here to continue the course, to get the qualification and to become a hairdresser and get a job.&quot;

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para73">The situation is nonsensical. It highlights that it is essential to bring together probation, prison and all the agencies if we are to tackle that sort of problem and all the others that go with integration. I congratulate the hon. Member for Crosby on having raised the issue and I hope that the Minister will give us satisfactory responses. It is important, it is critical; it is a really big issue that needs to be tackled. The intentions behind NOMS were good, but it has gone off the rails. There could be good will across all parties to get it back on track.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew10"><b> David Taylor </b> : Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the ways of getting back on the rails&#151;the present prisons Minister is the best we have had in the past eight years&#151;would be for NOMS to publish a detailed business plan that can be scrutinised, debated and measured against standards that people will accept as being those of a good public sector organisation?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew11"><b> Mr. Oaten </b> : I agree; the sooner that happens, the better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para74">I am informed that the NOMS business plan has just been published and put on the Home Office website, although it appears not to have been circulated to probation boards and chief officers. The Minister may be able to confirm that; it was mentioned in a briefing note that I received a couple of days ago. If that is the case, it is a shame that those on the front line have not received it. On the other hand, they can access the website. At least the information is available. If it has not been put across in the right way, that is another example of how this issue is not handled as well as it might be. We have an opportunity to get it right. We are a long way from doing so, but the will is there to make it work in future.

</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew12"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham)</b>  (Con): There is a huge element of d&#233;j&#224; vu about our debate, but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted that the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) has given us another opportunity to beard the Minister in this den of Westminster Hall. I hope that he will be left with a lot more time to answer today&#039;s debate, as we have a lot more questions and many are hanging over from previous debates.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 482WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para75">I congratulate the hon. Member for Crosby on her introduction to the debate. I understand that the Minister is married to a lady from Crosby. I hope that that will soften him up for his replies to the debate&#151;and I hope that the hon. Lady will have more success in getting replies out of the Minister than did other Members did in this Chamber on previous occasions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para76">I identify strongly with the story told by the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten). Unfortunately, the Liberal Democrats do not have much continuity in dealing with the subject; the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) was speaking on prisons in the previous Westminster Hall debate. It would be nice to see consistency, with the same people following the subject through.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para77">I, too, have spoken to many prisoners and discovered that the way in which they are prepared for release is so inadequate that they would rather stay inside. Recidivism is one thing, but it borders on the ridiculous that people can be so frightened of re-entering society that they would prefer to lose their liberty. That is when probation officers and prison officers come to the fore. They are the very people, the experts, needed to deliver a reduction in reoffending and to help ex-prisoners to take a proper role in society&#151;a role in which they can contribute by working and paying tax rather than being a net drain on society. We all share that view.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para78">To a certain extent, the Carter principles, the rebalancing of sentencing and a greater congruence between the work of the Prison Service and the probation service to help reduce reoffending and to protect the public is something to which we all subscribe. I have no doubt about that. Nevertheless, however pleasant, charming and helpful the Minister is, I am afraid that we seem to be descending into a quagmire. People do not know what is going on, and communications are exceedingly poor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para79">I understand that a group or cluster of prisons has already been put out to competition under the National Offender Management Service, but the Bill has gone nowhere. I was today handed a letter in reply to the debate that was instigated the other day by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor). That letter confirms that the first competition has gone ahead, but the points that I raised on the Bill were not dealt with, other than the Minister stating:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is regrettable that the Parliamentary timetable has not allowed for this Bill to be progressed more swiftly; however, I confirm that I have no intention of withdrawing the Bill this Session.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para80">That was allegedly written on 24 March; yet on 6 April, today, the Bill has little likelihood of success. I hope that the Minister is not going to pick a horse on the Grand National on Saturday; I am not sure that I would trust his judgment. It was an open secret: everyone knew that the Bill would go nowhere&#151;everyone except the Minister, who seemed always to stand up for it. I have heard rumours that the Bill will be redrafted&#151;I am sure it will&#151;yet NOMS is rolling on apace without legislative scrutiny, and the Minister has not consulted those involved in the work or Members of the House. Despite that, the change affects every constituency.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para81">The business plan is not an impressive document. It is one of the thinnest business plans that I have seen for a long time. I, too, know about business and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 483WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
management. The business plan runs to five pages. The corporate plan is a little longer, but several of its pages show pictures of the members of the NOMS executive board. I thought that legislation had to be scrutinised by the House before the changes took place, but the plan mentions April 2005. I am not sure when it was prepared, but it must have been obvious that the Bill would not be introduced or debated. We question how it was introduced and how it is being managed by the Home Office. I have no doubt that there is general confusion and chaos, and that communications are poor.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew13"><b> David Taylor </b> : I shall dash back to my office to look at the website and examine the business plan to which the hon. Lady refers. What matters is quality, not length, but I have seen what appear to be more substantial business plans for village halls. We are talking about a major public service that obviously needs billions of pounds of public money, and the trauma of change is envisaged. Condensing that to five sides of A4 paper means that it is unlikely to have been done well.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew14"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : It is hard to glean much detail from it, but it has just appeared on the Home Office website and one must ask to whom it has been sent because the chief probation officers have not received it yet. I am not sure what the distribution process is for information, but while we are talking about communications from the Home Office, I note that NOMS officials have acknowledged that communications have been poor. I understand that the NOMS updates that are circulated to all staff have also dried up. Will the Minister confirm that NOMS updates have not been issued to staff recently and that they have been left in the dark on a permanent basis at a time of unprecedented change? Goodness only knows. I used to work for Arthur Young when it merged with Ernst and Whinney, and became Ernst and Young, and we had daily communications. In a major upheaval in a major organisation, the staff must be spoken to, informed and consulted, not kept in the dark. At a time such as this, during a general election, the updates should not be allowed to dry up.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para82">I question the way in which the whole process is being managed. Our prison and probation services are not running along nicely. Indeed, they are in crisis in many areas: we still have gross overcrowding in some areas; the prison system is 24 per cent. overcrowded, as confirmed by Anne Owers; and there are at least two self-inflicted deaths a week. Last year, prison staff had to resuscitate 228 prisoners&#151;that is 228 lives that were saved by the people who are not being consulted about the way in which their jobs are being changed&#151;and there were almost 18,000 incidents of self-harm in our prisons. We are talking about the most vulnerable people in our society, who are at the mercy of the state, and about the people who provide this service to our society.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para83">There are still many questions, and I am disappointed in the response so far as this should not be a contentious matter. Members of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties have pressed the Minister for an answer, but answers came there none. There is silence on so much about the way in which NOMS has been put forward.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 484WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para84">Throughout this process, I have been briefed by the unions and their representatives, and I have been pleased to do business with them as they have conducted themselves in a first-class fashion. They have sought not to make political mileage but to get their organisations&#039; voices heard by the Labour Government. I am grateful for the fair way in which they have briefed me.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para85">The National Association of Probation Officers believes that there are still huge gaps and unanswered questions, and that the vision that the Minister has so often articulated about the statement of purpose for the Prison Service and the aims of the probation service is silent on the objective of rehabilitating those who have offended. It is an alarming indictment that it is silent on core values and principles. It is silent on achieving diversity and treating people with humanity, and on supporting the staff. Believe me, the staff do not feel supported. It is silent on the principles of openness and transparency, on the need for problem-solving approaches and on the need for an approach based on partnership and collaboration. That is a fundamental criticism of the process, which is reflected in the way in which the hon. Member for Crosby introduced the debate.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para86">I do not want to speak for too long, as I want to leave the Minister plenty of time to respond, but I am worried. My having covered this brief for the past year and having spoken to so many people, it is natural that documents should be sent to me from time to time, and I need some explanation from the Minister about some of them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para87">There is no doubt that this is a time of unprecedented change with the major sentencing reforms in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 being introduced this week, on 4 April. The challenges from the changes to the courts and the criminal justice service, particularly the probation service, are great, and our services need stability and support if they are to achieve the aims that the Minister and the Home Office have set out for them. However, at the same time, we have NOMS going on.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para88">The business plan for the national probation service is obviously assessed internally within the Home Office. I have been passed something called annex C which is a summary risk register for 2005&#150;06. I think that I understand the document, but I would like the Minister to answer some questions about it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para89">The risk register takes a couple of headings from the circular and identifies the likelihood of the risk taking place and what the impact would be of certain happenings. The first heading is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Contributing to the building of an excellent National Offender Management Service with the separation of Offender Management from Interventions: During 2005&#150;06 areas will be expected to reorganise themselves to establish a clear operational division between offender management and interventions.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para90">The risks and risk descriptions are then laid out, accompanied by a traffic-light system. One obviously, therefore, looks at the ones marked in red. I find there that there is a medium likelihood, with a high impact, and a risk rating assessment which is right up the register, that a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;lack of programme and programme management for NOMS implementation leads to uncertainty resulting in drop in performance and organisational effectiveness&quot;</p>
</ul>

&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 485WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para91">of the prison and probation service. That sounds pretty serious. I would like to know what the Minister thinks a medium risk with a high impact is. Also considered to be of medium risk is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;insufficient priority to establishment of new interventions organisation results in non-viable interventions capacity.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para92">Likewise, a medium risk is given to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;inadequate workforce planning to meet challenges of new CJA/Offender Manager development results in loss of confidence by sentencers.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para93">All those risks fall into the red area.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para94">The next heading is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Working purposefully with other criminal justice agencies to protect the public from harm.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para95">I really want some answers from the Minister today on that area. Various risks have been identified, with their likelihood of the risk taking place and the impact. The first is


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;industrial action/work to rule leading to disruption of service delivery.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para96">Apparently the Home Office considers that to be a medium risk. However, there is also considered to be a high risk of a


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;loss of key skills resulting in inadequate supervision of dangerous offenders&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para97">of which the impact would also be high. That is rated outside the traffic-light system: it goes to black.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para98">Another area considered to be of very high risk and very high impact is described as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Failure to obtain GSI accreditation results in reduced cross-CJS collaboration leading to failure to deliver benefits of joined up for CJS.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para99">I understand that that is a total failure of communications by e-mail; it does not work. There is considered to be a very high likelihood of it happening, and a very high risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para100">We are talking about a system for managing offenders. They are vulnerable people and people who, if they are not properly contained, looked after, managed and seen through the process&#151;as the Minister likes to call it&#151;of offender management, may put other people at risk. If this document says that even the basic communication system is not going to work, I am worried. Will the Minister comment on that?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para101">There is also considered to be a high risk of


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;inadequate supervision of cases leading to high profile media attention and unmanageable policy making.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para102">The impact of that would also be very high. Again, that is put in a black box, so it is outside the traffic-light system&#151;it is right at the top of the risk rating.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para103">If all that is the case, everything that has ever been said by the Opposition on this area is coming home to roost; the prison and probation service have been tipped into a position in which risks are being run. The Minister should take the 25 minutes available not only to respond to the points raised by the hon. Member for Crosby, but to talk us through those risk assessments. I am sure that they will be easy for him to dismiss. He said, &quot;Well it might happen; that is how we look at the risks&quot;. However, we deserve an answer from the Minister, even this close to a general election, when the ratings against the risk factors that I have identified in the debate are &quot;very high&quot;.

<a name="50406h03_para104">Our prison and probation services are very good. I am proud of them, and they deserve first-class treatment for the first-class job that they try to do. As I said, they do not deserve the current chaos and uncertainty, and I look to the Minister to answer today and not to write to me before the election.

I am grateful for that, because we are a year into what we always said was a five-year programme of development of the National Offender Management Service. It was never a service that could be pulled out of a hat or developed in five minutes. It is a complex arrangement that will take time to deliver and to develop properly.

Members do not confuse the business plan with the business case, which has frequently been requested and which, as I confirmed in the previous debate, is currently the subject of a Freedom of Information Act application. We will reconsider our refusal to publish the full business case if we accept that application, but in the meantime we have the business plan, which any public service is expected to provide, for the immediate period ahead. That is the document to which we are referring. I will talk about that issue later in more detail.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para108">I have never hidden the fact that there has been a need to improve communication with the work force to ensure that they are engaged and involved in the

<br>&nbsp;<br>
development of the organisation and its work. That is and remains my vision for the development of NOMS. We have taken steps to ensure that communication is improved. I will also talk about that later.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para109">Do I believe that staff now understand everything and feel confident that their positions in the organisation are secure? I fully accept that many members of staff do not feel like that, which is regrettable. It therefore remains an urgent task for Ministers and other senior officials to ensure that that dialogue is intensified and developed, because no one has anything to fear from the development of the service. Professionals and everyone else who is engaged in the system have everything to gain from the more coherent system that will be developed through the service.

<p><a name="50406h03_spnew17"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas </b> : The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) stated that the five-page business plan had not been distributed to our chairmen and chief executives. The chairmen, in the inception of NOMS, were excluded from discussions and I know that there has been an attempt to address the omission, but can the Minister confirm that the business plan and the accompanying corporate plan have been distributed to the chief executive of the probation authorities and the chairmen and that they received them before we did?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew18"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I cannot confirm that a specific copy has been sent personally to each of the people my hon. Friend mentions. There is no secret about the documents. They have been published on the website and they are there for people to see. If my hon. Friend suggests that people in those key positions in the local organisations do not routinely look at the Home Office website and need their attention to be drawn to this, that is worth considering. I will happily go back and check whether direct communications were made. If they have not been I will make sure that they are. My hon. Friend is entirely right.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew19"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew20"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I will, although several hon. Members complained that I did not respond adequately to questions last time. I always give way in debates because it is important to exchange views. But if hon. Members want their questions to be answered they will have to give me a little time to complete my remarks.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew21"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas </b> : The Minister says that it is incumbent on chairmen and chief executives to check the website. That is a bit like me saying to my constituents, &quot;If you want an answer to a problem, go to my website.&quot; That is not acceptable. These people are pivotal in the delivery of services. They ought to be treated as such and receive the correspondence that is pertinent to their job. I must receive assurances that that will be the case. I am exceptionally busy and I do not check my website every day. I do not expect them to have to check a document that is available to the general public to find out information that is directly pertinent to them and the operation of their service.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew22"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I do not wish to go down a blind alley here. I was simply making the point that I would expect 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 488WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
those people to have seen the business plan. My hon. Friend is quite right: we should ensure that they have seen them for certain. I will check that they have.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew23"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : May I help the Minister?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew24"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I will be happy to receive the hon. Lady&#039;s assistance, but my hon. Friend has this assurance: I am not a Minister who will take a punt on whether something has happened, even if it probably has, if I do not know for certain. I always check things thoroughly. If it has not happened, it will happen.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew25"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : A probation board&#039;s briefing was emailed to me yesterday. It says that the business plan and the NOMS corporate plan have just appeared on the Home Office website. To whom has it been sent? It was not sent, apparently, to probation chief officers or boards. I was told that in direct briefing from a probation board. The Minister can take it that it has not been sent to them. It does not surprise me because there is so much in these documents that needs to be answered. The Minister will understand that they will be concerned about all the efficiency savings, for example, that are laid out to be achieved in these documents.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew26"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : Nothing in the business plans will come as a surprise to any of the chief officers engaged in the delivery of the services. I make the point again: I will check and if they have not received the plan already, they will. I will be in touch with my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby to let her know the outcome.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para110">I must press on as time is receding very rapidly. Our correctional services have more investment going in now than ever before. Almost &#163;4 billion is going into our prison and probation services. They are performing better than ever. There is no question about that. But, as has emerged from the debate, we still need to do more, not least in reducing rates of reoffending. It is that determination to reduce rates of reoffending that lies at the heart of the offender management service reforms.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para111">I was delighted to hear my hon. Friend declare openly that she shared the vision for NOMS. She rightly pointed out that she and the Home Affairs Committee had welcomed the introduction of NOMS. There is no disagreement between us there. I hope that I will be able to offer her some reassurance on some of her detailed points about organisational structure and so on. Our determination is threefold. I have made these points before, but I need to make them again. First, we need to rebalance the system. My hon. Friend studies these things carefully and she knows that far too many people are still in the wrong part of the criminal justice system. Too many are in prison on short-term sentences rather than on robust community sentences, and too many have the support and supervision of probation officers when they should have been dealt with through a fine. We are determined to reinvigorate the fine and to ensure that community sentences are properly developed and robust and that there are adequate and proper places in prison for the serious and dangerous offenders who need to be there. The need to rebalance the system is absolutely fundamental.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para112">Secondly, we need to introduce a proper system of offender management. In his report, Patrick Carter always referred to the two silos of prison and probation. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 489WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
No matter how well those services perform, we can no longer have a system that is divided in that way. We need individual offender managers who are accountable to individual offenders and responsible for their sentence plans. That is particularly important now&#151;if it was not before&#151;following the introduction on Monday of the new sentencing framework. Under that framework, a determinate prisoner, for example, will spend the first part of their sentence in prison and the whole of the second part of their sentence after they have left prison under community supervision. We shall have one sentence, in two parts, properly managed by one offender manager. That gives us real hope that we can do far more to join up the systems.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para113">The story that the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oaten) told was horrific. Somebody was making progress because of a hairdressing course, but they were unable to see that progress sustained beyond the prison gates. Whether we are talking about hairdressing training, education, drug treatment, mental health support, employment or accommodation, provisions must be followed through coherently in one system. That is why I am so passionate about the need to introduce offender management right through the system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para114">The third element is contestability. We need to drive out more value for the huge amounts of investment that we are making. That is not privatisation or old-fashioned market testing, which seeks to cut the costs of our services. We have made guarantees, not least in relation to the contestability process for the three prisons on the Isle of Sheppey, that we are not looking for cost reductions. We are looking for added value and a bigger impact on reducing rates of reoffending.


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para115">I want the private sector, the voluntary sector and the not-for-profit sector to deepen the partnership that they already have with our Prison Service and probation service. I was delighted to meet people from the Pitstop project in Calderdale in a room nearby, and I hope that hon. Members present also had the opportunity to do so. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) drew my attention to that voluntary organisation, which works to prevent young people from getting involved in crime in the first place. I want the correctional services to embrace such organisations, to bring them on side and to see them as part and parcel of the system. That is what contestability is, and that organisation, like any voluntary organisation or private company, should have the chance to bid for the work.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew27"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas </b> : I have looked at what organisational structures and schematics exist for NOMS. The Minister has asserted that there will be continuous management of individuals&#039; rehabilitation programmes inside and outside prison, but nothing in the current structure demonstrates that. On the contrary, there is one line saying that prison services will be paid for and one saying that probation services will be paid for; there is no box that draws the two together. Will the Minister confirm that one person will be responsible for an individual and will dictate their rehabilitative programme, whether they are in prison or 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 490WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
community service? At the moment, the organisational structure does not show that; it shows two different people managing the individual in two different worlds.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew28"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Mr. Edward O&#039;Hara):</b>  Order. Before the Minister responds to that intervention, let me say that I have been taking advice about the request by the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) to speak a second time in the debate; I can find no precedent for that. She seems to have been following my advice to achieve her purpose through interventions, and I advise her to continue to do so. It is, of course, for the Minister to determine whether he has time to take all her interventions.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew29"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : As I explained, I always try to take interventions, so that we can have a genuine exchange. I can confirm to my hon. Friend that one, named, individual offender manager will be responsible for the whole sentence plan. Whether that plan is in prison, in the community, or partly in each, it will be for the individual offender manager to manage the whole plan, and to have a real input into its various elements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para116">An issue arises about where a prison governor&#039;s responsibility starts and ends. The governor is responsible for good order and discipline in the prison, as we should expect, and will continue to exercise that authority, but the system will not, as it is now, be composed of two distinct and unrelated parts. The offender manager will determine the plan and see it through and will be accountable for it and its impact. I hope that that gives greater clarity.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew30"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew31"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I should just like to mention the Isle of Sheppey, and the announcement that we made there a couple of weeks ago, because the hon. Lady asked me about that. She referred to our taking the action in question without a Bill. We are handling the contestability process in relation to the three prisons on the Isle of Sheppey within existing legislation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para117">The staff on Sheppey, entering upon the process, can do so in the knowledge that they have all the protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and all the additional protections that arise from the code designed to tackle the two-tier work force, so that, for example, a bidder cannot win the contract simply by undercutting on wages. There will have to be a level playing field.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para118">The staff can, also, begin in the knowledge that the public sector prison service has a fine and growing reputation. There is nothing to fear for anyone who works in the Prison Service in those three prisons from what is being done; what we stand to gain is added value for the work that they do.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew32"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : I hope that the Minister is not implying that after the Bill on NOMS is passed the staff would not have the protection of TUPE. According to the spirit, if not the essence, of these things, I appreciate that the Minister does not need the legislation, but to put things out so precipitately is not correct.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para119">I should like to take the Minister back to what he was saying; he said that an individual will be responsible for the sentence plan and management of an offender and 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 491WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
will be accountable. How can someone be held accountable when a prisoner is moved from London to another part of the country, and then to another and another, as happens now? Does the Minister say that there will be no churning&#151;no movement of prisoners across the country?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew33"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : The hon. Lady knows, because we have debated the subject in the past, that one of my hopes&#151;my firm expectations&#151;from the development of the offender management service, is that we shall increase the number of prisoners who are closer to home, particularly in preparation for release. She and I know&#151;we all know&#151;that good resettlement and rehabilitation are best achieved in close collaboration with the agencies in the community that can support a sentence plan beyond prison. I therefore expect that the numbers she is concerned about will reduce, and it is important that they should. The hon. Lady shakes her head, although I do not know what evidence she has to support her view. My aspiration is clear, and I believe that the increasing local and regional focus, to which I shall come in a second, will help us.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew34"><b> Mr. Oaten </b> : The Minister has talked about contestability with respect to prisons; will he deal with my point about the different overcrowding targets in the public and private sectors?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew35"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I shall happily do that; I am glad that the hon. Gentleman reminded me. It is in the notes and I hope that I should have reached it anyway. The reason for the differential is that most private sector prisons are more modern and are in a better position to cope with the pressures of overcrowding. However, of course none of us delights in an overcrowded prison system.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para120">We have recently opened up a slight capacity gap, because fewer people are in prison today than a year ago&#151;including far fewer women&#151;which is a good sign that we are achieving a rebalanced system. I am pleased that because of that we have recently been able to take out some places from the more overcrowded prisons, and reduce overcrowding. I take that issue very seriously, but the reason for the differential is that private prisons tend to be more modern and can more easily deal with it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para121">Let me move on and address some of the urgent questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby asked. We need to improve communication with staff and unions on the development of NOMS, especially in the early months. We have existing negotiating machinery between staff and the employers&#151;the Prison Service and local probation boards. We also now have the national joint council, where trade unions can meet senior NOMS officials. We are seeking to develop a stakeholder forum in which representatives of all the organisations and agencies involved in NOMS can participate, ask questions, and debate issues with senior officials and Ministers so that we can get the benefit of their advice. The initial intention was to do that through the NOMS board. On reflection, I think it would be better to keep operational issues with the senior executive board within NOMS, but also to have a wider group of stakeholders so that we can have the benefit of their advice and wisdom.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 492WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para122">I made it clear to the trade unions and staff that immediate dialogue with Ministers is also important. I want to have a kind of direct exchange with staff similar to that which we are having now.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew36"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : Will the Minister give way?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew37"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I will not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby has raised a number of questions and I want to answer as many of them as I can.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para123">I hope that our fourfold approach will sustain better communications in future. In terms of organisational development, the 10 regional offender managers are now in place. My hon. Friend referred to there being a lack of consultation. Of course we could always consult more, but the fact is that we have had two formal consultations on NOMS, one on the original report by Patrick Carter, and another on the proposal for organisational change, which took place about a year ago, and which culminated in my deciding not to press ahead with what was proposed in the consultation document. I say to those who criticise the Home Office for not consulting and listening that we have had two formal consultations, one of which resulted in me changing my mind, so we are consulting and we are listening. Do we need to do more? Yes, and we will do more. That is important.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para124">I have spoken about the development of offender management. I have been clear from the beginning that we have to get offender management on the ground and fully operational and making the impact that we know it can have. We have pilots in the north-west, and the probation service is in practice developing the split between offender management and interventions throughout the country. I am keen to make sure that that feeds through into the organisational design that will follow.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h03_para125">I want to make it clear to my hon. Friend that local connection is important. She rightly emphasised that on many occasions. I am proud that we have developed a coherent system of local partnerships across the criminal justice system; there are local crime and disorder reduction partnerships and local criminal justice boards, and all such partnerships are extremely important. NOMS will have a national structure and a regional profile, but it will also have to have that local connection.
</p>

<p><a name="50406h03_spnew39"><b> Paul Goggins </b> : I am not going to do so.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew40"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Can you advise me how I can ask the Minister to respond, outside this debate, to the serious points I have made about the risk register? In light of the fact that this Parliament is about to be dissolved, would it be in order for him to have to write to Members who have taken part in this debate within 24 hours?
</p>






<p><a name="50406h03_spnew41"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : It is quite in order for the Minister to offer to write to Members about such matters, but it is doubtful whether one could insist on his doing so within 24 hours.

<a name="50406h04_time0"><h5>3.30 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50406h04_spnew0"><b> Jane Griffiths  (Reading, East)</b>  (Lab): Like other hon. Members who are lucky enough to have secured a Back-Bench Adjournment debate, I am pleased to have such an opportunity. I wish to talk about sports cycling, and I want first to draw attention to the fact that I am proud&nbsp;to have been elected several times to the chair of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the all-party parliamentary cycling group. My predecessors in that role have moved on to illustrious roles: my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke) is now the Home Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) is Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I have been acting as adviser on sports cycling to the Minister for Sport and Tourism, my right&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. As someone who has never taken a driving test, cycling is one of my main modes of transport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para0">While we were enjoying our Easter recess&#151;perhaps eating chocolate&#151;the cycling Team GB were in Los Angeles for the world championships. It is worth remembering that, as a result of reorganisation of the cycling calendar, the team has competed in three world championships during the past 20 months, the others being in Stuttgart and Melbourne. That is on top of two world cup campaigns and the 2004 Olympics in Athens where Team GB won four medals. It does not stop there: last week, the under-23 team took part in the tour of Majorca. It is worth bearing it in mind that this year was supposed to be a rest year following the Athens Olympics. Some rest.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para1">We should congratulate the British cycling team because, at the world championship over Easter, it won six medals, including four gold medals&#151;twice as many gold medals as the next best team. I wish to put on the record the gold medal success of Rob Hayles and Mark Cavendish in the Madison; Steve Cummings, Chris Newton, Rob Hayles, Paul Manning and Ed Clancy in the men&#039;s 4 km pursuit; Victoria Pendleton for winning the women&#039;s sprint, and Jamie Staff, Jason Queally and Chris Hoy in the men&#039;s sprint relay. Jason Queally gained a silver in the men&#039;s 1 km time trial and Chris Hoy won a bronze in the men&#039;s 1 km time trial.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para2">As an hon. Member, it is always good to praise and welcome success that is built on the investment in facilities for the team based at the Manchester velodrome, which I was lucky enough to visit during the Commonwealth games in Manchester. It is possibly the best indoor track in the world. I welcome the recent announcement that there will be a new velodrome in east London, which will go ahead whether or not we are lucky enough to secure the Olympics for London in 2012, which I am sure we all hope will happen.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para3">Mark Cavendish, Ed Clancy, Ross Edgar and Victoria Pendleton, four of the team at Los Angeles, are quite young and offer real hope for the future of cycling. It shows that, when we obtain top-class facilities, strong national organisation, funding for training and coaching, together with support for our athletes, Britons can be the best in the world. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts would have been surprised if I had talked only about the success of sport 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 495WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
cycling, much as I am tempted to do so. She will have expected me to say at least something about what more the Government can do, the fact that we can be even more successful in sport cycling and how cycling can achieve wider health and environmental objectives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para4">This year, the national body for sport cycling, British Cycling, has undergone major restructuring, which places the emphasis on two ambitions: to achieve continued excellence&#151;more medals&#151;and to increase participation in cycling generally, not only competitively. Those two ambitions are inextricably linked, and the funding for the British Cycling Federation from UK Sport and Sport England reflects that. I believe that continued success can be delivered on both fronts, given adequate funding and support.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para5">Cycling continues to prove itself to be one of the most successful Olympic sports. It is probably more accessible to the young and the less advantaged than other successful Olympic sports in Britain, such as rowing, sailing, equestrian sports and so on. That is something that leaders in the sport are always uncomfortable about saying, because of the need to maintain good relations with other sports and the sports councils that fund them, but I feel that I can say it. Nevertheless, the truth is that investment in the sport and activity of cycling will contribute far more to all our key Government health agendas than will most other sports.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para6">We are more likely to achieve real, sustainable increases in participation by getting people to ride to school or work, or to the shops, and that should be funded accordingly more than almost any other comparable sport. It is unlikely that healthy activity will arise from people rowing to school, sailing to work or riding a horse to the shops, commendable as rowing, sailing and riding are. That is not to say that GB does not already do quite well in the funding stakes, but there is an argument that we should do even better.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para7">Cycling is also the only sport that contributes to our transport and environment agendas, so real encouragement for cycling to school and work would repay massively in those areas. Despite that, however, the funding made available by the Department for Transport for Cycling England is insignificant in the extreme. The new document published jointly by the Department of Health and the DCMS, &quot;Choosing Activity: a physical action plan&quot;, features cycling to school on the front cover and refers throughout to cycling in various forms as being beneficial to health. But how is the sport expected to make that happen if no funding of any consequence is available?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para8">Cycling as a sport is traditionally seen as a road-based activity, but increases in traffic and the speed of traffic make cycling on the roads ever more difficult. It is also more difficult and expensive than it needs to be, because I am sorry to say that the Home Office continues to drag its feet over the event safety guidance project. Both my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and I have asked questions about that in recent years, but there still appears to be little or no progress.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para9">Although sport cycling has traditionally been seen as a road sport, young people are much more likely to use their bikes off main roads. BMX has a great role to play in getting younger people interested in competitive

cycling, some of whom will get involved in that sport. I am pleased that due recognition has been given to BMX, which will be part of the Beijing Olympics. It is pleasing that BMX has become part of the lottery-funded GB cycling team.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para10">In January Team GB appointed its first full-time national BMX coach, Jeremy Hayes, who has been involved in the sport virtually since the first explosion of interest in the early &#039;80s. He has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The talent&#039;s already there in this country. We just need to get the best riders on board and get them working with proper training programmes.&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para11">He is right. I hope that the higher profile of BMX&#151;particularly if the investment by Team GB in the sport results in medals in Beijing&#151;will encourage the many teenagers and younger people I see riding their bikes around Reading to use facilities such as those in Hills Meadow and get more active in the sport.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para12">In the face of increasing problems in continuing to use the roads for racing, British Cycling has positively, and with a fair degree of success, sought to move more events to closed-road circuits, but, unfortunately, suitable facilities are few and far between. Funding for refurbishment of tracks and small facilities has come on-stream recently and will continue in a modest way, but the real investment needs to be in multi-sport, multi-discipline facilities such as those in Preston. There are also ready-made facilities that we could use as a nation, such as motor-racing circuits and redundant airfields, but they are usually commercially run, often making the cost of hiring prohibitive.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para13">Cycling is consistently the first or second most popular out-of-school activity, along with football, and most young people own bicycles. The recently published &quot;UK Strategy Framework: For Women And Sport&quot; rates cycling as the fourth most popular sport and/or physical activity for women. Despite that, cycling is not a curriculum activity and does not receive the promotion or funding that, for example, swimming receives as a life skill. In fact, the amount of cycling training in schools is declining rather than increasing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para14">A child not properly trained to ride a bike is far more likely to have a related accident on the road than one not trained to swim is to have an accident in water. As the governing body for cycling, British Cycling is funded to provide coaching and skills training for young people, but it is not funded to train them to cycle safely on the roads.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para15">I accept that parents also have a responsibility. It is not enough to give a child a bike, buy them a helmet and let them go off. I spent a long time teaching my children to cycle on the roads, riding with them and talking with them about what was happening. We are not born with road sense. It takes time and experience to be able to be out safely in traffic. Parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children have that knowledge and experience before letting them out on the roads. Getting involved in sports cycling in a safe environment is a good way of learning about riding and getting training in riding on the road.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para16">As well as the work with regard to BMX that I mentioned, British Cycling has been given a target to encourage younger people to get involved, which 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 497WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
everyone must welcome. As part of that, British Cycling has instituted the very good Go-Ride programme. The programme has a website providing information about the various branches of sports cycling, where they happen and the type of clothing typically needed to take part in the sports, so that parents can help their children to get active in an appropriate way.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para17">The programme also provides training with properly trained coaches at clubs around the UK. Clubs receive the clubmark accreditation, which recognises duty of care and child protection, to ensure that club officials are trained and have the resources to deal effectively with child protection issues, and ensures that the club runs safe, structured, regular coaching activities and competition for young people. The scheme also ensures that the club is an open and inclusive environment, so that every club member can achieve their full potential, and that finance, planning, communication and development are properly addressed.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para18">I have had the pleasure of seeing the scheme in action in my constituency, where the Palmer Park Velo club has provided training to young people since 1990. It now has 65 members aged from five to 16, boys and girls, who range from beginners to national standard achievers. The club runs training sessions at the Palmer Park track every Saturday, except for two weeks a year, as well as off-road rides, road rides and club championships.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para19">Further to that work, a new coach has been appointed for the best British junior riders. Darren Tudor has been set the task of achieving the same success with the junior riders as has been achieved with the under-23s and the full squad. He has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We&#039;ll be looking to give the juniors a more structured, year round approach, lots of skill based work, particularly on the track, with junior year two riders looking to performing at world championship level&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para20">I am pleased that there has already been a get-together of some of our best juniors for a week of activities and coaching in half term. The event was a huge success, which underlines the depth of young talent now coming through.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para21">As I think I have shown, cycling as a sport has enjoyed unprecedented success in the past eight years and can claim to be one of the most successful Olympic sports in terms of return on the investment of lottery funding, if not the most successful. Such value for money is borne out by the National Audit Office report, &quot;UK Sport: Supporting elite athletes&quot;. The report shows that of the four sports&#151;athletics, swimming, rowing and cycling&#151;that receive the bulk of the funding, cycling, with the return of one medal for every &#163;2 million, was the most cost-effective. The advantages of using that success as an inspiration to young people, and the not-so-young seeking better health, are easy to see. If we succeed in that, and get more people riding bikes, for whatever purpose, more often, we will make a meaningful contribution in such key areas as health, environment, transport and education.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para22">It is obvious that there would be long-term benefits if the Departments responsible for those areas could link with the DCMS to commit serious funds to the promotion of cycling as a sport, as a means of transport and as a way of life, instead of focusing on roads and railways&#151;and then needing more hospitals.

</p>






<p><a name="50406h04_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Arts  (Estelle Morris) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) on having secured this debate, and thank her for the work that she has done on this issue throughout her time in Parliament. We in the DCMS know of her interest and we are grateful for her support. I thank her for her work in the all-party group and on cycling matters in Parliament, and wish her well in the future.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para23">My hon. Friend tells a good story. The person who would normally respond in a debate such as this, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn), is overseas lobbying for us to have the Olympics, so he cannot be with us. That has given me the opportunity to think about cycling, and there does seem to be a good tale to tell. I understand my hon. Friend&#039;s wish for the Government to provide further financial support, and I appreciate her desire to keep the sport at the top of the agenda. I do not think that there is much difference in our views on the importance of cycling, the recognition of what has been achieved and the need to go further.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para24">Let me start by re-emphasising my hon. Friend&#039;s points about the areas of our lives to which cycling makes a contribution. It is a sport. Not everybody can practise it at elite standards and win medals, but most children&#151;indeed, most people at some point in their lives&#151;enjoy riding bicycles. Even if they are racing down the road or in the park, it is a sport for them. It fulfils that role, and my hon. Friend is right to point out that at a time when the Government, with the whole nation, are worried about keeping children active and making sure that they remain active beyond their school years, reducing obesity levels and improving fitness, cycling has a key role to play.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para25">Almost as important, if not more, is transport. If we could get more people to cycle rather than to drive cars, many of our problems would be solved. I accept the centrality of cycling, old activity though it may be, to much of the modern political, social, economic and health agenda.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para26">I also congratulate the UK cycling team. Even as somebody who does not particularly follow the sport, I remember the team&#039;s success at the last Olympic games. That shot cycling to the top of the television agenda and gave everybody an opportunity to appreciate not only the energy and skill that goes into the sport, but the fine record of the UK&#039;s cycling athletes. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for informing the House of the team&#039;s subsequent successes, and I know that our cyclists will be planning for the next Olympics. It is good to record our congratulations to them and our appreciation not only of what they have done for cycling, but of their contribution to national esteem&#151;sporting success does that.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para27">It is a good story, and cycling as a sport is on the increase. It is moving forward; it is not in decline, nor is it getting less money, and it is not as though fewer people are winning medals, or as though our national or international reputation is diminished&#151;it is going in the right direction. If there is anything to debate for the future, it is how much support to give&#151;how well different Departments should organise themselves to support cycling&#151;and therefore how much further progress we can make.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 499WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para28">Let me explain some of the ways in which the Government support cycling, particularly the elite sport in which people cycle competitively, to win medals. Sport England has given &#163;2.9 million to British cycling for sports talent development, and to support the network responsible for the development of clubs, competitions and schools activity. My understanding is that the bid was for &#163;3 million. To secure &#163;2.9 million out of &#163;3 million is, quite frankly, a record that I have not seen matched in my eight years in government. So someone somewhere recognises the value of cycling. It will certainly be spent well and will help to support the sport as it approaches the next Olympics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para29">I was delighted that the sport has also secured &#163;7.9&nbsp;million of funding from UK Sport, an organisation supporting talented athletes. Also, 11 individual athletes receive &#163;3,000 of financial support as part of the talented athlete scholarship scheme. We can see from the medals that have been won that the money has been well invested. Given the rigour with which UK Sport has reallocated its resources to those sports from which it feels medals can be gained as a result of the investment, the amount that the sport has got is a tribute to its record.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para30">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that unless we maintain the facilities and invest in them now, we will find that we have been resting on our laurels and Olympic and competitive glory will become a thing of the past. She is absolutely right to say that we need to invest in training, in facilities, in our young people and in opportunities for them if we are to make sure that cycling retains its standard. I want to put on record the work being done with facilities. I was pleased to read that &#163;2.9 million has been allocated to the community club development programme, under which 16 sports have been selected to receive public money for developing the community programme. That will support additional clubs.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para31">I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware that a further &#163;40 million has been allocated by Sport England to that programme, and although no further money has been allocated to cycling, that extra money has not been allocated. I cannot read anyone&#039;s mind, but in coming months cycling and the community club development part of the programme may well be able to access some of that further &#163;40 million.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para32">I wondered also about hopes for the future. I agree with my hon. Friend that, to some extent, the trick lies in making sure that we have multidisciplinary sports facilities where a number of sports can take place. Once we get people in there, we can attract them to particular sports because the facilities are there. In future months, the DCMS will work with local authorities to make sure that we know where the sports facilities are, what state they are in, whether they are where people need them and whether they are supporting the sports that we should support. The Government are not ready to make an announcement about that; we have to do the spade-work. I very much hope that an item for the next Parliament will be a sizeable amount of work being done on investing in local authorities&#039; multi-sports facilities.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para33">Our aim is that no one should live too far from one of these multidisciplinary sports facilities, so that they can access it as part of their normal lives. People will want 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 500WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to monitor that and make sure that cycling is represented in those facilities. As far as my hon. Friend&#039;s concerns go, that might be the best avenue for trying to influence people and make sure that cycling continues to be represented.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para34">Like my hon. Friend, I was delighted to hear the Lord Mayor of London&#039;s announcement that, whether or not we get the Olympics for 2012&#151;and let us hope that we do&#151;the velopark will be built in the Lower Lee valley. That will include a 1,500-seat velodrome, an outdoor cycle speedway circuit, a 1.6 km road-racing circuit, an international competition BMX freestyle path and a cross-country mountain bike course. That is exactly the type of facility that I am sure my hon. Friend would like to see in every area so that people can access one wherever they live. I cannot promise that; it is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future, but an early commitment to building that facility in the Lower Lee valley, come what may of the Olympic bid, is a sign of the commitment of many decision makers who are allocating resources for sport across the country.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para35">I want to move on to involving young people in cycling. My hon. Friend mentioned this at different points in her speech. It is also good to know that cycling has been included in the 22 sports that are delivering the Club Links programme as part of the very successful national strategy for PE, School Sport and Club Links.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para36">Young people drop out of sport and physical activity when they leave school, so we must bridge the gap and ensure that they do not fall when they enter different parts of their life. My hon. Friend will know that this initiative ensures that clubs make links with schools so that the transition from sport in school to sport in an amateur club is almost seamless and that young people are caught before they must make a choice between school work and non-school work.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para37">Some &#163;85,000 has been secured for cycling clubs to make links with schools. Again, I hope that my hon. Friend views that as a bold attempt to work with amateur clubs to ensure that they attract as many young people as they can. I am particularly pleased to see that &#163;50,000 has been made available for the young volunteers scheme, which includes cycling for young people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para38">My hon. Friend also talked about training, on which we can probably do some work. It is silly to set up different bodies and not encourage them to work together on a national standard for cycle training. I am told that work is being done to ensure that people from different committees at least sit on other people&#039;s committees so that the knowledge that each can build up is pooled. The strategy group that is working on the national standard for cycle training needs to work carefully with each of the other cycling bodies. I am told that the first step has been taken and that cross-representation has been secured. My hon. Friend also mentioned Cycling England. She acknowledged that this sport does not exactly aim for Olympic medals but aims to improve our lives by making transport more cycle-friendly and encouraging more people to travel by bicycle, as she does, rather than by car.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para39">My hon. Friend also mentioned the &#163;5 million from the Department of Trade and Industry. One could argue that that does not seem like much, but it is a start. I shall rattle through what the other Departments have done. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 501WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
She said that they had not provided any money to join the scheme. That is true, although the Department for Education and Skills has put &#163;20 million a year into the Travelling to School programme. It will not all go into cycling, but if someone is seriously thinking about how children travel to school, cycling must be one of the ways forward.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para40">The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman), has just turned up for the next Adjournment debate. We can thank him for the &#163;1 billion that is going to primary care trusts in the next year three years to implement public health measures. Again, that &#163;1 billion will not be spent solely on cycling, but cycling must claim its place among the public health measures on which that money will be spent. As my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East says, cycling contributes to the health agenda.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para41">The Department for Transport has given &#163;10 million for the Links to Schools programme to provide access to schools for the existing national cycle network. The DFES has given &#163;20 million in grants for facilities that could include cycle policies, including the provision of lockers.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para42">This is the beginning. I do not pretend that those millions of pounds will go only to cycling, but it sends a signal that government, which is sometimes incredibly cumbersome and slow to respond to what needs to be done, is beginning to show across Departments that money is being invested in cycling as well as in other things. That is key.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h04_para43">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we know that we have succeeded when the Department of Health and the DFES automatically include cycling in the planning and development of their policies and consider what it can contribute. I sense from the words that she used and the tone of her speech that she knows that progress has been made. In return, however, I equally accept that more progress must be made. It is a tribute to her work on this issue during her time in Parliament that the debate that she has secured today and her wise words to the House will be picked up by future Members who choose to take an interest in this subject on behalf of their constituents, and by Ministers who know that cycling can make a contribution to each of their agendas. I thank her for giving us an opportunity to debate it today.

<a name="50406h05_head0"><h3 align=center>East Sussex Hospitals Trust</h3>


<a name="50406h05_time0"><h5>4 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50406h05_spnew0"><b> Mr. Nigel Waterson  (Eastbourne)</b>  (Con): It is a great pleasure to have secured what I understand is the last Westminster Hall debate of this Parliament and possibly of this Government. I am delighted to see the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman). I am sure that he is aware of the problems faced by my local hospitals trust, so I will not have to go through them in great detail. I have raised them in questions in the House, as well as in a recent meeting with the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms&nbsp;Winterton).

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para0">In a nutshell, we have faced some difficult problems over recent weeks and months, particularly in my local hospital, Eastbourne District General hospital. More than 140 operations have been cancelled on the day of the operation. Bed blocking is still double the national average and has been significantly higher than that. People have been turned away from the accident and emergency department, and I am continuing my campaign to ensure that the A and E department stays open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para1">Things began to get difficult back in early March. On 3 March, the local trust issued a press release following its board meeting, in which it talked about the extreme pressure that the hospital is under. It said that the trust had been working at a 97 per cent. average bed occupancy rate for the past six weeks, way above the recommended bed occupancy rates. Emergency admissions were up more than 6 per cent. on the same time last year; 158 operations had been cancelled on the day of surgery, and many more a day or two in advance.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para2">That obviously raised some difficult issues, including one of three possible options decided by the board at one stage: the closure of an A and E department during times of severe pressure. That clearly attracted a lot of local interest, and was followed up some days later by a letter from the chief executive, Annette Sergeant, setting out the background. As she put it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;When levels of bed occupancy reach into the upper 90s risks of clinical errors become unacceptably high.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para3">Again, she talked about closing an A and E department to give some respite. She stressed that that was to be a last resort, and, as she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I would only take this decision if it was my view, and that of my clinical colleagues, that not to do so would compromise patient safety.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para4">She referred to the ongoing problem, which seems to have been perennial rather than to have existed only since March, of so-called bed blocking in our local hospitals. That has obviously caused a lot of human problems. A number of constituents have come to me who have had their operations cancelled once or several times. One can only imagine the stress that that produces. People have to get psyched up for an operation, and in some cases they have even gone into hospital at the allotted time and then had to go home again.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para5">There have also been problems with people being turned away from the A and E department. The local paper referred to the case of a Seaford man who had a stroke. The ambulance taking him to the Eastbourne 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 503WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
District General hospital had to be diverted because there were no beds, and he was taken to the Conquest hospital in Hastings. That meant that he had to travel almost 30 miles to hospital after suffering a stroke. Matters had become extremely serious.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para6">As I said, I had a constructive meeting with the Minister of State to discuss the various options. One of the decisions that she had taken at that stage was to put a recovery and support unit into the local NHS to try to find some solutions. It is also interesting that there is a short-term solution: on the day that I visited A and E, I found that some 19 patients had been removed that very morning and placed in nursing and care homes. It seems that, somehow, despite the background of deficits right across the local health economy and the pressures, which I will come on to in more detail, on local social services, funds were found that day to spirit 19 patients out of the hospital. It clearly made a significant difference, in A and E as well as in the medical assessment unit and other wards. We will see in a moment how long term that improvement is likely to be.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para7">Only a few days ago, the issue came up in Health questions. I am sorry to say that the suggestion was made by some Labour and Liberal Democrat Members&#151;even more sadly, it was endorsed by the Minister&#151;that it was somehow the fault of the Tory-run county council. That was unfortunate, because it is not true. Since the present administration took over in East Sussex, its top priority has been helping older people. It has modernised by investing an extra 35 per cent. in services for older people during its four years, despite receiving only 1 per cent. extra in grant from the Government if one excludes the extra funds passported to education.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para8">The county council has tried very hard to persuade the local health bodies to work jointly and also to find alternatives to hospital admission, which in some cases seems inappropriate. In particular&#151;I would be grateful if the Minister were to comment on this specific point&#151;it has been pressing hard for health bodies to be able to invest the fines money paid by the county council in new services as a better alternative to hospital admission. I understand that that is what many other health organisations are doing.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para9">It is particularly unfortunate that the Minister of State forgot herself at Health questions&#151;forgot, perhaps, that she is a Minister of the Crown whose job is to look after health care rather than make cheap political points. Had she thought for a moment, far from putting the blame at the door of East Sussex county council, she would have remembered that, according to the Commission for Social Care Inspection, East Sussex is the most improved social services authority in the country. She, or those advising her, might also have glanced at the recent Audit Commission review, &quot;Elderly Care in East Sussex&quot;, which in broad terms finds that East Sussex social services has been doing its bit for care of the elderly but that health has much more to do. I am told that East Sussex county council has accepted the Audit Commission&#039;s conclusions in full and is encouraging health organisations to do the same.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para10">Despite the pooling of some funds to help with the immediate problem, which may have coincided with my arrival at A and E, the county council is dubious about 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 504WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
whether putting more money into the system will solve the problem. It feels that beds will fill up again as soon as they are empty, and that council tax would spiral as a result, hitting older and more vulnerable people. Not unreasonably, it points to the whole systems review by the Audit Commission, to which I referred. It also points to the fact that in the financial year just ended the county council funded an additional 100 residential and nursing home placements at a cost of &#163;3 million from its own resources. In March, it agreed to a further 40 placements, to be funded jointly with primary care trust partners. However, it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;This does not however address the underlying cause of the problem&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para11">The primary care trust, which has a crucial role in all this, has told me of its position; apart from anything else, it has &quot;severe financial difficulties&quot;. It was looking to end the year with a deficit of &#163;980,000. It is not the only trust in that situation. The last projection I saw for the East Sussex hospitals trust, which includes my hospital, was a forecast for a &#163;4.7 million overspend at the year end.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para12">There is a difficulty. I wager that the Minister will say, &quot;Yes, it is important that all those bodies work together to try to solve the problem.&quot; If, as I believe, the underlying cause of the problem is underfunding, of both health and social care, it is no wonder that those bodies are often at each other&#039;s throats, blaming each other for the present situation. Anyone who knew anything about it&#151;I served on the Committee that dealt with the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Bill&#151;would have known that the system of fines would only exacerbate relationships between organisations that should be working closely together to solve the problem.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para13">I have three main points to put to the Minister. The first is about the deficits. I have already explained that, for some time, all the health organisations in my area have been struggling with substantial deficits. There is a rumour going around that Ministers are themselves telephoning chief executives in some parts of the country demanding that they eliminate their deficits by the year&#039;s end. I have no evidence for that, but I have no evidence to the contrary either. At Health questions I asked the Minister of State whether she could


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;assure me and my constituents that no one is putting any pressure on the trust to reduce the deficit at this very difficult time?&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 22 March 2005; Vol. 432, c. 728.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para14">I believe that it is significant, although I am open to persuasion, that she made no attempt to answer that direct question and merely talked about the importance of local agencies working together.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para15">My first specific question for the Under-Secretary is this: can he answer that question? Is any pressure being put by Ministers, the strategic health authority or anyone else on my local health authority to eliminate deficits, particularly if, at this delicate time, it could be at the expense of patient care? Although I do not complain, I remain somewhat mystified how, all of a sudden, these organisations, all of which seem to have historic deficits, were able to find money for those 40 extra placements.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para16">Secondly, I ask the Minister of State, through the Under-Secretary, to reconsider her attitude to this issue and try to remove the party political stuff, which 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 505WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
intruded at Health questions. I have already made the point that her own inspectorate gave an extra star to East Sussex social services and that the Audit Commission in its report came out in favour of the social services department and said that the health organisations could and should do more. I have already indicated how the Conservative-controlled county council has set as a priority increasing spending on older people&#039;s services. If the Under-Secretary really believes that the problem lies with social services, why on earth did the Minister of State decide to put in the recovery and support unit, which I assume is there to deal with health issues and not social services?

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para17">Thirdly, will the Under-Secretary or other Ministers seriously consider in the medium term the question of underfunding? East Sussex has the highest concentration of people aged over 85 in the country, yet this year it received the smallest increase in grant of any county. There simply is not enough money to go around. The Government seem content to allow the various health bodies and the county council to squabble over the limited resources available. My constituents and I think that it is time for this blame game to stop. It is played out week after week in my local paper. I am heartily sick of it.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para18">I mentioned the funding that was discovered for 40 extra placements only a couple of weeks or so ago. It is perfectly true that there was a short-term improvement after some funding was found recently. I described that at the time as a sticking-plaster solution. I note from the latest figures from the trust that the figures for bed blocking are creeping up again. Bed blocking in Eastbourne is twice the national average. The percentage this week in Eastbourne is 6.1 per cent&#151;30 beds&#151;which is an increase of six from only last week. I fear that we are slowly getting back to the position we were in when this crisis blew up at the beginning of March.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para19">I ask the Under-Secretary to think again about the funding issue. The problem will not go away. He may go away and I may go away, but the problem will remain. Whichever Minister of whatever party is in his place after 5 May they will still have to tackle it. For the moment I am not going to give up and neither will my constituents.

</p>




<a name="50406h05_time1"><h5>4.14 pm</h5>



<p><a name="50406h05_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) on his interest in the NHS and on securing this debate. I am always bemused in these debates when Conservative Members start off by making an overtly political comment about the result of the next general election and bury numerous other political comments in their speeches, yet say constantly that they want to avoid party political fighting and want some form of consensual politics.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para20">If the hon. Gentleman had really wanted that, he could have set an example. He could have emphasised the massive reinvestment in the national health service: overall expenditure in the NHS has roughly doubled since 1997, and it will have trebled by 2008. He could have mentioned the fact that social services departments around the country have been given a real-terms increase of a little under 30 per cent. in their budgets 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 506WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
since 1997. I shall come on to some more specific figures about the massively increased resources that we have made available since 1997. What would be the state of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s local health and social services if we were still working to the spending plans envisaged by the last Conservative Government? He would certainly have had something to complain about.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para21">I agree with the hon. Gentleman in that I believe his local trust is experiencing some significant challenges. However, I would argue that it is trying to respond to them, and I do not think that it is helped when the hon. Gentleman raises the issue of a contingency plan to close the local accident and emergency department. He knows&#151;he has been assured by the local authority&#151;that that was purely an in-extremis contingency plan. If the capacity of the A and E department had reached such a point that people could no longer be treated sensibly, a contingency plan was in place; that A and E department might have been closed temporarily and people diverted to one with more capacity. That has never happened, and the hon. Gentleman knows that it is never likely to happen. He should not try to misrepresent the status of that plan.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para22">I should like to pay tribute to all the staff of the local NHS, who are working very hard to deal with the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I shall come in a moment to some of the ways in which they are thinking of doing that. As the hon. Gentleman rightly emphasised, there are two partners: the NHS and the local council. In his eyes the NHS is, of course, largely to blame for the problems, while the local council struggles gamely to try to deal with them in the face of an uncaring NHS.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para23">Has the hon. Gentleman&#039;s analysis of the situation something to do with the fact that the council is Conservative, whereas through the NHS he can try to pass the blame on to the Labour Government? In preparing for this speech, I received an e-mail from one of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents. I shall not give his name, because I do not have his permission to use it. However, I have checked the information in the e-mail and can vouch for its accuracy. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Commission for Social Care Inspection: Performance Assessment Framework Reports November 2004 on East Sussex County Council&#039;s social services department show that ESCC is not investing enough in the older peoples&#039; services and have been among the lowest providers across the country for some time. The comparative data shows that East Sussex County Council is the 17th worst performer in the country for delayed transfers of care. The Council&#039;s funding of home care is even worse. For intensive home care as a percentage of home and residential care the Council&#039;s performance is the 9th worst in the country. The Council is the 5th worst performer in the country for the percentage of households receiving intensive home care and the llth worst performer in the country for helping older people to live at home. This is out of a total of 150 local authorities providing social services&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para24">what follows is the only bit of the e-mail that I disagree with&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;many of them in areas far more deprived than East Sussex is.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para25">I would argue that almost all are in areas far more deprived than East Sussex. My correspondent goes on:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The figures also show that ESCC performance is rock bottom when the Council is compared with the 13 local authorities who are similar to it. For supported admissions of older people to residential and nursing care, East Sussex County Council is the third lowest performer. For helping older people to live at home,

&nbsp;<br>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>it is the second lowest performer; and for intensive home care as a percentage of home and residential care, the Council is actually the lowest performer of the 13 authorities with which it is compared.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para26">The correspondent goes on to say that that data


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;is also reproduced in the recent Audit Commission presentation on &#039;Whole System Review of Services for Older People in East Sussex&#039;,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para27">to which the hon. Gentleman referred.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para28">So, we have a clear picture of a county council social services department that, whatever its intentions for the future, has not been punching its weight or delivering its side of the equation: to ensure that there is capacity in the local community for people to be discharged from hospital without delay when that is in their interests. If social services is not prioritising that capacity, it is no wonder that the sort of problems that the hon. Gentleman identified arise. We must accept that the performance of social services has been lamentable.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h05_spnew1"><b> Mr. Waterson </b> : The Minister throws around words such as &quot;lamentable&quot;&#151;$10 words that are the flavour of the moment&#151;but why did the social services get an extra star from the inspectorate, and why is he quoting an anonymous member of the public who seems to have done a lot of research, rather than what the Department thinks? Does he agree with the Minister of State that the county council has a deliberate policy to block beds? That is a serious allegation that has yet to be sustained.
</p>






<p><a name="50406h05_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman </b> : I quote those figures because I checked them against the official statistics and found that the correspondent is well informed and that the information is accurate. The county council could have gained an extra star for a multitude of reasons. Social services also provides services for children, and it is entirely possible&#151;I speculate only; I would have to look at the figures&#151;that it got its extra star for improving its care of children rather than that of older people.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para29">The hon. Gentleman assures me that social services will try to do more to increase capacity in the local community for older people, which I applaud if it is the case. I hope that it will work better with the local health services on delayed discharges.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para30">The hon. Gentleman mentions the use of the delayed discharge grant and the way in which several authorities have done deals with local health services to invest that money in capacity in the local area. East Sussex seems to believe that if that money is invested in local capacity, that will put a cap on its exposure to delayed discharges, but it does not; it does not do that anywhere in the country. I have made it absolutely clear that delayed discharge fines should be audited and that if they exceed the agreed amount to be invested in the local community, the council must pay the fines to the NHS, because the NHS is paying the cost of keeping people in acute beds when their care should be in the local community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para31">The hon. Gentleman does not like the delayed discharge legislation, but if his party were to win the general election would it repeal it? The legislation has saved about 1 million bed nights a year since it and the Government&#039;s efforts to reduce delayed discharges were introduced. That is the equivalent of eight or nine large 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 508WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
district general hospitals. It is a massive success. Experts around the world have identified England&#151;other parts of the UK did not introduce the legislation&#151;as the only country in the world on track to remove delayed discharges from our hospitals.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para32">East Sussex is the one area about which I constantly hear it said that the delayed discharge legislation is not working and a fight continues between health and social care. Everywhere else, people have managed to make arrangements that work better as a result of the legislation. East Sussex council seems to have set its face against allowing it to work. I encourage the council and local health partners to get into a room together and work out how to make it better for them. If they can do that by ensuring that the more than &#163;1 million that East Sussex has already been given from the delayed discharges grant this year works better for the benefit of local people, that is all to the good.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para33">In addition to social services, it is important that we move ahead and try to do what we can to improve things in the health service for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents. In the spirit of &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot; such decisions must be taken locally; Ministers no longer take them centrally. I am pleased to say that the Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority is working with the acute trust and relevant health and social care partners to address the issue of cancelled operations that was raised by the hon. Gentleman. I have received assurance from the local NHS that cancellations, when they do occur, are handled sensitively, that people receive personal calls from officials of the trust, and that every possible effort is made to reschedule patients within 28 days. Currently, the trust is able to reschedule about 50 per cent. of cancellations, but it is working to try to increase that to 100 per cent. as soon as possible.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para34">Leaders of the local health and social care organisations met in early March to discuss the operational problems faced by the hospital, and to urgently review local arrangements to manage the discharge of care. Some measures have been designed to help to address those problems and to free up beds. Improved intermediate care is one option that the local health and social care economy is considering. For example, I am pleased to say that Eastbourne Downs primary care trust has worked with social services to develop a 21-bed intermediate care facility funded by the NHS and social services. There are also proposals for the PCT to integrate purchasing of places in the independent sector with that of social services, to ensure effective and efficient use of the independent sector capacity that is available.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para35">Bexhill and Rother primary care trust and Hastings and St. Leonard&#039;s primary care trust are funding the post of intermediate care co-ordinator to become substantive from 1 April 2005. The co-ordinator will have an ongoing specific brief to develop a single point of access to intermediate care services. Sussex Downs and Weald primary care trust is increasing the capacity of discharge co-ordinators based in the community who work with the acute trusts to identify patients who are appropriate for support in the community.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para36">In addition to intermediate care, other proposals include plans to ensure that rapid access diagnostics facilities are available, so that the length of stay is as brief as possible and that hospital-avoidance initiatives 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 509WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
are effective, and plans to use locality-based commissioning to engage GPs in active referral management, with a view to reducing hospitalisation rates.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para37">Furthermore, I am advised that health and social care partners will meet on Friday 8 April to agree and sign off a joint action plan, which was compiled following the Audit Commission review of older people&#039;s services in East Sussex.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para38">Although there are challenges at present&#151;I agreed earlier with the hon. Gentleman that that was the case&#151;I hope that he will accept that progress is being made, but that it must be made by both partners. Health and social care must work together.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para39">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the issue of resources. In the past two years, an extra &#163;100 million has been added to the access and systems capacity grant to local councils to improve the quality and range of local authority community services. In East Sussex, the council received &#163;4.8 million for that grant last year and &#163;6.2 million this year. That money is entirely intended to build up the social care capacity of the local community 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>6 Apr 2005 : Column 510WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
to allow it to deal better with those types of problems. The health service in East Sussex has also benefited from significant additional resources: between 2005&#150;06 and 2007&#150;08, the four PCTs in East Sussex will receive an increase of more than &#163;111 million for health care services.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50406h05_para40">The hon. Gentleman also talked about deficits. All NHS organisations, including those in East Sussex, have received a fair share of resources. However, if that is the case, they have a corresponding responsibility to manage those effectively. It is now the responsibility of strategic health authorities to deliver overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure that each NHS organisation achieves financial balance. Therefore, when the hon. Gentleman raises the issue of deficits he must face the fact that if I waved a magic wand and cleared the debts, that money would have to come from someone else&#039;s health care economy.
