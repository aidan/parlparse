I should say that as it is the hottest day of the year, it is in order
for hon. Members to remove their jackets&#151;particularly those who
have not already done
so.</p><p><a name="06071968000011"><b><a name="06071968000505">Mike
Penning (Hemel Hempstead) (Con):</b> It isa pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship,Mr. Conway. I thank
colleagues for getting up so early to come to our first debate on the
Buncefield incident, and the Minister for taking the time and having
the consideration to meet me yesterday to discuss the Buncefield
inquiry.</p><p><a name="06071968000012">At 1 minute
past 6 on 11 December, an explosion registering 2.7 on the Richter
scale rocked my constituency and neighbouring constituencies across
Hertfordshire and the other home counties and parts of London. Tank 12
had been letting a rather large amount&#151;200 tonnes&#151;of
unleaded fuel escape for a considerable time, and the vapour exploded
in the car park areas of the Northgate and Fuji buildings on Mayland
industrial estate. It was the largest explosion on mainland Europe
since the second world war. Everybody accepts that the subsequent
explosion and fire tested our emergency services to the extreme. We are
all very proud at the absolutely fantastic job that they
did.</p><p><a name="06071968000013">I fully accept
that the incident could not have been predicted. There had been
similar, although not identical, incidents around the world, but as a
former fireman, I am all too aware that no one had trained or prepared
for an explosion of that magnitude or for a subsequent fire and
explosions. I reiterate my admiration for the firefighters who came
from all over the country to help my constituents in that national
disaster.</p><p><a name="06071968000014"><b><a name="06071968000506">Bob
Spink (Castle Point) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend has served his
constituents with great assiduity. I am sure that this will not be the
last time that he brings this matter before the House.</p><p><a name="06071968000015">Does my hon. Friend acknowledge
the great efforts and skill of the Essex fire service, which featured
in the incident? Is he aware that its firemen got their skills because
of the Canvey Island calor gas importation site, the first such site
for liquefied natural gas in the world? It now takes liquefied
petroleum gas from ships in the Thames and there is a proposal to
change it so that it can take a full 5 per cent. of the nation&#146;s
total energy need in LNG across Canvey Island. As everyone here will
understand, that is raising local fears.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 68WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000016">We must learn any possible
lessons from the Buncefield fire. Will my hon. Friend explain later why
the early detection systems at Buncefield failed to warn of the
developing clouds of vapour that had been rolling around for 20 or 30
minutes prior to the explosion? That is a key
point.</p><p><a name="06071968000017"><b><a name="06071968000507">Mike
Penning:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point.I
should declare an interest as a former fireman, and not only in Essex.
I trained on the foam monitor that protects the installation to which
he refers. It was a pleasure to do a lot of training at Canvey Island
and the neighbouring Coryton refineries. Some would say that I had an
inside knowledge of the explosion and depot fire long before I came to
this House.</p><p><a name="06071968000018">My hon.
Friend is absolutely right that without the expertise of the Essex
brigade and others&#151;particularly the Essex brigade, because Essex
has so many refinery installations and LPG facilities&#151;we would
really have struggled. I pay tribute to the Essex fire
service.</p><p><a name="06071968000019">On my hon.
Friend&#146;s second point, I will elaborate on the value of the
safety devices at the depot, which has a knock-on effect for all depots
and installations around the country. I have had the pleasure of taking
some hon. Members around Buncefield to show them what happened. If any
other hon. Member would like to visit, that could be
arranged.</p><p><a name="06071968000020">I was
massively impressed with the national disaster plan that the Government
have brought into force since they came into power. We could not even
have tackled the Buncefield fire had not high-velocity pumps been
purchased and training been done with them. Although we had major
problems with water supply, the one thing that we did not have a
problem with, once the high-velocity and high-powered pumps arrived,
was capacity. However, we did not have the knowledge of what would
happen once the firefighters started to fight the
fire.</p><p><a name="06071968000021">The Buncefield
site is a national facility, part of almost a national grid of fuel for
this nation. It was built in 1968. At the time, it was a stand-alone
installation: there were very few buildings around it, although a
couple of residential properties in my and neighbouring constituencies
were quite close. In 1968, the decision was naturally made that the
risk to properties around the site was minimal as there were so few of
them. However, that is a long time ago now, and over the years there
has been a substantial encroachment of building around the
depot.</p><p><a name="06071968000022">Some blame has
been attributed to the local authority. People have asked why it gave
permission for building around the Buncefield site. However, the
legislation is clear: any local authority has to look at a planning
application put to it. The authority had to ask permission or request
information from the Health and Safety Executive to find out whether
the development around the Buncefield depot was suitable and safe, and
I understand from my local authority that on every occasion that it was
asked, the Health and Safety Executive said that it could not see any
problems. I have looked at the paperwork and understand that that is
correct. I am afraid that it will probably fall to the inquiry to
decide who was responsible and when mistakes were made, but on the
planning side, I wish to emphasise that Dacorum borough council was 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 69WH</b><br>exemplary in its role of making sure that no planning went ahead if any
risk had been indicated by the HSE.
</p><p><a name="06071968000023">Some buildings were
still being constructed literally days before the explosion took place.
Some had been handed over to new owners by the developers the day
before the explosion. I am particularly proud recently to have chaired
a project called 20/20 Vision for the regeneration of my constituency,
particularly the town and shopping centre, and the industrial area.
Long before the Buncefield incident, we recognised that there was a
major need to regenerate the area because in the 1950s the requirements
of an industrial park requires were completely different from those of
the21st century. That project was well on its way before the
Buncefield
explosion.</p><p><a name="06071968000024">I shall
talk about the fire, but the explosion was the devastating thing.
Yesterday morning, I had the honour of taking the Secretary of State
for Communities and Local Government around the Buncefield site. I also
had the pleasure of taking the Deputy Prime Minister, in his previous
capacity, around the site. Everybody who goes is simply shocked at the
sheer devastation created by the explosion and subsequent fire. The
Northgate organisation is wonderful&#151;one of the things it does is
operate the pay roll for the NHS. The Northgate building was absolutely
devastated by the explosion: inside it, an eight-pump fire ensued,
which alone would constitute a major incident.</p><p><a name="06071968000025">What has to be addressed is
what happened in the build-up to the explosion. I am conscious that I
and colleagues must be careful in this debate not to jeopardise any
possible prosecutions. If I move too far that way, perhaps the Minister
would gag me immediately. I have no doubt that his officials will help
him.</p><p><a name="06071968000026">I desperately
want to find out what has happened since the fire was put out by our
brilliant fire service. The Deputy Prime Minister made a statement to
the House the following day, which I praised. When asked specifically
who was in charge of the Buncefield incident, he stated categorically
that he was in charge. I discussed with him on several occasions what
would happen after the fire was put out and how matters would progress,
especially in respect of the environment, planning and the obvious need
for an inquiry. As a new MP, I sometimes got a little lost in those
negotiations, in which the civil servants told us one thing but
probably did another. However, we achieved a broad remit for the
inquiry through the negotiations.</p><p><a name="06071968000027">The Deputy Prime Minister and I
discussed whether we should have an open and public inquiry similar to
the Marchioness inquiry. I pushed for that simply for the sake of
natural justice, not only for my constituents but for the country as a
whole. If we can have an open dialogue about what happened at
Buncefield, there will be more confidence throughout the country not
only that such an incident will not occur again but that nothing has
been brushed under the carpet or in any way left out because it may
cause embarrassment. I am not saying that that is the case, but it is a
natural assumption about anything that is done behind closed
doors.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 70WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000028">After a couple of days of
negotiations with the Deputy Prime Minister, I was informed that he was
not in charge but that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was
responsible for the inquiry. I gather that that is why a Minister from
that Department is with us this
morning.</p><p><a name="06071968000029"><b><a name="06071968000508">Mr.
Tim Boswell (Daventry) (Con):</b> Does my hon. Friend agree
that it is important in such circumstances to differentiate the
immediate crisis response, which may be properly delegated to any
senior Minister, and the follow-up action after the immediate crisis is
past? Is not the most important thing that Ministers can do to make it
clear and announce publicly when responsibility transfers, if that is
necessary, rather than having it wrung out of them in
discussions?</p><p><a name="06071968000030"><b><a name="06071968000509">Mike
Penning:</b> I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. That
is exactly why I asked Mr. Speaker for this Adjournment debate. Sadly,
seven months after the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s initial
statement, many Ministers have come and gone. Many Secretaries of State
have come to the constituency to have their photos taken and to say
nice things about how well we are doing&#151;I will come to the needs
and aspirations of my community in a moment&#151;but no one knew then
or knows now who is in charge of the Buncefield incident.
</p><p><a name="06071968000031">It is clear that the
inquiry falls under the remit ofthe Department for Work and
Pensions. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has become
the Department for Communities and Local Government. No one has come to
the House and said to the country that a certain Minister is in charge,
that he has a budget and that he will ensure that, whatever happens,
all aspects of the Buncefield disaster will be addressed. That worries
me. Further to what my hon. Friend said, I am being bounced from
Minister to Minister as I try to find out who is in charge of which bit
on which day. There was some surprise that this debate comes within the
remit of the DWP. Many people expected a Minister from the Department
for Communities and Local Government, but because the inquiry is
continuing, immediately one talks about Buncefield, the matter comes
under the umbrella of the
DWP.</p><p><a name="06071968000032">I wish to discuss
the health and safety inquiry. I have nothing but admiration for the
expertise and the hard work of the inquiry board headed by Lord Newton.
Its job is difficult and technical. It has been good at providing
briefings that are as simple as possible&#151;without too much
jargon&#151;so that I can understand what is happening and what the
inquiry has covered. It has had real difficulty in getting historical
data, but it has done an absolutely wonderful
job.</p><p><a name="06071968000033">However, I have
said since day one&#151;I said this earlier in my
comments&#151;that the public sense of natural justice requires that
whatever happens in the inquiry must be fair and seen to be fair. There
is great concern that it continues behind closed doors. I regularly
meet with representatives of my local business community, which has
been and continues to be massively affected by the Buncefield incident.
Some 4,000 jobs are still at risk. I still have regular meetings with
companies in which I say, &#147;Give us time, stay with us while the
inquiry is taking place,&#148; and their reply is, &#147;What is
happening with the inquiry?&#148; My residents still come to me
several months on. Only this past 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 71WH</b><br>weekend, I met with residents of the Leatherstock green area of my
constituency who are about to have the roof of their home removed. They
had remedial repairs done but have suddenly discovered that there are
structural problems and that the whole roof will have to be removed.
They thought that they were over all such
problems.</p><p><a name="06071968000034">I went
around my constituency this past weekend to discuss my
constituents&#146; concerns with them before this debate so that I
could highlight them as accurately as possible. People are still
talking about their fears about the future of the depot&#151;sadly,
people are still experiencing nightmares and flashbacks&#151;and why
the inquiry is being held behind closed doors. I have reiterated from
day one that the inquiry should be open and public, along the lines of
the Marchioness inquiry, and not long drawn out. My great fear is that
the process will take years and
years.</p><p><a name="06071968000035">What really
tips me over the edge is not only that the HSE should not be conducting
the inquiry behind closed doors but that it must address the safety
failures to which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob
Spink) referred. They were mentioned in the fourth interim report,
which was released last Thursday. The report is open in saying that
there were catastrophic failures involving safety and back-up
mechanisms, but for many years HSE was responsible for inspecting and
approving the site and changes to it, and the safety devices. If the
HSE inspects something, we expect that it has done so rigorously and
that everything is perfectly
safe.</p><p><a name="06071968000036"><b><a name="06071968000510">Bob
Spink:</b> As I said, there is an LNG site in my constituency.
I have met with all the emergency services and the HSE to go through
all the safety systems and devices on that site to ensure that the
testing procedures for them have been checked and double-checked, and
that new procedures that more accurately reflect the reality of the
situation that occurred at Buncefield are developed in order to test
the devices. The public need to know that the safety procedures will
work.</p><p><a name="06071968000037"><b><a name="06071968000511">Mike
Penning:</b> My hon. Friend raises exactly the issue that I
was coming to. The public must have confidence in the Government agency
that is inspecting the depots and saying that they are safe. There are
many such depots around the country, some of them much larger than
Buncefield. It does not matter whether the inspection and approval of a
facility occurred a week, a year or 10 years before, the public will
always wonder why the HSE inspects itself. The public will see that a
major part of the inquiry&#146;s remit is to find out what went
wrong, but that the HSE was part and parcel of the organisation that
said that the depot was safe. They will ask themselves how the HSE can
inspect the site and carry out an inquiry&#151;possibly into its own
actions&#151;behind closed doors.</p><p><a name="06071968000038">The situation is extraordinary.
We were very lucky that no one died, so the police involvement has
essentially been zero, and the HSE has gone ahead with the inquiry.
That will take a considerable time, and we are lucky to have an
independent chairman, Lord Newton, who has been absolutely brilliant at
informing me about what is going on. None the less, like every other
member of the public, I have no idea what 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 72WH</b><br>evidence has been submitted to the inquiry or what is going on. If there
were to be a criminal prosecution, however, the organisation that was
responsible for the safety of the depot and its workers, as well as
that of the residents around it, surely could not be judge, jury and
defendant.</p><p><a name="06071968000039">That is
the most difficult thing to grasp, and I do not understand how we can
have a situation in the21st century in which the HSE&#151;a
Government agency&#151;investigates the explosion and the subsequent
fire when it was so integral to the depot&#146;s safety before the
fire. I shall continue to call for a full public inquiry by an
independent board to be started as soon as possible. I am not saying
that the HSE should not make its expertise available to the board, and
perhaps even be part of it, but it is imperative that natural justice
is seen to be done when so many of my constituents and others around
the country are so worried about the effects of the fire.</p><p><a name="06071968000040">Let us dwell for a second on
how lucky we were. The vapour initially exploded in the car park. A
breeze&#151;it was a real act of God&#151;had moved the vapour from
beside the tanks, which were in the depot, into the car park, which was
just outside it. If the explosion had taken place in the depot, no one
there would have survived, and the fire and the explosions that
subsequently affected the area would have been even more severe. I
think that the inquiry would probably agree with that view; I know that
the chief fire officer
does</p><p><a name="06071968000041">Some 31,000
people worked in the industrial area, and the explosion damaged their
buildings. Some 2,500 people were evacuated from homes that had been
damaged or were in what the fire brigade decided should be an exclusion
zone, because there was a risk of further explosions. Just to show how
fantastic my community is, I should say that of the 2,500 people who
were taken out of their homes, just over 200 were put up by the local
authority; the rest were looked after by loved ones and friends in the
community of Hemel Hempstead. That clearly shows how well members of
the community pulled together.</p><p><a name="06071968000042">The council did a fantastic
job. Many of its staff were way out of their remit and had little
experience of such incidents. Let me publicly express my admiration for
all the council&#146;s workers, and particularly its senior
management, who were absolutely brilliant and whose control room was up
and operating very quickly. Organisations such as the women&#146;s
institute and the Red Cross were simply fantastic&#151;we could
probably have put the fire out with the amount of tea that they
supplied. Typically, when this country comes under attack, we pull
together, and this was an attack on our
community.</p><p><a name="06071968000043">I want to
give colleagues time to speak, so I come now to my last point, which
relates to my great concern about the environment in and around my
constituency. I am concerned not only about the Buncefield explosion,
but about the chemicals that have been found in the environment, which
the report clearly indicates have nothing to do with Buncefield. I
refer, in particular, to perfluorooctane sulphonate, for which the
short name is PFOS. PFOS is a particularly nasty carcinogen used in
firefighting foams whose dangers have been known for many years. Before
Buncefield, the Government were in what I might best describe as 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 73WH</b><br>deep negotiations with the European Union about banning PFOS. They had
drafted a statutory instrument to do so, which provided for a two-year
sentence for those who brought PFOS into the country.
</p><p><a name="06071968000044">Two sorts of foams
were used at Buncefield: synthetic foams and protein foams. I shall
talk only briefly about synthetic PFOS foams, because my colleagues
want to talk about them. However, I continually go on about protein
foams, although nobody seems to be listening. Protein foams are often
blood based and they have been used for many years. Indeed, I trained
with them extensively when I was in the fire service. Protein foam is
smelly, horrible stuff because it is based on blood. Blood tends to
bubble up rather well, so people who are trying to smother a fire use
blood. That might sound silly, but it was the traditional way of doing
things. Protein foams were developed extensively during the war because
petrochemical ingredients were in short supply.</p><p><a name="06071968000045">I have deep concerns about
protein foams. I know that they were used at the incident, because I
saw them there in bulk supply, but it looked as if they had been in
storage for a considerable time. As I have said before, I am concerned
that some of that foam, which firefighters would never dream of using
on anything else and which might have come out of storage, was disposed
of at the incident. I have therefore asked the Minister to address a
particular issue, although I fully appreciate that the environment is
not in his brief and that he might have to write to me. I have asked
for undertakings that none of the protein foams that were used were
based on full-blood products and that where blood products have leaked
into the environment&#151;we already knew of the dangers of blood
products in the 20th century&#151;none of the firemen, or anybody
else locally, has had their life
endangered.</p><p><a name="06071968000046">I turn now
to the issue of synthetic foams, of which PFOS is a major ingredient.
Before the Buncefield incident, the Government were trying to ban PFOS,
and no level was acceptable in drinking water. Recently, however, the
drinking water inspectorate has said that it would be happy to have
three parts per million in drinking water. Will the Minister explain
the logic of saying that we should have no PFOS one minute, but then
suddenly saying that we should have three parts per million? I
emphasise that there is no PFOS in the drinking water in Hertfordshire,
that the bore holes close to the incident have been closed and that
extensive monitoring has taken place.</p><p><a name="06071968000047">However, that monitoring has
shown up another anomaly, which my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) will describe. The water table in
areas with no link at all to the Buncefield incident have been showing
extensive signs of PFOS. Where does the Minister think that those
contaminants have come from? Will he make sure that testing takes place
well away from areas where there is a natural assumption that any
contaminants will have come only from firefighting foam? PFOS has been
used in pesticides and insecticides in the past, and it might still be
used in them. That is a major issue in the rural community outside my
new town.</p><p><a name="06071968000048"><b><a name="06071968000512">Mr.
Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con):</b> Does my
hon. Friend agree that Hertfordshire has a 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 74WH</b><br>very delicate environment because our water comes from chalk aquifers?
When a motorway service station or something like that is built, a lot
of work goes into ensuring that the run-off is secured. Does he feel
that a Minister who deals with environmental matters should make a
clear statement about safety, pollutants and so on in the light of the
Buncefield incident? That would allow us at least to know what the
damage was and what the risks and worries
are.</p><p><a name="06071968000049"><b><a name="06071968000513">Mike
Penning:</b> I could not agree more with my hon. Friend.
People are concerned not only about Buncefield and the explosion, but,
quite naturally, about the fact that if PFOS and other
contaminants&#151;not least the oil-based products&#151;were
getting into the aquifers, that needs to be addressed long before
Buncefield is given permission to reopen, although I reiterate that I
hope it never does. During the incident I was told that the nation
could not live without Buncefield, which is a major part of our fuel
infrastructure, but I understand now that capacity is up to 95 per
cent. without Buncefield. Is that correct? If so, does the Minister
agree with my logic, which is that if we reconnect the feeder lines
there is no national strategic need for Buncefield and that it should
not reopen? That would alleviate the next problem that I want the
Minister to deal with, which concerns
planning.</p><p><a name="06071968000050">Naturally,
the community wants to get on with its life. The business community
wants to get businesses back on to a level playing field. It wants to
find out whether properties can be rebuilt or whether they will be too
close to a new exclusion zone, if Buncefield is rebuilt; it wants to
know whether, if Buncefield is not rebuilt, the contamination of the
land will put employees at risk. There are so many questions that I
should have hoped that seven months after the incident my constituents
and the country would have received the answers.</p><p><a name="06071968000051">It is deeply damaging to the
Government and to public confidence that the inquiry continues to be
operated in secrecy, behind closed doors, and that the evidence to the
inquiry is not fully known by the public. I accept that some evidence
may need to be held back because of the possibility of prosecutions.
However, on behalf of my constituents I cannot understand the
Government&#146;s reluctance to come clean, open up and let the
public see natural justice take place, especially in the light of the
obvious involvement&#151;interference, if you want to put it that
way&#151;of the HSE in the safety of the depot before the incident,
and in the catastrophic failures that occurred. My final plea to the
Minister that he go to his bosses and persuade them to give us the
public inquiry that we deserve, so that we can get on with our lives in
Hertfordshire.</p><p><a name="06071968000052"><b><a name="06071968000514">Derek

<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 75WH</b><br>woken in my home a few miles from Buncefield. It is certainly an
experience that I shall not forget, nor will I forget the experience of
driving past Buncefield on the A41 and seeing the plumes of smoke, or
visiting the site with my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead
(Mike Penning). He mentioned the subject on which I should like to
focus&#151;perfluorooctane sulphonate, or PFOS, traces of which have
been found around Buncefield, raising several concerns.</p><p><a name="06071968000054">It may be
useful briefly to consider the issue and give the history of PFOS. The
chemical was widely used, mainly as a fabric protector&#151;most
famously as Scotchgard. However, it had several other uses, such as in
pesticides, insecticides and, of course, firefighting foam. In May
2000, 3M, the manufacturer of Scotchgard, announced that it was phasing
out the use of PFOS from 2001. Following that, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development produced a hazard assessment in
which the US and the UK took the lead. Several conclusions about health
were reached. One was that PFOS was persistent, bioaccumulative and
toxic in mammals. It was detected in blood serum of occupational and
general populations. There was a statistically significant association
between exposure to PFOS and bladder cancer, and an increased risk of
tumours of the male reproductive system, the overall category of
cancers and benign growths, and tumours of the gastro-intestinal tract.
There is quite extensive evidence suggesting that PFOS is persistent,
with a human half-life of four to eight years. As for toxicity, tests
on monkeys and rats&#151;but not, you will be pleased to know, Mr.
Conway, on cats&#151;show that it can kill at 4.5 micrograms per
litre on a repeat dosage over a 90-day period. The OECD hazard
assessment further concluded, with respect to the environment, that
PFOS is persistent and bioaccumulative, that it is highly toxic in
honey bees and that it bioconcentrates in fish. It has been detected in
the tissues of wild birds and fish, in surface water and in sediment,
in waste water treatment plant effluent, in sewage sludge and in
landfill.</p><p><a name="06071968000055">After that
assessment, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
commissioned a review of environmental risk. Despite the fact
thatthat use of PFOS has, overall, been substantially reduced
since 2001, certain concerns remain. The environmental risk reduction
strategy concluded that marketing and use restrictions on PFOS-related
substances</p><a name="06071968000447"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will provide
the only effective level of control&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000056">In October
2004 the Government proposed an immediate prohibition on the storage or
use of PFOS and PFOS-related substances at or above 0.1 per cent. of
mass. It is important to recognise, however, that within the
consultation document produced by DEFRA a five-year derogation was
proposed for the development of acceptable substitutes and alternate
technologies for firefighting foams. However, implementation of the
proposals for that quite extensive ban on PFOS usage was prevented. In
an answer to my hon. Friends the Members for Hemel Hempstead and for
Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela
E. Smith), said that</p><a name="06071968000448"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;before consultations had been
completed, the European Commission suspended our unilateral action and
subsequently issued its own draft Directive to restrict the marketing
and use of 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 76WH</b><br>PFOS. In this draft, all current PFOS uses, including firefighting foam,
would be allowed to continue. This would not therefore allow the UK to
set regulations to ban its use.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>,
14 June 2006; Vol. 447, c.
1238W.]</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000057">On first reading, that
rather rankled with me, given my Eurosceptic instincts. I do not see
why that is a matter for the European Commission and why the UK should
not be in a position to make a judgment on the dangers of PFOS and to
legislate accordingly.</p><p><a name="06071968000058">I have several questions for
the Minister. To be fair to him, I acknowledge that I did not have an
opportunity to tell him my questions in advance, and I am conscious
that PFOS is a subject not necessarily closely related either to work
or to pensions. Any answers that the Minister can give now would be
gratefully received, but perhaps he can write to me later.</p><p><a name="06071968000059">I should be grateful to know
the Government&#146;s attitude and what steps they are taking to
lobby the European Commission and the EU. Do they fully accept that the
matter is something for EU jurisdiction? Having made that point I want
to qualify it in two ways. First, on first reading the parliamentary
answer that I quoted, one could get the impression that but for the
European Union we would have banned PFOS and it would no longer be
relevant. However, the two questions that I referred to related to the
fire service, and, to be strictly accurate, even if the UK had
proceeded down the route that it wanted, it would still have been
possible to use PFOS for firefighting foam, because of the five-year
derogation. The derogation does not relate to the EU position, under
which use will continue. Secondly, there appears to be no reason why a
voluntary plan could not be adopted here; indeed, the answer mentioned
that. Given that we are talking about public authorities, I cannot
imagine that there is anything within the EU draft directive that would
stop the UK Government issuing guidance on that point. Reference is
made to a voluntary phasing-out and I should be grateful to know where
we are in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="06071968000060">PFOS has been detected in the
rivers near Buncefield and ongoing testing shows sporadic detection of
PFOS. The levels are higher than 3 micrograms per litre, the advisory
level set by the drinking water inspectorate in environmental
monitoring samples, although it has not been detected in drinking
water, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said. However,
the samples show quite high levels: 4.8 and 5.9 micrograms of PFOS per
litre have been reported, which is higher than the concentration that
killed the monkeys and rats.</p><p><a name="06071968000061">The initial report on
Buncefield makes the point that there is apparently a widespread
occurrence of trace quantities of PFOS in the Hemel Hempstead area,
some apparently unconnected with Buncefield, which raises the question
why PFOS was not routinely monitored prior to Buncefield. It clearly is
a concern, for the reasons I have outlined. The Environment Agency has
been taking samples at 150 sites in the area in the period April to
July. We have not yet reached the end of July, but the view is that if
PFOS is found to be widespread it is intended to expand the sampling. I
should be grateful to know if there is any information on whether
sampling has found PFOS to be widespread so that we know where we
are.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 77WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000062"><b><a name="06071968000516">Mike
Penning:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is imperative
that we look not only around Hemel Hempstead and in Hertfordshire, but
across the country? Clearly, if the chemical is in the environment in
areas that have nothing to do with oil depots and fire stations, we
need to know so that we can address the problem
immediately.</p><p><a name="06071968000063"><b><a name="06071968000517">Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Rather by
accident, we have discovered that PFOS seems to be widespread. The
early indications suggest that its presence is not just related to
Buncefield; it could be anywhere. I hope that the sampling process will
be thorough and widespread and that we do not assume that the presence
of PFOS is related only to firefighting. There is a concern about how
widespread it may be and I shall be grateful for an update on any
progress in that
respect.</p><p><a name="06071968000064">Anxieties
about PFOS have been heightened by the fact that 800,000 litres of
stored firewater from Blackbird Lees sewage treatment near Radlett was
accidentally released into the water supply. I understand that it was
treated and there has been no evidence of PFOS as a consequence, but it
is a major concern.</p><p><a name="06071968000065"><b><a name="06071968000518">Mr.
James Clappison (Hertsmere) (Con):</b> My hon. Friend will be
aware of the concern felt in Radlett, whose residents will wish to hear
from the Minister on that point. My hon. Friend may also wish to join
me in paying tribute to the work of the Radlett fire crew who attended
the Hemel Hempstead
fire.</p><p><a name="06071968000066"><b><a name="06071968000519">Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for two reasons:
first, for further highlighting the concern about the leakage and,
secondly, in paying tribute to Radlett fire station, which I am
certainly keen to do. I also pay tribute to the fire station of
Bovingdon in my constituency. My hon. Friend and I are both worried
about the fact that Bovingdon and Radlett are set to close, or, indeed,
have closed, but I will not go into that now.</p><p><a name="06071968000067">I am especially concerned about
the water sewerage because the fire water is stored in my constituency
at Maple Lodge sewage treatment works. I wrote to Thames Water
expressing my anxieties about the leakage and received a reply dated 12
July. It is reassuring; it
says:</p><a name="06071968000449"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Following
detailed analysis, we are satisfied that the release of the treated
water poses no risk to public health, drinking water, or the local
environment.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000068">On the
Maple Lodge site, it
says:</p><a name="06071968000450"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
water used to extinguish the fire itself continues to be stored safely
at Maple Lodge sewage treatment works. The design of the tanks here is
such that an incident similar to that at Blackbird Lees sewage
treatment works could not
occur.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000069">I am reassured by
that to some extent, but I am also rather concerned that, seven months
on, the water continues to be held within Hertfordshire. It is a
responsibility of the oil companies to dispose of it and they have been
somewhat tardy in doing so. If the Minister can shed any light on
progress and tell me when we can get the contaminated water out of my
constituency I shall be very
grateful.</p><p><a name="06071968000070">In
conclusion, there are concerns about PFOS levels, which seem to be
widespread and are not narrowly 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 78WH</b><br>connected with Buncefield. I hope that the Government recognise the
seriousness of the matter and will address it as quickly as
possible.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000484">10.15

Main (St. Albans) (Con):</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for
Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) remarked, the incident at Buncefield is
not only a Hemel Hempstead problem. From St. Albans we watched the pall
on the horizon; we were lucky that the wind was favourable and it did
not come over to us, but it could so nearly have done. Since then,
residents have had major concerns about the environmental impact,
because we are downstream from Hemel Hempstead. We have two major
rivers, the River Ver and the River Colne, which help to define a
beautiful part of my constituency, but which also makes us very
vulnerable to pollution incidents.</p><p><a name="06071968000072">As late as July 6, my local
newspaper was still running stories about confusion about water
pollution. I am glad that we are using the term PFOS, because the long
name&#151;perfluorooctane sulphonate&#151;does not trip nicely off
the tongue. It is a diary of disaster to local residents. I shall not
repeat the details of the toxicity concerns about PFOS, except to say
that my constituents have little faith in the system that seems to be
throwing up such completely differing views on the safety of PFOS in
the water supply, how long it will be there, who is responsible for
eradicating it and how the effect on the health of the local
environment is to be monitored.</p><p><a name="06071968000073">On December 11 at 6 am, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead said, 30 million gallons of
fuel went up in flames. On December 20 the Health and Safety Commission
and the Environment Agency started an investigation into the events. In
January, a large pool of liquid measuring 200 m by 10 m by 20 m was
allowed to run off the site; it was standing in Cherry Tree lane for
the first week of January.</p><p><a name="06071968000074">In January, Lord Newton was
appointed as the independent chairman of the investigation. Since then,
there have been various progress reports. In April, a progress report
was published which mentioned PFOS and zinc for the first time. The
chemicals have seeped into the ground and are now detected in the
water. On April 18, the Environment Agency revealed that diesel oil had
been found in ground water. The water is taken from bore holes which
goes into the water-holding layer of chalk, some 40 metres below ground
level. Three Valleys Water said that it will continue to monitor the
situation and the Environment Agency said that it could take years to
assess the full impact.</p><p><a name="06071968000075">On May 9, the third progress
report was published, stating that PFOS had now been detected in local
rivers&#151;the River Ver, the River Colne and the River Red. Fuel
and fire water had soaked into the water table and been detected in
bore holes. The Environment Agency said that the chemical was at a very
low level and generally below what the drinking water inspectorate
considers acceptable.</p><p><a name="06071968000076"><b><a name="06071968000521">Mike
Penning:</b> I emphasise, because it is very important, that
before Buncefield there was no tolerance for PFOS in drinking water,
but suddenly 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 79WH</b><br>3 parts per million is acceptable. Our constituents are very concerned
about that. Can hon. Friend see any logic or link in
that?</p><p><a name="06071968000077"><b><a name="06071968000522">Anne
Main:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for pointing that out. I
shall give a little history lesson. We are all old enough to remember
the Camelford incident in 1988. That was a different environmental
disaster affecting water sources. Acidic aluminium sulphate got into
the water sources and caused a level of toxicity that worried local
residents. However, according to the newspapers of the day, South West
Water Authority blithely assured people that it was safe to drink. It
took weeks and 400 people complaining of ill-health effects such as
mouth ulcers and so on before the problem started to be taken
seriously. The view of the water industry and, to some extent, the
medical establishment, remained that aluminium in drinking water was
not toxic, and the 1991 Clayton Committee report failed to alter their
views, yet, even now, people complain about long-term health problems
such as dementia that might have arisen out of that unfortunate
incident at Camelford. One can therefore forgive my constituents for
not feeling terribly reassured that there is suddenly a new, safe level
for PFOS.</p><p><a name="06071968000078">I do not
think that we will see the effects of the Buncefield incident for a
long time. We cannot be sure what levels are acceptable for pregnant
women, for example. I have here Dr. Brooke&#146;s February 2004
report, which is hundreds of pages long, on the environmental risk
evaluation of PFOS in the environment. The report points out some
worrying issues. For example, the half-life of PFOS is estimated by
some to be four to eight years, but the report estimates it to be 30
years. It says that concentrations in fruit and vegetables are hard to
measure, but contribute to the toxicity build-up. PFOS has even been
found in cows&#146; milk. We have to measure the levels not only in
drinking water, but in all the animals&#151;prey birds, for
example&#151;that inhabit our sensitive environment. People in St.
Albans and the surrounding areas take their environment extremely
carefully. We are blessed with the Ver Valley Watercress Society, which
prides itself on having brought back that ecological miracle by really
clearing up the environment. It is an indicator, or barometer, of how
clean the environment is.</p><p><a name="06071968000079">We must be careful about the
creeping, accumulative toxicity which may cause dangerous levels
further down the line. My constituents have had no reassurances: the
drinking water sources might be safe, but all the other environmental
sources of PFOS may not be safe and are not really being examined in
the depth that they would like. We cannot blithely assume that
everybody&#146;s water comes from a tap. Mr. Hall of Hanrox Turkeys,
who I went to see the day after the disaster, is particularly concerned
because all his water comes from a bore hole. He has been assured that
it is all fine, but is it? Is it okay for him to feed the animals on
his farm&#151;he has other animals as well as turkeys&#151;from
that water source?</p><p><a name="06071968000080">The impact on the environment,
which will have a huge cost implication, has not been considered. Who
is to pick up the bill? My local council seems to think that the
problems will have implications for councils for years to come. I would
like some answers from the 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 80WH</b><br>Minister. What support will we receive, transparently, to ensure that
the source of the harm is acknowledged and that people are aware of it,
and who is responsible for monitoring the damage and clearing it
up?</p><p><a name="06071968000081">I would also like
some assurances from the Minister about how the long-term adverse
effects on the aquatic environment are to be cleared up in our
sensitive area. We are in a fog of confusion. A report on June 16 said
that no traces of PFOS had been found in drinking or ground water, and
that consumers can therefore be reassured that</p><a name="06071968000451"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;there is no evidence that their
tap water has been
contaminated.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000082">But that
is only half the story, and I would like the other half to be brought
out fully. The Environment Agency says that hundreds of thousands of
litres of firewater escaped from where it was stored at
Radlett&#151;we have heard about that&#151;into the River Colne. I,
too, praise the Radlett firefighters, but add my concerns to those of
others that if there is another Buncefield fire disaster, the Radlett
fire service might not be there, because it is under threat. I hope
that that the service
remains.</p><p><a name="06071968000083">We have
contradictory statements from the drinking water inspectorate and the
EA. The EA recently
said:</p><a name="06071968000452"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Notwithstanding
the recent press release...we continue to
detect...PFOS&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000084">One
press release says that nothing is there, and another says that there
is PFOS. We do not know where we are. I ask the Minister for clarity
and honesty. I do not want another Camelford incident. I do not want
somebody to say, 20 years down the line, &#147;This was a
problem.&#148; I want the problem to be looked at now, and I do not
want the bill to be picked up either by Hertfordshire as a whole or my
constituents, particularly not the environmental or health
bill.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000485">10.24

Stephen Crabb (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con):</b> I shall
shorten my speech to allow the Minister the maximum time to respond to
the extremely important questions and issues brought up by hon.
Members.</p><p><a name="06071968000086">I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike
Penning) on securing this important debate. I visited the Buncefield
site with him earlier this year and was shocked by the scale of the
incident, the severity of the impact on surrounding properties and
buildings, and the sheer size of the footprint of the damage created by
the blast. Clearly the explosion at Buncefield, which exceeded any
previous worst-case scenarios for emergency planning purposes, has
heightened concern among Members such as myself who have major fuel
storage and processing facilities in their
constituencies.</p><p><a name="06071968000087">I echo
my hon. Friend&#146;s call for an open and independent inquiry into
the Buncefield incident. The results of the inquiry cannot be that we
should carry on business as usual. It must lead to some real
improvements in the way in which risks are assessed and managed at fuel
storage sites.</p><p><a name="06071968000088">In my
constituency, we have the UK&#146;s largest fuel storage terminal
facility. It is three or four times the size of Buncefield and has
capacity for more than9 million barrels of product. It has
more than 80 tanks storing a range of products including gasoline, 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 81WH</b><br>kerosene, jet fuel and crude oil. In close proximity to that storage
facility, we have two of the UK&#146;s nine major oil refineries,
which are also located on the Milford Haven waterway, and two of the
world&#146;s largest liquefied natural gas import and storage
facilities are being built alongside them.</p><p><a name="06071968000089">The major concentration of
hydrocarbon storage and processing facilities in my constituency is
heightening concern in my community about the risks that the local
population is living alongside, particularly in the village of
Waterston, where the storage facility is located. To say that the
facility is close to the village is inaccurate: it is right in the
middle of the village. Indeed, many villagers live just a few feet from
the main entrance to the SemLogistics site. In the past year or two,
they have lived with the disruption caused by the construction
activities around the liquefied natural gas plant. They also live with
the eyesore of the stacks and buildings from the old oil refinery, but
their biggest concern at the moment centres on understanding the risks.
They seek reassurance about the risks that they live
alongside.</p><p><a name="06071968000090">At the
start of this year, the fuel storage facility was sold by Petroplus to
SemGroup, a US company which trades in the UK under the name
SemLogistics. I have been extremely encouraged by the several meetings
that I have had with the US and the UK components of the management
team, who seem to be taking seriously their responsibilities to ensure
that an incident such as that at Buncefield never happens in
Pembrokeshire. At our first meeting, we agreed that the site needs more
than a lick of paint and a change of badge. Serious investment is
needed to upgrade the facility and provide reassurance for the
community nearby.</p><p><a name="06071968000091">Two
weeks ago, I visited the site and saw the new secondary containment
features being installed in the tanks, and a new Bentomat geosynthetic
clay liner being put in to prevent the leakage of product into the
ground water. I looked at some of the high-level safety systems, which
actually exceed current UK statutory requirements, that are being
installed on the tanks. The company takes its responsibilities
seriously.</p><p><a name="06071968000092">I was
encouraged by the initial findings of the Health and Safety
Executive&#146;s safety alert review last month, which did not
identify the Waterston site as one of the five in which there are
problems and issues with bunding, risk assessment or the maintenance of
firefighting systems on site.</p><p><a name="06071968000093">Those are reasons to be
encouraged, but there are other reasons for dismay and huge concerns in
my community. Our local fire brigade has a proud history, having
tackled some major incidents at the oil refineries in Pembrokeshire in
the past 40 years, but we are set to lose our only remaining 24-hour
fire station, which will be downgraded to a day crew only. That is
causing huge concern in my community. I repeat the calls that I have
made many times for the Mid and West Wales fire authority to hold back
from implementing that decision, at least until the full findings of
the Buncefield inquiry are made public, so that we can better
understand risks and how we respond to major incidents. As I said
earlier, what has happened at Buncefield has reset the gauge for
emergency responses to major incidents.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 82WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000094">We need facilities such as the
ones in my constituency. I do not know enough about the matter to say
whether Buncefield will ever reopen, but we need storage facilities in
the UK for strategic reasons. At a time of energy price volatility, it
makes good commercial sense for some of the downstream companies to
have such storage facilities, but the risks need to be managed properly
and understood. I hope that the Buncefield inquiry will result in some
clear, concrete recommendations for improving the safety of these
facilities and will provide reassurance for the communities that live
immediately next to
them.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000486">10.30

David Laws (Yeovil) (LD):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member
for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) on raising this issue. It is clearly
of enormous importance to his constituency and has great significance
for other parts of the United Kingdom that have similar oil and fuel
storage facilities. I hope that we will be able to return to the
subject in other debates. I add the congratulations and thanks of my
party to those given by his party to the members of the emergency
services who dealt with what was clearly a major and serious
incident.</p><p><a name="06071968000096">I know that
the hon. Gentleman is keen to leave as much time as possible for the
Minister to respond to the debate, so I shall keep my comments as brief
as possible. Conservative Members have commented on a number of the
environmental concerns that remain in the area around Buncefield. Those
points have been made clearly, and therefore I do not need to add to
them.</p><p><a name="06071968000097">I hope that the
Minister will be able to address three particular issues. The first is
a point that has, understandably, not been made so far: when the fire
and explosion initially occurred, there were fears, given the general
background, that the incident might have been caused by a terrorist
attack of some kind. As I am sure that the hon. Member for Hemel
Hempstead is aware, there is a danger of fighting the previous fire and
learning the lessons of an incident that may not be the one that we
face in the future. As the investigation proceeds, will the Minister
ensure that any lessons arising from Buncefield about the safety of
these types of facility will be taken on board in relation to the
security aspects of such sites? The sites are key in national security
terms, and we want to ensure that their vulnerability is closely
examined in respect not only of this type of incident, which
fortunately was not a terrorist one, but of any terrorist incidents
that might occur.</p><p><a name="06071968000098">Secondly, we know that, in this
set of circumstances, the key issues were why the fuel was allowed to
run into and over the top of the tank, why the safety checks failed and
why the safety equipment appeared not to be working. We know that the
Health and Safety Executive issued a safety alert in early July to
operators of fuel storage facilities. That related specifically to one
of the safety devices that are supposed to be attached to all of the
tanks to prevent such incidents from occurring. We know, because it is
set out in paragraph 23 of the report, that there was further
investigation into the design and operation of this particular
high-level switch, and the way in which the switches are put back in a
position that ensures that they are operating after testing.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 83WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000099">Paragraph 23 states:</p><a name="06071968000453"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;While the relevance of
this feature to the Buncefield incident has still to be determined, one
of the issues that has arisen from these enquiries relates to the
reliance on this type of
switch&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000100">I would be
grateful if the Minister would say a little about why the issue has
arisen in relation to Buncefield. Is there any evidence that the
switches of this type at Buncefield were not operating? Are these
particular switches tested regularly by the HSE as part of its regular
inspections of these sites? Will that be done in future? It would also
be useful if he would say whether the testing of these devices has
taken place at other facilities throughout the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06071968000101">My third and
final point is that it is clear from the ministerial statement that was
made the other day and from other things that the size of both the fire
and the incident was not expected. We still do not know why the
explosion was as large as it was. It is also clear from paragraph 83 of
the report that the HSE&#146;s advice about the type of incident that
could occur in a worse-case scenario turned out not to be accurate. It
states:</p><a name="06071968000454"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A
vapour cloud explosion was initially considered, but arising from
tanker loading operations and not tank storage. A pool fire was
assessed as presenting the greater off-site hazard. The Buncefield
incident brings into question the assessment policy for many oil/fuel
depot sites, and the zone setting method which it
informs.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000102">That is clearly
an extremely important point for other sites in the
country.</p><p><a name="06071968000103"><b><a name="06071968000525">Mike
Penning:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important issue.
Other such incidents have taken place in parts of the world, so it is
important to find out why the HSE did not use the experience of the
incidents that took place in New Jersey and Florida, where similar, but
not identical, situations involving a vapour cloud caused by petroleum
occurred. Perhaps that experience could have been used to prevent the
Buncefield incident from ever occurring.</p><p><a name="06071968000104"><b><a name="06071968000526">Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes his point very effectively.
I do not claim to have expertise in those other incidents, but this is
clearly a serious matter. The recommendations in paragraph 71 represent
some of the major issues that we will need to examine if we conclude
that there are risks of further explosions on this scale. I again
congratulate him. The issues are clearly important for his constituency
and county, but there are also important issues for all of these
facilities in the UK.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000487">10.36
am</h5><p><a name="06071968000105"><b><a name="06071968000527">Mr.
Tim Boswell (Daventry) (Con):</b> I, too, congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) on bringing a
unique blend of professional expertise and determination to represent
his constituents on this serious matter. I also congratulate all others
who have made a contribution and, in hopeful anticipation, I
congratulate the Minister on his
response.</p><p><a name="06071968000106">To this
particular situation, I bring an interest that goes all the way back to
my school days and my time in the combined cadet force, when I was
involved in civil defence matters. Since that time, I have gained a
limited amount of experience in fire training and in resilience issues.
In conducting my own farm business, I acquired 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 84WH</b><br>quite a knowledge of pesticides and diffuse pollution. Incidentally, I
also held a petroleum storage licence for a number of years. My final
point on credentials is that my daughter used to conduct prosecutions
on behalf of the Drinking Water
Inspectorate.</p><p><a name="06071968000107">I shall
begin with the positive side of this matter so far. I am happy to
endorse the praise that has been properly lavished on the emergency
services for the tremendous job that they did on the occasion.
Secondly, I extend my thanks to Lord Newton, who, as it happens, became
my first boss 40 years ago this week.</p><p><a name="06071968000108"><b><a name="06071968000528">Mike
Penning:</b> On my hon. Friend&#146;s first point, the fire
services of this country do a fantastic job, but sadly firemen get
injured and some die. Two brave firefighters recently died in incidents
in Hertfordshire. The fire brigade&#146;s benevolent fund raises a
lot of money for former colleagues. I hope that you, Mr. Conway, do not
mind my highlighting the fact that the booklet, &#147;The Buncefield
Explosion&#148;, which will raise money for the firefighters&#146;
benevolent fund in Hertfordshire, is probably the best visual guide to
any incident that this country has ever seen. Will my hon. Friend
praise the work of the fire brigade benevolent fund as
well?</p><p><a name="06071968000109"><b><a name="06071968000529">Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have no hesitation in doing so. We are grateful
and lucky in respect of the dedication of our emergency
services.</p><p><a name="06071968000110">I mentioned
Lord Newton and the expert work that his committee has conducted. I
should also like to touch on aspects of the expertise of the Health and
Safety Executive, in particular the Health and Safety Laboratory, which
I visited recently. I am happy to say that in terms of the knowledge of
its people, even if it is not always translated into the results we
would want, it is a world leader in forensic accident
investigation.</p><p><a name="06071968000111">So
much for the positive. It is important that the Minister should respond
and that we should put our remarks in a reasonable context. I should
like to highlight three points of query or criticism before I sit down.
The first is that, on the facts as set out in the interim report, it
seems that somehow a long period&#151;nearly 40 years&#151;of the
successful operation of this depot and of similar depots, be they in
Milford Haven or elsewhere, has lulled local residents and the
operators into a false sense of security. The series of explosions and
the fire came as a serious shock. I mention that not simply to show the
importance of regular and professional inspection by the HSE and so
forth, but to allow us to consider the possibility of challenge
inspections by outside bodies, which could look into an incident and
ask the awkward questions that are occasionally
overlooked.</p><p><a name="06071968000112">I
hope that the Minister will say a little about the Government response,
which has already been explored in exchanges with my hon. Friend the
Member for Hemel Hempstead, and about ministerial responsibility.
Ministers need to show who is responsible at any one time; I bear in
mind that different Departments have interlocking responsibilities, but
who is in charge&#151;and at ministerial, not simply agency, level?
Ministers owe us the assurance that they are satisfied that action is
being taken at all similar oil storage facilities, and at
establishments that face similar risks, in the United
Kingdom.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 85WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000113">I should like to emphasise the
issue of progressive development around the site and the planning
issues, which have already been touched on. They need looking into,
particularly as there is evidence that the HSE entered no objection to
the development adjacent to the site. The Minister might usefully say
something about the interlocking interests of the HSE and another
Government agency, the Environment Agency, which is responsible to
another Minister. He might want to say something about monitoring such
development and preparing the safety plan, and about that plan as a
whole.</p><p><a name="06071968000114">Finally, I
re-emphasise the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel
Hempstead made so passionately about the inquiry process. There is an
inherent difficulty in government that goes back to the days of the
Roman Tacitus&#151;the problem of who will supervise the guardians.
Who is to be responsible for ensuring that the professional activities
of Government regulators are carried out to the highest possible
standards? We should remember that in some cases, including that of
Buncefield, the HSE is the competent prosecuting authority. If a
criminal prosecution is brought&#151;and I do not wish to prejudice
that process&#151;there is a real risk that the HSE will be not
merely judge and jury, but prosecutor. That is a difficult moral
hazard, and it is not confined to HSE matters; exactly the same could
apply to the Food Standards Agency and its subsidiary, the Meat Hygiene
Service. The Minister owes us a response on that point, and an
explanation of why the process cannot be entirely independent
process.</p><p><a name="06071968000115">In dealing
with such serious incidents, it is important that the Minister accepts
that there must be a readiness to be open, and he must not in any way
regard a judicial process or an inquiry as an embarrassment; they are
necessary reassurances to constituents and the nation that such
incidents will be tackled for the future. We need to know that lessons
have been learned, that the Government structure is being adjusted to
deal with the situation, and that there will be continuing effective
enforcement. The miracle of Buncefield is that no one was killed, so
only if lessons have been learned can we feel that there has been
benefit from that serious near
miss.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000488">10.43

<p><a name="06071968000120">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) on
securing this debate on a subject that is important not just to the
people of Hemel Hempstead, who are understandably closely concerned in
the matter, but to all communities containing fuel storage depots of
the kind found at Buncefield; that point has been made by other hon.
Members. The explosions and fires that occurred at Buncefield have
raised wide concerns about the safety of such sites, and all those
concerns must, of course, be addressed.</p><p><a name="06071968000121">The debate is timely, as it
comes soon after the publication of the initial report of the
investigation into the Buncefield incident, and after
yesterday&#146;s visit to the site by my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, who met local
residents and businesses.</p><p><a name="06071968000122"><b><a name="06071968000535">Mike
Penning:</b> And
me.</p><p><a name="06071968000123"><b><a name="06071968000536">Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> Yes, and the local Member of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071968000124">First, I
should like to say a few words about the incident and its impact. The
explosions and fires that burned for more than three days were massive
and devastating, and caused major damage to residential and commercial
properties near the depot. Fortunately, there were no fatalities or
really serious injuries, but that was largely down to a good dose of
luck in the timing of the incident, as the hon. Gentleman said. There
was also contamination of groundwater and surface water from escaped
fuel and firefighting water. That was sufficient for the incident to be
reported to the European Commission as a major accident to the
environment. I am aware of local concerns that the contamination may
have affected drinking water supplies, particularly because of the
presence of perfluorooctane sulfonate, which I shall refer to as PFOS,
in the firefighting foam. That has been, and will continue to be,
closely monitored. Let me reassure the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne
Main), who raised the issue, that to date no evidence has been found of
contamination of drinking water.</p><p><a name="06071968000125">The emergency
services&#146; response to the incident&#151;and particularly the
response of the fire and police services&#151;was on a massive scale.
I pay tribute to the dedication and professionalism of all those who
responded in such difficult circumstances. The incident was a major
test of the new national resilience arrangements introduced under the
Civil Contingencies Act 2004, and the test was, I think,
passed.</p><p><a name="06071968000126">I pay
tribute, too, to the resilience of those directly affected by the
Buncefield incident. Homes and businesses were damaged, trade was
disrupted and jobs were lost. There is continuing uncertainty about the
future of the site, as the hon. Member for Hemel 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 87WH</b><br>Hempstead said. It is not surprising that many people, both locally and
elsewhere, are keenly awaiting answers about the root causes of the
incident and about whether such an event could happen again. The
process of finding those answers began the moment that it was safe to
begin. Buncefield and other sites that present major accident hazards
are regulated by a joint competent authority, formed by the HSE and the
Environment Agency in England and Wales, and by the HSE and the
Scottish Environment Protection Agency in Scotland. I shall generally
refer to this joint competent authority, except when speaking of one of
its parts.</p><p><a name="06071968000127">The
competent authority assumed formal control of the investigation from
the police on 14 December, even before the fires were all finally
extinguished. Investigators were able to move on to the site
on16 December. Even so, parts of the site remained so
dangerous that they could not be accessed for weeks or even months
afterwards. It is a normal statutory function of the competent
authority to carry out investigations of major accidents. Those
investigations are often highly complex and technical, requiring a wide
range of specialist skills and expertise. It was quickly recognised,
however, that Buncefield was an exceptional event requiring an
exceptional response.</p><p><a name="06071968000128">That is why the independent
Health and Safety Commission, which advises the Government on health
and safety policies, decided to direct a formal investigation on 20
December. The commission made that direction using its legal powers
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It set out detailed
terms of reference, including reports to be made and published, but
that did not amount to a public inquiry. The commission could have
directed a public inquiry with the Secretary of State&#146;s consent,
but decided that a formal investigation would better advance the
interests of safety. The commission was mindful of the pressing need
for answers felt by the local community&#151;apoint
reiterated by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead&#151;and other
communities with fuel storage depots. Public inquiries generally take
years to reach any substantial conclusions, and only when their
processes have ended can a report be published. That would have
seriously delayed sharing the important lessons of
Buncefield.</p><p><a name="06071968000129">By
contrast, the current investigation, which the hon. Gentleman welcomed
on 13 January, has already produced four reports in quick succession.
They have been well received by local communities and local
authorities, and they have led directly to work to improve safety. For
example, Dacorum borough council has welcomed the good progress
described in the initial report while recognising the need to get the
investigation right.</p><p><a name="06071968000130">I shall say more about the
activities to improve safety in a moment. First, I stress that the
investigation is certainly not being conducted in secrecy or behind
closed doors. When the commission announced the investigation, it
recognised the need for openness as well as speed to ensure public
confidence. It adopted a number of unprecedented measures. For the
first time, it appointed an independent investigation board, chaired by
Lord Newton of Braintree, to supervise the investigation. The board has
scrutinised the progress of 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 88WH</b><br>the investigation to ensure that it is thorough and that it rigorously
pursues all appropriate lines of inquiry.</p><p><a name="06071968000131">The board&#146;s terms of
reference also require it to work closely with all relevant
stakeholders and to keep them fully informed. That is why it appointed
a community liaison officer to co-ordinate such work. Again, it is the
first time that such an appointment has been made in such an
investigation. The board has engaged openly and transparently in
meetings with local residents and businesses, and it has received
representations from interested parties. It is the first time that an
investigation board has had such close contact with local
interests.</p><p><a name="06071968000132">More
important, the board has ensured that the investigation&#146;s
findings have been put into the public domain as soon as they emerge,
subject only to the necessary legal considerations. As the hon. Member
for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) knows, it has published three progress
reports as well as last week&#146;s initial report. It is always
challenging to strike the right balance between being open, thorough
and sharing safety lessons without delay, and avoiding prejudice to
potential legal proceedings. I am satisfied that the
commission&#146;s arrangements meet that challenge.</p><p><a name="06071968000133">Last week, the investigation
board published its initial report. It was announced through a written
statement to the House by the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire). I
shall not repeat everything in that statement, but it noted that the
investigation has made good progress in identifying the root causes of
the incident in spite of the widespread damage that the fire and the
force of the explosion caused to the forensic evidence. I shall add to
my earlier tributes to the investigation teams. They have worked hard
and professionally in difficult and sometimes hazardous conditions to
enable such progress to be made.</p><p><a name="06071968000134">The board considers that enough
is known to set out with reasonable confidence the sequence of events
leading to the incident, although uncertainty remains about why the
explosion was so violent. Work continues on that. The initial report
does not make detailed recommendations, but it identifies several areas
of concern arising from the investigation. They relate to the design
and operation of storage sites, the emergency response to incidents and
the advice given to planning authorities about risks to proposed
developments around major hazard sites. Action is under way on all
those matters. If I may tell the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead, we
expect an interim position on land use planning to be made available
before the end of the year. It will then be subject to local
consultation.</p><p><a name="06071968000135">As
early as February, the competent authority issued a safety alert to 108
storage site operators to review the safety of their operations in
light of information emerging from the investigation. That was followed
up by inspections of all 108 sites, and the preliminary findings were
published on 13 June. Overall, they showed no areas of serious concern,
but 50 per cent. of sites have been asked to make improvements. The
competent authority took some enforcement action, and we expect more
details about that to be made available in the autumn.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 89WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000136">The Environment Agency initiated
a further programme on 11 April to consider the effectiveness of
environmental protection at fuel depots. The results of that initiative
will be published later this year. In parallel, the industry is working
with the competent authority in a task group to improve risk control.
The work includes reviewing and revising guidance on handling flammable
liquids at storage sites, and an interim report from that task force is
expected by the end of September.</p><p><a name="06071968000137">A second safety alert was
issued on 4 July about the working of certain high-level safety
systems. Again, it came as a direct result of new information emerging
from the Buncefield investigation. All information on actions under way
in response to the Buncefield investigation is publicly available on
the websites of the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment
Agency, as appropriate.</p><p><a name="06071968000138">I have
already referred to the massive scale of the emergency response.
Inevitably, there are important lessons to be learned from the event,
and several reviews of the emergency response to Buncefield are under
way. The advice that the Health and Safety Executive provides to
planning authorities about developments around fuel storage sites is
also under review. Preliminary conclusions are expected later this
year, and relevant to that will be the work of the cross-government
group, which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary announced in a
statement to the House on 15 May.</p><p><a name="06071968000139">Other work under way includes
the extensive programme of environmental monitoring described in the
initial report and carried out by the Environment Agency and other
bodies to assess the full impact of the incident on the environment. As
part of the investigation&#146;s terms of reference, reviews are
being carried out of the competent authority&#146;s prior involvement
in regulating activities at the Buncefield site. To ensure
impartiality, the reviews are being carried out by people with no
previous involvement in regulating Buncefield, and they will report to
the Buncefield board. Finally, the competent authority is pursuing a
criminal investigation and it will in due course make a recommendation
on legal proceedings.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 90WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000140">Let me assure the hon. Member
for Hemel Hempstead that all Departments are working closely together
in their response to Buncefield. The key co-ordination role is carried
out by the Government office for the east of England, which covers the
Buncefield
site.</p><p><a name="06071968000141">Finally,
there is another initiative by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government to learn the lessons of the
Buncefield incident and its aftermath. She has asked the Government
office for the east of England to convene a task force to investigate
options for Government support to businesses and local economies in the
period following an exceptional disaster such as the one under
discussion. Our paramount concern is that all lessons of Buncefield are
learned to prevent such an incident from recurring. However, if an
incident occurs, we must ensure that the emergency response
arrangements are fully effective. Good progress has been made in a
relatively short space of time, but there is still much work to do.
That work involves not only the Buncefield investigation board and the
competent authority, but a range of agencies throughout central
Government. The Government are committed to that effort and to ensuring
that the widespread concerns created by the Buncefield incident are
fully met.</p><p><a name="06071968000142">It is
vital to take the time to ensure that the investigation is thorough and
gets its work right. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead
agrees that it would be wrong to rush to hasty conclusions, as Dacorum
borough council has itself recognised. The investigation must ensure
that all the right lessons are learned, and it must provide robust
evidence in the event of any subsequent criminal proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Government are doing everything they can to work with
other bodies to help the recovery effort in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

them to account&#151;commensurate, of course, with national
security.</p><p><a name="06071968000147">We need a

view, we want one that is free from inappropriate political
interference and&#151;a linked matter&#151;one that acts in a
British national interest. I want to explore today whether those two
criteria were being met by MI6 in its present and immediately past

aims.</p><p><a name="06071968000148">In hindsight, it
is clear that in the run up to the Iraq war we sold a distortion of
intelligence to help a narrow political objective&#151;to shape
public opinion towards supporting a pre-emptive attack on Iraq. The
Minister will doubtless be familiar with the responses in the Butler
report, a useful document. It gives an interesting description at
paragraph
32:</p><a name="06071968000455"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The
Government wanted an unclassified document on which it could draw in
its advocacy of its policy. The JIC sought to offer a dispassionate
assessment of
intelligence&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000149">At
paragraph 34, the report
states:</p><a name="06071968000456"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We
conclude that it was a serious weakness that the JIC&#146;s warnings
on the limitations of the intelligence underlying its judgements were
not made sufficiently clear in the
dossier.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000150">At paragraph
33, it states
that</p><a name="06071968000457"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;judgements in the
dossier went to (although not beyond) the outer limits of the
intelligence
available.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000151">At paragraph
35, the report says that</p><a name="06071968000458"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;more weight was placed on the
intelligence than it could
bear.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000152">Clearly, there are
lessons to be learned. I do not want to revisit the entire history of
the Hutton inquiry or of matters leading to the Iraq war, but that is
an important perception. It would be useful to see whether the problem
is being corrected.</p><p><a name="06071968000153">I
want to pursue two issues. The first is the role of John Scarlett, then
head of the Joint Intelligence Committee, in the dodgy dossier and
subsequently. The second is the use of information. It is clear that
language was changed in order to turn neutral intelligence&#151;the
best available analysis, with all the caveats built into it&#151;into
something much more 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 92WH</b><br>certain. In other words&#151;I dare say that it was like a red rag to
a bull&#151;what Andrew Gilligan said was by and large
right.</p><p><a name="06071968000154">It is clear
that words such as &#147;might&#148; and &#147;possibly&#148;
were removed, and more certain words such as &#147;can&#148; and
&#147;will&#148; put in their place. We also know from extensive
evidence in the Hutton inquiry that many of those changes were proposed
by Alastair Campbell and No. 10. I do not blame Mr. Campbell; he was
doing his job. However, I do blame John Scarlett, head of JIC, for
succumbing to that pressure and allowing what was supposed to be a
neutral intelligence document to be manipulated for political purposes.
We now know that no weapons of mass destruction were to be found. There
is a serious question mark over why John Scarlett should have allowed
his intelligence to be changed in that way. Indeed, that episode did
the intelligence services, which we want to hold in the highest regard,
a considerable disservice.</p><p><a name="06071968000155">I draw the Minister&#146;s to
the 45-minute claim, and also to a prominent article in <i>The
Observer</i> of 15 May 2005 by the respected journalist Anthony
Barnett. In it, he alleged that John Scarlett had asked another weapons
inspector, the Australian Dr. Rod Barton, to sex up another dossier by
inserting nine &#147;nuggets&#148;. The article
stated:</p><a name="06071968000459"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Barton
had been hand-picked by the CIA to be the special adviser to the Iraq
Survey Group&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000156">In that
capacity, Barton was preparing a document, but the group was preparing
to reach quite different and damning conclusions. The article reported
that</p><a name="06071968000460"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Saddam
did not have any WMDs at the time of the US-led
invasion&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000157">and it
alleged&#151;I have no knowledge of whether it is true&#151;that
Saddam</p><a name="06071968000461"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;had not had any
programmes to manufacture such weapons after
1991.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000158">In response to
that, <i>The Observer</i> quotes Dr. Barton as saying that</p><a name="06071968000462"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;senior figures in British
intelligence tired to stop the ISG publishing its interim report when
they realised what it would say.
He&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000159">that is Dr.
Barton&#151;</p><a name="06071968000463"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;also
reveals how when this failed, John Scarlett...tried to strengthen
the ISG report by inserting nine &#145;nuggets&#146; of information
to imply Saddam&#146;s WMD programmes were active&#148;.
</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000160">Included in that article were
suggestions that</p><a name="06071968000464"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Saddam was working on a
smallpox weapon, did have mobile biological laboratories and was
developing research equipment for use in nuclear
weapons.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000161">The report
continues:</p><a name="06071968000465"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I
couldn&#146;t believe
it...He&#148;&#151;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000162">that
is John
Scarlett&#151;</p><a name="06071968000466"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;was
suggesting dragging things from a previous report [that the ISG had
found to be false] to use them to, well, &#145;sex it up&#146;. It
was an attempt to make our report appear to imply that maybe there were
still WMD out there. I knew he had been responsible for your
[government&#146;s] dossier and then I realised he was trying to do
the same
thing.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000163">Anthony
Barnett of <i>The Observer</i> makes a serious allegation. I am not
aware whether it has been properly investigated or a proper rebuttal
given&#151;if, indeed, a rebuttal is appropriate. I ask the Minister
to comment on that report. I ask specifically whether it is true, and
if so where it leaves John Scarlett, who appears to be 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 93WH</b><br>continuing the mistakes&#151;I put it neutrally&#151;involved in
drawing up the dossier prior to the invasion of Iraq. It would be
helpful if the Minister were to publish the e-mail correspondence
between John Scarlett and the ISG in that regard. It seems not to be a
security matter, but a matter of public interest with no security
implications.</p><p><a name="06071968000164">I turn
to another MI6 strand, which is the activities carried out by the
information operations unit. The interests of the Government of the day
are not necessarily those of the nation as a whole. That message is
well understood by civil servants&#151;it is established in the civil
service code of practice&#151;and it also applies to intelligence
officers. Yet Nick Rufford, a journalist with <i>The Sunday Times</i>,
produced a story on 28 December 2003 in which he alleged that attempts
were made by MI6 through something called &#147;operation mass
appeal&#148; to plant stories in the media about Saddam
Hussein&#146;s alleged weapons of mass destruction. Scott Ritter, the
former UN weapons inspector, was reported as
saying</p><a name="06071968000467"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The aim
was to convince the public that Iraq was a far greater threat than it
actually was&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000165">If that is
so, it suggests that MI6 was being used to further a narrow political
objective rather than anything in the national interest. If I worked
for MI6, I would be rather concerned that my activities were being
manipulated in that way. Nick Rufford&#146;s story was backed up by a
report by the respected journalist Seymour Hersh, on the other side of
the pond, in which he reported a former American intelligence officer
as saying,</p><a name="06071968000468"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It
was intelligence that was crap, and that we couldn&#146;t move on,
but the Brits wanted to plant stories in England and around the
world&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000166">We
need to know what MI6&#146;s role in this country is. Many of have
naturally assumed that its activities have taken place abroad, but
there are clear suggestions that it has been involved in disinformation
campaigns on the UK mainland. Other newspaper reports, which I do not
have time to refer to, suggest that the information operations unit has
been planting favourable stories with friendly journalists and stories
in other papers that are damaging to those who are critical
ofMI6&#146;s activities&#151;or perhaps I should say of
the Government&#146;s
activities.</p><p><a name="06071968000167">The other
strand that I want to touch on in my last five minutes is the closeness
of this country to the United States Administration. That has of course
been a great strength to us over many years&#151;indeed, since the
second world war. The difference now is the that present US
Administration are operating on a different basis of morality from that
on which previous Administrations operated, up to and including the
Clinton era. We have seen an abandonment of some of the norms of
behaviour that the US introduced after the second world war with
support from other western countries.</p><p><a name="06071968000168">That is a matter for the US,
except that too often it appears that UK foreign policy is merely a
subset of US foreign policy. Nothing that has been overheard in
conversations on microphones in recent days has done much to dispel
that. For example, US foreign policy 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 94WH</b><br>now appears to accept the principle of pre-emptive military action. Al
Gore, the former vice-president, said that the doctrine would
replace</p><a name="06071968000469"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a world in
which states consider themselves subject to
law&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000169">with</p><a name="06071968000470"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the notion that there is no law
but the discretion of the President of the United
States.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000170">That is his
take, and he ought to know.</p><p><a name="06071968000171">Again, in a sense that is a
matter for the US, except if we follow that policy. As we indeed appear
to follow US foreign policy quite slavishly, it is legitimate to ask
the Minister whether other aspects of US foreign policy have been
followed by the UK, through MI6. Can he tell me, for example, what the
MI6&#146;s involvement in Guantanamo Bay has been? It is well
documented that MI6 officials have been over there. What have they been
doing? Have they made it plain to the US that Guantanamo Bay should be
closed down or have they been following a different policy of accepting
that it is there&#151;whether or not we would have started
it&#151;and trying to deal with it as it is?</p><p><a name="06071968000172">The US has also been involved
in the horrors of Abu Ghraib. I hope very much that we would never
endorse that sort of thing in any shape or form. We have heard
allegations of extraordinary rendition, which the Intelligence and
Security Committee is now looking into. I would be grateful if the
Minister said something about that and whether we have had any
involvement at all in extraordinary rendition, either directly or
through connivance.</p><p><a name="06071968000173">The US has offered support for
regimes across the world that are questionable in morality
terms&#151;let me put it as neutrally as I can. The Minister will be
aware of the publication about Uzbekistan by Craig Murray, the former
ambassador, which suggests that there was torture, imprisonment and all
sorts of human rights abuses that we did nothing about, mainly because
we thought that we had a geopolitical interest in having the President
there on board.</p><p><a name="06071968000174">There
is also the issue of legitimised assassinations. I refer the Minister
to a report in <i>The Guardian </i>on29 October 2001 that
said:</p><a name="06071968000471"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Bush
gives green light to CIA for assassination of named
terrorists&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000175">overturning
a 25-year ban on assassinations. That was referred to in a further
report in <i>The Guardian </i>on13 August 2002 that
said:</p><a name="06071968000472"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;The US
government is considering plans to send elite military units on
missions to
assassinate&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000176">terrorists</p><a name="06071968000473"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in
countries around the world, without necessarily informing the
governments involved, it was reported
yesterday.</p></ul><a name="06071968000474"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
Pentagon is discussing proposals which could see special operations
units dispatched to capture or kill terrorists wherever they are
believed to be
hiding.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000177">What is the
Government&#146;s policy on that? Do we accept the truth of that
report in <i>The Guardian</i>? If the Minister thinks that it is
untrue, he can say so; if he thinks that it is true, what policy have
we adopted on it? Are we informed by the Americans of what they are
doing? Given the close relationship between the CIA and MI6, are
we&#151;horrible as it is to ask&#151;in any way involved in such a
policy?</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 95WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000178">I need to ask the Minister a
number of questions. Will he publish the e-mails and other
correspondence relating to John Scarlett&#146;s dealings with the ISG
and the influencing of the report? Will the Minister set out the
boundaries of action for MI6 in operating within this country, as
opposed to operating abroad? Will he clarify the role of the
information operations unit and whether it has been involved in
briefing journalists and putting out information or disinformation to
the British press in order to influence public opinion in this country?
Will he confirm whether MI6 was in any way involved in extraordinary
renditions? Does he have any knowledge at all of whether MI6 is
involved in the apparent US policy of targeted assassinations in this
country or elsewhere?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000490">11.15
am</h5><p><a name="06071968000179"><b><a name="06071968000540">The
Minister for the Middle East (Dr. Kim Howells):</b> It is a
great pleasure to serve under you,Mr. Conway&#151;I do not
think that we have had the pleasure before. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) on securing this debate. I welcome the
opportunity to set out the Government&#146;s position to the House
and to reassure him of the integrity and professionalism of the United
Kingdom intelligence services.</p><p><a name="06071968000180">I am certainly to glad to hear
the hon. Gentleman welcome the existence of MI6 or, as it normally
called, the Secret Intelligence Service or SIS&#151;I say that so
that I can reply more quickly. As someone helping to co-ordinate the
evacuation of thousands of very frightened people from Lebanon, I find
it difficult to imagine how a safe evacuation could be carried out
without high quality intelligence from our intelligence services. That
is literally a matter of life or death.</p><p><a name="06071968000181">I have heard lots of names of
journalists and newspapers from the hon. Gentleman. We all have our
favourite journalists and favourite newspapers, but I would not expect
some of them to write a good story about the Government this side of
the next millennium.</p><p><a name="06071968000182">The hon. Gentleman is right to
note that the United Kingdom is close to the United States of America
and that the UK intelligence services are close to their US opposite
numbers. I am sure that the House expects nothing less. International
co-operation is critical, especially in these times, when it comes to
countering international terrorism. Our relationship with the United
States is a mutually beneficial one that enables us to co-operate
closely where our interests coincide and to discuss, debate and
disagree privately where they differ.</p>

<p><a name="06071968000183">However, any suggestion that
the SIS is unquestioning in its relationship with the
Americans&#151;whether with the CIA or with anyone else&#151;is to
mistake the nature of that relationship. For obvious reasons, it is
impossible to discuss the operations of the SIS or its co-operation
with the CIA in detail, but I should like to set out its legally
defined functions, since they are at the heart of what the hon.
Gentleman asked me. I should also like to discuss the oversight
mechanism, which I hope will offer him the reassurance that he
seeks.</p><p><a name="06071968000184">The SIS was
placed on a statutory basis by the House in the Intelligence Services
Act 1994, which was 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 96WH</b><br>modified by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The
functions of the SIS as Britain&#146;s foreign intelligence service
were set out in that legislation as follows:</p><a name="06071968000475"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to obtain and provide information
relating to the actions or intentions of persons outside the British
Islands; and...to perform other tasks relating to the actions or
intentions of such
persons.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000185">The Acts also
stipulated that those functions should only be carried out by the SIS
if they are</p><a name="06071968000476"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;in the
interests of national security, with particular reference to the
defence and foreign policies of Her Majesty's Government in the United
Kingdom; or...in the interests of the economic well-being of the
United Kingdom; or...in support of the prevention or detection of
serious
crime.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000186">In
order to ensure that the SIS carried out those functions and those
functions only&#151;it is important to remember this, as the hon.
Gentleman has raised some interesting questions&#151;the two Acts set
up the following oversight
mechanisms.</p><p><a name="06071968000187">First, if
the SIS wished to carry out an action that would be otherwise unlawful,
it could apply for an authorisation to be issued by the Foreign
Secretary. The authorisation may only be issued if the Foreign
Secretary thinks it necessary for the discharge of the SIS&#146;s
functions that a particular action is taken and is satisfied that the
proposed action is proportionate and reasonable.</p><p><a name="06071968000188">Secondly, the decisions of the
Secretary of State to give authorisations are subject to the review of
the Intelligence Services Commissioner who reports at least once a year
to the Prime Minister, who in turn lays the commissioner&#146;s
report before Parliament. The commissioner must be a person who holds,
or has held, high judicial office and every member of the SIS is under
a statutory duty to provide him with all the documents and information
he needs to carry out his functions.</p><p><a name="06071968000189">Thirdly, there is a tribunal of
judges and senior lawyers with the power to investigate individuals'
complaints against the SIS, make awards of compensation or, for
example, quash or cancel any warrant or authorisation. If a complainant
is dissatisfied with a decision of the tribunal, they may decide to
take their case to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg.</p><p><a name="06071968000190">The
operations of the SIS are therefore carried out within a strict
statutory framework, overseen by the Foreign Secretary and scrutinised
by members of the senior judiciary.</p><p><a name="06071968000191">The hon. Gentleman has
questioned the use of intelligence in the run-up to the war in Iraq,
and the degree to which the agencies were happy with that use of
intelligence. He has also raised concerns over the behaviour and the
subsequent appointment of John Scarlett as chief of the Secret
Intelligence Service.</p><p><a name="06071968000192">I do not propose to revisit the
exhaustive work carried out by Lord Butler of Brockwell, or the
conclusions and recommendations of his report&#151;no doubt that will
be debated and discussed as long as the assassination of
Kennedy&#151;but I will highlight that, as noted by the Intelligence
and Security Committee in its annual report, which was debated in the
House as recently as 11 July, the Government have adopted Lord Butler's
recommendations to improve both the 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 97WH</b><br>validation of intelligence and the ability of dissenting voices to
challenge conclusions based on that intelligence.</p><p><a name="06071968000193">The SIS has also
reorganised and strengthened staff responsible for the overall quality
of intelligence and the process by which it is produced, and that is
very important. Mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that senior
officers in the Defence Intelligence Staff see all relevant
information. A confidential guide on the nature, collection and use of
intelligence has been produced for those who read and use it.
Assessment boxes are included on the Joint Intelligence Committee's
assessments papers to explain the limitations of the intelligence on
which the assessment has reached its conclusions. I am appreciative of
that, as it helps a great deal if we have an explanation of where
intelligence has come from, how reliable it is likely to be and whether
it can be corroborated from elsewhere. I think that is an important
step forward.</p><p><a name="06071968000194">A
professional head of intelligence analysis has been appointed and is
leading work on the training of analysts, and the JIC assessments staff
have been expanded. Written dissent from JIC assessments can be
included in the paper to which they refer, the JIC assessments staff
have access to the Agencies' Staff Counsellor, and the DIS has a
mechanism for expressing dissent within the Ministry of
Defence.</p><p><a name="06071968000195">The
Intelligence and Security Committee welcomed these changes, and has
said that it hopes that
they</p><a name="06071968000477"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;will have a
positive impact on decision-making at the highest level of the
intelligence
community.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000196">I
will now try to answer at least some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
questions. I noted around 15 questions, but I will try to answer the
most important.</p><p><a name="06071968000197">First,
the hon. Gentleman raised a number of issues about John Scarlett, or C
as he is officially known. The former Foreign Secretary&#151;now
Leader of the House&#151;appointed John Scarlett on the basis of
recommendations he had received from a totally independent selection
panel following standard Civil Service Commission practice. The process
followed precisely the same pattern used to select similarly graded
permanent secretaries. The key consideration was to appoint the best
person for the job and on the advice of the selection board, the former
Foreign Secretary concluded that John Scarlett was indeed the best
candidate. The Prime Minister did not intervene in the selection
process, but was consulted as it came to an end, when he gave his
approval.</p><p><a name="06071968000198">The SIS has
made considerable progress since John Scarlett&#146;s appointment and
steps that can be described publicly include the implementation of the
recommendations of the Butler review&#151;welcomed by the
Intelligence and Security Committee&#151;and the unprecedented move
to open recruitment to enable the expansion necessary to counter
terrorism, which was also welcomed by the ISC. The SIS has set up a new
website and I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows the address, but I will
tell him anyway:
www.mi6.gov.uk.</p><p><a name="06071968000199">On the
SIS carrying out illegal operations, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the
SIS is drawn from the ranks of the UK population. The staff therefore
share the legal and human rights priorities of the UK as a 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 98WH</b><br>whole and are trained to operate within the Acts that define the
service&#146;s role. The SIS&#146;s compliance with legislation is
clear from the reports of the commissioner that have been made over
many years. In the extremely unlikely event that officers of the SIS
attempted to carry out an operation that required the Secretary of
State&#146;s authorisation without obtaining approval, they would be
subject to the same liability in law as any other UK citizen. I welcome
that and hope that the hon. Gentleman does too.</p><p><a name="06071968000200">There are both internal and
external systems in place to prevent unauthorised action. Internally,
the SIS is structured in such a way as to prevent any person or group
carrying out an illegal operation without it coming to the attention of
officers who report directly to SIS&#146;s senior management. The SIS
reports any errors in its oversight process to the Intelligence
Services Commissioner, who includes them in his report to the Prime
Minister. The right of access to SIS&#146;s records by the
commissioner and the Investigatory Powers Tribunal means that any
attempt to act independently of ministerial authorisation could be
detected either as a result of a direct complaint or in the course of
the commissioner&#146;s routine and regular scrutiny.</p><p><a name="06071968000201">Infuriatingly, we are running
out of time, but I want the hon. Gentleman to know that the Government
are not involved in any form of torture in any way, nor do we condone
torture, or tactics that undoubtedly were used at some stage in the
past by people with whom we ally ourselves. I have made many visits to
Afghanistan and Iraq, and I believe that nations are judged to be
civilised and modern on the basis of how they treat not only their own
citizens but the citizens of other countries. That means, at its most
acute moment, how they treat those they have in custody, where they may
be able to do things to people that they would not normally be able to.
I want to make it clear that the Government are not involved in any of

this debate because I am aware that transport debates are often
dominated by people from other parts of the country who have longer to
travel and rely more on the railways. In fact, travelling by rail is
more of a London habit, and half the people who travel by train are
Londoners. It is important that, from time to time, we have an
opportunity to put to Ministers the particular concerns of London
Members, especially when faced with the enormous levels of growth both
in the capital and in the use of railways.</p><p><a name="06071968000210"><b><a name="06071968000545">Mr.
Mark Field (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> I am
sorry to disturb the hon. Gentleman so early in his speech, but perhaps
a point we should also make as London Members is that London railways
are used by hundreds of thousands of constituents from outside the
capital&#151;for example, as far away as east Kent. Therefore, the
state of London railways isan issue of great concern well
beyond the 74 constituencies in the
capital.</p><p><a name="06071968000211"><b><a name="06071968000546">Martin
Linton:</b> It is absolutely true that the railways in London
perform vital functions for three groups: first, the people who live in
London; secondly, those who work in London and travel in daily; and
thirdly, those from all over the country who travel to London. Those
points should not be overlooked, especially by Members who represent a
constituency that is a long way from London and see the issue as
involving competition between their transport needs and ours.</p><p><a name="06071968000212">I am not sure whether hon.
Members have seen it, but there is an early-day motion tabled by my
hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) that
notes the achievements of the Government in the last comprehensive
spending review when they agreed to a five-year investment programme
with the Mayor, and calls for the Government to use the next
comprehensive spending review in 2007 to raise the level of transport
spending in the UK&#146;s other metropolitan areas and to address the
gap in spending per head. The motion does not call on the Department to
stop funding Transport for London&#146;s investment programme, just
to match it elsewhere, which suggests that London has had its turn and
it should be the turn of other areas now.</p><p><a name="06071968000213">That approach suggests that
rail transport should be seen as an on-cost. I suggest that it is far
better to regard it as an investment that contributes
between&#163;9 billion and &#163;15 billion to central
Government: much more than it receives. Investment in the London
transport system benefits not only Londoners but the entire country. It
is often suggested by people outside London that the capital is
overheated and overcrowded, and that the pressure needs to be relieved
by having more investment outside London. In fact, 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 100WH</b><br>London has substantial under-used resources: there is high unemployment
in many parts and low employment rates, as well as many bottlenecks
that prevent the effective use of resources.</p><p><a name="06071968000214">In addition, the population of
London is due to grow by between 900,000 and 1 million in the next few
years, and those additional million residents will be living all around
London, but working mainly in the centre. In order to accommodate this
huge pressure on the capital, TFL has introduced proposals for
London&#146;s transport investment needs in &#147;Transport
2025&#148;, and more specifically in &#147;Rail 2025&#148;. The
centrepiece of that is the East London line and the North London
railway, both of which provide mainly orbital routes that will join up
in about six years to form a London orbital rail network. It is worth
while spending some time understanding the implications of
that.</p><p><a name="06071968000215">The 2001 census
showed that, although 38 per cent. of Londoners live and work in the
same borough&#151;a figure that has been falling rapidly; it used to
be much more than that&#151;25 per cent. travel into central London
along radial routes, like the spokes coming into a hub, and 19 per
cent. take orbital journeys to work. That was defined in the survey as
someone who lives in one borough, but works in another that is not in
central London, so the journey to work is not radial but orbital. That
means that for every four commuters travelling into the centre, there
are three travelling across London to get to work. Inevitably, a far
higher proportion of orbital commuters travel by car, partly because
they often have to because there is no public transport, and partly
because they can.</p><p><a name="06071968000216">It
is not only Londoners who make orbital journeys, as commuters and
travellers going through London do not particularly want to go through
the centre. One of the key points about the London orbital is that it
will provide interchanges where commuters coming into London can switch
to the orbital route to avoid travelling through the centre. That will
be at places such as Clapham Junction, Willesden Junction, which is in
the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms
Butler), West Hampstead, Stratford, and in east and south London at
points that are not yet exactly clear. There will be places where all
the trains stop and people can get off and, instead of going to a
London terminus, they will be able to travel more directly to where
they want to go. Indeed, I welcome the fact that the Mayor of London
has recently discussed powers to enable him to insist on the train
operating companies stopping at these orbital interchanges.</p><p><a name="06071968000217">There has already been a 30 per
cent. rise in rail journeys and there is another big increase to come
that can never be met by the traditional model of everybody coming into
the centre and then travelling to their required destination. Victoria
station is already so overcrowded that it often has to be closed during
rush hour because there are too many people on the platforms. The irony
is that many of the people who travel into the centre do not actually
want to be there.</p><p><a name="06071968000218">A
further reason why we need an orbital rail network is to serve the
communities that were forgotten or overlooked by the tube network when
it was created. South London springs to mind in that context as,
certainly in my part of south London, it was believed at 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 101WH</b><br>the time that clay could not be tunnelled through. Although it is now
considered to be the best material for tunnelling through, large parts
of south London where left without the tube for that reason. The
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and
Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) is another example of an area of London that
has never had a tube. It is only now with the arrival of the East
London line that it will have a tube system. That means that
communities that have so far been deprived of the advantages of having
a tube will now have it. People hardly know that Haggerston and Hoxton
exist because they are not on the tube, but they will now have new
stations.</p><p><a name="06071968000219"><b><a name="06071968000547">Ms
Diane Abbott (Hackney, North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</b>
Of course, everyone knows about Haggerston, and I live a few steps away
from the new station there. Does my hon. Friend agree that the
advantage to the people of Hackney of the new orbital route and the
East London line is not just the convenience of being able to access
the tube, but that it will play an important role in regeneration in an
area which has long had some of the highest unemployment rates in the
country?</p><p><a name="06071968000220"><b><a name="06071968000548">Martin
Linton:</b> My hon. Friend makes the point for me that these
are real places with real transport needs, but because they have not
appeared on the tube map until now, they have been relatively less well
known. It is a huge problem in south London, particularly for the
entertainment industry and tourist attractions, that tourists always
navigate entirely using the tube map&#151;indeed, this is also the
case for some north Londoners&#151;and do not recognise the existence
of anywhere served only by the rail network. I very much hope that the
new East London line, whether it is run as a tube or metro service,
will be on the tube map. The biggest single benefit will come from
people seeing that we are on that map and being able to find the
service.</p><p><a name="06071968000221">I mentioned
Haggerston and Hoxton, but Dalston Junction is also involved. There is
a new station at Surrey Canal road and another at Sands
End&#151;although I believe that it will be called Imperial
Wharf&#151;in Hammersmith and Fulham. Furthermore, Shepherd&#146;s
Bush will soon be linked to the West London line and, at last, 163
years after it was built, Clapham Junction will be on the tube. That is
of enormous interest to my constituents.</p><p><a name="06071968000222">Orbital routes are important.
In so far as the great expansion in demand for transport in London
relates to radial routes, it can already be accommodated simply by
building longer trains, longer platforms and better signalling. That is
what the rail industry will do. I do not underestimate the cost; the
project will use a lot of Department for Transport and Transport for
London resources, but it is a relatively simple and straightforward
solution.</p><p><a name="06071968000223">London&#146;s great fortune
is that we also have orbital routes: the South London, East London,
West London and North London lines, which have been underused over the
years. They are full of freight paths and run very few passenger
trains, which in some sections come only once every 30 minutes. The
project will cost a lot 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 102WH</b><br>of money, but all we have to do is join up those four routes to have a
ready-made orbital network.</p><p><a name="06071968000224">Ironically, the first phase of
the East London line extension is not so much an orbital route as a
radial route in from Croydon and Crystal Palace. However, it paves the
way for an orbital route, and the second phase of the East London line
extension&#151;the one of main concern to me and some of my hon.
Friends&#151;will be an orbital route. Not only that, but, as it
provides the missing link, it will allow all four East, North, West and
South London lines to be joined up in a network that will enable a full
orbital route to exist. Work is already well under way; the enabling
works contract for the first phase, involving work on viaduct bridges,
was in June last year. The rolling stock contract is already advanced
and the main works contract, worth &#163;500 million, is expected to
be awarded next month. The bidding process for an operator for the East
London and North London lines is already at an advanced stage. The
appointment should be made next year and the completion date is June
2010.</p><p><a name="06071968000225">Phase 2 is
vital because it will link up the orbital route. It is crucial that it
follows on directly fromphase 1. That, of course, depends
entirely on the Treasury and the Department for Transport providing
sufficient capital or prudential borrowing to TFL to continue the
programme on which it has embarked. The Mayor of London has told me
that he regards the East London line as a single project. Provided that
he can get the prudential borrowing or capital that he needs in the
comprehensive spending review, he intends that phase 2 should follow on
from phase 1 and he thinks that things could be ready within three
years.</p><p><a name="06071968000226">That,
ironically, would take us to June 2013, just10 months after
the Olympics. It would be good to know that there was a way of ensuring
that the work was completed before the games. Although there is a
promise to build the East London line in my party&#146;s manifesto,
there has been no promise that it will be ready on any particular
date.</p><p><a name="06071968000227"><b><a name="06071968000549">Jeremy
Corbyn (Islington, North) (Lab):</b> My hon. Friend is
absolutely right in saying that we need the link. I am concerned that
there is a phase 1 and phase 2 when it would be much better if it were
all done in one phase. My suspicion&#151;and, I suspect, that of my
hon. Friends&#151;is that phase 2 might get delayed for funding
reasons. We need a clear commitment that phase 2, which includes a
planned extension to Highbury and Islington in my constituency, will be
followed and that we will retain the option of a link to Finsbury Park,
which would become a sub-orbital network in the same way as my hon.
Friend has outlined in other cases. Does he support that
position?</p><p><a name="06071968000228"><b><a name="06071968000550">Martin
Linton:</b> As the Government were committed to building the
East London line in their manifesto and as it follows the logic of all
their transport policies, I remain completely confident that they will
enable phase 2 to go ahead so that trains eventually run from Clapham
Junction to Highbury. I accept that, to create an orbital interchange
in that part of London, it would make huge railway sense for Finsbury
Park to be added to the system. It is a natural hub, whereas other
stations in the area are not.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 103WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000229">The cost is great; greater than
anticipated. Phase 1 of the East London line will cost close on
&#163;1 billion. Originally it was a national scheme, but it is now a
London scheme; London is borrowing the money to carry it out. The
Treasury, through the Department for Transport, funds the Mayor of
London to enable the money to be paid back.</p><p><a name="06071968000230">By comparison, phase 2 is
costed at only about&#163;250 million to &#163;275
million. I regret to inform my hon. Friends the Members for Hackney,
North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and for Hackney, South and
Shoreditch that, of that &#163;275 million, &#163;200 million is
the cost of extending the line by just two stations, up to Highbury and
Islington. For technical reasons that I do not fully understand, that
is the expensive part of the project. None the less, it is very
important that it should go ahead. It might be worth pursuing why that
cost is so disproportionate.</p><p><a name="06071968000231">The southern extension to
Clapham Junction, my main concern, is a relatively cheap &#163;75
million, most of which is to build the new station at Surrey Canal road
in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford
(Joan Ruddock). Once that has been built, we shall campaign for a
station at Brixton. The idea of having a line in south London that goes
through but does not stop at Brixton seems extraordinary. The Mayor has
commissioned a business case for a station at Brixton, although that
would involve huge technical difficulties. I shall pursue the same
strategy and get a business case for a station in north
Battersea.</p><p><a name="06071968000232"><b><a name="06071968000551">Meg
Hillier (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I
agree that it would be great if the trains stopped at Brixton. That
would enable people to visit Hoxton and Haggerston, which many people
have heard of and do visit, but with greater difficulty than if they
were a station in Brixton.</p><p><a name="06071968000233"><b><a name="06071968000552">Martin
Linton:</b> My hon. Friend will know the difficulties of
travelling from one part of London to another when it involves going
through the centre. That problem will become very apparent during the
Olympic games. People living outside London think that London has the
Olympics, but east London has them. The difficulties that people living
in south-west London will have in reaching the Olympics would be very
great at the moment but would be considerably helped by the new line.
Similarly, if a person wants to travel from Brixton to Hoxton, their
journey, which would now take 50 or 55 minutes, would be reduced to
about 15 or 20
minutes.</p><p><a name="06071968000234"><b><a name="06071968000553">Ms
Dawn Butler (Brent, South) (Lab):</b> I agree strongly with my
hon. Friend and with my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North
(Jeremy Corbyn), who said that we should consider doing all the work
under phase 1, especially given that the Olympics are so near. Given
the Olympics, Wembley and even the line from Queen&#146;s Park to
Stratford, does my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)
agree that the extension of the London orbital network, by joining
east, south, north and west London, is paramount to having a successful
Olympics?</p><p><a name="06071968000235"><b><a name="06071968000554">Martin
Linton:</b> I agree absolutely. We must remember that the
Olympics are just six years and two 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 104WH</b><br>weeks from now. We are talking about a transport system that will last
100 years, but if the Olympics helped to concentrate minds and
demonstrate the advantages to people, that would serve a purpose. If we
had an orbital route functioning for the Olympics, so that people from
all over London found it easy to get to them, that would be of great
benefit to them.</p><p><a name="06071968000236">I
come back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney,
North and Stoke Newington: the most important reason for having an
orbital route in London is regeneration. When the East London and the
North London lines are joined together under a single operator, they
will bring into the London rail and tube system nearly 100 new
stations&#151;about 30 on the East London line and about 60 on the
North London line. Those lines go through 80 per cent. of the wards in
the top 20 per cent. of deprivation in London. Four out of five
deprived areas will be served by
them.</p><p><a name="06071968000237">Some people say
that it is old fashioned to see the structure of London as a well-to-do
centre, a deprived inner ring and a wealthier ring of suburbs. There
are many exceptions to that pattern, and one could point to parts of
outer London that are becoming more deprived. Nevertheless, a central
pattern exists, and an orbital route would be good for regeneration
because it would link all those places. The south London spur, which
will cost &#163;75 million, would enable people in north Battersea,
Clapham, Brixton, Camberwell, Peckham and Deptford to get to jobs in
docklands in 15 or 20 minutes. At present, those journeys might take
well over an hour. An orbital route would bring employment
opportunities to many deprived areas, and I am sure that one can make a
similar calculation for the Gospel Oak to Barking line and the North
London line, which will end at Stratford.</p>

<p><a name="06071968000238"><b><a name="06071968000555">Jeremy
Corbyn:</b> As my hon. Friend knows, the Barking to Gospel Oak
part of the North London line was saved from closure some years ago
when a previous Government tried to get rid of it altogether. However,
in advance of the construction of the necessary links that he outlined,
it is possible already to improve the service by running trains beyond
Gospel Oak through to Willesden Junction and Ealing Broadway. As
wonderful as Gospel Oak is, it is not a natural suburban interchange.
Trains from Barking could easily run to many more destinations all
around London. I hope that if TFL is listening to or hearing about this
debate, it will recognise that that can be included in the service
requirement document now, even before the new lines have been
constructed.</p><p><a name="06071968000239"><b><a name="06071968000556">Martin
Linton:</b> Indeed, I believe that Network Rail is already
waking up to those possibilities. It conducted a worthwhile, although
very overdue, exercise to produce the cross-London rail utilisation
strategy, which considers the use that is being made&#151;or not
being made&#151;of those lines. For instance, Network Rail has
started running trains straight through from Clapham Junction to Gospel
Oak through Willesden Junction, but they are infrequent and
under-publicised. The trains are choc-a-bloc with people who know about
the route, but the marketing of railways within London has been poor,
and there are many examples of stations that are full of regular
commuters but little passing trade.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 105WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000240">One of the problems with the
railways in London as opposed to the tube is, strange as it sounds, a
marketing problem. Everybody knows about the tube. They understand the
tube map. People who arrive in London instantly grasp how the tube
system works and where they can get to, but people who have been living
next to a rail station, perhaps for nine months, still have not
discovered that they can get regular trains from
it.</p><p><a name="06071968000241">The train
operating companies need to understand that their mission in life is
not simply to take people in and out of London but to take them around
London&#151;in other words, to have a tube mindset rather than an
inter-city mindset&#151;and they must market the stations and the
services that they provide tothe population in a way that can
be understood. The companies must operate a turn-up-and-go system. It
is no good expecting Londoners who are used to the tube to memorise the
times of trains at all their local stations. Unless they are regular
commuters, they will not do
that.</p><p><a name="06071968000242"><b><a name="06071968000557">Ms
Butler:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that having a single
operator would mean that stations would be safer and that secure
stations accreditation could be more easily rolled out along the
network?</p><p><a name="06071968000243"><b><a name="06071968000558">Martin
Linton:</b> I pay tribute to the good work that my hon. Friend
has done on the safer stations scheme in respect of stations in her
constituency and elsewhere. I had a long campaign to get one of my
local stations, Queenstown Road, staffed. It was completely unstaffed
for 11 years, but now there is one member of staff. That helps the
situation enormously, and regular users of the station are much happier
about it. One of the reasons that people are put off using the railways
as opposed to the tube system is the fear of crime and unlit stations.
They are afraid of walking into a station and suddenly realising that
they are the only person there, and that there are no staff to protect
them in the event of an emergency. I very much welcome safer
stations.</p><p><a name="06071968000244">London has a
huge advantage because of the railways. My constituency is practically
made of them. Hundreds of lines criss-cross it in every possible
direction, but the local residents get little use out of them.
Bizarrely, many stations in inner London were closed in the 1940s,
1950s and 1960s, partly because of the Beeching inquiry but even before
it. For example, Battersea High Street station on the West London line
was closed during the war. Stations in Camberwell and Walworth were
closed at about the same time, and there are now long lines of railway
track with passing trains that do not stop, even though they pass
through some of the most densely populated areas of the entire
country.</p><p><a name="06071968000245">The existing
mainly cross-London railway routes are a huge asset. They could be used
if they were added to the tube system, invested in, joined up, marketed
and run by a single company under the auspices of TFL, which has played
a key role in focusing our energies on this issue. London transport
could be a real success story in years to
come.</p><p><a name="06071968000246"><b><a name="06071968000559">Harry

to the Barking to Gospel Oak line, which is very important in my
constituency? Is not there a powerful case for approving
electrification of that line? First, it would mean that diesel trains

recently heard of Gospel Oak. I had to look it up on a map. I am glad
that it has been included in the North London railway concession and
that we have trains from Clapham Junction along the Gospel Oak line,
but the fact that that line, which runs from Barking through my hon.
Friend&#146;s constituency, through Tottenham, Leytonstone, the whole
of Haringey and Islington and ends up in Camden, has been so little
used is a poor reflection on the use of London railways. Indeed, I did
not realise that it is not an electrified
line.</p><p><a name="06071968000248">I have, however,
a slight concern about freight. I believe, as I am sure we all do, in
as much freight running on the railways as possible, but a huge amount
of the freight running through London does not actually have anything
to do with London. It is going through London from Felixstowe to
Liverpool, or it crosses the Battersea railway bridge in the journey
from Dover to Newcastle. That railway bridge takes all the freight
coming from the channel ports and going north of London. Yes, we
believe in freight, but we do not want it to clog up London lines so
much that Londoners themselves do not get adequate use of
them.</p><p><a name="06071968000249"><b><a name="06071968000561">Tom
Brake (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD):</b> The hon. Gentleman
speaks knowledgeably about the need to increase the use of trains and
to raise their profile in London. Would he agree that one of the most
effective ways to do that would be to move as quickly as possible to
allowing the Oyster card to be used on both trains and tubes? Not being
able to use it on trains must be one of the most restrictive things in
terms of encouraging train use.</p><p><a name="06071968000250"><b><a name="06071968000562">Martin
Linton:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman and I believe that
the plans are well advanced. The Mayor has made the campaign his own
and he has had considerable success in achieving that goal. Many of the
Londoners who want to use trains will want to use their Oyster card on
them.</p><p><a name="06071968000251">I have rather
liberally interpreted my prerogative as the person who was lucky enough
to secure the debate, and I have stayed on my feet for half an hour. I
know that my hon. Friends and other hon. Members want to join in, and I
have perhaps taken up too much time already. However, I should
emphasise that we in London have a huge opportunity because we are on
the way to completing the East London line, which is one of the major
transport infrastructure projects in the country. It is essential to my
constituency and, indeed, to my future in it that phase 2 follows on
from phase 1, although I am arguing for the project not in personal
terms, but in simple, common-sense transport terms. This is an
excellent project from the point of viewof transport,
regeneration and, indeed, social equity, and I very much look forward
to hearing what my 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 107WH</b><br>hon. Friend the Minister has to say in reply to the debate. I also look
forward to hearing the contributions of my hon. Friends and other hon.
Members.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000492">3.1

Mark Field (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</b> I
thank the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) for his speech.
Thank goodness it was a 90-minute debate, not a 30-minute debate,
otherwise no one else would have had a chance to contribute.</p><p><a name="06071968000253">Given the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s insatiable desire to know more about Gospel Oak, I
should perhaps tell him&#151;my friends in the London borough of
Camden would be keen to point this out&#151;that Gospel Oak was one
of the wards that went to the Conservatives in the recent local
elections. Indeed, I believe that our majority there is rather bigger
than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s majority in his parliamentary seat in
Battersea, but that is another matter.</p><p><a name="06071968000254">This is a useful debate. The
failure to invest in London&#146;s infrastructure, especially its
transport infrastructure, is regarded as the single biggest issue
facing London-based businesses. The debate is also timely, given the
Conservative party&#146;s transport initiatives, particularly its
rail transport initiatives, which have been announced in the past 48
hours. Our concern is that the railway transport system is too
disjointed and broken up&#151;a complaint that goes back to the
privatisation that took place under the Conservative Government.
However, it could also be said that transport policy making in London
as a whole is too disjointed.</p><p><a name="06071968000255">One reason why we, as London
MPs, perhaps have a somewhat limited voice on the matter is that much
of the policy making and day-to-day decision making on transport is in
the hands of the Mayor, Transport for London and the Greater London
authority. That makes it difficult for us, as London MPs, to have our
voice heard. As I said in my brief intervention, one of the biggest
issues is that London transport affects not only the 74 London
constituencies, but many constituencies and constituents far beyond the
capital. It is all the more important, therefore, that debates such as
today&#146;s take place.</p><p><a name="06071968000256">I worry particularly about
financial services and the creative industries, because we need to
promote those important areas of growth in our economy. For historical
and other obvious reasons, those industries are based in London, and we
need to do our bit to ensure that the infrastructure, and the transport
infrastructure in particular, is promoted.</p><p><a name="06071968000257">I appreciate that other hon.
Members have quite a lot to say, so I shall not say too much, not least
because none of the orbital railway directly affects my constituency.
It just outside my constituency, although it might assist parents in
Hackney who happen to send their children to schools in my
constituency, as well as people making other journeys. However, the
City of London corporation is keen to ensure that there is proper
investment in the east London link line, and it welcomes the progress
that has been made so far on phase 1. I have walked through the
constituency of the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg
Hillier) and seen the disruption in Hoxton and Haggerston. An enormous
amount of building work is 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 108WH</b><br>going, but it will all be to good effect in the longer term. I hope that
phase 2 will ensure that there is an interchange with the Victoria
line, which is crucial, for the reasons set out by the hon. Member for
Battersea.</p><p><a name="06071968000258">I do not
want to speak only from a north London perspective, so let me also say
something from a south London perspective. Thankfully, I have heard of
Battersea and Clapham Junction, and it is important that they are
linked in to the system so that we have a proper orbital railway. That
will ensure that the City is well catered for and that people will be
able to use the orbital railway, at least until the last available
point, when they will have to take another form of transport, which
might be a bus, rather than the tube or the train. That will also
ensure that we take the earliest opportunity to avoid a lot of the
wasted journeys that result, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, when
people go into central London, only to come straight out
again.</p><p><a name="06071968000259">I congratulate
the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. He is right to suggest that
the London orbital railway may prove to be a most effective means of
improving London&#146;s train transport. I have 34 tube stations in
my constituency, but, as I said, none of them is directly affected by
the orbital link. However, if we can ensure that there is proper
investment, we might well alleviate some of the problems that people
experience when the tube is very busy, particularly on days such as
this.</p><p><a name="06071968000260">Let me say a
quick word about Crossrail, which is a central issue for most London
Members. I am pretty realistic about its prospects: notwithstanding the
enormous amounts of time and effort that are being expended in this
place on the hybrid Bill, it is highly unlikely that Crossrail, at
least under the currentplans, will ever be built. I do not
think that the finances will be there, given that the cost is projected
to be&#163;13 billion, &#163;14 billion or &#163;15
billion and is rising fast. However, I hope that serious thought will
be given, whatever the colour of the Government, to ensuring that at
least part of the projected Crossrail infrastructure is built. In
particular, I hope that we shall have a line that links the City of
London with Canary Wharf and perhaps the Thames Gateway, which will be
necessary if that redevelopment area is to be viable in any meaningful
way.</p><p><a name="06071968000261">All of us as
London MPs irrespective of our party have an important message that we
would like to get across to the Minister. Our voice is inevitably
somewhat silenced by the fact that we have a Mayor and Transport for
London, but that arrangement should enhance London&#146;s transport,
not diminish it. It is greatly to be regretted that the Department for
Transport has taken its eye off the ball in respect of London&#146;s
great needs, although, to be brutally honest, the same would be true if
we had a Conservative Government. How we deal with London&#146;s
substantial needs will affect its standing as a financial and tourist
centre and whether we have a viable and thriving economy in the years
ahead, all of which will have an enormous impact on the 560-odd MPs who
do not represent London seats. I hope that the Minister will take due
note of what has been said and of what other hon. Members will say,
because we need to invest. In so far as the enormous sums required for
Crossrail cannot 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 109WH</b><br>be promised, please can the Government ensure that they put money
towards getting the orbital railway up and
running?</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000493">3.7

Hillier (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op):</b> It
was only at the end of 2003 that I was talking with a Hackney resident
who summed up the frustrations about the east London line that people
have felt for years by sighing and saying, &#147;You know, ever since
I&#146;ve lived in Hackney, the east London line&#146;s been about
seven years away.&#148; Now, only a few years later, we know that
phase 1 of the east London line will be delivered by 2010. It is long
overdue, but very welcome in Hackney.</p><p><a name="06071968000263">We now have the building blocks
in place for the London orbital railway, on which many of us have
campaigned for many years, but we need the final links. I differ
slightly from the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr.
Field) in saying this, but it is worth acknowledging that having a
London Mayor and a transport body for London has transformed the
prospects for an orbital railway. I should underline for the Minister
that Transport for London has a track record on delivery, and
London&#146;s civic and political leadership is also keen to champion
the interests of Londoners. In addition, the Government have trusted
Transport for London and the Mayor to deliver on several such projects,
and Ministers should continue to support the long fought campaign for
London&#146;s outer circle line.</p><p><a name="06071968000264">As well as regenerating the
area concerned, as my hon. Friends the Members for Battersea (Martin
Linton) and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said,
the orbital railway will relieve congestion on the most central London
routes. We have a crazy system now, with many people having to travel
into London to get anywhere quickly. Those who use the north London
line, for example, find it an invaluable link, but it is also
frustrating.</p><p><a name="06071968000265">Hackney
is an anomaly in London transport terms: it is an inner-London borough
with no tube. That is reportedly because a large Victorian landowner
refused to have tunnelling under his land, although, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Battersea suggested, it might have been linked to the
geology and the clay that is prevalent in Hackney. However, we have
suffered long as a result of that accident of history. Hackney can,
arguably, claim one staircase of Old Street station and perhaps one
staircase of Manor House station, in the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington,. We like to claim
the little that we can for each of our constituencies, but it is a poor
show for a constituency that reaches as far as Broadgate and Liverpool
street in the heart of London to have nothing on the tube map. My hon.
Friend the Member for Battersea and I therefore form an alliance, with
my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, in
our unfortunate distinction as MPs for central London boroughs with no
tube.</p><p><a name="06071968000266">In Hackney we
have long campaigned for better transport links. As the hon. Member for
Cities of 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 110WH</b><br>London and Westminster said, it is great to see the bridge strengthening
works under way down the route in Hackney, where the track bed has been
sitting there for years, frustratingly under-used. Those works may
cause some local temporary inconvenience, but people are not sad to see
it. Although there may be local day-to-day problems, we are delighted
to see the work on the East London line.</p><p><a name="06071968000267">From November 2007, Transport
for London will take control of the North London line in my
constituency. That will be another crucial link on London&#146;s
outer circle line. When Transport for London takes over and lets the
franchise, the service will increase to eight trains an
hour.</p><p><a name="06071968000268"><b><a name="06071968000565">Ms
Abbott:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the people of
Hackney, who look forward to the completion of the East London line and
the orbital line, still look forward with optimism to proper funding
for both Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2, so that the residents of Chelsea
can come to Hackney and explore all our cultural and gastronomic
delights?</p><p><a name="06071968000269"><b><a name="06071968000566">Meg
Hillier:</b> How can I fail to agree completely with my hon.
Friend? Hackney will be on the map in so many ways&#151;as it is
already for those of us who know and love it. We are prepared to share
that secret, or the best bits of it, with the many visitors we expect
to receive.</p><p><a name="06071968000270">When
Transport for London takes over the North London line, there will be
real-time information and better facilities. Staffing has been promised
for stations, as well as longer and better trains, which are on the way
to being ordered. That will transform a line that is very well used,
but which, as the Transport Committee of the London assembly recently
acknowledged, lets down many residents. Despite increases in the number
of rush-hour trains, the crush at rush hour is worse even than on parts
of the tube system. It is, however, a vital link to central London, so
we look forward to its getting better, and to the arrival of the East
London line in 2010.</p><p><a name="06071968000271">All that is welcome, but we
benefit from every extension that creates the full Orbirail&#151;the
full outer circle line. People in Hackney want to go places, and, as
has already been touched on, we want to welcome people to Hackney,
including Haggerston and Hoxton. I look forward to entertaining my hon.
Friend the Member for Battersea in some of the restaurants there.
Although I do not want to suggest that they are better than those in
Battersea, I think that we can equal if not improve on his gastronomic
and cultural experiences in our exciting and historic area of
London.</p><p><a name="06071968000272">Transport is
important for Hackney, but it should be considered in the London
context as well. The population of London is set to grow by 1 million
by 2025&#151;a number greater than the populations of many cities in
this country&#151;and we must manage that in a sustainable way. We
need to transport Londoners around London in a way that is sustainable
and continue to get Londoners out of cars. There has been a drop in car
use as well as an increase in bus use, but we need to improve the links
that we have. The improvements we are discussing will contribute to
that process.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 111WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000273">London also contributes
&#163;9 billion to &#163;15 billion to central Government. I point
out to my hon. Friend the Minister that that is significantly more than
it receives in spending. It is high time that London residents got
their due. Of course, as the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster pointed out, not only London residents will benefit, but
the many people from around the country who travel on London&#146;s
train system.</p><p><a name="06071968000274">The
capital also has the highest poverty rate in England and some of the
worst housing, public health and homelessness in the UK. I have
highlighted those issues as they affect Hackney on other occasions, so
I shall not repeat them in this short debate, but I want to point out
one issue. The number of incapacity benefit claimants in my
constituency is the second highest in London: there are 7,400 people
claiming, 63 per cent. of whom are under 50. Yet the constituency goes
right down to Broadgate in the City. Unemployment in the area is still
too high&#151;higher than the national average. The transport links
will do a great deal to get people more easily into different types of
work in different parts of London.</p><p><a name="06071968000275">I conclude with some key points
for my hon. Friend the Minister to take up. First, I hope that the
Government can work with Transport for London to produce a funding
package to reinstate the western curve at Dalston. That is critical to
the linking of the North London and East London lines at that very
important junction for all of us in Hackney, which will become even
more important as it is improved for Londoners in general. It is not
yet clear whether that can be done in time for the Olympics, but
Transport for London is working on it in detail at the moment. I fully
support its aim to get the link built and opened in time for the 2012
Olympics. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can comment on what
the Government are doing to support Transport for London, which, I
repeat, has a track record of delivering projects on time and to
budget. It is, in financial terms, one of the best managed public
authorities in the country.</p><p><a name="06071968000276">Secondly, I hope that we can
secure a better station than is currently planned at the Geffrye
museum, the Haggerston station. I am taking up that matter with
Transport for London. Thirdly, we want all the routes to be well marked
on all maps. Often, people who do not know our area of Hackney and
parts of London that the outer circle line will benefit get confused
about where they are. We have had big improvements in signage since we
have had a transport body for London and I hope that that will
continue, particularly for the outer circle line.</p><p><a name="06071968000277">Finally, to reiterate points
that other hon. Members have made, funding for phase 2 of the East
London line needs to be forthcoming. It is great to have it for
Hackney, but we want to go places and have people come to us, as well
has having our own little bit of railway line on the East London line,
and we would like a commitment from the Minister&#151;today, if
possible&#151;about phase
2.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000494">3.16

congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton) on
securing this 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 112WH</b><br>important debate. Whenever people talk about investing in
London&#146;s infrastructure, MPs who do not represent constituencies
inside the M25 are often a little sceptical. It is important to use
this debate to state that investment in London infrastructure is not
just for the benefit of Londoners; it benefits the entire national
economy and should be seen in that light. I also congratulate my friend
and comrade the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, for the leadership
that he has shown throughout. People in Hackney are very relieved that
he has now taken over the North London line and that the improvements
in frequency and in investment that he has planned will
happen.</p><p><a name="06071968000279">It has
already been said that the importance of an orbital route in London,
going through Hackneyand all the way to south London, cannot
be overstated. It is beneficial in terms of regeneration and
employment&#151;we have serious unemployment and underemployment
problems in east London&#151;and it is beneficial for London as a
city. I was amazed to hear that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea
had never heard of Haggerston. I live in Haggerston, which should be
reason enough for it to be imprinted on his memory. I look forward to
having a new East London line station a few steps from where I live.
Although all the stations will be in the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) the East
London line is vital to my constituency for travel into central
London.</p><p><a name="06071968000280">I congratulate
Transport for London on the work on the East London line that it has
quietly gone ahead with. I hope that the funding for the next stage
will be made available. I stress to the Minister that this is not just
a London issue, but a national one. Investing in the London
infrastructure benefits the national economy. I remind the Minister of
something that people may forget: we have in London some of the most
severe poverty in the country. Politicians from outside London can
often be heard to say, &#147;London is so wealthy, and has so many
jobs,&#148; but we have pockets of tremendous poverty and
deprivation. Infrastructure investment is key to tackling those
problems. I urge the Minister, in spite of the tiny bit of scepticism
that one hears from MPs outside the M25, to bear in mind the importance
of the progress of the infrastructure investment, not just for
Londoners but for the country as a whole.</p><p><a name="06071968000281">I congratulate the Mayor and
Transport for London, who, in a difficult climate, have established
themselves as people who deliver. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Hackney, South and Shoreditch has said, they should get the funding for
the other spur. If the Government are serious about dealing with social
exclusion and child poverty, and if they are serious about engaging
with all of our diverse communities, they should be serious about
investing in London&#146;s
infrastructure.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000495">3.20

was worried that his lack of awareness of Haggerston and Hoxton would
be echoed by other hon. Members. There are hon. Members present who
represent Hackney; indeed, I served as a councillor on Hackney borough
council, representing De Beauvoir ward, so Haggerston, Hoxton and
Dalston are areas that are very familiar to me. Back then, in 1988, we
were talking about the need to bring the tube to Dalston and I am
pleased that, a number of years later, it finally looks as if it will
arrive.</p><p><a name="06071968000284"><b><a name="06071968000569">Martin
Linton:</b> To avoid a joke turning into an historical fact,
what I actually said was that few people have heard of Hoxton and
Haggerston because they are not on the tube map and that is one reason
why I think it is important that the East London line should appear on
that map. Although I am not as familiar with Hoxton or Haggerston as my
hon. Friends who represent that area, I have heard of those areas and,
along with the people of Battersea, I look forward to their taking
their place on the map of the London
tube.</p><p><a name="06071968000285"><b><a name="06071968000570">Tom
Brake:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
I am sure that the residents of Haggerston and Hoxton will be pleased
to hear that he is familiar with those quarters of London.</p><p><a name="06071968000286">I think it is true to say that
transport in London has improved; whether it is the lengthening of the
Jubilee line trains or the new rolling stock on suburban railway lines,
there is some good news. Some local authorities, including my own, are
beginning to consider the serious issues of congestion, traffic and so
on. My local authority was successful in securing funding for turning
Sutton into a sustainable town centre and I look forward to seeing how
it will tackle issues relating to car
use.</p><p><a name="06071968000287">However, progress
is a bit patchy, and the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster (Mr. Field) referred to Crossrail. Although I support that
project, like him, I have serious doubts about whether the project will
eventually emerge. The link that was made with the Lyons report was
very unfortunate, especially as Sir Michael Lyons was not specifically
asked to look at Crossrail as part of his inquiry. It seems to have
been kicked into the long grass to delay making a decision on the
subject until a future date when perhaps in a quiet media time there
might be an opportunity to make a not terribly positive announcement on
Crossrail. I hope that that is not the case, but we will see.</p><p><a name="06071968000288">This debate rightly focuses on
another missing piece of the transport jigsaw: orbital rail, or
Orbirail. As any commuter, traveller or tourist in London knows, it is
very easy to make journeys into London and back out again, but it is
much harder to make an orbital journey around London by rail. There are
a limited number of valued bus services that provide orbital transport
links such as the X26 bus route that goes from south-east London
through a number of constituencies and on to Heathrow. When such
services are threatened there is, rightly, a vigorous reaction and
response.</p><p><a name="06071968000289">There is,
however, very limited rail provision, which is why my colleague on the
Greater London assembly, Geoff Pope, has been vocal in campaigning on
the issue 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 114WH</b><br>of orbital rail, a view endorsed in March by the London assembly
transport committee report on the North London railway. It called for
three things relating to funding, to which the hon. Member for
Battersea and other hon. Members have referred: funding for the
upgrading of the North London line; funding for phase 2; and funding
for the electricification of the Gospel Oak to Barking line.</p>

<p><a name="06071968000290">We already know what is in the
pipeline on the North London line upgrades. A view from the boroughs
and transportation officers is that whenthe North London line
is opened up and publicised&#151;the hon. Gentleman touched briefly
on that point&#151;one of the key issues that must be addressed is
the travelling public&#146;s awareness of the existence of some of
the less high-profile lines. When there is such awareness, there will
be a sudden growth in the number of passengers who want to travel on
the North London line. The Government need to consider the issue of
funding to enable the line to operate as a six-car train service to
create the additional capacity that will be needed when people start to
use it.</p><p><a name="06071968000291">I want to
pick up on the point made by the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster who asked if the Government have taken their eye off the
ball in respect of transport in London. I hope that, when the Minister
responds, he will be able to say whether he has had discussions with
Transport for London about the North London line upgrades and, if so,
whether he supports
them.</p><p><a name="06071968000292">I hope the
Minister will say, too, what time scale will be involved, what costings
are associated with the project and whether there is the risk of an
impact on 2012. We need to know that a dialogue is going on; I hope the
Minister will comment on that and on the line&#146;s regeneration
potential, which the hon. Member for Battersea mentioned in his opening
speech. It is not only about cutting congestion, but about opening up
new areas to regeneration which, in the case of the North London
railway, could include a huge redevelopment area near the King&#146;s
Cross railway land.
</p><p><a name="06071968000293">Developers are
looking at rebuilding the stations at West Hampstead and there is
potential to reduce the pressure on the main termini, which we must all
seek to achieve. Although it is not one of the stations that will be
affected, anyone travelling through Victoria knows that anything that
can be done to reduce pressure on people coming in to the main termini
and swapping to other modes of transport would be welcome.</p><p><a name="06071968000294">I do not need to refer to phase
2 of the East London line extension, as other hon. Members have done
so, other than to say that I support what they are calling for.
However, I shall underline one factor: the range of organisations and
groups that are supporting thephase 2 extension, including
eight or nine boroughs, the Corporation of London and a large number of
businesses. They are very keen for funding for phase 2 to be approved.
Will the Minister say what discussions he has had with Transport for
London on the subject and the likelihood of the project proceeding?
Does he, like the Mayor, believe that a &#163;10 billion regeneration
programme will be a spin-off of the proposal? Do the Government
recognise that and will they therefore be able to factor it in when
they are considering whether to allocate funds to the
proposal?</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 115WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000295">The final piece of the Orbirail
jigsaw is the electrification of the Gospel Oak to Barking line, which
other hon. Members have mentioned. Has the Minister been informed of
the likely cost? Does he have a view about whether the Government would
be willing to underwrite that cost in one form or another?</p><p><a name="06071968000296">On the totality of the
proposals, if the three different funding proposals were approved, or
if one, two or three of those proposals were approved individually,
what plans do the Minister and Transport for London have to publicise
the availability of the lines within London and beyond to ensure that
commuters coming in to London from much further afield are aware of the
alternative transport services and can therefore reduce the pressure on
main stations?</p><p><a name="06071968000297">London
is the UK&#146;s major wealth generator. The nation&#146;s
prosperity and the success of events such as the Olympics depend on a
transport network that is comprehensive and flexible and that reduces
congestion and pollution. The creation of an Orbirail system based on
the three transport enhancements that I and other Members have
mentioned fits the bill and will complete London&#146;s transport
network. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be positive and
optimistic in his
reply.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000496">3.30

Grayling (Epsom and Ewell) (Con):</b> It is a pleasure to see
you in the Chair, Mr. Conway.</p><p><a name="06071968000299">I congratulate the hon. Member
for Battersea (Martin Linton) on his speech. He talked authoritatively
about the transport issues that face both the area that he represents
and other parts of London. He rightly talked about the falling numbers
of people who live and work in the same borough and highlighted the
fact that more and more people are travelling across London. He is
right to say that if the right services are not in place, there is a
risk that those people will seek to drive rather than use public
transport, in so far as it is possible to drive given the levels of
congestion in and around London. Clearly, it is in all our interests
that people should use public transport wherever that is possible and
practical.</p><p><a name="06071968000300">It is our
duty to do our best to ensure that our public transport system is
capable of offering people as wide a range of options as possible given
the limitations of our transport corridors. It is striking how much we
depend on our heritage from Victorian times. Most of the corridors that
we seek to reopen, redevelop and use to expand services date from that
period, so we should be mighty glad to have that
inheritance.</p><p><a name="06071968000301">The
orbital route is already coming about. Phase 1 of the East London line
is going ahead&#151;construction will begin shortly&#151;and we
have seen a change to service patterns on the other side of London. One
can now take a train from Clapham Junction through to Stratford, as the
hon. Member for Battersea will know, and the new stations at West
Brompton and others on the way in west London are beginning to create
an alternative service pattern that was not there 10 or15
years ago. So, we have already started down the road that the hon.
Member for Battersea rightly identified: providing people with
different transport options around London.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 116WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000302">It is clearly desirable that we
should improve service patterns in London. Evidently, if we hope, as we
should, to continue to revive and regenerate our cities and encourage
people to live in them&#151;we are a small island, and cannot
continue to build in green, open spaces&#151;we need better public
transport provision. People simply cannot drive everywhere in our
cities that they might want to. I very much agree with the hon.
Gentleman about the desirability of enhanced services and of an
Orbirail-type system in so far as it can make a difference in London. I
say that with a few caveats, to which I shall return.</p><p><a name="06071968000303">Some of the issues that the
hon. Gentleman highlights could and should have been dealt with by some
of the other projects that were supposed to happen this decade but have
not. I listened carefully to Labour Members&#146; comments about the
different station options that would be available around an Orbirail
network, and about how a number of communities who are not served by
railway stations could be so served on such a route. That is all well
and good and absolutely desirable; there is genuinely a market for
radial journeys in London. However, I am less convinced that there is a
market for people to come from the south coast, get off at Clapham
Junction, go round an Orbirail network to Finsbury Park, for example,
and get on a train to the north. I suspect that the real benefits will
come for people in places such as Hackney by opening up links to other
parts of London, such as south-east London, and by creating easier
links to docklands and parts of north London. The network would open up
places that are currently difficult to reach by public
transport.</p><p><a name="06071968000304">Of course,
some of the pressures that the hon. Member for Battersea rightly
highlighted in his speech could and should have been dealt with through
projects such as the rather inaptly named Thameslink 2000, which was,
according to the Government&#146;s 10-year plan, due to be open and
functioning by 2000. Indeed, it is slightly bizarre that even as we
speak, there are two empty tunnels beneath St. Pancras station. They
were built to create an additional dimension to cross-London transport,
but will remain unopened because the Government have not, as yet, gone
ahead with the commitment that they made in their 10-year plan to open
up, develop and make a reality of the Thameslink 2000
service.</p><p><a name="06071968000305">I am glad
that phase 1 of the East London line is going ahead, but hon. Members
should remember that it is one small part of a much broader range of
projects to ease the congestion, to which the hon. Gentleman referred,
that have not come to fruition despite having been clearly set out as
commitments for 2010 in the Government&#146;s 10-year
plan.</p><p><a name="06071968000306">Hon. Members
rightly mentioned the significant costs of some of the proposed
schemes. I suspect that that is one reason why, with the East London
line, there has been a commitment only to phase 1, although the whole
line was originally due to be completed within a few years. I can
clearly see the potential benefits of the East London line coming to
Clapham Junction; a link to Finsbury Park, as described by my hon.
Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster(Mr.
Field); and various other suggested enhancements to the route. However,
there are, of course, huge costs.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 117WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000307">It should be of significant
concern to us all that the costs of such rail projects have risen so
much in the past few years, and it should be a challenge for
Governments and would-be Governments to address why they have risen so
much. We have to bring those costs down so that we can spend the
savings on projects such as phase 2 of the East London line and
Thameslink 2000. We must get to grips with this issue: our railways are
far too expensive, especially in recent times&#151;much more so than
they appear to be in other countries. We have not yet got to grips with
that challenge, but we must do
so.</p><p><a name="06071968000308">There has been a
lot of discussion about the work done by Transport for London and the
Mayor of London, and comments were made about the professionalism of
Transport for London. I think that TFL does some good work. The Mayor
clearly has an absolute commitment to enhancing London&#146;s
transport infrastructure, and he is not wrong to identify transport in
London as a key issue for its future economic success.</p><p><a name="06071968000309">A variety of transport
challenges are building up: it is becoming increasingly difficult to
get an easy and comfortable journey into central London, and there is a
significant under-provision of transport to parts of central London
such as Hackney. The Thames Gateway also causes me great concern. We
cannot build a city of a million people on the Thames without proper
infrastructure provision. Those issues will have to be
addressed.</p><p><a name="06071968000310">I have a
few concerns regarding some Labour Members&#146; remarks about the
Orbirail project, and about some of the consequences of its creation.
The first such issue that I shall address is that of cost and
prudential borrowing. It is becoming commonplace for people, when they
talk about transport in London&#151;people in TFL, and Labour
Members&#151;to regard prudential borrowing as something easy that
can just happen. The bottom line is that the Mayor intends to spend
&#163;10 billion, raised by prudential borrowing, on transport
projects over the coming years. After that money has been spent, the
debt has to be paid. It is not like a zero-percentage-rate credit card
on which one can go out and spend up to the credit limit and it is all
fine thank you very much. We have to pay the debt off in the end. The
cost of servicing that &#163;10 billion of prudential borrowing will
be about &#163;800 million a year; TFL&#146;s budget is about
&#163;4 billion a year, so the equivalent of &#163;1 in every
&#163;5 will be spent on servicing the debt. We cannot simply look at
the Mayor&#146;s prudential borrowing for transport infrastructure as
being some great nirvana, because ultimately it has to be paid for, and
I am not convinced that he has the money to pay the
bills.</p><p><a name="06071968000311">At the start of
the debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and
Westminster pointed out that many people who come into London, and many
people upon whom its economic prosperity depends, do not come from
within the London geographic area. My constituency is inside the M25,
but I am not a London MP. My constituents cannot vote for the Mayor of
London and do not have a say in what Transport for London
does.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 118WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000312">I do not have profound concerns
about the desirability of sensible stops being made by trains coming in
from outside London to link in with an Orbirail-type development. I
think that is sensible and would happen anyway. If a metro-type service
is using an orbital route around central London, for someone who is
running a suburban train in it will become natural and logical to stop
at the stations where an interchange on to that service is possible. I
do not think that that in its own right would be a problem. I think it
would simply happen as a matter of course.</p><p><a name="06071968000313"><b><a name="06071968000572">Mr.
Mark Field:</b> My hon. Friend and the hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) would understand that precisely
that sort of mentality existed with the tramlink between Croydon,
Wimbledon and Beckenham. Precisely that linking up of a range of
different residential areas was involved. It predated Transport for
London, so, as my hon. Friend rightly points out, it is not just the
existence of TFL that has allowed some joined-up thinking in transport
matters in the capital.</p><p><a name="06071968000314"><b><a name="06071968000573">Chris
Grayling:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point and gives a
further good example of where such thinking has worked well in the past
without politicians seeking to direct it.</p><p><a name="06071968000315">As somebody who represents
people who travel into London from outside the Mayor&#146;s catchment
area, I do not wish to see the Mayor taking direct responsibility for
changing the service patterns on trains that come from areas outside
his control. It is simply not right to have the Mayor taking decisions
about service patterns to fit a particular need in central London when
those decisions materially affect commuters who live 30, 40 or 50 miles
away. The Minister must be extremely careful before he hands over too
many powers to the Mayor over the timetabling of the suburban rail
network. Doing so may allow the Mayor to achieve his transport
aspirations within London, but it will work to the detriment of those
who come from outside London and will ultimately impact on the
competitiveness of London and the south-east.</p><p><a name="06071968000316">I have two other brief points
to make. First, for all the Mayor&#146;s aspirations for the north
London line, and for improving and continuing those services around an
Orbirail route, we must be careful about the impact on freight. Labour
Members are right to say that some of the freight coming through north
London should be going elsewhere&#151;another of the commitments in
the Government&#146;s 10-year plan for transport that has not so far
been kept. Of course it is crazy that goods coming in to Felixstowe and
going to the midlands have to come through central London; that should
not be happening. However, some freight comes into London in its own
right, and if we fill the north London line with passenger services to
the extent that those freight trains can no longer come into London,
the consequence will be additional lorries on the roads. Ministers, TFL
and Labour Members must be mindful of that when talking about the
growth of services on the north London
line.</p><p><a name="06071968000317">The last point I
want to make relates to a comment made by the hon. Member for
Battersea, and is about the specification of services. He offered some
hopes about the kind of service provision that the train 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 119WH</b><br>companies would come up with. My message to him is that they have no
freedom to do that now. The rail service in this country is specified
in fine detail by the Minister and his colleagues. They have a team of
civil servants who write train timetables and set out in minute detail
which services can and cannot run. If the hon. Member for Battersea is
looking for a specific level of service on the Orbirail route or in
other areas that he represents, it is the Minister he needs to go to
see, rather than the train companies.</p><p><a name="06071968000318">We all agree that
London&#146;s transport infrastructure is essential not only to the
future economy of the city, but to that of the country. We should all
work to enhance it in the right way for the future. I commend the hon.
Member for Battersea on highlighting the issue of Orbirail, which is
often a forgotten project, but potentially a very valuable one. I hope
that the jigsaw puzzle pieces that the Government put together in their
10-year plan for transport, which would all come together to form an
Orbirail route, will come to fruition by 2010, as promised by this
Government.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000497">3.44

Minister of State, Department for Transport(Dr. Stephen

Battersea (Martin Linton) on securing this debate and on the passionate
case he puts for an orbital rail route to serve his
constituents.</p><p><a name="06071968000320">One of
the nice things that I have discovered about being a transport Minister
is the opportunities it gives me to bring people together; I think of
the good folk of Clapham junction being able to enjoy cultural
interchange with the good folk of Dalston junction, and of bringing
Haggerston and Hoxton on to the map. Another thing I have discovered is
that when somebody comes up to me and mentions a small place, whether
it be a small village far away from London or one of the villages of
London, or when they ask me about the B205 or some small station that I
have never heard of, the one thing I should never do is admit to never
having heard of the place, because everybody thinks that transport
Ministers keep an encyclopaedic knowledge of such places. I am not
going to boast about whether I know of Haggerston and Hoxton or not;
all I shall boast is that we will want them to be provided with a
comprehensive rail and public transport service. The steps that the
Government are taking, hand in hand with Transport for London, will
deliver that.</p><p><a name="06071968000321">I want
to take issue with the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster
(Mr. Field), who seemed to imply that we take our eye of the ball and
leave London&#146;s transport to TFL. TFL, like local authorities
outside London, passenger transport executives around the country and
other bodies are the delivery mechanisms by which the Government
deliver most of their transport schemes. TFL is just one such body.
Most transport in this country is local. The Government must have some
direct input into the Highways Agency trunk road network and the main
rail services, but the vast majority of goods and people are moved on
local roads and through local transport. We have a very close
relationship with all those local
authorities.</p><p><a name="06071968000322">In
London, we have the close relationship with TFL and the Mayor in order
to deliver London&#146;s transport. 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 120WH</b><br>We are certainly not taking our eye off the ball by relying on the local
expertise of the Mayor and his team at TFL. The hon. Gentleman might
feel that the voice of Members of Parliament is not heard because they
are somehow divorced from TFL, but I would argue that it is the job of
MPs to get engaged with their local transport delivery mechanism. Just
as I try to engage with Kent county council on behalf of my
constituents, he should be engaging with
TFL.</p><p><a name="06071968000323"><b><a name="06071968000575">Mr.
Field:</b> Does the Minister not accept that for strategic
funding purposes, one of the difficulties that we have in London is
that the Mayor has a precept? He is able to charge tax, part of which
goes to transport, although other bits go to policing and are spent in
other high profile ways. That breaks that nexus and makes it more
difficult for all of us; it is the devolution debate writ large. I
speak for Conservatives, although perhaps not for Labour Members of
Parliament with London constituencies, when I say that there has been a
sense in which the Department for Transport has taken its eye off the
ball as far as London transport is
concerned.</p><p><a name="06071968000324"><b><a name="06071968000576">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I do not accept that at all. Every local
authority has the power to raise funds through its council tax to
supplement the money that the Government give it for its transport
systems. I was listening to the comments made by my hon. Friends,
particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke
Newington (Ms Abbott), who talked about the views of Members of
Parliament who represent constituencies outside the M25. She believes
that they have a negative view of the amount of money that is spent on
London. It is true that many Members who represent constituencies
outside the M25 think that all the money is spent on London and that
more of it should be spent on their areas.</p><p><a name="06071968000325">The
Government clearly take the view that spending on London transport is a
necessary part of our national transport infrastructure, and that we
have a largely radial transport network in this country and it comes in
through London. We think that there are benefits to spending on
transport in London. If there is a tension between Members who
represent constituencies outside London and those who represent London
constituencies, I would like to encourage London Members to start
engaging with Members who represent constituencies outside London and
explaining to them the importance of travel investment in London. That
would also give them the opportunity to explain the difficulties that
they feel. The fact that both Members who represent London
constituencies and Members who represent constituencies outside London
think we are spending too much on the other area probably indicates
that the Government are getting the balance about right.</p><p><a name="06071968000326">I return to the matter of the
London orbital railway. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and
other hon. Friends made powerful cases about the levels of deprivation
and unemployment in London, which many people do not realise. The
Government certainly do, and we see benefit in providing a transport
infrastructure in places for which regeneration is a huge opportunity.
We see the benefit of the orbital network relieving congestion, and
alongside orbital services we must recognise the need to maintain
journeys on the 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 121WH</b><br>radial routes into London as journeys on those services are also vital
to the economic well-being of London.</p><p><a name="06071968000327">We must also recognise the
importance of allowing freight traffic to serve London and pass through
its rail network from, among other places, the channel ports. My hon.
Friend made a powerful case but nearly lost me when he appeared to
suggest that freight from the channel ports should not come through
London. Perhaps he momentarily forgot that I represent a constituency
that is a channel port and that many of my constituents are employed in
putting freight on a line that comes through
London.</p><p><a name="06071968000328"><b><a name="06071968000577">Martin
Linton:</b> I am suggesting not that freight should not pass
through London to reach its destination but that it might benefit the
channel ports and London if there were a simpler route. There was at
one time talk of a tunnel under the Thames at Shell Haven to allow
freight from the channel to reach the rest of the country without
having to use the congested and clogged railway lines of
London.</p><p><a name="06071968000329"><b><a name="06071968000578">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> My hon. Friend is right that freight currently
has to pass through London. Maybe in the future we can find simpler and
more straightforward ways to move freight around. The hon. Member for
Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) pointed out that dilemma, but the
difference between him and the Government is that we are making
investments that will allow us one day to deal with that problem,
whereas I suspect he has no intention of even thinking about such
investment.</p><p><a name="06071968000330">On 14
February this year we announced the transfer of responsibility for the
management of the rail services collectively known as the North London
railway to Transport for London. That transfer will become effective
from November 2007, from when TFL will be responsible for the
franchising of passenger services that are currently operated by
Silverlink. It will be responsible for the management of the
franchise&#151;or as I understand it intends to callit, the
concession&#151;and the financing of future enhancements. Those
matters will need to be judged alongside other TFL priorities. It is
important to pause and reflect on what that means: that a London
organisation, answerable to London politicians and therefore to the
people of London, will be deciding the priorities for London, rather
than national politicians such as myself trying to second-guess them.
That is an important step
forward.</p><p><a name="06071968000331">Of course
Network Rail will remain the owner and operator of the track
infrastructure, and the agreement that we have struck with Transport
for London does not change the status of that ownership. As part of the
handover process, TFL has named the four bidders that pre-qualify to
tender for services and it will soon issue invitations to tender.
Services under its control will include Gospel Oak to Barking,
Stratford to Richmond and Euston to Watford Junction. TFL&#146;s
aspiration is four trains an hour on each of the core routes and
significantly greater frequencies on some sections, especially at peak
times.</p><p><a name="06071968000332">Although the
scheme has not yet been committed to and is subject to agreement with
Network Rail on the 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 122WH</b><br>availability of paths on the route, TFL also plans significant station
upgrades and a fleet of new trains. Two new stations on the West London
line&#151;Shepherd&#146;s Bush and Imperial Wharf&#151;are
planned to open in 2007, with four new stations being added as part of
the northern East London line extension.</p><p><a name="06071968000333">I say as an aside that my
Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing,
Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter), who is here with me today,
has reminded me how useful it would be if there were an additional
station on the West London line in his constituency, linked to
Crossrail. I must tell him that we cannot always get what we want, but
I know that he intends to campaign hard on his
idea.</p><p><a name="06071968000334">The 60 existing
stations, including those south of New Cross Gate, will be cleaned,
renovated and upgraded. All the changes are being made possible by the
record level of investment in London&#146;s transport infrastructure
facilitated by TFL&#146;s five-year investment programme and the
funding settlement reached with the Government for the period 2004-05
to 2009-10. The first phase of the North London railway infrastructure
enhancement is expected to be completed by early 2011, and it will be
in good time for the Olympics. Used properly, the North London line has
the potential to be a vital radial route around a wide arc of north
London, shortening journey times for those travelling across London and
relieving congestion at the central London terminus
stations.</p><p><a name="06071968000335">However,
when considering such services we must also be aware of the important
role that the North London line has for freight and the contractual
rights that freight operators have on it and on other routes. The North
London line is part of the main route between the major east coast
ports, Felixstowe and Harwich, and the west midlands and north-west.
The route has been cleared to allow larger containers to operate along
it, with the aim of maintaining rail&#146;s modal share as the
container market changes. Any changes to passenger services must be
considered alongside freight requirements, and we know through work
with TFL and Network Rail that the requirements of freight operators
have been a major issue in identifying the infrastructure requirements
to deliver enhanced services on the North London line. That probably
answers the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea
about why the extension of the line around Highbury and Islington and
Canonbury, although it is only a short stretch of line, is so much more
expensive than the other parts of the enhancement. It is because of the
need to provide extensive signalling and other work to meet the needs
of freight traffic and those using the interchange between the two
lines.</p><p><a name="06071968000336">We have not
ruled out the further devolution of franchising powers, and we will
need to consider it on a case-by-case basis. We need to be mindful of
the synergy between London&#146;s services and those further afield
in any decisions that we make, and understand the potential impact on
issues such as performance that may be the result of such decisions.
The hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell pointed out the problems that would
be caused if the Mayor were to make decisions on commuter trains

engage with the Mayor on that matter, but it is sensible that he is
allowed to make suggestions about the need for trains to stop at
particular interchanges so that people can take an orbital route around
London rather than having always to come right into the centre and
travel out again. It is a matter of getting the balance right and
listening to the Mayor&#146;s ideas rather than allowing him to
dominate the decision-making
process.</p><p><a name="06071968000337">TFL
has not taken over the franchising role for the north London railway,
so we shall have to assess how that project develops in the coming
years. Orbital services will be significantly enhanced in 2010 when the
East London line extension phase 1 opens. That project will link the
rail network north and south of the river to the east of the city and
provide, for the first time in a number of years, regular and fast
journeys between north, east and south London, with services between
Dalston in the north and west Croydon and Crystal Palace in the south.
Journey opportunities will be significantly enhanced by opportunities
for connections with existing services. Preparatory infrastructure
works to facilitate the extension have commenced and as part of them
Shoreditch station recently
closed.</p><p><a name="06071968000338">The planned
and committed investment in enhancing London&#146;s orbital rail
network up to 2012 is in excess of &#163;1 billion. The Department is
aware of further aspirations for enhanced orbital services: the East
London line extension phase 2, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the
Member for Battersea, would provide further orbital journey
opportunities, but it is not funded within TFL&#146;s current
business plan and I am afraid that it is not expected to take place
until after 2012. I am of course aware of the representations that my
hon. Friend has made to my ministerial colleagues on that project and
the importance that he places on it, and the Government will consider
the funding of such enhancements as part of the next spending review,
and in TFL&#146;s submission to the Department if it TFL proposes
it.</p>

Linda Riordan (Halifax) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am delighted to
have secured this debate, in which I, and many of my colleagues, can
put my concerns directly to the Minister. My worry is that the current
review of Remploy could take the shine off many of the good things that
this Labour Government have done for the disabled, including the
Disability DiscriminationAct 2005. I am pleased that complete
shutdown has been ruled out, at least for now, but any new five-year
plan for the business must have the needs of employees at its centre.
Work must be done with the trade unions that are close to the
organisation and that can offer help and support.</p><p><a name="06071968000340">There are many misconceptions
about disabled people, among them the notions that, because their
bodies do not work as normal people&#146;s do, they cannot cut it in
the world of work, and that their work is unimportant. I am concerned
that nearly 40 disabled people employed at the Lightowler road factory
in my constituency, and many other disabled Remploy employees across
the country, may lose their jobs as a result of the Government review
of Remploy. Many of the workers are suffering from great stress because
of the uncertainty about the future of their workplace, and there has
been insufficient dialogue between management, workers and the unions.
Remploy&#146;s management needs to consider how best to become more
efficient. I am sure that it knows that its relationship with its
employees and local communities is very
special.</p><p><a name="06071968000341"><b><a name="06071968000580">Mr.
Jim McGovern (Dundee, West) (Lab):</b> I am sure that my hon.
Friend has had a chance to read at least part of the report,
&#147;Remploy&#151;Review of Future Business Options&#148;, which
was published only a couple of hours ago, and I am sure that she will
be aware that the trade unions are calling for the management structure
to be reorganised; they regard it as top-heavy. Page 39 of the report
says that substantial savings could be made through a restructuring of
the management. Does she agree that that would be a good place to
start, in re-evaluating
Remploy?</p><p><a name="06071968000342"><b><a name="06071968000581">Mrs.
Riordan:</b> Yes, certainly I do. I have had meetings with the
relevant trade unions this week, and I have managed to read much of the
document published today.</p><p><a name="06071968000343">We must do all that we can to
protect and develop the relationship between Remploy and the
communities. In a letter written to me in April, the chief executive of
Remploy, Mr. Bob Warner, welcomed the review, because he believes that
it is time for strategic change at Remploy, but many, including me,
believe that major changes have been taking place. They include the
introduction of the Interwork
scheme.</p><p><a name="06071968000344"><b><a name="06071968000582">David
Taylor (North-West Leicestershire) (Lab/Co-op):</b> My hon.
Friend mentioned that the trade unions are quoted extensively in the
report. Has she had an opportunity to look in detail at
Remploy&#146;s scenario 3, which is its alternative business plan? I
believe that a CD has been sent to all MPs, and it makes a powerful
case for an alternative way ahead for Remploy that 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 125WH</b><br>does not involve factory closures on the scale originally envisaged. Not
least, that could involve developments in the service sector similar to
the arrangements used by Tesco in some of its midlands Express stores,
where as many as 40 per cent. of staff are contracted through the
Remploy service arm. Is not that a
possibility?</p><p><a name="06071968000345"><b><a name="06071968000583">Mrs.
Riordan:</b> That is a very realistic possibility, but it is
early days for those schemes, although we must keep them under
consideration. However, we must retain the sheltered work schemes,
too.</p><p><a name="06071968000346">It is the senior
management&#146;s role to review and increase productivity wherever
possible, but not to the extent that it undermines the whole ethos of
Remploy, a business built on a history of caring and supporting its
most valuable resources&#151;its
employees.</p><p><a name="06071968000347"><b><a name="06071968000584">Mr.
Mike Hancock (Portsmouth, South) (LD):</b> The hon. Lady will
certainly have my support and that of all Remploy employees in the
Portsmouth factory. The Minister said in her statement that she would
give adequate time and funding to allow the changes to be considered
properly, but does the hon. Lady agree that in some instances that
could be a fairly lengthy period? I hope that the hon. Lady will agree
that we must avoid a concertina time frame that would destroy any real
sense of
consultation.</p><p><a name="06071968000348"><b><a name="06071968000585">Mrs.
Riordan:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman, and I shall cover
that point later. Any changes must be made in consultation with the
employees and trade
unions.</p><p><a name="06071968000349">I will list
the reasons that Mr. Warner gives for his welcome of the review. First,
he rightly points out that Remploy has proven that Interwork, a
specialist recruitment agency, can deliver jobs in ever greater
numbers, and at a cost that provides excellent valuefor money
for the taxpayer. However, money should not be the only issue. A recent
survey carried out by my local paper revealed that an overwhelming
majority supported retaining Remploy at the taxpayers&#146;
expense.</p><p><a name="06071968000352"><b><a name="06071968000586">Ms
Katy Clark (North Ayrshire and Arran) (Lab):</b> Does my hon.
Friend agree that one reason why there is a great deal of public
support for initiatives such as those introduced by Remploy is that
there is recognition among ordinary people of how difficult it is for
people with disabilities to gain employment in other workplaces? All of
us would like a wide range of employment options to be available to
people with disabilities, but unfortunately that is not the case at the
moment. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is why schemes such as
those run by Remploy must be supported, and must continue for as long
as they are
necessary?</p><p><a name="06071968000353"><b><a name="06071968000587">Mrs.
Riordan:</b> That is the ideal, and we will strive to achieve
it, but it is a long-term plan, so we must retain sheltered work
places.</p><p><a name="06071968000354">Secondly, Mr.
Warner argues that unemployed disabled people have said that they
prefer to work in mainstream employment, rather than in a sheltered
factory. Although that is true in many cases, and although that is an
ideal that we must always strive for&#151;the Interwork scheme is
successful in that 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 126WH</b><br>regard&#151;it is not always possible for a disabled person to be
employed in anything other than a sheltered environment, or indeed to
find employers who will take them on. Not all factories and workplaces
are disabled-accessible.</p><p><a name="06071968000355">Mr. Warner goes on to say that
many of Remploy&#146;s businesses are in declining sectors, where the
loss per person is high and the work experience of the individual is
unsatisfactory, either because of idle time or lack of opportunity to
develop marketable skills. I understand that statement, and I
understand the dilemma, but new factories and businesses can and should
be started in partnership with Government at local, regional and
national level. I would go as far as to say that the board of Remploy
should agree on an expansion plan in areas that show development
potential.</p><p><a name="06071968000356">However,
the management of Remploy could do even more. It is clear to many,
especially those closest to the organisation, that there are management
issues that need to be addressed. It would be possible to reorganise
the 10 Remploy organisations into three, making them more efficient and
streamlined. Further changes could be made; for example, why does
Remploy sell wheelchairs to another organisation, but not sell direct?
Remploy produces excellent quality products in its 83 factories, and it
should do much more to promote its products, instead of aiming to
change its core business. The products need to be better marketed and
sold directly, if appropriate. Every effort should be made to work with
the workers&#146; trade unions and with management to develop the
business, in order to avoid cuts and reductions that make the business
less productive overall. Interwork has benefits, but many of its jobs
are short term and in non-unionised work environments; that is not what
I would expect for vulnerable staff who need as much protection as
possible from all.</p><p><a name="06071968000357">Mr. Warner argues that 80 per
cent. of the grant that Remploy receives from the Government supports
jobs in Remploy&#146;s own businesses, although more than80
per cent. of the jobs that it creates are in mainstream employment,
through Interwork. Some &#163;90 million of the grant that it gets
from the Department for Work and Pensions is used to support factories.
That means that about one quarter of the DWP budget for the employment
of disabled people is spent on just 5,000 people. That cannot be the
right use of resources,Mr. Warner says.</p><p><a name="06071968000358">Although that may be the
case&#151;I and others dispute the figures&#151;the basic point is
that not all employees are able to work in the mainstream, and they
should not be thrown on to the scrapheap because of employment
challenges. There must be a place for the sheltered environment, and
taking that option away from communities throughout the country is not
the way forward.</p><p><a name="06071968000359">Unfortunately, all of Mr.
Warner&#146;s arguments and statistics are better used as
illumination rather than support. Many calculations and figures are
supplied by the failing Audit Commission, and the fall within the
&#147;How long is a piece of string?&#148; category. It is possible
to alter the cost per head for Remploy from under &#163;10,000 to
more than &#163;20,000 depending on what is included in or excluded
from the per head calculation, such as sites, costs from third parties
and income from 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 127WH</b><br>other enterprises. Some people have even suggested a figure of more than
&#163;40,000. Surely, no one can take that seriously. I certainly do
not. Workers should not suffer because of management&#146;s inability
to run a business. The simple message that I want the debate to convey
is that Remploy is a major company, producing real goods and services
and providing real jobs. &#147;Real jobs for real people&#148;, as
the company likes to say.</p><p><a name="06071968000360">The company
was started in 1945 to provide work for war-disabled ex-servicemen and
servicewomen. It is now the biggest employer of disabled people in the
country, with 5,700 people in 83 factories at locations including just
about every decent-sized town and city in Yorkshire. Remploy is in
textiles, furniture, health care, electronics, mechanical assembly and
other manufacturing sectors. It is run like any other business, on a
commercial basis, competing for contracts on the open market. In
Halifax, 30 people work in a purpose-built factory in Lightowler Road,
where there is a long and proud tradition of bookbinding for
universities, hospitals and libraries, including the British Library.
Until recently, <i>Hansard</i> was bound in a Remploy factory. It is a
tradition that I would like re-established.</p><p><a name="06071968000361">Remploy in Halifax is due to
celebrate 60 successful years next year. I hope that those celebrations
go ahead and do not simply represent a further decline in
Remploy&#146;s employment in Halifax. There is a difference between
Remploy and other companies, which Remploy calls &#147;the
paradox&#148;. The firm exists to employ severely disabled people so
that they can live independent, worthwhile and self-supporting lives.
At the same time, Remploy has to operate efficiently and compete in the
commercial world. It is a tall order.</p><p><a name="06071968000362"><b><a name="06071968000588">Jim
Sheridan (Paisley and Renfrewshire, North) (Lab):</b> Does my
hon. Friend accept the proviso that although Remploy requires
Government support, there is also a role for local companies in buying
Remploy products, such as textiles? In my constituency, companies such
as Rolls Royce and Glasgow airport purchase uniforms for their
employees, and I should like those companies, as well as the
Government, to support Remploy.</p><p><a name="06071968000363"><b><a name="06071968000589">Mrs.
Riordan:</b> I agree. The problem is marketing, and it is not
done efficiently.</p><p><a name="06071968000364">Many people employed in
Remploy&#146;s purpose-built factories might not be able to find work
anywhere else. What Remploy offers is critically important to them. It
is perhaps the difference between a life of tedious struggle and a life
worth living. For many working in the factories, the alternative is a
life on benefits, which costs national and local taxpayers more than it
does to keep them at work. I have seen no mention of that in the report
published today.</p><p><a name="06071968000365"><b><a name="06071968000590">Mr.
Jim Devine (Livingston) (Lab):</b> We should consider not only
the financial but the emotional aspect. People have something to get up
and get dressed for in the morning, they meet friends and colleagues
and they establish a social network. That could also be
lost.</p><p><a name="06071968000366"><b><a name="06071968000591">Mrs.

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mrs. Anne
McGuire):</b> I am delighted to respond to the debate and to
agree with the final comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax
(Mrs. Riordan). Today&#146;s report and my statement are exactly
about keeping Remploy alive and working. However, what sort of Remploy
do we want to deliver for the significant funding that we put
in?</p><p><a name="06071968000369">I do not want to
focus too much on funding, because we can get tied up with figures, but
I shall return to it. We must consider serious issues of comparison. I
want to draw my colleagues&#146; attention to the comparison between
Remploy&#146;s funding and the number of disabled people it supports.
The issue is not about the funding that we put in. If substantial
numbers of disabled people went through Remploy, I would be more than
comfortable with any figures presented to me; but in reality, although
tens of thousands of disabled people work throughout Britain in
sheltered factories run by Remploy and local authority factory networks
such as those in which my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr.
McGovern) organised when he was a GMB officer, tens of thousands of
disabled people also work in mainstream or supported
employment.</p><p><a name="06071968000370">One third
of our total support for disabled employment programmes goes into
Remploy to support 9,000 people. Colleagues should consider the report
in-depth, and I am sorry to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax
that the figure of more than &#163;48,000 has been authenticated:
some jobs in Remploy&#146;s toiletries division are subsidised to the
tune of &#163;48,000 a year.</p><p><a name="06071968000371"><b><a name="06071968000593">Mrs.

an opportunity outside this forum tomorrow to discuss the figures in
detail. If I have the chance, I shall return to my hon.
Friend.</p><p><a name="06071968000373">In a wider
context, the debate offers us a valuable opportunity to consider the
background to the Remploy review. It is important to state early on
that no decisions have been made about Remploy&#146;s development. We
have a consultant&#146;s report, commissioned by the Secretary of
State and me, to provide us with independent advice. It is the advice
neither of management nor trade unions; it is independent advice. Of
course, the authors consulted management, the Remploy board and
extensively with the trade unions, because that was part of their
remit.</p><p><a name="06071968000374"><b><a name="06071968000595">Mrs.
Riordan:</b> The figure &#163;49,000 that is quoted includes
a set-up cost for the business over one
year.</p><p><a name="06071968000375"><b><a name="06071968000596">Mrs.
McGuire:</b> PricewaterhouseCoopers presented us with the
figure of &#163;49,000, and it extracts some central management
costs. It is at the top end of a range between &#163;7,000 and
&#163;48,000. The majority of jobs in Remploy are supported to the
tune of &#163;23,000. 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 129WH</b><br>May I deal with the policy, however? It is important and it may address

about the policy implications of the report and today&#146;s
announcement. My hon. Friendthe Minister knows that about
3,000 people in the north-east of England signed a petition opposing
any factory closures, so they will welcome today&#146;s announcement.
Will she confirm that additional funding is being made available this
year to ensure no factory closures? Will she further confirm that we
have now have five years to discuss the modernisation process, that
there will be full consultation with the trade unions and that Members
will be fully informed, and that this period of change can be used to
ensure that Remploy is fit for the 21st century and is able to deliver
for those who need support, ensuring that they can compete in a
different
world?</p><p><a name="06071968000377"><b><a name="06071968000598">Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am delighted to agree with my right hon.
Friend. To highlight the consultation process, I and my colleagues at
the Department for Work and Pensions, both official and political, have
tried to keep Members advised of the process.</p><p><a name="06071968000378">Let me be frank: it is not easy
for any of us. I am delighted to confirm that we are to fund a
significant deficit, over and above the current grant
of&#163;111 million, to ensure that we can go to the end of
the year and allow space for the trade unions, management and the board
to consider how to develop Remploy so that it can support more disabled
people. I emphasise again that it is not about cutting back on
Remploy&#146;s budget; it is about increasing its budget this year
and unlocking a modernisation fund for the next five years. It is
certainly not about undermining the aspirations and ambitions of
disabled people&#151;either those currently employed by Remploy or
those that I want Remploy to help over the next 60 years.</p><p><a name="06071968000379">We must consider the matter in
context. I shall reflect for a couple of minutes on what has been said
of people&#146;s misconceptions about disabled people. I could not
agree more. People have far too many misconceptions. We often look at
disabled people for what they cannot do rather than what they can
do.</p><p><a name="06071968000380">One of the
underpinning principles of our disability discrimination legislation is
that it effectively forces society to consider what disabled people can
do. Employers have to make reasonable adjustments if a disabled person
can do the job in a mainstream situation. That is an enormous advance
over 1945, and I am sure that it is welcomed by my hon. Friend the
Member for Halifax. The disabled people that I meet applaud the
Government for funding the move into employment through the supported
network system, and the reasonable adjustments make mainstream
employment a far easier option than it was 10 or15 years
ago.</p><p><a name="06071968000381"><b><a name="06071968000599">Dr.

Remploy was to establish a rehabilitation vehicle&#151;a factory
system&#151;for disabled ex-servicemen coming back from the second
world war. It was intended as a short-term move for rehabilitation and
it was almost entirely ex-servicemen who used it at first; it allowed
them to build up the skills and capacity necessary to move back into

have presented to the House is a five-year opportunity to modernise
Remploy. I see among my hon. Friends, particular colleagues who have
negotiated their way through various situations in the industrial
world, in the private and the public sectors. We are giving a
&#163;500 million financial envelope, plus an additional amount to
meet the shortfall on this year&#146;s grant&#151;as we have done
in previous years. There is also a modernisation fund. The trade
unions, management, local communities and disabled people will be able
to say what they want. Hon. Members must accept that there is a debate
out there. Many disabled people want to work in the 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 131WH</b><br>mainstream. As my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax said, and as we say
in the statement, some disabled people want to work in a more supported
or sheltered way.</p><p><a name="06071968000392"><b><a name="06071968000607">Linda
Gilroy (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op):</b> I am the chair of
the Friends of Remploy. I welcome the meeting that the Minister has
called tomorrow morning, when we can explore such matters further.
Could I press her about having an early meeting with the trade unions,
as I know that they want to meet
her?</p><p><a name="06071968000393"><b><a name="06071968000608">Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I have had constant discussions with trade union
representatives throughout the process. As late as last night, I had
further discussions with them so that they were fully aware of the sort
of direction that is being taken.</p><p><a name="06071968000394">A statement was made earlier
today, and an extensive independent report informed that statement. We
have not taken any decisions. We are offering Remploy the opportunity
to get more disabled people into work, because for many it is the best
way out of poverty. I want to see that third of my disabled employment
budget helping more disabled people.</p><p><a name="06071968000395">I hope that we can engage
positively on the modernisation of Remploy. As I said to my hon. Friend
the Member for Halifax, I want to ensure not only that she will be able
to attend Remploy in all its manifestations&#151;Interwork, managed
services and factories&#151;on its 60th birthday, but that her
successor a few years down the line will be invited to attend its 100th
birthday.</p><p><a name="06071968000396">I know that
it is not technically correct to do so, but I commend my statement to
the House and I thank hon. Members for the opportunity to discuss the
matter today. I hope that we can continue our
discussion.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 132WH</b><br>

Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con):</b> I am grateful to Mr.
Speaker for granting permission for this debate. I welcome the Minister
and look forward to his response. I also welcome my hon. Friends the
Members for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), for Peterborough(Mr.
Jackson), and for South Cambridgeshire(Mr. Lansley). I look
forward to helpful
interventions.</p><p><a name="06071968000398">The A14
is the major road in my constituency. It runs east to west&#151;or
west to east, depending on one&#146;s direction of travel&#151;and
bisects Kettering. It runs from the junction of the M1 and the M6,
through to the east coast. The bit of the A14 that goes rounds
Kettering is known to local people as the A1-M1 link because that was
its main purpose for the town when it was built. The A14 is of European
significance and has both local and national
importance.</p><p><a name="06071968000399">Of
particular concern to residents in Kettering is the fact that 70,000
vehicles a day go past Kettering between junctions 7 and 10. The road
is now straining at the limit of its capacity. Something needs to be
done urgently; otherwise the A14 and Kettering will grind to a halt. If
any of my colleagues want, to make a helpful intervention at this
point, it will be most
welcome.</p><p><a name="06071968000400"><b><a name="06071968000610">Mr.
Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing this important debate. As he knows, my constituency
abuts his. The A14 is the main emergency route for vehicles from
Wellingborough to the hospital in Kettering, which is my local
hospital. When the A14 gets congested, loss of life can occur, because
ambulances cannot get through. I hope that he is aware of
that.</p><p><a name="06071968000401"><b><a name="06071968000611">Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for
raising that important point. Congestion is the main problem on the
A14, but occurs not only around Kettering but further along the road,
into Cambridgeshire.</p><p><a name="06071968000402"><b><a name="06071968000612">Mr.
Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire) (Con):</b> Between
Huntingdon and Cambridgeshire, in my constituency, there is already
intense congestion. As it happens, this debate comes almost on the
ninth anniversary of the first time that I, like my hon. Friend, called
for the rebuilding of the A14 in my constituency. In theory, we are
three years away from the start of works. I hope that the Minister will
be able further to reiterate that that work, which is vital to my
constituents, will start not more than three yearshence.
However, from my hon. Friend&#146;s points ofview,
rebuilding the A14 between Huntingdon and Cambridgeshire will further
add to the attractiveness of the A14 corridor as a trans-European
route, including through his constituency.</p><p><a name="06071968000403"><b><a name="06071968000613">Mr.
Hollobone:</b> I am most grateful for that helpful
intervention. Congestion has to occur on only one part of a major road
for the problem to become a real nuisance for anyone who is driving
along it. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for
Peterborough(Mr. Jackson) also wants to add to this
debate.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 133WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000404"><b><a name="06071968000614">Mr.
Stewart Jackson (Peterborough) (Con):</b> I congratulate my
hon. Friend on securing this debate and on introducing it in his usual
eloquent style.Does he agree that the key issue for the A14 is
that it links significant growth areas, including not only south
Cambridgeshire and Stansted, but greater Peterborough and the south
midlands growth corridor? As such, it is vital that the Government
should consider the A14&#146;s improvement as part of the growth and
infrastructure of those key
areas.</p><p><a name="06071968000405"><b><a name="06071968000615">Mr.
Hollobone:</b> My hon. Friend is spot on, and that is the main
focus of the debate. We were promised joined-up government in 1997, but
I am afraid that the Department for Transport needs to have a closer
dialogue&#151;and fairly soon&#151;with both the Department for
Communities and Local Government and the Highways Agency if its growth
agenda in the part of the world that my hon. Friend and I represent is
not to stall.</p><p><a name="06071968000406">Another
problem is that when the A14 is congested and does not work properly,
the traffic spills over into Kettering, adding to the already
gridlocked situation in the town and affecting other villages in my
constituency, such as Welford, which becomes clogged up with lorry
traffic.</p><p><a name="06071968000407">The problem
with the A14 is bad enough, but itwill be added to by the huge
number of houses thatthe Government are imposing on Kettering
and the surrounding area. The figures are staggering: in the next 15
years the Government want 52,100 new houses to be built in north
Northamptonshire. I asked a parliamentary question the other day about
the Department for Transport&#146;s working assumption of the number
of car journeys a year generated by each new house built. The answer
comes to 1.29 car journeys a day. My maths is not great, but 52,100 new
houses in north Northamptonshire will mean 468,900 extra car journeys a
week&#151;almost half a million more. Because the A14 is used as a
bypass round Kettering, it simply will not be able to cope. That is why
the Department for Transport, the Department for Communities and Local
Government, and the Highways Agency need to come up with a proposal for
an eastern bypass for Kettering, to relieve the town not only of the
traffic that it already experiences, but of the huge growth in traffic
that it will experience in the next 15
years.</p><p><a name="06071968000408">The problem in
Kettering is compounded by the old road network. My local newspaper,
the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>, recently ran a series of stories about
the traffic situation in the town, including the junction under the
railway bridge, which is described
as</p><a name="06071968000479"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the worst in
the...county
for...congestion&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000409">That
junction is usually bad, but when the A14 is clogged up, it is an
absolute nightmare. I say in all frankness to the Government, as I have
done on many occasions before, that their growth area agenda for
Kettering will not work unless they come up with some sensible road
infrastructure proposals for Kettering, Corby and
Wellingborough.</p><p><a name="06071968000410">I am
not the only one to say that, because the Highways Agency says the same
itself. It hasalready imposed a series of article 14
directions preventing development in Corby, not unrelated to the A14. I
also have documentary evidence that says that the Highways Agency
cannot approve planning 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 134WH</b><br>applications for developments in and around Kettering unless a solution
to the problem of the A14 is found. On the one hand, the Department for
Communities and Local Government has imposed a statutory obligation on
the local authorities to deliver more houses; and on the other hand, an
executive agency, the Highways Agency, says that those houses will not
be able to proceed unless the road network is sorted out.</p><a name="06071968000445"><p>The statutory duty is for
52,100 houses in the next15 years. There are no improvements
in line for the A14 round Kettering in the Government&#146;s
transport plan until 2017 at the earliest. The situation is the same
for other roads that feed into the A14 round Kettering, such as the
A43, for which there are no improvements until 2021. Alarm bells are
ringing in Kettering, because local people rightly fear that we are
going to have the new houses first and that the road
infrastructure&#151;if it comes at all&#151;will only follow them.
That is completely unacceptable to my constituents.</p><a name="06071968000446"><p>One does not have to take
my word for it. I have here documentation from the Milton Keynes and
South Midlands Inter-Regional Board, chaired by Baroness Andrews, and
its meeting on 22 June this year. Highlighted in red, as a top
priority, is the lack of capacity on the A14. The document states that
the Highways Agency is concerned</p><a name="06071968000480"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;that there is insufficient A14
capacity to deliver more than 3,000 additional houses in the
Corby/Kettering area without provision of restrictive junction access
control measures in the short
term.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000411">So local residents
in Kettering are not only worried about the provision of improvements
to the A14 in the long term; we now face the threat of junction access
control measures on to the A14. If they are introduced, I can tell the
Minister that the traffic will back up along the A43, back up into
Kettering and back up into Wellingborough and the area will simply
grind to a halt. Worryingly, the document goes on to state that there
is</p><a name="06071968000481"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;No
guarantee that value for money A14 capacity improvements can be
identified, or that they can be afforded or delivered before
2016&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06071968000412">I am using this
debate to draw the Government&#146;s attention to this very serious
problem. The Minister and his colleagues need to get to grips with it,
and fast.</p><p><a name="06071968000413">Will the
Minister confirm that the HighwaysAgency, North Northants
Development Company and Northamptonshire county council are looking at
a study into improving the A14, but that the conclusions of that study
have been delayed? When is the report likely to be published? When is
the Government&#146;s response to that report likely to
appear?</p><p><a name="06071968000414">I have also
highlighted the fact that the problems with the A14 are not only of
local but national concern because of the strategic importance of the
route. I have been supported in that argument by my hon. Friends. Will
the Minister confirm that the Department for Transport, together with
the Highways Agency, will be providing appropriate funding for
improvements to the A14 before 2017? Will he give specific advice on
the nature of the various DFT funding schemes that would be available
to provide those improvements? Also, will he be doing something to
improve the north-south highway network through north Northamptonshire,
including giving approval to the southern section of the Isham bypass
in the constituency of my hon. Friend 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 135WH</b><br>the Member for Wellingborough? Will he confirm that he will encourage
the county council to bring forward plans for the dualling of the A43
Kettering to Northampton
road?</p><p><a name="06071968000415">Will the
Minister consider extending the funding of the sustainable towns
initiative to Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough to assist in the
implementation of the Government&#146;s sustainable transport agenda
as, under that scheme, the Department has already given &#163;10
million to Worcester, Darlington and Peterborough to encourage people
to use sustainable modes of
transport?</p><p><a name="06071968000416">In the
short time available for this debate, I hope that I have stressed that
this is an issue of great importance to local residents in Kettering
and north Northamptonshire and, as my hon. Friends have highlighted,
further afield. I would not want the Minister to leave Westminster Hall
without being aware that the local residents in all the constituencies
represented here today expect the Government to get to grips with the
issue and sort out the A14 before the whole area becomes
gridlocked.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000501">4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06071968000417"><b><a name="06071968000616">The
Minister of State, Department for Transport(Dr. Stephen
Ladyman):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Kettering
(Mr. Hollobone) on securing this debate and making his case. I wish I
had his knack and could insist on my hon. Friends making only helpful
interventions. Unfortunately, that is not allowed.</p><p><a name="06071968000418">The hon. Gentleman and his
colleagues make an important case, but I take issue on the
implicationthat somehow the extra housing growth in
Northamptonshire is something being done to Northamptonshire by a
Machiavellian Government. It is not the Government who are going to buy
these houses; it is the people who do so. They decide where they want
to live. The businesses of this country decide where they wish to
invest and where they feel it is necessary to create jobs. It is
necessary for the Government to respond to those forces. That is why it
is necessary, as the hon. Gentleman says, to provide about another
50,000 houses in Northamptonshire. I understand that that creates
problems and that he and some of his constituents may not like it, but
it is the reality we have to deal with, and whoever is in government
will have to deal with that
reality.</p><p><a name="06071968000419">The hon.
Gentleman is, however, correct when he says that, having recognised
that we will have to provide that housing growth, we have to ensure
that it is sustainable and that appropriate infrastructure goes with
it. It is not necessary to provide that infrastructure in advance of
the growth; it is necessary to ensure that the infrastructure goes with
the growth. That is what the Government are attempting to do.</p><p><a name="06071968000420">The importance of transport in
accommodating growth is beyond doubt. I certainly do not dispute that.
Over the past five years, about &#163;70 million has been invested in
Northamptonshire through the local transport plan. We need to ensure
that that money is effectively invested in things that have appropriate
priority to local people. That is why the east midlands, along with
regional bodies, local authorities and other key stakeholders, were
brought together and asked to 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 136WH</b><br>provide us with advice on how they wanted to see the local funding
allocation spent in the area.</p><p><a name="06071968000421">We received
that advice at the end of January. On6 July, we announced
that, broadly, we want to stick to the advice that we have been given
by local people. These were local people and local organisations
deciding the local priorities for spending local transport funding. I
shall deal with the A14. It is a matter for the Highways Agency and is
part of the national trunk road network&#151;I can confirm that the
Highways Agency would fund the development of the A14&#151;but now I
am talking about local schemes that are now in the indicative
programme. In Northamptonshire, they include the Isham bypass, the
Corby link road and the Isham-to-Wellingborough improvement scheme. The
first two are already included in our approved programme of major
schemes, while the Isham-to-Wellingborough improvement scheme is being
considered by the Department for programme entry.</p><p><a name="06071968000422">In addition, since April this
year, we have approved schemes worth more than &#163;27 million under
the community infrastructure fund&#151;they include the Corby
northern orbital road and the Wilby Way roundabout improvement. We are
also considering a bid for funding the Kettering and Wellingborough
intelligent transport system, which would provide advanced and
responsive traffic management facilities within and around those
towns.</p><p><a name="06071968000423">That is what
we are doing with local transport schemes, but the A14 is a core
national road which, as the hon. Member for Kettering says, links the
midlands with the east coast ports. It is also part of the
trans-European network, and those functions must not be compromised by
developments that generate local traffic. We are very much aware of his
concerns and those of others about capacity on the A14, especially in
the Kettering area where there is clearly conflict between local and
through traffic, which often causes considerable congestion. As he
says, that is seen as a major constraint on the potential for growth.
As the hon. Gentleman has also said, the Milton Keynes sub-regional
strategy proposes 52,100 new homes in north Northamptonshire, with the
county overall set to grow by 99,500 in the 20 years up to 2021. The
sub-regional strategy also indicates that the number of new jobs should
grow in north Northamptonshire by 42,800, which is a significant level
of
growth.</p><p><a name="06071968000426">With all this in mind, this
Government have placed a high priority on investigating potential
improvements to the section of the A14 that the hon. Gentleman referred
to. In July 2003, the Secretary of State responded to the
recommendations of the &#147;London to South Midlands Multi Modal
Study&#148; to widen the A14 by tasking the Highways Agency to
undertake further work on the A14 Kettering bypass section of the
route, with the eventual aim of completing the improvement by
2017.</p><p><a name="06071968000427">In response,
the Highways Agency commissioned an options study on the Kettering
bypass section of the A14 and various improvement alternatives are
being assessed. The agency will present its findings to the Department
when the study is complete and that will have to take into account the
housing and employment growth outlined in the Milton Keynes and south
midlands sub-regional strategy.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 137WH</b><br><p><a name="06071968000428">The hon. Gentleman asked about
the delay to that report and certain alternative proposals have been
put to the Highways Agency, who would not be doing its job if it did
not take account of them. The proposals have been put to the Highways
Agency by the local authority and local developers who see a way of
providing a solution to the problems identified, perhaps on a shorter
timescale than we can deliver the widened A14. At the very least, if we
did not consider those options carefully now, it would cause a delay to
the public inquiry process because people would immediately ask why we
had not considered them. It is important we take a bit more time
properly to study the options and we may want to introduce those that
provide a more cost-effective
solution.</p><p><a name="06071968000429">I suggest to
the hon. Gentleman and to local developers that it is in their interest
that we do this study properly and take account of the other proposals
that have been put to us. Following that, if we have alternatives that
can be pursued or we need to go ahead with the widening of the A14, we
can do so.</p><p><a name="06071968000430">No final
decisions have been taken on the timing of any improvements, but the
statutory process and study work will have to be factored into the
delivery timescale. Any major improvement works that might be
introduced have to be the right ones and have the support of local
stakeholders.</p><p><a name="06071968000431">The
management of the A14 is the responsibility of the Highways Agency. The
Agency's general approach to development and the possible impact on
trunk roads is set out in circular 4/2001, which I can provide or the
hon. Gentleman can obtain from the Highways Agency website. I have met
with agency colleagues and I know that they are endeavouring to be as
helpful as possible in the consideration of development proposals.
Article 14s are used occasionally when the Highways Agency does not
have sufficient information available in order to determine a planning
application within the given statutory period. The agency can use an
Article 14 to put a hold on the application so more information can be
provided and a decision can then be made. That is why article 14s are
used, but I am loth to see them used more often than is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06071968000432">Given that
I share the objectives of Government colleagues to see growth in this
area facilitated, I entirely share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s desire
to see it done in such a way that infrastructure is provided hand in
hand with the development of that growth. I will be insisting that the
Highways Agency work with local stakeholders as expeditiously as
possible to move this
forward.</p><p><a name="06071968000433"><b><a name="06071968000617">Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for the explanation given by the
Minister. Would it not be a good idea to move thousands and thousands
of cars each year away from the A14 by building a hospital in
Wellingborough so that people do not have to travel to Kettering? There
are hospitals in Northampton, Kettering and Corby, but not in
Wellingborough. Joined-up government thinking would surely conclude
that a hospital in Wellingborough was a good
idea.</p><p><a name="06071968000434"><b><a name="06071968000618">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The primary objective of the hospital building
programme has to be to make people 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 138WH</b><br>feel better and to ensure health specialisms are concentrated in the
right way, at the right level and in the right areas. Sometimes
objectives to provide hospitals of a particular size that are able to
deliver the best possible health outcomes to a local population do not
entirely align with our wishes in the Department for Transport for a
road network. We have to accommodate that
tension.</p><p><a name="06071968000435">I do not know
what the health concerns of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency
are&#151;although 12 months ago when I was Health Minister I probably
would have&#151;so I cannot comment on that. But I can tell him that
these are difficult and complex judgements that have to be made. I can
understand why he might be campaigning for a new hospital by arguing
that that would take some cars off the road, but I suspect that health
professionals are probably campaigning for a particular configuration
of hospitals that they think will deliver the best health outcomes.
That is probably where the priority has to end up. I do not want to get
into a debate about hospital services in Wellingborough this
afternoon.</p><p><a name="06071968000436"><b><a name="06071968000619">Mr.
Jackson:</b> I am conscious that the Minister does not see the
Milton Keynes and south midlands growth corridor in isolation given
that adjacent to it is the Greater Peterborough growth corridor where
we will have 21,000 new houses. That will be almost 80,000 new houses
over the next 10 years so it is not simply about
Northamptonshire.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06071968000502">4.56

Ladyman:</b> I want quickly to clear up a couple of points.
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) asked about the
scheme in the Ellington to Fen Ditton area, further along the A14. Our
plans for that road have not changed. However, there are outstanding
legal matters and an appeal to be considered. The appeal will be heard
in October; obviously, we shall have to take due account of whatever
comes from it. When I know more, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman
and confirm.</p><p><a name="06071968000440">The hon.
Member for Kettering asked about other issues. On alternative sources
of funding, the A14 is part of the core national trunk road network, so
funding for any improvement to it would come from the Highways Agency
budget. Potential sources of funding for other schemes in the area are
growth area funding, the local transport plan that I have talked about
and the transport innovation fund.</p><p><a name="06071968000441">The hon. Gentleman also asked
about whether the sustainable towns initiative could be extended to
Corby, Kettering and Wellingborough. We do not intend to extend the
initiative beyond the three towns on which it is currently focused.
These days, we expect all local authorities to take account of
sustainable development, and I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is
