<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.&#151;<i>[Mr. Jim Murphy.]</i>
</p>



<a name="50125h01_time0"><h5>9.30 am</h5>


<p><a name="50125h01_spnew0"><b> David Winnick  (Walsall, North)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to initiate this debate, which is not likely to last the full time. I originally put in for a debate on the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003. That would, by and large, have been appropriate, except that the main Opposition party decided to choose it as the subject of its first debate of the afternoon, as it had every right to. Whether my debate on alcohol abuse and public order is something of an anti-climax because of the debate in the Chamber later I do not know. However, there are genuine and deep-seated problems concerning alcohol abuse and I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para0">The controversy about extending drinking hours has helped to focus attention on alcohol abuse&#151;the cost to the national health service, the disorderly and sometimes criminal behaviour that takes place on a regular basis and, we should not forget, the harm done to the individual by excessive drinking. There is, however, a difference, which most of us would accept, between warnings about drug taking and smoking and warnings about alcohol. The first two activities should not be taken up at all. Every effort should be made to encourage people not to take up smoking and drugs. That is not true of alcohol. I would be the last person to suggest that one should not drink. Drinking is part of the pleasure of life and long may it be so. Perhaps, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, we could have a drink to that sentiment, but, of course, in moderation.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. John McWilliam): Order. I would be happy to oblige the hon. Gentleman, but not until the sitting is over.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew2"><b> David Winnick </b> : Point taken. It is chronic or binge drinking that is a danger to health and public order. It is not by any means a minor problem, as the Government recognise. The change to what could be 24-hour licensing, or, more likely, 16 to 18-hour opening times for pubs, which is longer than at present, will increase the problems. It is difficult to imagine that there will be less excessive drinking if opening hours increase. To their credit, in March 2004 the Government brought out a paper called &quot;Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England&quot;. I welcome the fact that the Government recognised the problems so well that, before the present controversy, they brought out that paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para1">The paper gives some alarming facts and figures. Those figures include the fact that &#163;95 million is spent on specialist alcohol treatment every year. There are more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than 30,000 hospital admissions annually for alcohol dependence syndrome. There are up to 22,000 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 2WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
premature deaths as a result of excessive drinking per annum. At weekends, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, up to 70 per cent. of admissions to hospital accident and emergency departments arise from alcohol-related incidents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para2">The Royal College of Physicians of London and the chief medical officer report a rising trend in deaths from liver disease caused by alcohol. The incidence of alcohol-related liver disease has increased tenfold since the 1970s. The figure that the Government give as the cost to the national health service caused by alcohol misuse is &#163;1.7 billion. That is apart from domestic violence, a third of which is estimated to be due to alcohol. These are very serious issues and very serious figures. It is understandable that, against that background, there is controversy about whether it would be right and appropriate for pubs and clubs to be open later than they are now. However, the same Government document gives a figure of up to &#163;7.3&nbsp;billion as the annual cost of alcohol-related crime. Therefore, alcohol abuse is a major contributor to ill health, premature deaths, serious accidents, road crashes, disorder, antisocial behaviour and crime itself.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para3">We know, not just from our television screens, the difficulties that the police regularly face. They have to deal with ugly scenes in town centres and spend a great deal of time trying to deal with the disorder caused by people drinking excessively. Fortunately, at many pubs with regulars there is little disorder; people know one another and know how much they should drink and when to stop. However, at other, anonymous places in town and city centres, a significant minority of people gather and drink without any concern for their situation afterwards or the likely effect on others and on neighbourhoods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para4">The drink industry seems to be rather complacent. I know that it set up the Portman Group, which might almost be said to be a public relations exercise to demonstrate that the drink industry is really worried about the problems, but I do not believe that it is concerned, as it should be, about excessive drinking. As long as the profits roll in, responsibility for what occurs should be left to others: that seems to be the alcohol industry&#039;s message. If the Government are to get tougher with the polluter, that is a welcome step, and one that should perhaps have been taken some time ago.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para5">The chief constable of Nottinghamshire is one of the many senior police officers who have made the point that the industry has maximised its profits with a disregard for the outcome. That sums up to a large extent the feelings not only of his fellow senior police officers but of politicians, many in the religious community and those who are deeply concerned about alcohol abuse. Representatives of the drink industry recently gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, which is holding an inquiry into antisocial behaviour. When confronted with the question whether it should pay along the lines suggested, the representative said, &quot;We already pay. We pay in taxes; we pay in rates.&quot; However, I do not believe, and I hope that this is the Government&#039;s view, that that is sufficient. The industry must recognise that some of its schemes, such as happy hours and half-price drinks to start with&#151;although not for long&#151;to encourage people to start drinking as much as possible, are irresponsible.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 3WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para6">As I began by saying, I am not one of those who considers drink to be a curse. I drink, the majority drink, but we drink in moderation. The problem is not drinking itself but excessive binge drinking and the irresponsibility of those who indulge in it and those who seem to encourage it through various schemes. The problems that I mentioned are clearly recognised by the Government, so I find it very surprising that they feel it appropriate to extend drinking hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para7">Let me be clear: I welcome the fact that local councils will be the licensing authority. I understand&#151;no doubt the Minister will refer to this&#151;that local authorities will have a number of criteria on which to base decisions about applications, but to what extent they will act tough in view of representations made by local residents and the police remains to be seen. Local authorities may have the power, which is fine, but will not large-scale owners of pubs and clubs use all forms of legal machinery to lodge appeals in the courts and so on, thus warning other local authorities not to be too tough? I do not believe that it is simply a question of local authorities acting in a responsible manner, which I hope they will.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para8">If we are faced with the problem that I described, which is recognised, with all the resulting costs, what sense is there in making it easier to drink? I know the argument that spreading the opening hours will mean that there will not be such disorderly conduct&#151;that people will be able to drink at leisure and will not have to drink up to ensure that they have what they want by closing time. Surely there is another argument: that those who drink excessively will go on to another pub that is open once the first is closed. Why not? If we are dealing with the sort of people about whom I am concerned, that would be a logical outcome. Instead of going home once the pub is closed, they will find one that is open&#151;if, indeed, the 2003 Act is implemented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para9">I hope that the Minister, my good and honourable Friend, will deal with another issue. If a number of pubs in a given area decide to stay open and others do not, will the latter not come to the conclusion that they are losing business? As a result of the competition they will decide, as business people, that it is wise to open their pubs for longer so that they will not be undermined by the competition from those who have already done so. Those issues need to be taken on board.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para10">There is some controversy about Scotland, but let us leave that to one side at the moment and deal with Ireland. Ireland decided four years ago to extend opening hours, not to 24 hours, but from 11.30 pm to 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am. The result was what some of us predict will happen here; there was much more drinking and disorderly and criminal behaviour. What was the result? The Irish Government decided that the decision taken in the year 2000 was wrong, and last year they wisely decided to revert to earlier closing times. Why should we have to go through that experience of extending hours to find, as the Irish have done, that it is a mistake? Now is surely the time to consider what happened in that country and other places, and reconsider the issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para11">During Third Reading of the Gambling Bill, the Tory spokesperson criticised the Government for conceding this and that. I intervened and asked what was wrong. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 4WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Government listened to people like me, who were concerned about super-casinos. They responded to that. I am glad that they did and I was able to support the measure last night on Third Reading, when previously I had abstained. I ask the Government to listen carefully now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para12">I have not been particularly party political, but I think that this afternoon the Conservative party will be climbing, not for the first time, on the bandwagon&#151;if that is the right expression. The Conservatives have a perfect, legitimate right as the Opposition to take up issues that are in the public mind. I spent 18 years in opposition. I understand all that. I am not going to criticise the Conservative party because it feels that it has found a popular issue and wants to exploit it&#151;that is the role of the Opposition. However, I say to the Government that we would be acting wisely if we understood that the concerns that have been expressed go far beyond the Conservative party, which, after all, supported&#151;except on Third Reading&#151;the Licensing Act. Very late in the day, the Conservatives have decided that there are votes, or potential votes, in doing what they are doing today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para13">I say to the Minister, just as we listened&#151;rightly&#151;over the Gambling Bill, let us listen now. Do not let us be dogmatic. I know that she is not in a position to decide whether the implementation of the 2003 Act should be postponed. She will not mind if I say that the decision goes a little higher than that and will be made at a more senior level. I hope that the senior members of the Cabinet will consider the position as quickly as possible. If the Government are determined to go ahead with the measure, why not at least set up a pilot scheme in one or two places to see what the position is? I have explained my concerns and reservations and I hope that it will be possible for the Government to reconsider the position, postpone the implementation of the 2003 Act and then see over a period of time whether it would be wise to extend opening hours along the lines that they have in mind.
</p>



<a name="50125h01_time1"><h5>9.47 am</h5>


<p><a name="50125h01_spnew3"><b> Simon Hughes  (Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</b>  (LD): I am glad of the opportunity to take part in this debate, although as the hon. Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick) rightly said, we have been slightly overtaken by the fact that there is a show on the main stage later. Happily, that is on the same day, so we can all contribute.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para14">I had better declare an interest. My dad and my granddad were brewers and my mother&#039;s pension is dependent on Whitbread continuing to make a profit. As children and youngsters, we were brought up to understand that alcohol in moderation was good for people&#151;and indeed good for our family&#039;s financial survival. Happily, none of the family has ever suffered as a result or become addicted. That has not been a problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para15">Like every colleague in the Chamber this morning and like everybody else, I have parts of my community where there is a concentration of heavier drinking or more frequent drinking establishments. I was told when I was elected that my constituency had the largest number of pubs of any in London. I never counted them, but there was certainly a huge number. There are fewer now. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 5WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Many pubs have closed, although in recent years many banks and offices have been turned into bars, as is the case all over the country. Very unlikely buildings that one would never have imagined would be turned into licensed premises have become licensed premises.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para16">There are two bits of my patch where there is now significant late-night drinking. One is the Old Kent road, the only bit of the Monopoly board south of the river, and the other is Borough high street, going down from London Bridge station. I have to say that there is not a phenomenal problem. There is late-night drinking. At the moment, the pubs and bars generally have extensions to 1 or 2 o&#039;clock. That is generally the throw-out time on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, rather than 11 o&#039;clock. However, they have not become no-go areas. They are not normally places where people cannot go.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para17">We must be careful not to exaggerate, to take those pictures that we sometimes see of the centre of Newcastle or the centre of other places and to presume that every urban centre&#151;every place where there are lots of pubs and bars&#151;becomes a no-go area from 10&nbsp;pm until 2 am or 3 am. That is not to say that there are not areas where problems blow up&#151;we all know that, if people drink heavily, problems are much more likely to arise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para18">I remember being in Hull late on a weekend night, watching the increasingly aggressive behaviour at the minicab office where people were waiting for taxis to take them home. If people are gathering around kebab shops, takeaways and minicab offices, with more people pouring out and none leaving the area, a cross word becomes a row, a row becomes a fight and sooner or later someone has attacked somebody else. Then the ambulance and the police are called and the whole situation can get out of control. We understand the position. The issue has clearly become, rightly, a major concern of our colleagues in local government, who will see responsibilities coming down to them as of later this year. It has also clearly become an increasing concern for the police.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para19">Let me declare that my starting position as a Liberal is that licensed premises should be able to stay open, if they want to be, 24 hours a day. I think that a modern society should be able to have licensed premises that can stay open 24 hours. In cities such as London, the current regime is extremely frustrating and inconvenient. Some people work late, some work a 2 to 10 pm shift. Some work&#151;as we do on a Monday evening for example&#151;until 11 pm. Some people arrive in the city in the evening to meet friends. It is quite a bizarre society where it is not possible to go out after a meal for a quiet drink, or where there is only 10 minutes or half an hour in which to enjoy the drink. All logic suggests that we ought to have the more continental timetable. That is the correct starting point and it is the reason that we support a move in that direction. It ought to be the choice of adults as to when they drink and how much. We all have to take responsibility for that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para20">However, we have clearly run into a difficulty in moving in that direction, which is that the enforcement agencies&#151;the police and the local authorities that are going to pick up the responsibility&#151;are saying, &quot;Hang on, we are not ready.&quot; We have a clearer message now than we did two to four years ago from people such as the outgoing Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 6WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
John Stevens, and others. We have to pay heed to that. As the Minister will know, that is why I, my hon. Friends the Members for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) and for Bath (Mr. Foster), who take responsibility for home affairs and culture matters, and other colleagues have decided that we, too, now believe that the evidence is there for slowing down the transition to 24-hour opening. When we have the debate in the main Chamber later on, we will be saying that, as will the Conservative Party, because we believe that the case has been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para21">We, like the Conservatives, voted against Third Reading of the Licensing Bill when it was going through Parliament because we had reservations, so we are not making a complete U-turn. We still want to move to a 24-hour position but we think that there is now a strong case for saying, &quot;Hang on, let us wait and get it right.&quot; There are two other logical reasons as to why we should do that. The first is that, unless we are living in cloud cuckoo land, we look as if we are about to have a general election in May. The Minister feigns ignorance of that fact but there is not a single sign that suggests otherwise.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Caroline Flint) </b> : I am just lowly.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew4"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : She has booked her holiday&#151;I do not believe her.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para22">That is one argument for saying, &quot;Let us just wait until the other side of the election and see what the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;composition of Parliament is. Let us see who the Government are, who has responsibility for the Departments of State with responsibilities for these issues.&quot; Secondly, we really cannot rush into another set of legislative changes such as that which the Government announced the other day. This is legislation on the hoof.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para23">The Government came to power in 1997 wanting, rightly, to reform licensing legislation, as it had been on the statute book pretty well unchanged for nearly 100 years. We then had long deliberations on the issue, including the famous commitment at the last election via text messages to young voters that licensing hours would be changed. It took all of six years from the Government coming to office to see an alcohol strategy, which, of course, as the hon. Member for Walsall, North rightly states, is a linked issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para24">There have been changes to the legislation on how we deal with pubs and bars that break the law. There are powers on the statute book to close places for 24 hours and longer. Last week, as a sticking-plaster job, the Government announced a raft of further ideas, including alcohol control zones. They may be reasonable ideas, but it seems that the Government are running to catch up. Everybody would benefit from a pause to look at three related areas: the way in which the industry will be able to regulate the new regime; the evidence of where the health and medical problems are; and the evidence for what may work from the point of view of the police when managing problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para25">I will make some brief points about each of those areas. But first, with regard to what is on offer, we must all be careful to correct the misunderstanding about what the new law proposes. There is an uninformed presumption that the change in the law will mean that all places currently open until 10.30 pm or 11 pm will open 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 7WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
all night. It is an option; it is not compulsory. My information from the British Beer and Pub Association is that not a single licensee expects to do that. Over the new year, when there could have been 36-hour opening, no one opened for 36 hours. There will be no great and sudden move.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para26">Secondly, there will be no free-for-all, because decisions will be made by elected local councils. Like the hon. Gentleman, I support that; it is the right move. People who are elected by and accountable to their communities will make the decision about what opens and where. Some of my colleagues rightly say that we are circumscribing the power of local authorities, that they ought to have more powers And that the guidelines prevent them from having a common policy for a whole area. That is wrong. If a local authority thinks that a particular area has a problem, it ought to be able declare that there will be no late licensing in that area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para27">Thirdly, most pubs and licensed premises are not on the high street, causing grief. They are in small towns and villages where people get on perfectly reasonably and no one complains about them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para28">Fourthly, and again this is why we should not rush into this process, the Government announcement suggests, if I understand the new proposals correctly, that suddenly, having consulted for months and months over what the licence fee should be, there will be a much higher fee. It is a bit unfair on the industry to consult on one set of charges and suddenly consult over another. The licensed trade pays &#163;22 billion a year to the Government in taxes, which is more than twice the entire police budget for England and Wales. On the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other hand, the relative cost of drink is much cheaper than it was 20 or 30 years ago, so there is an issue over how we collect the revenue, how much we collect, how much people in the licensed industry have to pay for the privilege of having those premises and how much we need.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para29">I have a suggestion. It is not party policy but, because drinking is a problem for a minority, which creates huge costs for the NHS, it might be helpful if there were some link between that part of the revenue and the money that goes to the NHS, which has to pick up the tab. That would be quite popular and appealing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para30">Lastly, the reality is that most people do not binge drink. We are briefed on what binge drinking is; there is a communal definition. Given that everybody uses the phrase, and so that people do not think that we are picking up the clich&#233; and running with it, I ought to put on record that I am told that the accepted definition is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;eight or more units for men and six or more units for women on at least one day in the week.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para31">I will not challenge colleagues over whether they fall into that category, but well under one in 10 members of the public do. Again, we are talking not about most of the public, but about a small minority who drink to excess.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para32">I want to flag up the fact that we have a right to be concerned and to express that concern. I have been given different estimates of the number of alcohol-related deaths in this country. Some of those that I have seen suggest that there are between 22,000 and 40,000 alcohol-related deaths every year. I am told, although I have a much clearer figure in my head, that about 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 8WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
120,000 people every year die from tobacco-related diseases. We do not spend nearly as much on preventing people from becoming alcohol dependent or on treating those who are alcohol dependent as we do on picking up the tab when they end up in the A and E department on a Saturday night, having been involved in a fight, a car smash or a domestic incident.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para33">If we are to get to grips with the fundamental problem, we need to deal with the growing problem of young people who start drinking early. The other day, I saw a horrific press cutting from the <i>Aberdeen Press and Journal</i>, which discussed the number of young people who are brought into hospitals in Aberdeen, suffering from alcoholism. The article said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;At least two children under the age of 15 get emergency treatment for acute alcohol poisoning in Grampian hospitals every week.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para34">Grampian&#039;s director of public health said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;It is amazing the number of young people who are being carried in unconscious to our hospitals&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is obviously a great source of concern that two-thirds of these are children under 13.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para35">It is true that half of all alcohol is bought from places such as supermarkets, takeaways and carry-outs, so the problem is not the responsibility only of those who run licensed bars and other premises. It is clearly a wider issue, with many more people drinking at home. In fact, the proportion of alcohol bought outside pubs and bars has gone up, while the proportion bought in them has gone down.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para36">The Government have clearly decided that they are going to introduce a new policy, under which those who run these premises will have to pay more towards policing costs. There is a real debate about that approach and a real policy issue behind it, and it may be the appropriate answer. In recent years, football clubs have been asked to contribute more. My local football club does so. That has become common practice. However, there needs to be a proper debate, and the local authorities need to be involved. If we are going to accede, as I think that we shall, to the hon. Member for Walsall, North&#039;s suggestion, which some of his hon. Friends have been making for a while, that we pause, put back implementation of the 2003 Act and take stock, we also need to have a rational debate across the parties about how to obtain the funding to pay for policing, so that local authorities are properly funded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para37">I make one last suggestion, which, again, shows that there may be a growing consensus. We may have occasion to pause, not only in the light of the relatively recent Scottish experience and of the Irish experience to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but to see whether we could pilot a scheme for 24-hour opening in certain areas. In London, for example, there would be no reason why a local authority could not say that it wanted to pilot a scheme for a year. I have no idea whether my colleagues who run Southwark, Lambeth and Islington councils would want to do that, or whether Labour-controlled councils such as Lewisham or Brent and Tory-controlled councils such as Wandsworth or Westminster would want to do so, but let us give them the choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para38">I end with a request. This is one of those issues where it would be frustrating if the public debate became over-partisan. To be honest, when people are standing on the Old Kent road on a Friday and somebody is injured, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 9WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
those people will not be bothered about the party politics; they will be bothered about getting the policy right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para39">We shall never have a perfect society. People will always get drunk or addicted to alcohol. That is inevitable in a free society and it is the case the world over. We should not become too reactive about that, but Liberal Democrat Members believe that there is sufficient evidence to say, &quot;Let&#039;s wait. Let&#039;s postpone implementation of the Act.&quot; I hope that the Government will heed that and understand that it would be better to proceed by consensus, rather than implement something that gave great concern to the police and increasing concern to local authorities and our health services. I hope that there is ground for an agreed approach before the general election.

<p><a name="50125h01_spnew5"><b> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham)</b>  (Con): I congratulate the hon. Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick)&#151;who is moving closer to me, because we probably agree on many things&#151;on obtaining the debate. He has made much of the fact that it is on the same subject as one of the Opposition day debates called by the Conservative party this afternoon. That goes to show that there is universal concern about this matter in all parts of the House. I hope that he will take part in the debate this afternoon, and make a similar contribution to the one that he has so valuably made in this Chamber.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para40">I also welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes). He is moving closer and closer to Conservative policy on many fronts, and this is just another one. We can look forward to the day when he can cross over to our party, because he agrees so entirely with our policy. In many ways the hon. Gentleman is right. It would be nice to think that there would be some consensus across the House on such a major problem, but I am sorry to say that I expect the Minister will not respond positively to his suggestions or those of my party.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para41">Sadly, over the past few years this country has developed a disgraceful reputation at home and abroad for drinking to excess to such an extent that life and limb are threatened. The costs to the country have escalated to such a degree that some commentators estimate that alcohol-related crime and disorder alone cost us some &#163;7.3 billion a year in policing and processing offenders through the criminal justice system. We have seen this evidenced in so many television programmes and reports; in the horrendous holiday destinations where we see youngsters literally out of their minds, clubbing in places like Spain; and in the all-too-familiar sight on Friday and Saturday nights in some of our inner cities, and even some of our towns, of young people who drink themselves almost senseless, and all the consequential problems in our town centres and communities up and down the country, referred to by both previous speakers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para42">A third of people are drunk when they are arrested. A recent study revealed that 63 per cent. of men and 39 per cent. of women serving prison sentences had been hazardous or harmful drinkers in the year prior to their incarceration. A report by the Revolving Doors Agency that I think the Minister is familiar with showed that people dependent on alcohol are more likely to be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 10WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
homeless on release from prison than those who are not. Therefore, they are likely to be amongst those most likely to reoffend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para43">Our increasing alcohol consumption in hazardous quantities does not just cost our criminal justice system dear. About 17 million working days are lost each year because of alcohol abuse. It costs our business and industry in excess of &#163;6.4 billion. Alcohol-related diseases, as the hon. Member for Walsall, North said, cost the health service some &#163;1.7 billion and rising.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para44">If those telephone numbers do not alarm people, perhaps some of the underlying facts will dispel the romantic notion that we can turn the UK into a caf&#233; society overnight, which is the vision of continental-style drinking on pavement caf&#233;s that has been laid out. The <i>British Medical Journal&#151;</i>this is a statistic to add to that repeated by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about the children in Scotland&#151;estimates that more than 2,000 drunk children are admitted to hospital annually, and a third of all teenagers aged 15 say that they have been drunk at least once, compared with a tenth in Italy and France&#151;the so-called caf&#233; society.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para45">Despite the rising levels of alcohol-related crime, police powers to tackle binge drinking and alcohol-related crime are not being used fully. In 1996, some 40&nbsp;per cent. of violent crimes were linked to alcohol and last year around 1.2 million violent crimes&#151;about half of the total&#151;were linked to alcohol. However, 90 per cent. fewer people under 18 are dealt with by the police for buying alcohol. Those figures are down from 276 in 1997 to just 33 in 2002. Some 50 per cent. fewer people are dealt with by the police for selling alcohol to those under 18. Those figures have declined from 296 in 1997 to just 162 in 2002. If we are looking for further evidence, we can find it in the fact that even the number of people cautioned for or found guilty of drunkenness has fallen by 20 per cent. since the Government came to power. Under-age drinking has been virtually decriminalised. The laws that exist to reduce the problem are not being used to any great effect under the Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para46">In addition, 360,000 incidents of domestic violence, which is about a third of the total&#151;the Minister is familiar with the statistics&#151;were linked to alcohol misuse. The fear in the general population has also increased. Some 61 per cent. of the population perceive that alcohol-related violence is worsening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para47">Against that background, the Government chose to send a text message to young people asking whether they gave a XXXX for last orders and saying that for extra time they should vote Labour. Was the Minister proud of that? Does she think that it was the action of a responsible party?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para48">There is no doubt that the Government have made some attempts to tackle the problem. On 15 March 2004 they published the &quot;Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England&quot; and set out a strategy for tackling the harms and costs of alcohol misuse. I understand that the aim of the strategy was to prevent any further increase in alcohol-related harms in England. Unfortunately, however, the whole truth did not come out at the time. Papers uncovered by the BBC&#039;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme showed that a draft version of the Government&#039;s strategy included evidence from other 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 11WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
countries of the damaging effects of longer opening hours. However, those concerns were removed from the final report in March 2004. Why was that decision taken?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para49">The Downing street strategy unit consulted 17 experts when drawing up the interim report that was the basis for the strategy. That report concluded that extending licensing hours would have a severe negative impact and stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Restriction on availability reduces consumption and general levels of harm. Relaxing availability increases general harm whether through more outlets (Finland), denser outlets (California) or longer hours (Western Australia).&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para50">In the final version of the strategy, there was no reference to opening hours. A source cited by <i>The Times</i> as being close to the strategy stated that civil servants
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;drafted what they thought was a pretty decent strategy only to see it get decimated as it got passed around government departments.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para51">Could the Minister confirm that report by <i>The Times</i>? It would be interesting to see whether Ministers went against the advice that was put forward by the very civil servants who were expert on the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para52">The previous two speakers acknowledged that we voted against the legislation at Third Reading because we had concerns. However, since that debate on the Licensing Bill&#151;now Act&#151;it has emerged that the police&nbsp;have considerable concerns about the likelihood of 24-hour drinking and the increases in hours. That is reflected in today&#039;s debate. Chris Allison of the Association of Chief Police Officers has said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;While ACPO acknowledges the positive elements of the new Licensing Act&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it does have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. concerns about&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the move towards 24 hour opening.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para53">John Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who has been quoted in this debate, said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The move towards 24-hour drinking needs to be slowed down. The fact that large groups of people will be coming out at 3 am or 4 am will mean we have to man the streets to ensure they behave.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para54">More recent police comment has shown a consensus among many police chiefs that the burden on the police from alcohol-related crime is already too much to bear. Andrew Trotter, deputy chief constable of the British Transport police, says that rather than dissipate the apparent problem of unified closing times, 24-hour drinking will simply mean that police resources will be diverted to alcohol-related incidents more of the time. He went on:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I think that all staggered opening hours does is spread the troubles right through the night.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para55">Mike Fuller, the chief constable in Kent, fears that noise and other disturbance will result from 24-hour licensing. He says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;A lot of the disorder, noise and rowdiness caused by people drinking finishes in the early hours. If this were to continue throughout the night there will be more disruption. This will significantly impact on people and likewise stretch police resources.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para56">The assistant chief constable in Dorset, Adrian Whiting, is also concerned about police resources. He says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;There are no further resources being provided to the police, nor indeed the health services and other agencies who will inevitably become involved in the potential outcomes.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 12WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para57">I could go on: there are many other quotes from many other organisations and agencies that deal with law and order and health in our communities and have expressed concern. We have a problem in this country, which at a conservative estimate costs around &#163;20 billion a year. That is more than &#163;450 for every adult in the country. However, we do not spend a great deal on preventing the harms that come from excessive alcohol ingestion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para58">According to Alcohol Concern, the Government spend about &#163;1.5 billion a year on drug-related activity but only &#163;95 million on alcohol. That is disproportionate, because there are about 1,500 deaths a year from drugs and 30,000 a year from alcohol. That means that we spend &#163;1 million on every drug-related death, and only &#163;3,166 on each alcohol-related death; we spend more than 300 times as much on a drug-related death. Does the Minister think that the response from Government is proportionate, particularly in the light of the fact that she is the Minister responsible for our policy on drugs?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para59">Now we have a Licensing Act that will liberalise the hours for drinking and a hastily cobbled together package of measures to try to minimise the harm that that may do to our communities. Even the local autonomy claimed in the package of measures put forward by the Government at the eleventh hour, which it is claimed will hand powers to our local communities, is not as accurate as one would at first believe. Even parish councils will not be able to object to licences in their own backyard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para60">I want to leave the Minister full time to respond. We do not agree with the Government&#151;we believe that the proposals will cause increased drinking, damage, street violence and physical harm to even younger people. More important, there are not enough police to deal with that. The hon. Member for Walsall, North asked the Government to listen. We are certainly asking them to listen, because we think that there is a problem that is reflected in all the commentary about the Government&#039;s proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para61">We ask the Government to delay the provisions. If they do not, there will be a clear choice at the next election. It will be a choice between a Labour Government who are encouraging 24-hour drinking and a Conservative party who would delay the provisions until more work on the problem had been carried out, recruit 40,000 extra police officers to enforce the existing laws, and ensure that there were sufficient resources for them to do so. We would cut away the paperwork and political correctness that stop the police fighting crime and disorder today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para62">The Minister has an easy task: she just has to say yes. However, although she means well, I suspect that, as the hon. Member for Walsall, North said, she is not in a position to give us what we want. I hope that she has the ear of the Home Secretary, and that the Government will admit this afternoon that we are right and back down from their proposals, which would cause great damage throughout society.
</p>



<a name="50125h01_time3"><h5>10.20 am</h5>


<p><a name="50125h01_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Caroline Flint) </b> : I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North (David Winnick) on securing this debate. One of the problems 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 13WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
with discussions regarding licensees&#151;each speaker has contributed to that problem again today&#151;is the impression being given that there will be a free-for-all, with people applying willy-nilly for 24-hour licences. In fact, Government research shows that 1 to 2 per cent. might be interested in having such a licence, compared with around 65 per cent. who merely want to vary their hours. Twenty-four-hour opening will not be the norm; there will simply be flexibility within the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para63">The measures brought in under the Licensing Act 2003 will, for the first time, give greater local democratic accountability to local authorities, not only to oversee the applications for licences, but to review them. For the first time local authorities will hold both carrot and stick when trying to contain the excesses we have all read about in our newspapers, and may have seen in our constituencies as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para64">My hon. Friend said that he was concerned about whether local authorities would be robust enough to deal with containment. That is an issue for those authorities, but one of the big differences under the new arrangements is that, unlike at present, there is local accountability. No offence to magistrates, but they are not elected, while local councillors are. If councils&#039; decisions have an undesirable impact, such as more disorder and problems in our communities and hospitals as a result of their not being robust in the handling of licences and their review of those licences, they will get a strong message from the electorate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para65">I draw my hon. Friend&#039;s attention to the partnership arrangements in the part of the country around the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor). Cleveland police and the licensees of pubs, clubs and takeaways have created a positive relationship whereby, for a small fee, the licensees receive an extra service&#151;telephone contact with specific police who respond instantly. The partnership has been up and running for two months and, with those four additional police, crimes of violence associated with alcohol have been reduced by some 21 per cent. That is a good example&#151;not the only one in the country&#151;of partnership between all the local agencies involved in tackling abuse of those licences or disorder as a result of people drinking to excess. The issue is not just about licences, but about how people are held to account.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew6"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : A local authority can refuse a licence only if a responsible authority, such as the police or environmental health officers, objects; the police already have enough to do. However, Westminster council says that it will not be able to reduce problems in its stress area, because the Government have put a &quot;must grant&quot; provision into the Licensing Act. Lastly, local councillors will now be unable to give evidence to hearings despite their local knowledge. Currently&#151;prior to the legislation&#151;councillors could object to applications in their own ward; under the legislation, they cannot.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I cannot speak specifically about the problems of Westminster council, but I know that a number of local authorities across the country have welcomed these changes. They feel it gives them a greater say over both the issuing and reviewing of licenses. One reason why there is a greater say in terms 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 14WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
of reviewing licenses is that we have brought in powers to close down premises; also, if people are not abiding by their licence, we can take quick and effective action. It is a step change from what we had before; the new culture in which local authorities can have more influence than in the past is one area that I am afraid is not being talked about.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew8"><b> David Winnick </b> : But what about the appeal machinery? As I mentioned in my speech, in a number of cases, very large organisations that are not satisfied with the local authority are challenging any of its decisions not to give an application the all-clear. Clearly one should take into account that the courts may well be involved, and local authorities may be somewhat reluctant to say no.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : As I have said, I cannot necessarily predict what every local authority will do, but they will be held to account for their actions. The other issue to remember is that we have had a huge amount of publicity about the problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption. If someone wanted to appeal&#151;of course people have the right to appeal; that is a just and fair process&#151;they must justify the grounds on which they are appealing. In the same way, the local authority would have to put its case as well. But I hope we are all agreed that the change from what we have had to a system of local authority involvement is to be welcomed. Overall, individual local authorities and bodies that represent them, such as the Local Government Association, welcome that change. They have probably also welcomed the clarity as a result of Friday&#039;s announcement on issues relating to fee structures.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew10"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : The Minister knows that I said in my speech that we welcome the move to local authority decisions. There was some nervousness among councillors, but that must be the right move. But I put it to her that there is widespread concern in local government. Its three concerns are that, first, local authorities cannot adequately take cumulative impact into account; secondly, they cannot apparently decide whether there will be a specific end point for licensing opening hours; and thirdly, they will be under-resourced for dealing with applications, appeals and the like. I hope that the Minister will, with her colleagues, talk again to the LGA and to the party groups, where I am sure that she will hear those concerns.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew11"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : As I said, the announcement of the fee structures has given greater clarity as to what local authorities might expect. Councillor Dame Sally Powell, giving her views on behalf of the LGA, certainly welcomed that greater sense of certainty. As with anything, these issues of course can and will be looked at, but we do have a raft of measures giving greater powers in relation to refusal. Under the new Licensing Act, objections can be made at any time by any of the police, environmental health&#151;from within the local authority, on health and safety grounds&#151;residents or local businesses. Of course there are intermediate actions that can be taken, such as the closing down of premises for 24 hours. Let us not forget also the issue of fixed penalty notices, for example on bar staff serving to people who are drunk or under age. The raft of measures actually complements a better licensing system than we have had before.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 15WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para66">Regarding other countries&#039; extension of licensing hours, we are talking about flexible licensing hours, rather than the perception that everyone will have premises open 24 hours a day. I understand from some of the evidence that an acknowledged problem in Ireland was that licensing hours were extended without some of the wraparound arrangements for tackling disorder that we have made part of the package of the change to flexibility. That was one of the primary reasons for their pulling back.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para67">The picture presented by the extension of licensing hours is a mixed one. In some instances it has not led to greater consumption. In 1988, when opening hours were extended in the United Kingdom, consumption did not increase per head of population. When Scottish licensing hours were reviewed in the 1970s, men&#039;s consumption went down and women&#039;s went up. That is not necessarily to do with the hours; it may be more to do with cultural changes, and changes in women&#039;s attitude to themselves and to drinking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para68">Complex issues need to be tackled with regard to consumption. I do not put the responsibility at the Conservative Government&#039;s door, but since the time of the Conservative Government there has been a huge increase in the number of outlets selling alcohol. Today it is commonplace to be able to buy drink in different outlets, whereas the traditional pub with an off-licence at the side has practically disappeared, because alcohol is available in so many other places. I should have declared an interest; I am the granddaughter of publicans and have served in a few bars.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para69">The issue to be considered is not 24-hour drinking, but the way in which people drink and their understanding of the dangers, and not just the immediate health dangers. I met a group of 16 to 25-year-olds last week and we talked about, among other things, personal safety. We need to educate young people not just about the physical or medical effect of too much alcohol, but about the fact that a person who is out of control because of alcohol is vulnerable and susceptible to attack or other dangers. That is true for women and men. Things can get out of control when they get into a fight or a stand-off in the street.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para70">Our messages must deal with health and personal safety. My brief encompasses the national drug strategy and we increasingly encourage our drug action teams to be drug and alcohol action teams. We have a long-term Blueprint project dealing with drug education in schools. The project is running in 23 schools where research is being done on the impact. It focuses on years 7 and 8, at the beginning of secondary school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para71">The project deals not just with illegal drugs, but with cigarettes, alcohol and, for that matter, prescription drugs&#151;paracetamol and the rest&#151;to which many young people have access in the home. The point of the programme is to make young people aware of different types of drugs and their possible effect and to enable them to make informed decisions. We do not treat alcohol as separate from our other work on drug education.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew12"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : I support that, and we must go further down that route. Although it is not for the Minister&#039;s Department to take the lead on this, I want to point out 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 16WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that all the cafeterias in the House are this week providing booklets about the five portions of fruit and vegetables a day for healthy eating. People need the same visible and regular information, from a young age, about acceptable levels of drinking. Bottles of drink should bear a statement of the exact unit level and the associated risk. Good advertising and good labelling would mean that the education battle was half won.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew13"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : As the hon. Gentleman probably knows, the Department of Health is examining the issue of what people understand by the alcoholic content of a drink, alcohol units and people&#039;s perceptions. A glass of wine has gone from a standard measure of 125 ml to something like 175 ml. Alcohol volume can vary from one beer to another. Some of the messages have become outdated over time, and the Department of Health is actively considering the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew14"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : Then why do the Minister and her colleague Ministers not consider delaying the implementation of the 2003 Act until 2006, when the impact of some of the excellent programmes that she is outlining will have begun to come into the Department? After all, some provisions in the Drugs Bill, which is before the House, have been delayed to April 2006. What is the problem about revisiting the 2003 Act and delaying implementation? If the Minister has such faith in the Act and in these programmes, she should be willing to wait for the results before further liberalising the licensing laws.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew15"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I believe that it would do the public a huge disservice to delay the licensing arrangements that we are introducing, which will move licensing from magistrates to local authorities. As I have tried to explain, we sometimes lose sight of the much firmer ground on which local authorities will be able not only to refuse licences, but to review and contain them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para72">Let us not forget the other measures that we have introduced, such as a new range of fixed penalty notices, which can be issued against individual bar staff who sell to under-18s. We have also increased the level of certain fixed penalty notices from &#163;40 to &#163;80 and we will be raising the others to that level. Fixed penalty notices are part of a package and do not stand on their own, but they have two important benefits. First, they reduce the time that the police spend on bureaucracy, which gives the police an incentive to use them. That may partly answer the hon. Lady&#039;s question about arrest. Secondly, they have an instant impact by containing individuals who, in different ways, create an unhelpful environment in which people end up fearing drink, instead of enjoying it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para73">In addition, we intend to introduce fixed penalty notices for under-18s who attempt to buy alcohol and for the sale of alcohol to someone who is already drunk. Those offences can already be prosecuted through the courts, but the FPNs would provide an immediate sanction and a wake-up call to some organisations and groups. I shall keep the list under review and add others as appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para74">The police and other enforcement agencies need to use the full range of existing powers to clamp down on irresponsible behaviour by the industry and individuals.

&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 17WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Among some retailers and licensees and in some parts of industry the practice has been less good than we want; in others it has been better. There is a good example in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South, and another in Manchester, where people are saying, &quot;There are some problems here. How do we collectively deal with them? What do we need the Government to give us, what do we need the local authority to do and how do we work together better? What do we expect from the industry and licensees?&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para75">The alcohol disorder zones, one of the proposals in last Friday&#039;s announcement, are not a knee-jerk reaction. Since the launch of the &quot;Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England&quot; my hon. Friend the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety has made it clear that we were continuing to discuss compulsory payments where disorder got out of hand. We must talk to the industry about those issues. On the one hand, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) seemed to want a delay, but on the other hand he seemed to be making a strong case for being tough on the industry, so I was a little confused.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para76">We have discussed this issue with the industry. We have seen some individual elements in the industry decide to take corporate decisions of their own, and move forward; I think Yates&#039;s Wine Lodge is one example, and there are others. Only yesterday, I saw that another group had decided that they were going to introduce a smoking ban in their outlets, so there have been voluntary improvements along the way. However, we always said that we would come back to this issue of whether we needed to have a pricing scheme linked to persistent disorder. That is exactly what the consultation paper is consulting on. It is not an alternative to some of the good practice that is currently taking place, whereby licensees and others are working with the local authority on a voluntary basis to get the sort of services that they want from police and others. That is taking place in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew16"><b> David Winnick </b> : My hon. Friend has been very generous in giving way, and I understand her responsibility as the appropriate Minister. We know that majorities are not always right. Does my hon. Friend agree, however, that all the indications&#151;opinion polling and the rest&#151;demonstrate that the large majority in this country at this moment in time do not want drinking hours to be extended? Perhaps that should be taken into account by the Government at the most senior levels.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew17"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : Probably some polls say that, and others suggest that people are in favour of flexible licensing hours. Some of the arguments for that are as appropriate today as they were when this issue was first discussed. One of the issues in Ireland is, I understand, that while they extended their hours, it was a fixed point extension, which meant that they did not solve the problem of everybody turning out at the same time. I think I am correct about that; if I am not, I am sure that somebody will tell me later.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para77">I return to my point: is the issue one of flexible hours, or of how they are organised? Obviously, if we say that everybody will be open until 3 am, we will not solve the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 18WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
current problem, which occurs when most outlets empty at 11pm or midnight. It does not solve the problem that the police were talking about. Yes, there are police officers who have voiced different views on this. However, Chris Fox, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, made it very clear on Friday that he welcomed the new information that the Government were providing on how the flexible licensing would be wrapped around with these other protective measures. These are valid issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para78">My hon. Friend made a point in his speech about people moving from one establishment to another. Well, that already happens in the sense that it is possible to go to a pub in Doncaster until 11 pm and then go to a nightclub until 2 am. That situation exists, so the response to blaming the entire concept of 24-hour opening&#151;as I have said, the indications are that very few outlets will want to open 24 hours a day&#151;must be to say that we already must deal with some of these issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para79">Why is it a problem? It is a problem because of lack of responsibility, sometimes by the licensees and by those who work in establishments who continue to serve individuals who should not be served. There is also a lack of co-operation between the police and the local authority on the ability to tackle these issues. Of course, underlying all this is the fact that drinking in the United Kingdom&#151;the amount we drink, the way in which we drink&#151;is not something new and has existed for a very long time. We have to tackle the underlying culture of drink. That, in itself, is not threatened by the new licensing arrangements. It is a bigger issue, which the Government must attend to on a number of different fronts.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew18"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : I would like to know where the idea came from for this flexible, 24-hour licensing. The Minister has mentioned, although not by name, J.D. Wetherspoon, which has bravely made its decision to go for smoke-free zones. The chairman of Wetherspoon, however, said&#151;I will not read the first part of the quote because it is not very complimentary to the Home Office&#151;that certain people
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;in the Home Office thought it would be sexy to go for 24-hour licensing. It was never an idea that emerged from pubs. To me, this all seems like last-minute chaos.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para80">If there was no demand from the industry, from where did the demand come that has resulted in this legislation, which even a leading member of the alcohol industry describes as &quot;last-minute chaos&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew19"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I have not read that quote. He is entitled to his opinion. The measures that we are taking are part of an ongoing discussion about how to tackle the excessive use of alcohol. We see that as an ongoing responsibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para81">When we launched the &quot;Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England&quot; we said that we would come back on a number of points, particularly on what should be paid by those who contribute to disorder as a result of alcohol. Those issues were part of a review of licensing arrangements&#151;in exactly the same way, I presume, as when a previous Government reviewed the opening hours in 1988&#151;to examine how our communities are affected and how licensing is arranged.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 19WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para82">Fundamentally, the issue is not about a carte blanche for 24-hour opening, but about variable licensing hours. What suits one community may not suit another. Alongside that will be more rigour, so that local authorities can have more of a say, and, importantly, powers for the police to deal effectively and quickly with the excessive use of alcohol.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para83">My hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, North also mentioned promotions. That is another aspect on which we have said that we will continue to consult. It is clear that some promotions in certain quarters are irresponsible. I met a group of young people the other week and we talked about promotions such as the one that allows a woman to drink for free if a man brings her, and speed drinking, where people drink as much as they can in an hour or two for half the price.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para84">We feel that such promotions are irresponsible and must be dealt with. That is not to say that we are trying to limit price&#151;there is an issue of price competition&#151;but there is a world of difference between that and some of the irresponsible promotions of recent years. Such promotions&#151;where people drink as quickly as they can in a short space, often very alcoholic drinks indeed&#151;add to the problem. We are supporting the British Beer and Pub Association and others in the development of guidance to owners and operators that we hope will do away with such irresponsible drinks promotions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para85">Let us not forget that our measures are not confined to the pubs, clubs and restaurants that sell drink. We are also talking about tougher measures for other outlets that sell drink, whether they be supermarkets or corner shops. They, too, should have responsibilities in relation to under-age drinking and selling drink to people who have had too much. We must consider the wider community and how drink impacts on different areas.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew20"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : The Minister knows&#151;I have said it more than once&#151;that it would be right for us to move as a country, as Scotland has done, to more flexible licensing hours, which is the phrase that people need to understand. However, because the Government have taken from 1997 to this year to honour the commitment to do that, there is every merit in considering the whole debate in the round. Rather than&#151;as was done last week&#151;announcing measures to deal with abuses that cannot possibly be law and implemented before November, let alone February, when licensing authorities will start the process, we should put everything on hold. That way we can bring together the payment regime, further proposals for controlling people who abuse the system&#151;both after consultation&#151;and then the implementation. That must now be the logic of the Government&#039;s position.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew21"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I have to differ with the hon. Gentleman. It is vital that we get under way the measures that will come into force on local authorities and on licensing . Local authorities throughout the country have been gearing up for the changes. It would be a retrograde step to say, &quot;Well, sorry, but we&#039;re going to put that on ice, pending other issues.&quot; Of course those other issues are important, but they should not necessarily prohibit us from moving forward on the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 20WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
licensing arrangements, bearing in mind that, aside from what was announced on Friday, we have tougher licensing arrangements&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew22"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : But they will not be in force.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew23"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : Hang on a second. Tougher licensing arrangements will come into force in the near future and there will be fixed penalty notices; they already exist for a number of offences. We have the support of the police forces throughout the country to work in partnership with local authorities and others to tackle the problem, and finally, we have good examples from the industry of what it is prepared to do to put its own house in order.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para86">We are looking at further measures, and by announcing those we are warning the industry and others about the changes. There is an opportunity for them to see the writing on the wall and to do more than they are doing to tackle the problems that exist in communities. There are some positive examples of that, but some are not so positive and need to be addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para87">With regard to the balance sheet, there are a range of policies and areas in which we can tackle the problem. At the heart of that are the new licensing arrangements, which create democratic accountability for the first time in the issuing of those licences, giving the community a say that it clearly did not have before. We must continue to build up the resources available for treatment for those who have binge-drinking problems&#151;there is a difference between that and chronic alcoholism&#151;and we are doing that as well.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew24"><b> Mrs. Gillan </b> : The Minister is giving way generously. Did I hear her correctly? Is she saying that this is not the end of the story and that the Home Office, or the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, have further proposals on their desk, which they are about to spring on the unsuspecting public, local councils or industry? If so, when can we expect to see them? Or is she threatening the industry by saying, &quot;There is definitely going to be a levy, but we are acting step by step and quietly because we are moving towards an election&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew25"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : No, the hon. Lady is twisting my words. It is quite clear that the existing powers are there to be used, and can be used in a better way throughout the country. The new licensing arrangements are coming in and the consultation document on Friday made the Government&#039;s policy clear.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para88">I said that it is not the end of the story because Members have raised several issues about how we tackle the culture of drinking in this country. Consideration must be given to projects such as Blueprint, which I mentioned earlier, and to looking at the information we give to young people, whether that is clinical information relating to ill health or information about personal safety. We are having ongoing discussions on those matters with regard to public health and people&#039;s responsibility for their actions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para89">On the question of domestic violence, I would say that alcohol is often a factor, but I strongly believe that one of the reasons why more cases of domestic violence have been brought to the courts is that the Government have, for the first time, tried to remove the obstacles 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 21WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
preventing those cases from coming to court. A rise in the number of arrests for domestic violence in itself is not a bad thing.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew26"><b> Simon Hughes </b> : Why?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew27"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : Because we are finding ways in which those matters can be brought to court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h01_para90">As in all areas of public policy, we are mindful of what is happening. We have to deal with an underlying cultural issue, but the issue of flexible hours will not necessarily make that situation worse.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew28"><b> David Winnick </b> : It will not make it better.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew29"><b> Caroline Flint </b> : I think it will make it better in a number of cases, but it has to be supported by good local working partnerships. At the end of the day, we can pass laws here, but they are implemented on the ground. That is why we see very good practice in some parts of the country, and we should expect all parts of the country to aspire to that.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h01_spnew30"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I do not wish to enter into the debate, but it being the anniversary of Robert Burns&#039; birth, I have to observe that he wrote a prayer to the Scotch Members of this House, objecting to the proposal to increase duty on whisky.

<a name="50125h02_time0"><h5>10.57 am</h5>


<p><a name="50125h02_spnew0"><b> Sandra Osborne  (Ayr)</b>  (Lab): I very much welcome the opportunity to raise the vital issues of the legacy of Scotland&#039;s national bard, Robert Burns, and the urgent need for funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. I know that they are also close to your heart, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I look forward to hearing your &quot;Immortal Memory&quot; later in the week. I am sure that you will be very interested in my reply to the &quot;Toast to the Lassies&quot;, and I had to be careful not to bring one of those speeches with me this morning. It might have been a wee bit more amusing than what I am about to say, but it would not have addressed the serious issues that, unfortunately, I have to raise.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h02_spnew1"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. John McWilliam): Order. If the hon. Lady had done that, I might have been responding to the debate, rather than the Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h02_spnew2"><b> Sandra Osborne </b> : Thank you.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para0">Today, as I speak, Burns clubs all over the world are celebrating the birth of this great poet and song collector. No doubt all kinds of over-the-top sentimentality will be on display, but kailyard parochialism has little or nothing to do with the real Burns, who is a far more substantial figure than that. His place in the Scottish consciousness is unique; he has been described as Caledonia&#039;s bard, natural man, a many-sided genius, the heaven-taught ploughman, the noble savage, a man of the resistance, a national hero and even a national myth. His name has become synonymous with Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para1">Life levels all men, but death reveals the eminent. Burns captured the soul of Scotland, and his name is entitled to the respect of posterity. He may have died a poor man, but he has immeasurably enriched the world. On this day, we do not remember a departed memory, but honour a living, life-enhancing presence. When Scotland forgets Burns, history will forget Scotland. It would be to our eternal shame if we ever allowed that to happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para2">Among his faults and virtues, Burns had a common touch, warm humour, vigour, humanity, a universal message and profound common sense. I want to quote some famous words by him, although I hesitate to do so, because when the Deputy Prime Minister visited Burns cottage&#151;we were very pleased to see him&#151;and he was asked to read a poem by Robert Burns, he refrained from doing so because he said that it takes him all his time to master the English language, let alone lowland Scots. I do not know whether the Minister will treat us to a Burns poem later, but in the meantime, as I said, Burns&#039;s profound common sense is encapsulated in these famous words:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;O wad some Pow&#039;r the giftie gie us</p>

<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 23WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para4">Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you will agree that those words are of great benefit to every Member of this House, both individually and collectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para5">There could not have been a better time to secure this important debate because, as we meet in our convivial gatherings at this time of year to celebrate Burns&#039;s life and works and to toast his immortal memory, there are pressing matters that we should consider if we are properly to secure his physical legacy in the west of Scotland, specifically in the place of his birth&#151;Alloway, just outside Ayr. Alloway is in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes), who is disappointed that he is unable to attend today&#039;s debate. Hon. Members may be aware that his wife is ill. My right hon. Friend is a member of the Burns Trust. In my role as Member of Parliament for Ayr, I also declare an interest in the trust as a trustee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para6">The debate is timely, not only because it is taking place on Burns day but because his legacy has recently seemed to be under threat. I want to provide the House with some background to the issue before seeking some reassurances from the Minister on lottery funding. The problem is a long-term one that should have been sorted out decades ago, not just in the last couple of months, as some who have spied an opportunity to jump on a political bandwagon are making out. Some of those people have not taken one iota of interest in Burns, apart from attending the occasional supper. The local councillor for Alloway, Robin Reid, who has suddenly become vocal in complaining, is, like me, a trustee. However, to my recollection he has not attended any of the regular trustees&#039; meetings since I joined in 1997. Burns would, I am sure, have looked with irony at much of the present hypocritical posturing. No doubt he would have written a poem about it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para7">I note that my predecessor, Phil Gallie, has acknowledged that efforts have been made during the years to preserve and develop the Burns national heritage park as a tourist attraction. I join him in paying tribute to people such as Douglas Hemming and our lord lieutenant, Major Richard Henderson, as well as to the local councils in Ayrshire. All have strived to preserve and develop the park but they have done so against the odds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para8">My opinion is that, instead of building the Tam O&#039;Shanter experience, which is really just a caf&#233; and gift shop, the money should have been invested directly in the historic buildings and artefacts and in preserving the physical heritage of Burns. Only a small proportion of the people who go to the caf&#233; and visitor centre visit Burns cottage, so although it gains some income it is not succeeding in attracting tourists to Burns, nor is the income anything like enough to meet the needs of such an important national treasure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para9">However, hindsight is a wonderful thing. My point is that we should have had a properly funded and supported national strategy to preserve the legacy of one of our most important historical figures many years ago.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h02_spnew3"><b> Angus Robertson  (Moray)</b>  (SNP): I agree entirely with the hon. Lady and with her sentiments about the importance of the legacy of Burns, not just to Scotland 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 24WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
but around the world. She is right to talk about a national strategy, but why, with a Labour-run council, Labour-run Scottish Executive and Labour-run UK Government, do we not have one?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h02_spnew4"><b> Sandra Osborne </b> : As I shall explain later, successive councils, both Tory and Labour, have tried hard with limited resources to support the legacy of Robert Burns. Also, the Scottish Executive have supported the funding for the last three years. I do not accept that they have not been proactive in the situation, and they are about to be much more proactive. Where I do agree with the hon. Gentleman is that Westminster has failed the legacy of Burns for many decades. As I suggested, it is a long-term problem. It did not just spring up last week. It should not fall to individual local authorities, trusts or Burns organisations to work in isolation to preserve the heritage, but that is the somewhat causal approach that has characterised the situation for far too long.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para10">I am no nationalist, as the House will be aware, but without, I hope, sounding too paranoid, I do not think that anyone in the House could foresee a situation in which Shakespeare&#039;s birthplace and places associated with his legacy would be neglected or would fail to be recognised as of national importance. To be even more parochial, if I am honest I think that if Burns had been born in Edinburgh instead of Ayrshire, it would also have been a totally different story.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para11">In many ways, it gives me great pleasure to say that it is with the Scottish Executive that we are seeing not only a quick response to the current problems, but a long-term commitment to evolving a coherent strategy for the future, which has been sorely needed for so long. My task today is to ensure that the Heritage Lottery Fund is recognised as a potential source of funding and that it operates in a way that can proactively protect our heritage, along with Historic Scotland and other Government bodies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para12">The Burns national heritage park is made up of the cottage where he was born, the museum, the monument and gardens, the manuscripts and memorabilia, the Tam O&#039;Shanter experience, which once exhibited a recreation of that famous poem, Alloway kirkyard and the Brig O&#039;Doon. It is all contained in a beautiful setting in the village of Alloway. It is vital that that setting is preserved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para13">The heritage park is managed by a joint board on which three partners&#151;South Ayrshire council, the Burns monument trustees, of whom I am one, and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire&#151;are represented. Based on previous consultancy reports, the original commercial aim was that the heritage park would be financially self-sufficient after its first few years of operation. That never happened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para14">I think that it would be of benefit if I outlined briefly where we are at the moment and how our problems came about. The Tam O&#039;Shanter experience is owned by the council and for some time it has been its intention to lease it to a commercial operator. In so doing, it was responding to a request from the joint board. It was thought that that could provide an opportunity for capital investment and for an ongoing revenue stream. The council planned to reinvest the income from the lease in the upkeep of the park as part of a service-level agreement. That is not new and has been in the public domain for at least the past couple of years, if not longer.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 25WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para15">In so doing, the council was treating the trust in the same manner as every other voluntary organisation. The purpose of such agreements, as hon. Members will know, is to determine the level of service delivered in return for financial support from the taxpayer, and to ensure that outcomes can be measured and acceptable standards maintained. That will be familiar to hon. Members as part of the best value regime and is all within the thrust of Government policy to follow the public pound. Councils are measured in terms of how they spend public money and the quality of services that they deliver. Service-level agreements are an extension of that, in that councils are charged with the responsibility of following the public pound to ensure that external organisations give value for public money and are measured as stringently as councils themselves. That is as important for preserving our heritage as it is for providing services to people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para16">However, that is a tall order for many organisations and the problem is that the trust is a very different entity from most other voluntary organisations. Its constitution is a complicated and aged document, drawn up at a time when it was seen as appropriate to set up bodies that were basically made up of the local gentry&#151;the great and the good, such as the lord lieutenant, the sheriff principal and elected representatives&#151;whether or not they had the time, expertise or interest required. In recent years the trust managed to recruit some more appropriate volunteers, but the constitution meant that the trustees would be held jointly and severally liable for financial problems. That became a major problem when a multi-million pound project was involved, so advice was sought about dissolving the trust and setting up a new management structure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para17">It is my understanding that at that time the National Trust for Scotland was not interested in taking over, although it was clear that a national body was required. At the same time, there was an increasing problem with preserving precious artefacts. A report produced last April by the national Burns collections project showed that 35 per cent. of the existing Burns collection is stored in the Burns cottage museum in an uncontrolled environment. I am sorry to inform the Chamber that the original manuscript of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is currently held in Edinburgh for that reason. I am sure that the Chamber will realise not only the financial importance of the document, but its importance as Burns&#039;s legacy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para18">Artefacts have been held in an uncontrolled environment for many years. That cannot be allowed to continue. Little or no support was provided over the years by any national body until the Executive stepped in three years ago with short-term funding. That cannot be allowed to continue either.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para19">I am going into some detail about how we got to where we are now partly because there have been deliberate misrepresentations, particularly about South Ayrshire council, but also because I believe that there are important lessons to be learned. Local bodies cannot in isolation take responsibility for sites and collections of such national significance as the heritage of Robert Burns. I might add that his birthplace is by no means the only important Burns legacy in south-west Scotland. A proper strategy is required for them all.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 26WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para20">As I have said, work has already been done to establish a new Burns museum at Alloway that would preserve the Burns collection to modern standards and greatly enhance tourist potential. One application has been made for lottery funding, which was rejected, and a second was withdrawn with a view to resubmission when a new management structure was established.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para21">Given the scenario, I would contend that it was perfectly clear to all that that structure was needed if the project was to succeed. It could not possibly have escaped the notice of our national heritage bodies, but they did not see it as their role at either a civil service or quango level to intervene in a proactive manner that could address the problem. I do not suggest that anything other than good professional advice was given about the merits of the designs or the business plans, but only latterly were there discussions about the structure of the management, which appeared to be caused by the council not being prepared to underwrite the costs. That was never a feasible proposition. Councils today are simply not in a position to take on multi-million pound projects in such a way. In any case, as I have tried to make clear, there should be a national input.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para22">The Minister may be about to tell me that it is not the role of the lottery heritage board to intervene and suggest that the project is of national significance and should be run on a national basis. The Heritage Lottery Fund, not local councils, largely funds our national historic assets today and, along with bodies such as Historic Scotland, is charged with the responsibility of preserving our heritage. I suggest that a more proactive approach, with powers if necessary, is required at some level. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para23">I pay tribute to the Scottish Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Patricia Ferguson, not only because she was instrumental in organising the campaign that got me elected in 1997, but because she has provided the political will&#151;lacking for so long at a national level&#151;to give Robert Burns the recognition that he deserves. She has backed that up by speedy action. When I met her before Christmas, along with my colleague Cathy Jamieson, the MSP who represents Alloway, Patricia Ferguson immediately informed us of her determination that the homecoming of the Scottish diaspora, planned for the 250th anniversary of Burns&#039;s birth in 2009, will centre around the Burns national heritage park in Ayrshire. That has not always been the case; in the past, it would have been far more likely to be centred in Edinburgh. I was delighted to hear it, and I hope that hon. Members who are Scottish but represent seats elsewhere&#151;such as yourself, Mr. Deputy Speaker&#151;will join us in the celebrations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para24">Plans are already under way and have pointed up the need for a national strategy. The Executive will fund the work needed, but it is clear that a firm central direction is needed. Patricia Ferguson MSP has made &#163;50,000 available in the short term; yesterday I met her, South Ayrshire council and Scottish Enterprise to begin planning the future, which includes the possibility that the whole park will be taken over by the National Trust for Scotland. It is a solution favoured by most, and South Ayrshire council yesterday indicated its willingness to go along with that solution. It is likely to include a submission to the lottery fund for a museum to be ready in plenty of time for 2009.

<p>
<a name="50125h02_para25">At last we are moving in the right direction to secure the Burns legacy, which is so richly deserved. On Burns day, in celebration of his immortal memory, I ask that we all&#151;not just in Scotland, but in the UK and throughout the world&#151;pay tribute to Scotland&#039;s national bard, not just with words but with action.
</p>



<a name="50125h02_time1"><h5>11.17 am</h5>


<p><a name="50125h02_spmin0"><b>The Minister for the Arts  (Estelle Morris) </b> : May I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Sandra Osborne) more than usual on securing the debate on the most appropriate day for it? As one of the few non-Scots in the Chamber, I also wish everyone a happy Burns day and pay tribute to Robert Burns. My hon. Friend naturally talked about his Scottish heritage and contribution to Scottish culture and history. I want to recognise that his work went way beyond the country boundaries. Although the Scots own him in the best sense of the word, his contribution has been felt throughout all continents. As we approach the celebration of 250 years of his birth in 2009, I think that above all things he has certainly stood the test of time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para26">Indeed Burns&#039;s words of wisdom, particularly about poverty and disadvantage&#151;and the emotions which he had the ability to portray in anger at those things&#151;have not lost their relevance, although I suppose the geography of where those feelings are more apt changes with time. So, although we talk of celebrating his history, of a memorial and of paying tribute to the past, one main reason for needing to do all that is the wisdom of his words in the present&#151;wisdom which I am sure will continue into the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para27">This is a difficult debate for me in some ways. There are areas over which I have responsibility, and areas over which I do not. Of course I want to acknowledge that the Heritage Lottery Fund has a role to play. That will be the main comment I want to make. Before that, however, I welcome the contribution that the Scottish Executive have now made; only last week, they announced a grant of &#163;50,000, which my hon. Friend rightly said was short-term funding. From what I have read, it will not survive in that form; it will be covering the ongoing year-on-year costs. It is not a real investment to keep the park steady and there must, I suspect, be a joining together of financial forces to bring into reality the dream to which she referred.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para28">I shall therefore talk briefly about the Heritage Lottery Fund, because hon. Members will know that it is a national UK body. Although our Department has no responsibility for culture in Scotland&#151;nor should it&#151;we do have an overseeing purpose regarding the HLF. To make matters even more complicated, the HLF is itself independent of Government&#151;so in some ways I feel twice removed from the issue about which we are talking. None the less, I accept a responsibility to keep a careful eye on what is going on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para29">The HLF has had a relationship with the Burns national heritage park over the years. I reviewed it for the debate and it was clear that it had been an up-and-down relationship. There have been seven applications for HLF funding since February 1997, and the pattern is that small ones were granted and large ones were turned down. It is good news that in 1996 just over &#163;65,000 was 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 28WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
granted for repairs; in 2000 just over &#163;98,000 was granted for a curator to help with preparation of a bid; and in 2003 just over &#163;49,000 was granted for project planning for the redevelopment of the cottage museum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para30">However, the applications that were turned down were of far greater monetary value. There were applications for &#163;1 million in June 1998, for &#163;1.25&nbsp;million in December 2002, and for more than &#163;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million in December 2004, although that was withdrawn. Those big bids tended to be withdrawn rather than turned down. That told me, as I looked through the HLF applications, that the HLF was not unwilling to engage with the Scottish authorities and the trustees. It looked to me as if when the big bids came in, something was not right with the applications. I suspect&#151;although I can only guess at this&#151;that they have fallen on advice from the HLF about the likelihood of securing approval and a suggestion that the applicant should get its house in order before proceeding further.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h02_spnew5"><b> Sandra Osborne </b> : The Minister makes a very good point. I believe that we are pushing at an open door with the Heritage Lottery Fund. There have been several applications, and there has been no mechanism to enable anyone to ask, &quot;What is the problem? We cannot allow the drift to continue.&quot; Do the relevant agencies have a role to play in being a bit more proactive?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h02_spnew6"><b> Estelle Morris </b> : My hon. Friend makes the point exactly about the way forward. An organisation is needed to do as she describes. It cannot be the HLF; it cannot say, &quot;Let&#039;s get our act in order. We will take on leadership, co-ordinate the funders and the trustees and see whether we can arrange things.&quot; However, the HLF will equally not conduct the equivalent of an Ofsted inspection, sitting quiet until the bid is made and then passing it or failing it. It does not have that sort of relationship with an applicant, but something in between.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para31">A bid as large as the one that we are discussing should never get to the point of being submitted without a fair understanding on the part of the applicants of the likelihood of success. To proceed otherwise is a waste of time and resources. I see it as the duty of the HLF&#151;it is an obligation that it accepts and fulfils for many major projects&#151;to work with the applicant, advise on where there are shortfalls and help with putting the bid in good order.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para32">All that that will mean is that when the bid is made, it will be in good order and eligible, and can compete with others for what is inevitably a limited amount of funds. The relationship with the HLF cannot guarantee the funding, because one cannot know how many bids, or of what value, will be made. However, the Burns heritage park needs someone other than the HLF to play the leadership role, and be the point of contact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para33">The light on the horizon, which my hon. Friend mentioned, is that the National Trust for Scotland has expressed an interest in that role. I do not suggest that it should put in more money than anyone else; that is not for me to do, but the equivalent of a lead body is needed. My hon. Friend alluded to the history, and we all know about such things from our constituency experiences&#151;I can almost imagine what has gone on, without needing to be a Scottish Member. There have been many interested parties and people willing to help, but no one with an agreed lead role.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 29WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para34">As an outsider, my reading of the situation is that we could be most optimistic if the trustees and other parties would unite around a lead partner. Choosing the National Trust for Scotland for that role would give the HLF a better chance of doing the negotiation before the bid was put in. The reasons given for the project being turned down in the past were things like value for money, long-term sustainability and management&#151;we are talking about a multi-million pound project. The HLF will advise on each of those things, but cannot do them for the bidder and cannot take an ongoing lead role. Perhaps there is a time for all of these things.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para35">For Scottish Members of Parliament, and for Scottish Members representing English seats as well&#151;certainly with the pressure of 2009 upon us all&#151;I agree with my hon. Friend that nobody would want the Scots from throughout the world returning to see that the memory of Robert Burns, the greatest of all the national poets, has not been honoured in a way in which they would expect. If 2009 gives us incentive to ensure that that has happened by then, that is good. If the National Trust for Scotland can provide that lead role, all the better. All I can do today is to say to my hon. Friend that the HLF is a source of income to which an application would be in order, but no promises can be given, as it will need to be considered alongside other applications. The HLF is willing to talk and make sure that as the bid is being developed it stands the best possible chance of being ruled in order and being competitive. Maybe those issues are beginning to come together&#151;perhaps for the first time in a while.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h02_para36">I know that with the leadership that my hon. Friend has shown in her constituency all those concerned will not let this opportunity slip away. I congratulate her on having a most historic constituency and on having the foresight to allow us all at Westminster to celebrate Burns day today. Celebrating it in Westminster is apt&#151;although I suspect that they are having greater celebrations north of the border&#151;and I wish her every success in the project that she has taken on.
</p>

<a name="50125h03_head0"><h3 align=center>Obesity (Young People)</h3>

<a name="50125h03_time0"><h5>2 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50125h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Nigel Evans  (Ribble Valley)</b>  (Con): I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise a subject that is of interest to people inside and outside the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para0">The problem of obesity is spiralling out of control in the United Kingdom, although it is not unique to this country and affects others too, notably the United States of America. Already, 8.5 per cent. of six-year-olds and 15 per cent. of 15-year-olds are classed as obese. It is estimated that the cost to the economy of obesity is around &#163;7.5 billion and that obesity reduces life expectancy by nine years. The BBC has reported that more than 30,000 deaths a year in England alone are caused by obesity. We know too that obesity leads to other health-related problems, including arthritis, heart disease and diabetes. In addition, there is the risk that certain cancers, such as prostate cancer, are more difficult to diagnose in those with obesity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para1">It is in young people, however, that the problems have increased at an alarming rate. Since 1982 the number of obese children has doubled. If present trends continue, half of all children in the United Kingdom could be termed obese by 2020. We need to take action now, before it is too late for our children. There is an acknowledged problem, so action is needed now. When I talk about obesity, I am not referring to a genetic condition termed Prader-Willi syndrome, which I believe was the subject of a BBC 2 documentary last night.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para2">What is being done to help young people not to become obese? The &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper is a welcome step in the right direction. The Prime Minister notes in the foreword:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Government cannot&#151;and should not&#151;pretend it can &#039;make&#039; the population healthy. But it can&#151;and should&#151;support people in making better choices for their health and the health of their families. It is for people to make the healthy choice if they wish to.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para3">That is okay as far as it goes, but the Government should ensure that young people receive the information that they need to make the correct choices. If people are not doing enough exercise and are not maintaining their health with the information that the Government provide&#151;the figures that I have quoted prove that people are not&#151;much more must be done to give information to young people. I mentioned the cost of &#163;7.5 billion, which is a huge drain on the economy, never mind the fact that the quality of life for young people with obesity will be dramatically altered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para4">Obesity is on everyone&#039;s radar screen. I welcome the Health Committee&#039;s report on obesity from last year and I am delighted that hon. Members who serve on that Committee are here this afternoon. On 9 February, between 8.15 am and 10 o&#039;clock, the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate), who is also here, will hold a mini conference to discuss the White Paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para5">I read with interest the <i>Hansard</i> report on the hon. Gentleman&#039;s debate on the same subject in January 2003, which I am sure he remembers well. The then Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Much more needs to be done to ensure that both children and adults have all the information that they need to choose a healthy lifestyle.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 31WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para6">He continued:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;A low level of physical activity among children also contributes to a rising level of obesity.&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 22&nbsp;January 2003; Vol. 398, cc. 132&#150;33WH.]</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para7">Two years on from that debate, why has so little been done on obesity? Talk is clearly cheap, but we now need action to ensure that the problem is properly tackled.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para8">Physically active people have a 20 to 30 per cent. reduced risk of premature death and a reduced risk of contracting major chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer of up to 50 per cent. It is estimated that more than one in 200 people in the UK are diabetic and that the figure is dramatically increasing. It is clear how important it is not to be obese or overweight and to take physical exercise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para9">Some 30 per cent. of boys and 40 per cent. of girls are not meeting the recommended one hour a day of physical activity for children. It is in school that that should become second nature, as part of their way of life. The number of obese children has tripled in the past 20 years. Physical education is a compulsory part of the national curriculum up to key stage 4&#151;or 16 to the rest of us. In 2001, the Labour party manifesto stated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We pledge a sports entitlement for all children, giving them access to at least two hours a week of sport in or after school.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para10">We now know that that target has been missed. According to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, sport and physical activity among five to 16-year-olds has actually declined since 1999. According to teachers, children are lucky to get two 45-minute sessions a week. Given the time that it takes to get to the gym, change and have a shower afterwards, we are talking about nothing like 45 minutes, and children would be lucky to get two sessions of half an hour, which adds up to one hour a week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para11">Recently, I spoke to Heinrich Ungerer, a PE instructor from County Hall gym. He said that young people should exercise at least three times a week, spacing their exercise sessions out within the week so that their bodies had time to repair. He believes that many young people rely on their metabolic rate to hide the fact that they simply do not do enough exercise. It is my view, therefore, that physical activity provision in schools should be increased so that youngsters get exercise at least three times a week&#151;Monday, Wednesday and Friday&#151;and for at least an hour each time, not including the time that it takes for them to change and shower.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para12">I am of the considered belief that, in the past, physical activity, or PE, was always seen as an add-on&#151;it was something that we had to do, but if we could not do it, we would not be too bothered. Furthermore, some of the equipment in schools, certainly in my day, was not up to the job. Physical education in schools should, however, be as important as maths, reading and writing, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that she, too, believes that it is as important as some of the other subjects in the curriculum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para13">We also need to make it exciting for young people to go to the gym. I referred to the facilities in schools in my day, but we know that state-of-the-art equipment is now available in the best gyms in the country. I do not see why our youngsters should suffer, and I hope that the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 32WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Minister can give us some good news about ensuring that all schools can now start to re-equip their gyms with state-of-the-art equipment so that youngsters will be encouraged to use them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para14">Clearly, a one-hour session will not be enough for students to stay fit, and there are initiatives to help children who are being failed by the education system. I can point to things that are being done in my constituency, and I suspect that all hon. Members could do the same in theirs. For instance, I am president of the Clitheroe Wolves football club, which is led by George Hibbert, and I pay great tribute to him. Every Saturday, he has up to 400 boys and girls of all ages out training in Clitheroe. They play football regularly, and they play in teams too. That is superb. Clearly, with 400 youngsters, he does not do that all on his own; he has a number of other dedicated volunteers to help him, and I pay tribute to them. I saw them working last summer in Clitheroe, and it was fantastic to see so many youngsters out enjoying themselves. Clearly, the scheme is outside the education system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para15">I have also been in touch with Farouk Hussain; he, too, is a volunteer, and he works with other volunteers to run the Clitheroe cricket club for youngsters. He says that, on Thursdays, well over 100 youngsters regularly take part in exercising through cricket. He also has 35 youngsters who coach themselves and other youngsters; that is not only helping them to keep fit, but teaching them leadership. I congratulate him and his volunteers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para16">In Wales, people over 60 are entitled to free swimming, and some youngsters are also eligible. A constituent asked why that provision could not be extended throughout the country, and the Minister responded that it was not possible for the Government to provide such schemes. However, swimming is one of the healthiest forms of exercise that we can do, and I hope that the Government will look again at the issue. I hope that they will look at what is happening in Wales and at why we cannot extend that throughout the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para17">I also congratulate those involved in sporting events such as the London mini marathon, which has been going on since 1986. Teams can enter from all the London boroughs, and there are also 10 county teams and home county teams from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Many of us will be familiar with other sorts of mini marathons that take place throughout the country, encouraging youngsters to get fit, undergo training and participate in and enjoy running in the marathon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para18">Professional football clubs must also be congratulated on the work that they do with youngsters. Blackburn Rovers is just outside my constituency. The club runs a number of programmes designed to tackle obesity and promote healthy eating. The students study what a player eats in a day, comparing a player&#039;s diet with what they eat, and consider questions such as, &quot;why should you eat healthily?&quot; The club also gets the children to monitor their physical fitness by running up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to 100 m and then monitoring their heartbeat. Programmes are designed specifically to meet the different needs, ages and academic abilities of the pupils. They also consider other important health issues such as the dangers of alcohol. A number of other professional 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 33WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
football clubs participate in such schemes, and we should encourage the spread of such schemes throughout the country to all football clubs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para19">It is also important that there is provision for physical activity in the workplace. I asked BAE Systems, which is based in Samlesbury in my constituency, what sort of facilities were provided and found that there was a sports and social association&#151;a gym at the factory with up to 500 members, about 20 per cent of the work force. But the company also encourages youngsters into its grounds to participate in sport in the summer. More such initiatives should be encouraged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para20">In the workplace there is a tax of 20 per cent on &quot;free&quot; memberships of gyms at work as a benefit in kind. I know that the Prime Minister is looking at taxation as a way of incentivising people to take out gym membership. Indeed, we should be looking at ways of ensuring that we at least do not penalise companies when they offer free gym membership to their workers. So I hope that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer speaks in just over a couple of months&#039; time he will be able to give some good news in this regard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para21">I have discussed physical activity. Now I shall speak about food education. Education in what we eat could go some way to stem the problems of obesity. Food education is loosely mentioned in some of the subjects covered at school, such as science subjects. When young children are taught about keeping their teeth clean, they are told which foods can be harmful to their teeth. I have learned of schools that have personal, social and health education that includes some teaching on healthy eating, but there is little direction and there are few examples of firm education on how to lead a healthy lifestyle. Including that in the national curriculum would benefit youngsters and the whole country. Most adults and children do not meet the dietary recommendations of five pieces of fruit and vegetables a day.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para22">I welcome an initiative mentioned in one of today&#039;s newspapers, led by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Geraint Davies), who is campaigning and trying to enforce nutritional standards for school meals. Under his private Member&#039;s Bill, nutritional information would be displayed on school menus and vending machines on school premises would be regulated. Any increase in the amount of information that we can give to young people about what they are eating must be welcomed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para23">I have been contacted several times about the food that is provided in vending machines in schools. I welcome initiatives by the Dairy Council and the Food Standards Agency, such as the healthy drinks vending study in 12 secondary schools across England and Wales. The pilot, managed by the Health Education Trust, examined the likely demand for healthy alternatives to carbonated drinks. For 24 weeks vending machines containing healthy drinks such as milk, water and fruit juice operated alongside more traditional machines. I read that the scheme was a great success. It gave youngsters choice and around 70,000 drinks were purchased from the machines, the most popular being semi-skimmed milk, milkshakes, mineral water and pure juices. It is with schemes like this that we can make a direct impact on young people&#039;s lives. Although this was a pilot and a leaflet was produced and distributed to 9,000 schools, it is no promise that things will change in 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 34WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
schools without direction. We need clear commitments from the Government to ensure that drinks like these get into school vending machines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para24">Fast food is always the butt of everyone&#039;s criticisms when it comes to talking about obesity. The Health Committee had meetings with McDonald&#039;s, among others, concerning obesity. A recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> highlights these anti-fast food sentiments and I believe that Brussels has given the food industry a year to stop advertising their fast food in the way that it does and to improve product labelling or face legislation from a European level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para25">I went to McDonald&#039;s when it had one of its open days at the top of Victoria street. I was pleased to see that it is beginning to recognise that there is a problem, and that it wants to give its customers a varied choice. It has introduced items like fruit segments, which it never had before. Super-size meals have been junked out of the window, and salads have now started to feature on the menu. It also makes skimmed milk available to customers. I welcome its initiatives, such as partnerships with the four home-nation football governing bodies, which will create 10,000 community coaches across the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2006. McDonald&#039;s calculates that those partnerships have led to children aged seven to 16 across the country receiving an extra 800,000 hours of coaching. McDonald&#039;s seems to recognise its social responsibility: it provides food, giving more choice to youngsters, but it is also doing something about exercise, which is absolutely right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para26">There has been a similar movement to promote a healthier lifestyle by Coca-Cola, another company berated from time to time for its products. The company has a four-point strategy for supporting healthier diets and active lifestyles, including initiatives such as offering greater product choice, more low-sugar and diet drinks, greater promotion of Diet Coke, the expansion of responsible sales and marketing practices, such as commercial-free zones in schools, and the encouragement of communities to take part in a range of grass-roots sports, including the schools football cup, which a number of youngsters participate in. As hon. Members will know, I have my own retail convenience store, and what I hear about the sale of Diet Coke now being greater than the sale of ordinary Coca-Cola is certainly reflected in my own business. I welcome the company&#039;s decision not to brand its vending machines, which will offer a full choice, especially of the lower-sugar and diet products. I understand that it has just introduced a smaller size of Diet Coke can as well.

<p>
<a name="50125h03_para27">I hope that the Minister can give us some good news following today&#039;s debate&#151;one of many that we have held in the House on this subject. Will she look carefully at ensuring that the level of activity for children in schools will be increased, that activity will be treated as seriously as other subjects on the school curriculum, and that sports facilities generally will be improved and made more available to children, particularly in summer? I cannot stand the fact that when the schools close in summer, the sports facilities alongside them close as well. We have mentioned that time and again in the House over the past few years. The excuse, or maybe a legitimate reason, is that they are afraid to open up, let us say, the soccer fields or the tennis courts because they cannot get insurance. The facilities would have to be insured, and people would have to be paid to monitor 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
the youngsters. I hope that the Minister will look at making facilities within schools available during school holidays, and in the evenings. I know that a lot is done with community school sports facilities&#151;we have one in Longbridge, in my constituency&#151;and we must ensure that they are also fully supported.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para28">On the nutritional side, more information must be given to youngsters, both in the classroom and in the dining room, regarding the nutritional value of what they are eating and the long-term effects if they do not correct their diet and balance their lifestyle with healthy exercise. That is vital. Fruit, for instance, is a cheap and economical food these days, and in many supermarkets is cheaper than some of the other foods that youngsters buy. Fruit is filling and hugely good for them. We need to give that information to youngsters so that they can make intelligent choices. Unless we do so, we are storing up much greater problems for ourselves in the future.

<a name="50125h03_time1"><h5>2.19 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50125h03_spnew1"><b> Dr. Howard Stoate  (Dartford)</b>  (Lab): I am pleased to be called in a debate of enormous importance not just to the House but to everyone in the country. I am pleased, too, that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr.&nbsp;Evans) has secured an opportunity for the House to look in hard detail at an extremely worrying and important issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para29">I am particularly pleased to take part as I understand I am the only practicing GP left in the House. I chair a number of Back-Bench all-party groups&#151;the all-party group on obesity, the all-party group on primary care and public health, the all-party group on pharmacy and the all-party group on men&#039;s health&#151;all of which have taken an active interest in the problem of obesity. I co-authored, with my research assistant Bryan Jones, a report published just over a year ago by the Fabian Society called &quot;All&#039;s Well That Starts Well&quot;. That came up with some controversial views that were well received and debated by people outside&#151;in the media and across the country&#151;and again contributed to the debate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para30">I am pleased to be president of Team Darenth, a cycling club in my constituency. The club is one of the largest and most successful in south-east England. It teaches young people how to ride their bikes safely and how to use cycling as a sport and hobby&#151;indeed, as a learning experience for life. Many young people are benefiting from that club and the person running it, Michael Humphries, has put great efforts into making it a success.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para31">Along with other hon. Members, I have on many occasions referred to a time-bomb of obesity. I must be slightly out of date as my friend and colleague Dr. David Haslam, chair of the National Obesity Forum, says that the time-bomb of obesity has already gone off and what we are now waiting for is the time-bomb of diabetes and heart disease that will follow it. That is what we are facing. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley has already alluded to obesity leading to significant increases in diabetes and heart disease. What he did not mention is that someone with a body mass index of 30 and above faces anything up to 30 times the risk of getting diabetes at some time during their life.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para32">When I was a medical student, type 2 diabetes was considered to be a disease of middle and old age&#151;indeed, it was called maturity onset diabetes. It is now 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 36WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
called type 2 diabetes partly because we are seeing it happening in much younger people. It is wrong to call it a disease of maturity and middle age, as it can now happen in the teenage years, or even before.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para33">It should be a worrying pointer for us all to be seeing significant numbers of children coming through diabetic and endocrine clinics in our hospitals, suffering from diabetes. Those children face a hugely increased risk of heart disease, early death, blindness, loss or amputation of limbs. The complications of diabetes are pretty unpleasant and the longer one has it, the more complications arise. Therefore, a person who gets diabetes during their teens has an extremely high chance of complications as they get older. That wrecks not only their own lives, but the lives of their families. As the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, it causes a huge drain on resources for the entire health service and the wider community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para34">I do not need to rehearse the statistics that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, but he is right that the number of obese children has trebled in the past 20 years. That should give us all pause for thought. Another worrying statistic is that, in a typical week, one in five children eat no fruit at all, according to the national diet and nutrition survey in 2000. Nine out of ten children taking packed lunches to school have lunches which contain far too much fat, salt and sugar. Therefore, we face a massive problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para35">It is not right to say that the Government have not taken the matter seriously. As the hon. Gentleman said, I secured a debate about this important issue a couple of years ago. I am extremely gratified by the huge amount of work that the Government have done, particularly the Minister who is on the Front Bench today. In publishing the recent White Paper on public health, she has made an enormous contribution to this topic. It would be wrong to score party political points by saying the Government have not taken it seriously, when clearly they have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para36">I know that the Minister will go through the arrangements the Government have put in place in more detail, but I want to recap a few of them to give hon. Members an idea of the range of topics that the Government are addressing. For example, we are trying to ensure that children have equal access to healthy living, a main area of action outlined in the White Paper. Meanwhile, the Sure Start programme, which is already helping children with healthy living, will develop new child development projects, including volunteers visiting families who are under stress and who need extra support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para37">That is very helpful, as is some of the action that is targeted at schools such as the national healthy schools programme, which is encouraging schools to foster better health. The provision of free fruit and vegetables to all children aged four to six has been enormously popular in my constituency. When I visit schools in my area, particularly primary schools, many children are extremely pleased to get their free fruit every morning in school. I find that extremely helpful. They are teaching their own parents to buy and eat fruit. That has also been important.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para38">The Government are working hard on revising school meals to improve their nutritional content. There is more support for cycling to school and for promoting 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 37WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
sport in schools. At least 400 sports specialist schools are to be established over the next few years and the food in schools programme, a joint venture between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills, will help to ensure that children have access to healthy choices of food in schools. The programme will develop a range of nutrition-related activities and projects in schools to add value to some of the other things that they are doing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para39">Another cornerstone of the White Paper is the promotion of joint action by local authorities and business voluntary groups to tackle local health inequalities and other issues. People are to be encouraged to become more active through cycling and walking initiatives and will have easier access to sports facilities. By 2006, local authorities are forecast to have built more than 7,000 miles of new cycle tracks and cycle lanes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para40">Consumers are to be helped to choose healthier meals by a colour-coded system of food labelling and will have more guidance on portion sizes, while the Government, working with the food industry, aim to reduce levels of salt, added sugars and fat.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew2"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford)</b>  (Con): In what is known as the traffic light system of labelling&#151;the hon. Gentleman has a medical background, which may help&#151;what colour would the label be for an avocado pear? On the one hand it is a fruit that we are encouraged to eat; on the other hand, if eaten regularly, it could cause one to become quite fat.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew3"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : There are several responses to that question, but most of the deprived children in my community are not worrying too much about avocado pears. We need to concentrate more on the staple foods and diets that they will be eating.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew4"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : Answer the question.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew5"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : The answer is that there will always be difficult areas at the margins, and we must make a sensible and grown-up decision about certain foodstuffs that do not easily fall into a category. The hon. Gentleman is right. There will be some foods at the margins that will be difficult to classify, but that does not undermine the point of the scheme, which is to give people simpler, more straightforward and more helpful advice, particularly those who have to feed large families on relatively fixed incomes.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew6"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : May I try again? If the aim is to have better, simpler, comprehensive labelling, so that consumers know what they are buying, is not it unhelpful that three different supermarket chains are working on their own labelling systems, which are all at variance with one another and will simply cause more confusion?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew7"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is nonsense for different companies to work on completely contradictory schemes. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain how the Government will work with the different food retailers to make sure that they produce a harmonised scheme that is simple and easy to understand. I agree with the hon. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 38WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Gentleman that it is easy to pick holes in such initiatives, but their point is to make life much simpler and more straightforward for those who are struggling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para41">Seventy per cent. of young families admit that they do not have enough information to ensure that their children are fed healthily. That is a worrying statistic,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am pleased that the Government are looking at it and are trying to improve. Although there will be difficulties and problems in achieving that improvement, we must help the 70 per cent. of families who are struggling to feed their children because of a lack of appropriate knowledge.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew8"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : The hon. Gentleman is a doctor, and it is good to have a doctor in the House on these occasions, but surely the whole point of giving youngsters and parents information is so that, when they are deciding what to eat, they can choose a balanced diet. Eating the same foods is not a balanced diet. Sometimes they can have chocolate or chips, but not at every meal, not three times a day.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew9"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : That is entirely the point; it is exactly what we must concentrate on. No one is saying, &quot;Chocolate is always bad. Coca-Cola is always bad&quot;. Of course they are not. What is bad is the proportion of the diet that those foods make up. People should be free to eat what they want, but if they have the information to make choices that balance their diet and can choose from a wide range of available foods, which I am pleased to say most shops now stock, that will improve nutrition. Therefore, it is a question not of banning foods or making them difficult to get, but of making sure that people have the right information to make balanced choices for themselves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para42">I want to scotch the idea that we are producing a nanny state&#151;that is precisely what we are not doing. The Government are ensuring that people are properly educated in order to make choices for themselves. At the moment, when anyone raises the issue of obesity in the House, the newspapers jump on it and make it look as though the Government are telling people how to live their lives, which is exactly what we are not doing. I am pleased to be able to make that point.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para43">As I have said, there is an awful lot going on. In 2007, the Government will launch a new health initiative, health direct, which will be an online service and phone helpline that will allow people access to all sorts of information to improve their health. The Government have done a lot, but I am not complacent and we are not yet reversing the trend. Although they are on the right track, it is not working yet because we are still seeing an increase in obesity in children. The problem is getting worse, not better, so much more must be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para44">The extraordinary thing about nutrition is that children are not born with a particular taste in food. They are not born wanting burgers, chips and cola; that is learned behaviour. We must tackle the problem at the point where children learn that behaviour. The situation is a bit like that of smoking. Once someone has become a smoker, they are a smoker. If we can prevent them from taking up smoking, it will have a great effect on their health chances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para45">The same thing applies to young children. Something happens at a very young age to many children that turns them on to a diet that is far too high in saturated fat, 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 39WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
sugar and salt. If we can get a handle on that early formation of their dietary preferences, we can make an effective difference. Hopefully, they will then grow up with a taste for less unhealthy foods, healthier options, more fruit and vegetables and less saturated fat.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para46">We need to concentrate far more on food education, which has become increasingly marginalised in schools during the past 20 years. I understand that there is increasing pressure on the curriculum for all sorts of core subjects, which must be tackled. Often, however, schools lack specialist equipment, kitchen space and appropriately trained teachers, which is one of the biggest problems. That has led to the statistic I cited earlier: 70 per cent. of parents do not know how to feed their children effectively. They did not learn how to do that at school, so it is hardly surprising that they are unable to pass the relevant information on to their children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para47">We should make food education a compulsory part of primary and secondary education. Unless children are brought up with a good understanding of what constitutes a healthy diet and how to make such choices, there is little chance of them getting it right. As we know, there is a statutory obligation for primary schools to offer food technology lessons, but that does not apply to secondary schools. The Government recommend that schools offer students the opportunity to study food technology. However, 10 per cent. of schools offer nothing at all and many give students only a limited introduction to the subject.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para48">At the moment, the food technology syllabus comes under the heading of design and technology, which means that students are far more likely to spend time designing the biscuit packaging than understanding what the biscuit contains and whether it is good for them. Obviously, altering the curriculum will have significant cost implications. For a start, schools will need extra grants to invest in kitchens and equipment. Teachers will need help to get the necessary training. There would be a cost implication, but we have a duty to consider that to see where Government, local authorities and local education authorities can help to put things right.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew10"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : One of the statistics that I used showed that obesity costs the NHS about &#163;7.5 billion. We are talking about shifting the money from when the problem exists to before it exists. I suspect that a percentage of the money used to tackle the problems of obesity after it has happened could be used to prevent it, which would mean that we saved more money than we spent.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew11"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : I happen to agree with that constructive comment. We could do that if we recognised the opportunity cost of transferring some resources into prevention. The hon. Gentleman is right. Such initiatives can be brought to bear to improve the position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para49">There is an initiative in my constituency called &quot;Don&#039;t Sit, Get Fit&quot;, which is an excellent example of what can be achieved in schools and the community. It has given scores of children in Dartford and Gravesham the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 40WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
opportunity for the first time to take part in regular out-of-school exercise and to learn about healthy eating. Its latest initiative, a healthy living calendar, involved 12 primary schools in Dartford and Gravesham each contributing a healthy recipe. That is a valuable resource. Last week, I met children who were involved. They were extremely energised and enthused by it and were learning a lot from it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para50">The other area of the school curriculum that is vital is physical education. The Government&#039;s White Paper, &quot;Schools&#151;achieving success&quot;, gave a commitment that all children will be entitled to two hours of physical education a week. I accept the point that the hon. Gentleman made. Two hours does not always necessarily translate into two hours of actual activity, as there are issues at each end of the lesson. However, at least it goes a long way towards putting that right.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para51">To back up that commitment, the Government have already spent more than &#163;1 billion on the development of school sport. It is hoped that, by 2006, 75 per cent. of all pupils will be participating in physical activity and sport each week. That is encouraging.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para52">The Government are also encouraging schools to develop stronger links with the community and sports clubs to encourage kids to continue their interests outside school. One in five year 2 to 11 students in sports partnership schools now participate in clubs with links to their schools. Again, that is spreading out into the wider community, which is the sort of thing that we need to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para53">If we focus on schools as the main driver, the benefits can spill out into the wider community. The cycle club that I mentioned is based in school premises, which the school has made available to the club to use at weekends. To answer the point that the hon. Gentleman made about school facilities not being open outside school hours, they often are. Team Darenth is able to use the school at weekends and has free access to the school grounds, the playing fields and all the things that are needed to ensure that the kids have access to off-road safe cycling and facilities. It can be done. It is just a question of the initiative needed to get it going and the will to drive it along.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para54">I would like trained specialist coaches, particularly from some of our prestigious sports clubs, to go into schools. I know that some already do that, and I think that that could be widened. I would like school sports facilities to be made more accessible to other members of the community, so that the benefits from the school spill out into the community and the community comes into the school to use its sports facilities and other equipment. That can foster closer links and hopefully forge greater partnerships.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para55">Another area that we need to consider is transport to school. Currently, only one in 11 primary school children travel to school unaccompanied, compared with one in five a decade ago. The number of children being driven to school has increased enormously over the past 20 years. We need to do something to reduce the dependence on car transport and to encourage more kids to walk and cycle to school regularly. That is essential to get them into the habit of taking daily exercise. It is not only exercise at school that is important, but the exercise that they get while going to school and the other things that that will achieve. The 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 41WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Government have made &#163;50 million available to help schools and local authorities to draw up measures to reduce car dependency. Again, that is a successful start. It obviously needs to go further, but it is an important beginning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para56">Another problem is access to fresh food. In the UK today, we buy 80 per cent. of our food in the main national supermarket chains. Those supermarkets are designed and located to cater for the affluent car-owning majority. If one does not have a car&#151;one in five of us does not&#151;access to supermarkets, which are often in edge of town locations, is severely reduced. The Government are now revising planning guidance to prevent any edge of town spread. However, in my constituency, many of the supermarkets are based on the edge of communities and are quite difficult to get to if one does not have access to private transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para57">A young mother with two children in a pushchair, trying to carry home the weekly shop on a bus, would know what I mean. It is extremely difficult. Many of them have to resort to taxis, which they can ill afford, or else they have to shop in more expensive shops that offer a narrower range of foodstuffs. That issue needs to be tackled if we are to reverse the trend.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew12"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : How?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew13"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : Quite often, the shops in the middle of towns not only offer a more restricted range of food but are more expensive. They do not offer the choice that supermarkets do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para58">I will give the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) an example. A basket of healthier food is significantly more expensive than a basket of unhealthy food. A survey was carried out a while ago in a London suburb that showed that a basket of healthy food is 41&nbsp;per cent. more expensive than the equivalent basket of less healthy food. That obviously puts a huge strain on the budget of families with limited incomes. It means that they are much more likely to choose foods that are less healthy for their children purely on the ground of economics. We need to look hard at that to ensure that healthy, fresh produce is priced in a way that makes it accessible to members of society with less disposable income.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para59">Quite a lot of work has been done on street markets. Many street markets, which often offer a wide range of affordable food, are being squeezed by some of the large out of town developments that tend to have a negative impact on many market towns. The number of market stalls reduces as supermarkets gain a greater market share. That puts more pressure on costs and can drive them up beyond what many people can afford.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew14"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam)</b>  (LD): I take the hon. Gentleman&#039;s point about the changes in Government planning guidance that will move supermarkets increasingly from the edges to the centres of towns. How, precisely, will that change help those markets?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew15"><b> Dr. Stoate </b> : One of points that I wanted to make was that we need incentive schemes. There are still many difficult estates that are, effectively, food deserts. Often, there are no shops in those inner-city areas, or the shops 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 42WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
that are available offer narrow choice and foodstuffs that are not necessarily appealing to people, or do not have a sufficient range.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para60">I should like the Government to look hard at the idea of a fresh food audit for some of our difficult towns and cities, which would discover what fresh foods were available there. If areas fell below a Government standard for the fresh food that should be available, serious consideration should be given to tax breaks or subsidies to ensure that those foodstuffs were available to people who could not get access to out of town shopping centres.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para61">I know that my suggestion is a bit controversial and I do not expect the Government to promise such a bold step at once. However, I want them to take a hard look at ways of improving the availability of foods in areas where people have low incomes and poor access to transport, and find it extremely difficult to get healthy food for their families. If we could get that right, it would make a huge difference to nutrition and to the massive burden of obesity that we all face. It will affect the whole country sooner or later. If we do not tackle the problem now, we shall all face the consequences in years to come.

<p><a name="50125h03_spnew16"><b> Mr. David Amess  (Southend, West)</b>  (Con): I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) on securing the debate. Seldom have I heard him speak with such passion and enthusiasm. He was entirely right to choose the subject of obesity in young people. I was initially concerned when he seemed to concentrate most of his remarks on physical activity, but he more than redressed the balance in the latter part of his speech. I think that the emphasis, in dealing with this problem, should come from the fact that we would not die if we did not engage in physical activity but would die if we did not eat and drink.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para62">Four hon. Members are present for the debate, and all are or have been members of the Health Committee. I consider our report on obesity to be the most profound of any that we have produced since I became a member of the Committee. I do not want to pre-empt remarks that I hope to make on 10 February when the Minister will respond to our report. I simply want to say that the Health Committee report has led the way on the subject of tackling obesity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para63">After the Obesity Awareness and Solutions Trust came to see me at my surgery and shared with me a significant number of problems that rather large ladies face, I attended a meeting of the Committee in which we considered our future programme.

<a name="50125h03_para64">When I asked the producer of the BBC&#039;s &quot;Fat Nation&quot; programme, &quot;You do know, don&#039;t you, all about the Health Committee report and the fact that we started this?&quot;, I was reassured when she said that she will run the programme for two years and that she is not into gesture politics. I am sure that all hon. Members have been sent videos in connection with ITV&#039;s Britain on the move campaign. I am told that those running it are not into gesture politics either. They will continue with the campaign for a considerable time.

<p>
<a name="50125h03_para65">No politician or Government should be engaging in gesture politics on this subject. It cannot be cured by photo-opportunities of politicians on bikes, or taking part in marathons, or with young people. If the country is serious about dealing with obesity&#151;and it is not yet&#151;doing so will take at least two decades. That is why it is so important that the Government listen to the Obesity Awareness and Solutions Trust strategy for dealing with obesity. I am sure that the House of Commons is sick to death of listening to all the statistics about how many people are obese and how many ailments one can contract as a result of obesity. The House does not need any more proof that obesity is a serious subject. We need some action and leadership; we do not need gesture politics. That is why I look forward to the Government&#039;s response on 10 February to our Select Committee report.

<a name="50125h03_para66">Southend does not intend to wait for the Government to act; we intend to lead the way with initiatives. The Minister of State has been in correspondence with me about a frontier-leading production by Sally Lawrence. I can sense that a general election is on the way, as everybody is mentioning local initiatives so I am not going to step away from that. My constituent Sally Lawrence, from Outloud Productions recently came to see me at a surgery with a great idea to promote healthy eating among young people. Her production, &quot;An Unhealthy Invasion&quot;, is an innovative approach to promoting healthy eating. The Minister&#039;s letter arrived today with her views on the initiative. In the production, the characters, Healthy Kid, Vitamin Girl, High Energy and Protein Dog join forces to rid the world of Gargoyle the Greedy and end his oppressive reign of obesity. The production&#039;s use of comic book-style characters is an excellent way to tap into the mindset of young children and teach them about the problems of obesity.

<a name="50125h03_para67">My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley has concentrated on young people. Those of us who have children observe daily how young people live their lives. I have five young children. We have a black labrador dog, which requires a great deal of exercise. If I were to ask my children, &quot;Would one of you kindly take the dog for a walk?&quot;, one or two expletives would be let out, and eventually one of them would go to the front door, open it and let the dog out of the house. The idea that young people are overwhelmingly and regularly into physical exercise in the sense that my hon. Friend has mentioned, is absolutely ridiculous. I can say that with all the experience of my children, who are attending school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para68">Young people live in a completely different style to that of hon. Members present. I walk a lot; young people do not. Those of us with children often run a taxi service. If they want to be dropped off at a party or see their friends, they do not walk half a mile, they say to mum and dad, &quot;Can you give me a lift?&quot; Mobile phones, the internet: all that technology has meant that young people, as they go about their daily lives, do not participate in as much physical activity as they used to.

<a name="50125h03_para69">I hope that in 2012 we will have the Olympic games in London. I totally support that.

West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) referred to the traffic light system. During the Health Committee&#039;s inquiry into obesity, we visited America and had talks with McDonald&#039;s and Coca-Cola. We were all appalled at what we witnessed. We found those companies in a state of denial. They did not want to talk about the amount of sugar, salt and fat in their products. They were much keener to talk about the emphasis that they wanted to place on physical exercise. I feel strongly that our battle is with the food manufacturers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para70">In the last parliamentary Session, I raised with the then Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg), the issue of healthy eating in schools. In America, we saw healthy schools and unhealthy schools. We saw some schools where one could get snacks at any time. At other schools, there was a ban on access to those snacks. The Government cannot step away from the issue. If schools in the United Kingdom say, &quot;We cannot do away with vending machines because it would adversely affect our income&quot;, the Government must address the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew17"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : Am I right in thinking that my hon. Friend was a strong supporter of Baroness Thatcher when she introduced the local management of schools, which gave to governing bodies and head teachers the powers to run our schools? As my hon. Friend is nodding, I assume that he did support it. Surely it is up to governors and head teachers to take decisions on vending machines and not for the Government to interfere and lay down the law.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew18"><b> Mr. Amess </b> : My hon. Friend has guessed the next point that I was going to make. It is entirely a matter for the governing bodies of those schools to determine priorities and to ensure that healthy eating and tackling obesity are at the top of the agenda. As far as the Government are concerned, guidance is advisable. I cannot see any reason why the Government should not let it be known that they hope that the governing bodies of our schools take the initiative on the issue. I am delighted to say that some schools in my constituency, for example St. Christopher&#039;s school, have taken the initiative on vending machines. At Belfairs high school, which I visited last Friday, healthy eating options are available immediately for young people.

<p>
<a name="50125h03_para71">Recommendation 19 of paragraph 222 of the Government&#039;s response to the Health Committee&#039;s report says:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;We recommend that, rather than targeting sugar and fat separately, Government should focus on reducing overall energy density of food, and should work with the Food Standards Agency to develop stringent targets for reformulation of foods to reduce energy density within a short time frame.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para72">I could not care less what the recommendation is. I want something to happen. I hate the expression &quot;a traffic light system&quot;, but I hope that, in the next two decades, the food manufacturers will let it be easily recognisable where the healthy foods are in a supermarket. It is not the case that those of us who do supermarket shopping get hold of each product, look at its contents and say, &quot;Well, this has got so much salt and so much fat.&quot; If we did that, we would never get our shopping done. However, it is possible to have a range of products in a supermarket that are either healthy or not-so-healthy,

<a name="50125h03_para73">I am delighted to say that Southend-on-Sea borough council has a successful walking buses initiative. I hope that other local authorities will copy that. In Southend, in March, there will be a launch&#151;I hope that it will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attract some national interest&#151;involving opinion formers and celebrities addressing the issue of obesity. It will not just be a photo opportunity for the great and the good to turn up, mouth a few words and then forget about it because they have done their bit. We need to be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obsessive about this issue. Giving people the information&#151;that is Government-speak: this is not the nanny state&#151;will not be easy. If the Health Committee report, which I know all members of the Committee are proud of, is to deliver what we want eventually to see, we must create a climate in which it becomes second nature to eat and drink healthy products&#151;with just as nice a taste as non-diet products&#151;and in which people undertake as much physical activity as possible. This is the most serious and the biggest of all challenges that our health service faces today. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley on giving us the opportunity to debate it.
</p>



<a name="50125h03_time3"><h5>2.56 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50125h03_spnew21"><b> Mr. Paul Burstow  (Sutton and Cheam)</b>  (LD): I congratulate the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evans) on securing the debate. It is a useful opportunity to review progress and to pose some questions to the Government. The hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) talked about the need to be obsessive. I concur that he is obsessive about this issue&#151;and rightly so. A litany of statistics has been set out during the debate. Like him, I do not propose to trot out many more, but they are compelling evidence of the need to take the issue seriously and for this to be a matter of consistent and clear focus for public policy. They are also make a compelling case for us as individuals to take stock of our own lives and the lives of those for whom we have caring responsibilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para74">I take the point that was made by the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) that perhaps the obesity time bomb went off and we almost did not notice it. We are now feeling the aftershock and that in turn will lead to some huge health consequences. The Health Committee paid a visit to the United States as part of its inquiry into obesity. One of the points that was made when we visited the parks department in New York&#151;the point was made time and again and it has been echoed in today&#039;s debate&#151;was that children as young as four or five were now being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Cases among children of that age have been diagnosed in this country. The consequences for those young people&#039;s lives&#151;lives that will be brought to an end far sooner than they should be, and that will be blighted by disability, blindness and many other things&#151;mean that it behoves us all to make this an issue that involves not just debate, but action.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 46WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para75">I was particularly struck by some research that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) undertook. He considered the views of heads of PE departments. Activity is undoubtedly part of the equation. The issue is about how we readjust the energy-in, energy-out equation so that we get ourselves into a virtuous circle rather the vicious weight-gain spiral that we are in now. In the survey, he considered what was going on in schools and found that just one in 10 heads of PE believe the average pupil in secondary school to be in good health and to have good fitness levels. Some 65 per cent. of those same heads of PE said that they felt that the health of those in their charge, in their schools, had deteriorated during the past five years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para76">That statistic bears out many of the findings of Sport England and other organisations, and of the chief medical officer, who found that levels of activity had gone down over the past decade or so. It is therefore not surprising that when the National Audit Office considered obesity it came up with the shocking cost figures that the Health Committee has, in turn, looked at and updated. In 1998, the Committee found that the&nbsp;direct costs to the national health service would be &#163;480 million and the indirect costs &#163;2.1 billion&#151;a combined cost of &#163;2.58 billion to the economy. It estimated that the cost would rise to &#163;3.6 billion by 2010. The Committee recalculated those costings and found that the cost of obesity alone was &#163;3.7 billion&#151;and that is the cost now, not by 2010. So the very conservative figures that the NAO came up with are already found to be wanting. The challenge is found to be greater. When &quot;overweight&quot; is added to the equation, the total cost rises to &#163;7.4 billion a year, as we have heard. We need to be doing more to promote physical activity as part of the equation to reduce those risk factors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para77">I was struck by the contribution of the hon. Member for Southend, West regarding the parental angst of taxiing one&#039;s children from one place to another. The evidence from the University College London study into physical activity is very persuasive. It is not just the physical activity within the curriculum that matters. More calories were burned by walking to and from school than during the two hours of weekly PE lessons. It is not surprising, if most of that time is taken up with getting to the gym and getting changed, then having the exercise before getting changed and away from the gym, that that two hours does not have the impact that is needed. Clearly, there is a lot that has to be done across Government outside the Department of Health, in planning and highways policies, to make our environment beyond the school safer, so that people feel more willing to walk to school with their children, and more content for children to walk to school. That has to be a focus.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para78">The Olympics in 2012 are all about excellence in sport. The key to cracking this problem is about encouraging everyone to participate in physical activity. We must not lose sight of that when we make decisions about the way in which the curriculum is structured and funding for sport is orientated, so that we do not underfund everyone taking part at the expense of ensuring that we have the excellence as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para79">Nutrition has been mentioned. I feel very strongly that we need to see every school developing a nutrition policy in consultation with parents and children. That 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 47WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
would be a powerful tool for change within schools. It would make possible critical discussion of the merits and demerits of, for example, tuck shops and vending machines, and what should be in those vending machines. That could be a useful way of moving things forward at a local level without undermining the autonomy of school governing bodies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para80">There is an area, however, where the Government have the right to step in: nutrition standards for school meals. One of the areas that I was particularly disappointed with in the public health White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health: making health choices easier&quot;, was the Government&#039;s approach to nutrition standards. The Health Committee recommended that the English standards should be abandoned and we should adopt the Scottish standards. The Government are committed to a leisurely three-year review of this. They are only committed to considering it. They are not minded, at this point, to make such an important change, which could have a real impact on the quality of the food served in our schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para81">It is worth picking up on what we have done to under-educate people about food. The hon. Member for Dartford mentioned that there is less education now, and there are no requirements in secondary schools. It is not surprising, therefore, that in 1983 the average time spent preparing a meal was about an hour. Today, that has gone down to 13 minutes. It is amazing that it takes that long to unwrap the packaging of a fast food meal and shove it in the microwave, but clearly it does. My belief is that we need to have a curriculum that equips everyone with the basics to shop for, and prepare, a meal&#151;not a curriculum that turns out the food technologists of the future.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew22"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : The hon. Gentleman has reached a very important point. Does he not also believe that newspapers have a role to play in giving this information to parents and youngsters? Indeed, in today&#039;s <i>Metro</i>, in Metro Health, it talks about breakfast being the most important meal of the day. It goes through about 10 options, saying that having nothing is the worst thing you can do, and porridge is the best. Would the hon. Gentleman recommend that newspapers play a more active role in disseminating information for parents and youngsters?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew23"><b> Mr. Burstow </b> : The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that newspapers can play a powerful part in educating and information parents, not least because it was found in a survey that one in four children regularly eat sweets and crisps for breakfast, not porridge, which is the more desirable foodstuff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para82">The other point that I should like to pick up briefly is reformulation. It is important not only that we focus on salt, but that sugar and fat are rapidly addressed. Food labelling has a part to play in driving the reformulation agenda. We need to move beyond a voluntary approach to labelling towards something mandatory, not least because of the confusion that could arise if a multiplicity of labelling schemes emerged throughout the country. Surely the Government should give a clear lead and a framework within which labelling schemes can be operated.

<p>
<a name="50125h03_para83">Hon. Members have rightly highlighted the challenges that obesity poses to the country and the costs, human, personal and to the economy as a whole, that it imposes. I hope that the Minister will say&#151;or at least indicate when she will be able to say&#151;at what point she believes the sum total of Government policies that bear down on the problem will reach a tipping point and the obesity trends will begin to reverse. If the Government are willing to set targets for others, we need to be clear what their own targets are, so that we can see whether Government policy really is making a difference and, ultimately, saving lives.

<a name="50125h03_time4"><h5>3.6 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50125h03_spnew24"><b> Mr. Simon Burns  (West Chelmsford)</b>  (Con): I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) on securing this important debate. We have heard in the speeches so far, from my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), the hon. Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) and the Opposition Liberal Democrat spokesman, the importance that is attached to the problem of obesity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para84">In many walks of life, we are thought to be about five to 10 years behind the United States and constantly playing catch-up. However, obesity is not something on which we want to catch up with the US, where the problem is far more significant than it is here. Sadly, however, that is not to minimise the extent of the problem in this country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para85">In the past decade or so we have, regrettably, been playing catch-up. The statistics, as hon. Members have mentioned, are daunting. About one in 20 boys and one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in 15 girls&#151;or 5.5 per cent. and 7.2 per cent. respectively&#151;aged between two and 15 were obese in 2002, according to the international classification. Overall, more than one in five boys and more than one in four girls were either overweight or obese. Projecting those figures forward 15 years and assuming steady growth suggests that around one third of adults will be obese by 2020. However, if the rapid acceleration in childhood obesity in the past decade is taken into account, the predicted prevalence of obesity among children in 2020 will be in excess of 50 per cent., which is a staggering and extremely worrying statistic.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para86">In the majority of European countries, the prevalence of obesity has increased by between 10 and 40 per cent. in the past 10 years, but in England the rate has more than doubled. Levels of walking and cycling have fallen drastically in recent decades, while the number of cars has doubled. That shows the extent of the decrease in the amount of exercise taken.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para87">Added to those statistics is the equally worrying research carried out by London Metropolitan university, which shows that between 1989 and 1998 the average waistband of a two-year-old girl increased by 5&nbsp;per cent. and that that of a two-year-old boy increased by 4 per cent. An increase in waist size is the most serious problem for health, because it increases vulnerability to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The waistline of a two-year-old girl increased during that decade by 2.5 cm, or 5.2 per cent., and her body mass index increased by 1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent. The waistline of a two-year-old boy increased by 2 cm, or 4.1 per cent., and his body mass index increased by 1.8 per cent. If one takes the average waistline figures alone, there was an increase of 2.9 per cent. over the decade, which is staggeringly and deeply disturbing.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 49WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para88">The question that we must ask ourselves is where we go from here to ameliorate the problem. As many hon. Members have said, the answer is a combination of two things: a healthy, balanced diet and proper exercise. At this time of the year, one often sees people making new year&#039;s resolutions to join a gym and start losing weight, but by the end of January, all their good intentions have gone by the wayside. That is not the way to solve the problem; it is a short-term gimmick, which will not succeed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para89">Instead, we must ensure that there is better education, not only for children in the school system, although that is important, but for parents. There is a lost generation in this country&#151;a generation of couch potatoes who have been all too quick to jump in their cars and to choose a sedentary lifestyle. They are now superimposing that lifestyle on their children, and we are reaping the harvest of that failure. Therefore, we must use the education system to teach young people about the differences between quality food and poor food, between fresh food and processed food. We must also educate them about cooking and about the need to eat fruit and vegetables, of which, to be fair to the Minister, the Government have made great play. Their work in that respect is to be commended, and it is part of an educational programme that we should all welcome. We must educate children about the importance of such issues, in the hope that they will then be able to educate their parents, who are, in many ways, members of a lost generation. In that way, they, too, will be able to pick up on the benefits of a healthy, balanced diet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para90">We must also ensure that people do not eat a disproportionate amount of certain foodstuffs. To my mind, there is nothing wrong with a Big Mac or a KFC once in a while, but when everything is with chips&#151;three times a day, seven days a week&#151;and everything is fast food, rather than part of a balanced diet that includes fresh fruit and vegetables, one has problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para91">Similarly, we must ensure that there is provision for proper exercise in our schools. We must ensure that there is more school sport, by which I mean not only sports lessons, but physical exercise during playtime in the playgrounds. We must ensure that children understand that it is important to walk up or down escalators, rather than just standing there letting the machinery do the work for them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para92">It is also important for children to be able to walk to school, although I accept that there is a serious problem as regards them cycling there, and I suspect that the Minister will agree with me. There has been a dramatic decrease in recent years in the number of school children who cycle or walk to school, and for the first time in our history, fewer than 50 per cent. of children cycle to school. That is because the competing traffic makes many roads too dangerous for them to do so, and parents are unwilling to let them. In certain areas, particularly in the winter, many parents are not happy to let their young children walk to school unescorted in what could be the hours of darkness. All of that has increased the numbers of parents getting into their cars and taking their children to and from school. I am not sure what the answer to that problem is, because it is a difficult issue. However, that does not excuse us from examining it. There are many other aspects to the matter. Before the Government proceed, I urge them to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 50WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
consider that although they may perceive some advertising of certain foodstuffs as poor and unhelpful, advertising can also be used positively, to get positive messages across.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para93">It will seem odd if the Government decide to ban television advertising of foodstuffs for part of the day or before a certain watershed, but not to pursue a ban in other areas of advertising, where there are so many food advertisements. I think that the proposal is unworkable per se, but I urge the Government against a knee-jerk reaction of rushing ahead without considering the whole issue and its implications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para94">The key message is a balanced, healthy diet and more exercise, but it is necessary to educate young people, children and parents, so that we can begin to make an impact and try to reverse a deeply worrying trend that is already having a significant and adverse impact on the health of the nation and individuals.

Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) on raising the issue of obesity in young people. Much public attention has been devoted to the matter in the past few years by influential bodies and the press. That concern is not misplaced, as we all agree.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para95">There is emerging evidence of the effect of obesity on children&#039;s long-term health, including UK researchers&#039; frightening prediction that the increase in obesity threatens to reverse the gains in longevity made during the past 100 years and in some cases could result in parents outliving their children; that is a terrifying thought.

<a name="50125h03_para96">It is well recognised that overweight and obesity increase the risk of coronary heart disease and some cancers, as hon. Members have said. They can also increase the risk of diabetes and hypertension, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate) said, and conditions such as osteoarthritis. All those factors led the National Audit Office to highlight the fact that obesity is responsible for more than 9,000 premature deaths each year in England. That is not many compared with the number of deaths from smoking, but it is still a large number of deaths and a major problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para97">I agree that the problem being stored up for young people is of particular concern to us, as it presents an opportunity to get things right, and those people have the longest lifespan ahead of them.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para100">In response to the remarks of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns), England is not the only country to have experienced a rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity, although rates differ between countries and I entirely accept that we do not want to catch up with the US in this regard. Virtually all population surveys have shown an increase in the past two decades. Several countries, including the US and Denmark, are taking steps to deal with the issue.

Parents mostly fulfil that role, but the state also has responsibilities, as do schools and other organisations, for the well-being of young children. Again, that is uncontroversial.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para104">Our principles are informed choice&#151;much has been said about the importance of giving people more information; personalisation&#151;allowing people to make choices that are tailored to the reality of their lives; and working together. The Government must not only work with individuals; key partnerships are needed to help to deliver these principles. A number of hon. Members have mentioned the important role played by schools and sports clubs. There is huge scope for partnerships to work here in the right way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para105">As a Department we cannot tackle things on our own. We are working with a range of partners&#151;national, regional and local. Action on nutrition includes investment in the five-a-day programme mentioned by some hon. Members, an excellent programme that is leading to changes in eating behaviour at home as well as at school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para106">As hon. Members have cited their own constituencies, I may as well revert to form and do so too. I visited the Green Lanes primary school in my own patch a little while ago and saw children taking part in the school fruit and veg scheme. I was amazed to see even raw mangetouts being consumed with enthusiasm. I am sure that many parents would have been surprised by that. 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 52WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
We must also challenge parental assumptions about what children will and will not eat. The children were gobbling the mangetouts down as if there was no tomorrow; most parents would not have put money on that.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew25"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : The Minister is talking about children gobbling down food. Does she remember the Minister for Sport and Tourism endorsing the Cadbury&#039;s wrapper campaign, in which children had to buy X thousand bars of Cadbury&#039;s chocolate to get a piece of sporting equipment for their schools? If a subsequent campaign were proposed, would the Minister be happy with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport endorsing it, as it did the last campaign?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew26"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Before I call the Minister, perhaps I should get in on the act and declare that I am a life member of Blaydon rugby football club.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew27"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : We are following your lead on these matters now, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Clearly anything like that will be tackled by the Government, as a cross-Government issue, and will be in line with our suggestions in the White Paper.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew28"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : That was not my question.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew29"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : I was amazed that the hon. Gentleman did not ask about avocados and DCMS policy on avocados.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew30"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : Will the Minister give way again?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew31"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : No; I would like to make a little progress.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew32"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : The Minister has not answered my intervention.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew33"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : I will give way one more time.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew34"><b> Mr. Burns </b> : I should be grateful if the Minister would answer the question: would she expect the Government to endorse another wrapper campaign in the way that the Minister for Sport and Tourism endorsed the last one?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew35"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : It is clear that the White Paper policy would not necessarily advocate such support in future. I am sure that we would not expect to see such developments in future. As hon. Members have outlined, we want the Office of Communications to take action about advertising food to children. I myself was commenting on the EU proposals for action last week. We are clear that some food promotions aimed at children, such as toy offers, are extremely unhelpful, as they put pressure on parents and encourage children to try certain foodstuffs or demand more of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para107">It is for all those reasons that we are investing in schemes like the school fruit and vegetable programme, and working with the food industry to reduce fat, sugar and salt. I agree with the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) that we should be tackling all three substances. The progress that we are starting to 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 53WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
make on salt will be replicated, as will the methods of working, when dealing with fat and sugar. We are determined that unhealthy foodstuffs should not be promoted to children by adverts that are clearly aimed at them, during children&#039;s programmes or otherwise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para108">I have already mentioned that we have a public service agreement target. We want to see more action at a local level, and a number of Members have talked about the importance of that. I am delighted by the admission by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley that he is a member of the Clitheroe Wolves. We will not comment about wolves here, but it is clear that a lot of clubs, like Blackburn Rovers football club, have good programmes for helping young people to think through diet and exercise issues, often building self-esteem as well. Such work is enormously valuable and provides leadership in the community. It is difficult to find the kind of leadership that has quite that standing with young people.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew36"><b> Mr. Evans </b> : I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s comments, and pay tribute to everybody who volunteers in the wider community to give our youngsters opportunities to participate in sport outside school. Will she now give a commitment to increase the number of hours for which youngsters can participate in sport in school?
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew37"><b> Miss Johnson </b> : We have made it plain that we expect to see a large investment in school sport. One billion pounds is going into facilities and improvements. Many programmes are designed to increase the number of hours in which children get physical activity each day. There will be a supportive environment through the healthy schools programme, and people have talked about active travel programmes. We are also considering some of what the chief medical officer has set out, including ensuring that children get the 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 54WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
recommended amount of physical activity a day. It is also important to look beyond sport. Sport is important and I entirely endorse its important role, but we must build physical activity into everyday life for children and parents. We should push for people to walk or cycle to school regularly, as they are the kinds of activity that help keep weight down and lead to more cardiovascular activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para109">We are committed to nutritional standards, and to a nutrition-based approach to school meals. Because schools have a lot of freedom, governors can now take action themselves. The school fruit and vegetable scheme has taught us that schools often wait for some other incentive to come along, and introducing that programme then means that they can decide to take action on other issues, such as the food that children bring to school, the wider availability of fruit and vegetables, the availability of water and what the vending machines contain. All those questions are already for the schools to decide, and although they can do a great deal, we will support them and give them more direction, looking at the way that school meals can be used in the school environment and ensuring that healthy schools are developed across the board. It is important to recognise that walking and cycling to school are ways that that can happen.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h03_para110">On the question of the fresh food audits raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford, the local authorities and primary care trusts have been working together in Barnsley, Knowsley and other places. They have identified some of the &quot;food desert&quot; issues, and addressed them through food co-ops.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h03_spnew38"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b> : Order. I am afraid time is up. We have to get on with the other debate, as there is likely to be a Division in the House later.

<i>25 Jan 2005 : Column 55WH&#151;continued</i><br>

<a name="50125h04_head0"><h3 align=center>Rail Services (Worcestershire)</h3>

<a name="50125h04_time0"><h5>3.30 pm</h5>


<p><a name="50125h04_spnew0"><b> Mr. Peter Luff  (Mid-Worcestershire)</b>  (Con): I am extremely grateful for this opportunity to raise an important subject. Worcestershire is overlooked in so many ways and its two principal rail routes to England&#039;s first and second cities are no exception. They are the London line&#151;the Cotswold line, in my case, via Pershore, Evesham and Honeybourne to Oxford&#151;and the Birmingham line, or rather lines, via Droitwich and Bromsgrove, or via Hartlebury and Kidderminster to Birmingham.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para0">This debate is timely for three separate reasons. The first is that the Government are on the verge of assuming responsibility for the Strategic Rail Authority, which is currently taking all the decisions on these lines. The second is that the route utilisation strategies have either just been published or are about to be published for both those routes. The third and most urgent reason is that the franchises are both being redrawn. The Central Trains franchise to Birmingham has been broken up into its component parts and on the Cotswold line a new, Greater Western franchise is being created.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para1">I intend to concentrate on the Birmingham services as that is where I have had the greatest volume of complaints about the quality of service. However, I also attach great importance to the strategic potential of the Cotswold line. Complaints about the Birmingham services soared in late 2003, leading to a local meeting organised in Droitwich with commuters and attended, rather bravely I thought, by Mike Haigh and his colleagues from Central Trains. I pay tribute to him for coming into the lion&#039;s den and braving the wrath of the commuters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para2">For a period after that, things appeared to get better, but the volume of complaints has been rising again. I have heard from the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate in Worcester, Margaret Harper, how many people there have raised the issue with her, and I know from my own postbag just how bad things are for my Droitwich commuters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para3">Let us turn first to the Birmingham services. I received an e-mail a couple of days ago from Jeremy Batt of Ombersley, who said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;I am extremely disappointed with the very poor rail service we get between Droitwich and Birmingham. Last year was pretty awful, with many trains late or overcrowded. Since the changes in timetables in September last year they have got progressively worse. Trains are routinely late, and we receive little or no information about what is happening.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para4">That sums up the situation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para5">I am grateful to Mike Haigh who has provided me with Central Trains&#039; punctuality and reliability information for two key services in each direction, between Worcestershire and Birmingham. The 06.49 from Great Malvern achieves only 63.6 per cent punctuality within 10 minutes. The 07.09 does a bit better at 83.3 per cent but that still means that nearly 17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent of trains are arriving late, beyond 10&nbsp;minutes. Coming back, for the 17.50 from New Street to Worcestershire, only 66.7 per cent of trains make it within 10 minutes and, for the 17.59, the figure is 79.1&nbsp;per cent. Central Trains&#039; own figures show that there is a real problem with punctuality on services in my constituency.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 56WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para6">I am particularly grateful to two of my constituents, Haydn Lloyd and Michael Norris, for the way in which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have kept me up-to-date with their experiences. Mr. Lloyd has sent me detailed logs of his commuting experiences between Droitwich and Birmingham and I quote from his most recent letter, dated 19 December:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Unfortunately the introduction of both the autumn and winter timetables from 26 September and 12 December 2004 has not brought in any improvements in punctuality and reliability. This is illustrated in my logs of the periods for October and November 2004.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para7">He summarises his position by saying:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Total time lost outward and return journey over 11 week period = 12 hours 54 minutes; this includes over a week when I was on leave. Therefore it could have been worse if I had been at work all the time! Regular delays both on the outward and return journeys. Week commencing 13 December 2004 alone I lost 1 hour and 18 minutes on the outward journeys.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para8">Michael Norris, who is a particularly diligent correspondent, told Mr. Haigh in an e-mail of 5&nbsp;January:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;At 17.30, the 17.45 arrival for Stansted was shown to be due at 17.55&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para9">This gets a little complicated but it is important to concentrate as it shows how difficult these things are. He continues:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;but the 17.50 to Droitwich Spa was &#039;on time&#039; which is impossible if the same unit is to be used. It was later announced as being 14&nbsp;minutes late. At 17.50, the 17.50 was announced as arriving at Platform 12b. Instead the 17.59 (two car unit) arrived and everyone overcrowded on to it (at least we had seats on this occasion). With having to wait for the Conductor, we finally departed at 18.15.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">What happened to the 17.50? There was no audible announcement of its arrival but observing passenger movements it could have arrived on 12a and possibly left via the Bordesley loop to Kings Norton. If this was the case, why were we not given the option of transferring to this train particularly if it was to depart before the delayed 17.59?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para10">That may sound rather complicated, but it shows how frustrating it is for passengers at Birmingham stations trying to catch trains to Worcestershire. I am grateful to the Minister of State, Department for Transport for the serious interest he has taken in overcrowding on trains when answering my parliamentary questions and correspondence. Overcrowding is a serious issue on trains to Birmingham.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para11">In an e-mail on 17 October, Martin Whitehouse of Evesham said:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;On Saturday 16th October I had the misfortune to travel on your 1649 hrs service to Great Malvern from Birmingham Moor Street. When the train arrived (15 minutes late!!), it was already quite full. Approximately 100 people were waiting to get on.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Imagine my dismay when we were all crammed in with nowhere to move. I did a quick count and in our carriage, there were as many people standing as were sitting, (approximately 80 people!). This ridiculous state of affairs lasted for about 1 and 1/2 hours, until the train was terminated at Worcester Shrub Hill. The situation was so bad, that 2 passengers had panic attacks, one of them had to leave the train soon after getting on.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">At subsequent stops more people tried to get on than were getting off. Tempers were so frayed by the time we got to Stourbridge Junction that when one of your staff members tried to get us to squash up even closer to allow more passengers on, (a similar number to those at Moor Street), they were prevented from doing so by passengers already on board. I myself had to lean on my wife and daughter for most of the journey, which made it very uncomfortable for them.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 57WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para12">The situation is very bad. That is just some anecdotal information portraying just how bad the services are in our county. At present, services are worse because of the overtime ban caused by the dispute over rest day working. We will not get into that, because it is an industrial relations dispute for Central Trains to sort out with its drivers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para13">Central Trains has made mistakes. Its timetabling has not always been up to the mark. It has allowed inadequate turnaround time for its trains. I am particularly critical of its failure to stop enough trains at Hartlebury, which would provide a valuable service to my constituents in what is an area of population growth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para14">On the subject of population growth, one fundamental problem is that passenger volumes are increasing sharply. There is natural population growth, a sharp increase in housing and the success of the Bull Ring development in Birmingham. All are driving more and more people on to the trains, but there has been no planning for increased capacity to cope with increased volumes on those services. The route utilisation strategy is imminent, and I hope that it will have some important and useful things to say about capacity on those services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para15">I am dismayed by the recently published west midlands regional spatial strategy, which shows no provision for increased investment in transport infrastructure to support the increase in housing in Worcester and Droitwich. We cannot keep cramming into those areas more people who want to commute to Birmingham, unless the transport infrastructure to take them there is provided. There are too many two-car units running, and as four-car units cannot even stop at Bromsgrove station, they are not used on the line. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) supports my view, but she cannot be present today. The Health and Safety Executive must be much more pragmatic about allowing four-car trains to stop at Bromsgrove. Selective door opening is not beyond comprehension; it could and should be achieved. The only long-term solution at Bromsgrove is an extension to enable it to take four-car trains with all doors opening. I hope that my party will include Bromsgrove in a list of priority schemes for improvements, but more must be done now.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para16">Safety is not optional&#151;overcrowded trains are not safe. We have seen some unpleasant accidents at level crossings recently. I was involved in one just over a year ago. People on a seriously overcrowded train could have a much worse experience than those on a train that is acceptably loaded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para17">Signalling, reliability and adequacy are not good enough. Major improvements are due in the Worcester area, I am told, by 2012, with some hinted at this year. However, we urgently need a new signalling section between Worcester and Droitwich to improve capacity on the line. It has been talked about for years, but when will it happen? In Worcester, improved track layout between Shrub Hill and Foregate Street stations would improve train service flexibility, but there is no sign of that happening. It is talked about, but there is a shift right in time terms all the time. It would be a tremendous improvement, offering flexibility to the operators of trains not only on the Birmingham but on the London services.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 58WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para18">There are too many speed restrictions on the line. It is a little known fact that 65 per cent. of all delays on the Birmingham services are still down to Network Rail and not Central Trains. I remain concerned about the primacy of Centro, the passenger transport executive for the west midlands, which seems to be able to call all the shots on the use of rolling stock and services in the wider west midlands. That means that my constituents are left with a worse service than those who have the good fortune to live in the conurbation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para19">The Government plan to make that problem worse by giving more powers to the passenger transport executives. The Secretary of State for Transport was helpful on that point in the House recently, so I hope that he will reconsider his proposals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para20">The size of the franchise area has been too big, which is a problem, although the size is being reduced, which I welcome in principle. However, concerns have been expressed about the continuation of through services in Worcestershire, between Malvern and Droitwich, for example. There are hints that Chiltern Railways, which is the favourite to take on the franchise, does not have the resources to do so. Concerns have also been expressed in the railways press about the thought that has been given to the proposal by the SRA and the Government and about whether they are making things up as they go along&#151;I refer the Minister to the latest edition of <i>Rail </i>magazine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para21">Finally, information on the Birmingham services is a scandal, on trains and at stations, especially at New Street station, but also at University station, Droitwich station, Worcester Shrub Hill station and Foregate Street station. It is confusing for those who are not experts on how the services run to work out exactly what is happening.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para22">That is a brief and rather rapid synopsis of the Birmingham services, but what of the London services? I am talking about a major inter-city route that has for decades been treated as a sideshow by successive nationalised and privatised operators of the railway. The line was downgraded by the old nationalised British Rail and it is now difficult to achieve the vital improvements that are needed. The line still suffers from a dreadful poverty of aspiration, particularly on the part of the SRA. Passenger volumes are high and growing, but could grow much more if the service were not so irregular and if the service in the middle of the day were better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para23">Two to three-hour gaps are a regular feature of the timetable. For example, the service from Evesham to London is okay in both directions at peak times and is serviced by the better Adelante trains. However, after 09.02 the next through train to London leaves at 12.37. There is a train at 13.37, an hour later, and then another three-hour gap, until 16.33. That is not the way to build passenger volume on a potentially lucrative route.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para24">The remedies are more straightforward than on the Birmingham services, although I fully acknowledge that they have a price. For example, there could be minor signalling improvements to address the so-called Evesham double stop&#151;the fact that an inter-city 125 pulls in at Evesham station, stops 100 yd later to exchange tokens at the Evesham signal box and then proceeds to Worcester on a single line section. That is 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 59WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
ridiculous. Even the Severn Valley railway has more modern signalling arrangements than the public railway at that point in my constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para25">We should consider limited re-dualling of the long single track sections. I came here by train this morning and my train was 20 minutes late, largely because we had to wait for a unit coming on to the single line section approaching Moreton-in-Marsh. If there were some passing loops on those single sections, how much better things would be. Full re-dualling of the line should remain on the agenda. I recognise that that is an expensive item and would be some years away, but re-dualling must remain our aspiration for the line.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para26">We could look to the Strategic Rail Authority, and subsequently the Government, to give a higher priority to service levels on the existing infrastructure. I know that First Great Western was anxious to do more on service levels, but that the SRA was not prepared to back it. One major weakness is parking. Parking at Worcester Shrub Hill station is a real problem and I still think that Worcester Parkway station would be one way of encouraging people to drive to the railway and then take a train to their destinations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para27">Worcester Parkway station is discussed in the route utilisation strategy a little dismissively. The strategy seems to suggest that the station is relevant only for Worcester to London services, but it would also be important for Birmingham to Worcester services. The strategy does not refer to the north-south aspect of that station, so I hope that the Strategic Rail Authority, and subsequently the Government, will consider the proposal afresh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para28">The route utilisation strategy is in some ways helpful, but overall a disappointment. It acknowledges the impact of single track sections, which is good, although it is a little optimistic about the impact of Adelante trains on the route, it does not acknowledge the infrequency of service outside peak hours and does not acknowledge any possibility of infrastructure improvements to improve service levels on the line. Page 33 of the strategy says that the stakeholder aspiration is to have a full hourly service on the line, but that that is not recommended. The strategy says that potential demand is
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;insufficient to justify additional resources and risk to performance&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para29">and recommends:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Progress development and appraisal of more limited options in view of potential significant wider economic benefits.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para30">In other words, the strategy recommends tinkering at the margins. That is not good enough on a line that could deliver so much more for the county.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para31">On page 39, we read about the possibility of reducing first-class accommodation on the inter-city 125s that serve the line to increase the standard-class accommodation. I came down this morning. I admit I travelled first class, and it was full. The prospect of reducing first-class accommodation seems to be ludicrous. We should be looking at increasing overall capacity of the line, and not fiddling with the construction and configuration of inter-city 125s.

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 60WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para32">Finally, in the route utilisation strategy, we read with some hope that the aspiration for a so-called &quot;clockface&quot; timetable&#151;an hourly service, in other words&#151;between Oxford and Worcester is not entirely dismissed. It is:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Recommended for further development and appraisal to improve affordability by focusing on more marginal peak timetable enhancement.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para33">That is the extent of the SRA&#039;s aspiration for these crucial services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para34">I have rattled through a list of things, and I gave the Minister some guidance in advance of the kind of things I would be saying, which I hope was helpful. A range of things should and could be done to improve the Droitwich service to Birmingham, involving both Government and regional operators and organisations. It is complex, but it can be done. On the London services, it is fundamentally about improving the infrastructure of the line, but no one is talking about that.
</p>

<a name="50125h04_para35">I use the train as much as I can, not as much as I would like, because of the timings of some of the services. This morning, as I said, I was 20 minutes late. Last week, and I see the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) here, we were both 35 or 40 minutes late. The service is not good enough and needs to be improved. I hope the Minister will have some words of encouragement for our hard-pressed commuters.

<p><a name="50125h04_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Charlotte Atkins) </b> : I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) on securing this debate and on providing an opportunity for us to discuss rail services in Worcestershire. He has raised a number of concerns, which I will try to address.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para36">The White Paper, &quot;The Future of Rail&quot;, published in July 2004, envisaged that the Strategic Rail Authority would be wound up and its responsibilities transferred to various bodies, including the Department for Transport. I assure the hon. Gentleman that those changes will not be detrimental to the efficient re-letting of franchises during the transitional period. The White Paper also announced our intention to consider how rail passenger franchises could be best aligned with Network Rail&#039;s regional and route structure.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h04_spnew1"><b> Mr. Michael Foster  (Worcester)</b>  (Lab): I emphasise the fact that the Department will have a stronger role to play in terms of the organisation of rail services in Worcestershire. Sub-regional capitals such as Worcester need to have a top-class rail service to the regional capital&#151;Birmingham&#151;if my constituents and those of colleagues in Worcestershire are to gain the economic, social and wider environmental benefits that rail services and good public transport links can have. I urge my hon. Friend to use the Department&#039;s newfound influence to put right the historic wrong of the way rail services in Worcestershire have been built up over time.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h04_spnew2"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. It is important that we are now taking control of the railway industry by bringing it back in-house to ensure that the issues that arose from privatisation, where we had a disjointed railway service, can be 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
addressed and that areas such as Worcestershire, and Worcester in particular, can benefit from much more joined-up thinking.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h04_spnew3"><b> Mr. Luff </b> : I do not wish to introduce a partisan note, but with, for example, the London service, the major damage to the railway was done well before privatisation. It is not a function of privatisation that we have a problem in the county. It is much more deep-rooted than that.
</p>




<p><a name="50125h04_spnew4"><b> Charlotte Atkins </b> : The hon. Gentleman has almost implied that privatisation did cause damage. I accept the point that he makes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para37">The changing of the franchise map is part of the commitment to improve the efficiency of our railways. Those changes will help to encourage joint working between track and train in order to deliver an improved service to customers and help to ensure that efficiency savings through economies of scale are maximised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para38">On 19 October 2004, the Secretary of State made a statement on the number of franchises, which included the announcement that, following the expiry of the current Central Trains franchise in 2006, its routes will be distributed into the Silverlink, Chiltern, Virgin Cross Country, Midland Mainline and Northern franchises. Work on remapping the routes currently in the Central Trains franchise is at an early stage and no decisions have yet been made on any potential changes to service levels and patterns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para39">Among the changes to the franchise map announced by the Secretary of State in his statement was the formation of a new Greater Western franchise from existing First Great Western, First Great Western Link, formerly Thames Trains, and Wessex Trains services, following the expiry of current arrangements. The invitation to tender for those services will be issued in the summer and the new franchise is due to run from April 2006. The decision to form the new franchise followed extensive consultation with passenger groups, local and regional stakeholders and the rail industry on the SRA&#039;s policy for single franchise operations at major London stations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para40">The specification for and procurement of the new franchise will be informed by the Greater Western main line route utilisation strategy, which the SRA published for consultation in January. The deadline for responses is 8 April. The RUS aims to make the most efficient use of the existing network, balancing service provision, maintenance access and performance levels, while taking into account anticipated changes in demand. The RUS has come about primarily because of the congestion of train services into Birmingham and rising passenger demand, which we accept. It looks specifically at current crowding and future demand, and will devise a strategy to meet that.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para41">In the consultation document, the SRA acknowledges the aspirations of stakeholders for additional capacity to Worcester and the north Cotswolds. That has been considered as one of a number of options. The RUS notes that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The London-Oxford-Worcester route has a service with certain two-hour intervals and a number of trains operate only between Oxford and Worcester. This option would seek to provide an hourly service with all trains running to and from London.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 62WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para42">The SRA&#039;s current view is that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Initial appraisal indicates that the financial benefits from this option would be outweighed by the cost of additional rolling stock resources leading to an unaffordable increase in subsidy. In addition, performance risk would be high given the intensification of use of a route with several single track constraints.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para43">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#039;s concern about the issues at Evesham. We know that that arises from a rather strange situation where drivers need to stop alongside the signal box to obtain a token from the signalman, giving them permission to pass safely through the single track stretch. Clearly, that should be resolved. Network Rail is examining the possibility of altering the token system, so that the exchange could take place using equipment on the station platform instead of outside the signal box, with the double stopping that exists at present. That would avoid the need to stop twice. The work could be undertaken by the end of 2006, but precise details are not available yet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para44">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of Worcester Parkway. Worcester Shrub Hill is not well placed for current passenger demand and if a new parkway station were to replace Shrub Hill it is thought that it would have a strong business case. That would be further strengthened if a new parkway station were linked to and part funded by new development. The SRA is prepared to consider the replacement of Shrub Hill in these circumstances. The local authority has been invited to consider ways of improving the business case for Worcester Parkway.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para45">The SRA says that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Significant potential wider economic benefits are forecast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it is therefore proposed to undertake further option development and appraisal in order to seek to identify more affordable options&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para46">possibly providing
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;a service which is less frequent in the contrapeak than the peak direction.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para47">The new December 2004 timetable, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, introduced 125 mph class 180 Adelante trains, offering greater capacity and improved on-board facilities to First Great Western Link direct services from Great Malvern to London. For passengers wishing to travel during the day, there are direct trains at 12.21 and 13.21 from Worcester Shrub Hill to London Paddington, each scheduled to take two hours four minutes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para48">I accept that the hon. Gentleman will set those improvements against the reduction in the number of direct services. However, although the December timetable slightly altered the departure times of daytime services, involving a change at Oxford, the journey time remains the same. Furthermore, many journey opportunities are still offered by connections at Oxford on the Great Western line and from Birmingham on Chiltern and Virgin West Coast services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para49">Chiltern Railways currently operates as far as Kidderminster on a limited basis, with five trains to London in the morning and five back in the evening, as an extension of its Birmingham Snow Hill to London Marylebone services. Chiltern Railways also offers the hon. Gentleman&#039;s constituents regular access to stations to London Marylebone through connections provided 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 63WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
by Central Trains at Snow Hill. If Chiltern Railways were to operate services beyond Kidderminster, additional rolling stock would need to be secured for the mileage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para50">Services from Birmingham to Worcestershire will be considered in the forthcoming west midlands route utilisation strategy, which is due for publication in February. There will be a 12-week consultation on that. I am aware that the hon. Gentleman has raised his concerns about overcrowding, particularly on the Central Trains route, on many occasions. The RUS will look specifically at that issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para51">The hon. Gentleman raised the health and safety issue of train doors opening at the platform at Bromsgrove. Selective door opening would be a possibility, but would 
<br>
&nbsp;<br>




<b>25 Jan 2005 : Column 64WH</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
obviously be expensive as all vehicles would have to be modified to include that as an option. Again, cost becomes a crucial issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50125h04_para52">In conclusion, future planning will be informed by the route utilisation strategies on which the SRA is consulting. The Greater Western main line RUS was published earlier this month, and the west midlands RUS is due to be published in February. Those will be used to develop the Greater Western franchise and to examine services between Worcestershire and Birmingham. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other stakeholders, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), will play a full and valuable role in developing the conclusions.
