<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="61214h0001.htm_para1"><a name="06121477000007">This is an important debate in which politicians must show a little more leadership. Many changes that we now see in medicine and in the health service are about human progress and health progress, and the focus of every single Member of Parliament should be on saving lives not buildings. That should be our guiding principle in consideration of health service change, and it is the right way to approach the subject. The issue is difficult, and we know that change in the health service is not easy. However, it is a question of demonstrating political leadership at times in localities, so that the public understand the changes that are proposed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="61214h0001.htm_para2"><a name="06121477000008">I shall put the matter in context. I am pleased that so many members of the Conservative party are present, because it is important that we remind ourselves of the health service situation in 1997, when the infrastructure in which we could deliver safe and high-quality care simply did not exist. There were too many old and inappropriate buildings, and the infrastructure was largely Victorian. According to the King&#146;s Fund, in 1997, the average age of national health service buildings was older than the national health service itself. Capital spending in the latter years of the previous Administration was slashed, and between 1992 and 1997, there was little new development in the fabric of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="61214h0001.htm_para3"><a name="06121477000009">The problems were not only with buildings, but with people. There were staff shortages: 37 per cent. fewer doctors than there are today; 27 per cent. fewer nurses; 36 per cent. fewer allied health professionals; 17 per cent. fewer GPs; and health care scientists could not even be counted separately. The legacy of NHS underfunding created a cumulative under-spend of &#163;220 billion between 1972 and 1998 when compared with the European Union average.</p>

Both units are now under threat, and that is affecting my constituents. Is not it true that the West Sussex primary care trust&#146;s &#163;33 million deficit is due to a formula that was introduced in the past 10 years? There were changes to the formula in 1998 and in 2001. The Minister would be better off addressing that issue rather than engaging in historical analysis, and he would be better off addressing the funding formula rather than trying to downgrade the accident and emergency units at two well loved, highly efficient and clinically excellent hospitals.</p>

so that we provide the very best service to our constituents. I gather that many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s colleagues are present because they want to discuss those changes in the health service. However, I hope that he will permit me to set out the context for those changes. I shall make some progress on those points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="61214h0001.htm_para6"><a name="06121477000020">Back in 1997, the adoption of medical technologies was late and slow, with those people needing medical care being the least likely to receive it. There is a history of widespread hospital closure in the 1980s. The closures, which were opposed by NHS staff, the unions and the public, included one in my constituency where an accident and emergency department was shut down. Since then, there have been far-reaching improvements. After years of low growth, UK funding matches European levels and we have increased capacity. There are now more than 300,000 extra staff, and there are more staff in every main category.</p>

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="06121477000021"><a name="61214h0001.htm_spnew8"><a name="06121477000388"><b>Mr. Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con):</b> I have been alerted to an issue by someone who works in the health service in south Northamptonshire. Apparently, six midwives are supposed to cover that area, their number being down on previous staff levels. There are actually only four midwives because of the cuts, however, and they believe that the service is at breaking point. How does that relate to all the extra staff the Minister is talking about?</p>

It is up to each local health economy to ensure that it has the right number of staff to provide safe and effective services, but if that is not happening in his constituency, I am happy to consider that particular issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="61214h0001.htm_para7"><a name="06121477000023">We have also invested more in training places to secure future staffing levels. Some 10,600 more medical students have entered training since 1997, there has been a major expansion of dental training, and more than 10,000 extra nurses and midwives are being trained than in 1996-97. Facilities have been modernised: there are 54 major new hospitals, 2,850 refurbished or replaced GP surgeries, 520 new one-stop centres and 61 walk-in centres.</p>

Will he take for granted that we have read Lord Warner&#146;s speech, and move on to the subject of this debate, rather than repeat what was said in the House of Lords on 7 December at column 1289 of the <i>Official Report</i>?</p>

The fact is that the infrastructure in which care is delivered has been substantially modernised and improved. That sets the context for this debate. In many places, we have the most modern facilities possible, and I am proud of that. I visited University College hospital earlier this week. It is a superb facility providing possibly the highest-standard health care that the NHS can offer today. It is extremely important that we do not gloss  <br>

Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead will forgive me if I pre-empt the point that he was going to make. I visited Hertfordshire the Monday before last. The people there have been debating for four years how they should respond to changes in clinical practice. The message that the strategic health authority is sending them even now is, &#147;We need greater specialisation and greater concentration of services in major units in order to deliver.&#148; That is what Members of Parliament in Hertfordshire signed up to in the investing in health strategy&#151;they signed up to a new hospital at Hatfield. Just weeks ago, the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust said that, for reasons of affordability, it could not go ahead. What the Minister will tell the House should be happening is precisely the opposite of what is happening. The concentration of services in a new central unit will not happen in Hertfordshire. How does he explain that?</p>

We do not say&#151;I ask him to show me where we say it&#151;that one model of care should be imposed on every community, nor do we take decisions at ministerial level about whether a scheme should go ahead or be scrapped.

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="61214h0001.htm_para8"><a name="06121477000032">The issue is not just about buildings. Recently, there have been enormous improvements in mortality rates. Deaths from cancer in under-75s fell by nearly 16 per cent. between 1997 and 2004&#151;that is 50,000 lives saved. We are on track to reduce deaths from heart disease by 40 per cent., saving 150,000 lives, by 2010. I am immensely proud of those achievements.</p>

He and other Ministers often make the point that, under this Government, deaths from coronary heart disease have decreased by 150,000 since 1997. However, one of his colleagues answered a question on similar terms. Health Ministers were asked how many lives had been saved from coronary heart disease between 1979 to 1997, so will he confirm that the answer was that 535,000 lives had been saved from coronary heart disease and premature mortality in the preceding18 years, compared with the 150,000 that he mentioned?</p>

The national service framework introduced by this Government for coronary heart disease made an immediate and important change to the care of coronary heart disease patients when it was introduced in 2000. That change came with the change in Government. As a result, a large number of people in the hon. Lady&#146;s constituency and mine were prescribed statins, and a much greater emphasis was placed on preventive health care. Hon. Members might be claiming that the national service framework had no impact on the health of coronary heart disease patients, but I am not sure what intellectual credibility that argument would have with specialists in the field.

Many of the commitments in the White Paper were developed with that in mind. For example, we are supporting a procurement exercise to secure more primary care services where the number of GPs is insufficient and people have to travel some distance to visit a doctor. We will also be testing advanced assistive technologies, such as telecare, that would enable frail and elderly people with long-term conditions to be more independent and reduce the need for frequent visits to hospitals and doctors.

The advent of some of the more personalised pharmaceutical technologies will lead to far more different treatments.

They are treating far more patients at that level who would previously have had to go to hospital for an out-patient appointment.

Before such steps are considered, it is important that proper capacity should be developed on the ground. In areas where there have been substantial LIFT schemes, I would argue that there is that capacity. What is required is a change in culture and thinking, possibly with hospital-based consultants bringing services out to the patient and perhaps providing them to an even higher standard, because the patient will be treated closer to home, which is a good thing in itself. In many parts of the country, there is the potential to start to bring services out.</p>

births in each of eight units. The Minister talks about clinicians. I have been to Macclesfield district general hospital and to Fairfield general hospital in Bury, and the clinicians there believe that they are providing a safe service. Macclesfield has obstetric cover, anaesthetic cover, neonatology cover, paediatric back-up and a dedicated obstetric operating theatre. Even though they have fewer than 2,000 live births, the clinicians there believe that their safety record justifies the maintenance of their service.

It looked at the number of neonatal deaths in southern California in 1991 in places where children were of low birth weight and there was no regional neonatal intensive care unit. I accept the proposition that babies of low birth weight should not be born in places where there is no good neonatal intensive care, but that does not stretch to the proposition that the larger the maternity unit is, the better it is. What is the Minister&#146;s evidence? Given that the largest maternity unit in Germany, for example, has 4,000 births, and 3,000 births is about as large as it gets in France, why do we in Britain have to go to 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 live births and deny mothers the access and choice that they need?</p>

In recent years the NHS has improved the services that it offers, and waiting lists are at a record low, but we are building on that.

A range of factors has an influence on how health care funds are allocated. It is right to say that the funding formula that was in operation for many years&#151;certainly under the Conservative Government&#151;was largely age-driven. The age component of that funding formula&#151;and I acknowledge that it was not just age-related&#151;was given more weight than now. However, I hope that the hon.

Leigh probably has a lower burden of disease than Eastbourne simply because, although it may have greater areas of deprivation, the average age is considerably lower. The Minister can see in the evidence on deficits to the Select Committee that the burden of disease rises significantly and the principle determinant of morbidity is age. Will he now accept what the Health Committee accepted on the evidence that it received&#151;that the resource allocation formula requires review, and consideration should be given to actual need rather than proxies of need? That is precisely our point. Let us find out, in the formula, what is actually required to deal with disease in an area, rather than simply use deprivation indices.</p>

Friends are not listening, but perhaps they will listen to this&#151;said that, yes, the burden of disease is probably higher in Leigh than in South Cambridgeshire. Therefore, Leigh, under his funding formula, should get more money than South Cambridgeshire. That is the logic of his funding formula.

Health services are different in different parts of the country because health needs are different. However, on the subject of GPs, if he were to go to Worthing, Eastbourne or Bognor Regis and speak to any of the GPs there, they would tell him that an 85-year-old requires, on average, twice as much attention from a GP as a 75-year-old. We are talking about extra-old weighting. If the Minister is now saying that we will lose GPs, we will have serious problems because of the requirements of our elderly population.</p>

Gentleman&#146;s position. I do not accept the argument&#151;this is the nub of the debate&#151;that an 85-year-old needs more attention from a GP because she is 85. We know that cancer patients, stroke patients and coronary heart disease patients will need help from a GP and access to their time. The fact that somebody is old does not necessarily mean that they will be a high consumer of health services.

It will mean more vertical integration of services with more services where GPs and consultants work more closely together. That will benefit the patient because it will offer quicker care. It will put services in the right setting and the right location. Conveniently for them, it will allow consultants time to spend with the cases that they really need to see.</p>

It is in that challenge that politicians need to show leadership. They need to speak up for change where the clinical community says that it is in the best interests of the local population. That challenge falls to every hon. Member, and if we can grasp that challenge I am confident that we will build a national health service that is better able to meet the needs of the British public well past its 60th year, into many further decades.</p>

Last weekend at six o&#146;clock on Saturday, at Worthing hospital, the mayor of Worthing together with patients and others&#151;with Labour people, Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and people without party all taking part&#151;started a 24-hour vigil. During those 24 hours, 10 new mothers had their babies delivered safely, three by section. It is not obvious to anybody in Worthing why mothers should either have to have their babies at home or travel for40 minutes to an hour down the road to go to another hospital. Accident and emergency saw and treated147 patients, 24 of whom were admitted. I think that the Minister would accept that if they were admitted, they needed to be in hospital. Such cases cannot be treated at home; they should not be expected to go for 40 minutes to an hour down the road to another hospital. Four people had moderate or severe injuries as the result of accidents and the hospital&#146;s trauma team was in attendance awaiting the arrival of the ambulance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para0"><a name="06121477000152">In the week before the vigil, the Prime Minister put his name to the estimate that if people could be taken straight to the relevant hospital, 500 lives a year could be saved. That would be a worthwhile total. Such a hospital could give angioplasty straight away&#151;Worthing hospital can do so. It would be good if the Prime Minister were not quoted by other parts of the health service as saying that his words will save lives when the consultants at Worthing say that they could provide the angioplasty themselves and that if people from A and E at Worthing had to go down the A27 to Brighton, to Chichester or to Portsmouth lives would be lost. Clearly, such issues are a matter of balance.</p>

a strategic health authority or primary care trust should have information of that nature without the MP being informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para3"><a name="06121477000155">I return to what happened during the 24-hour vigil. The intensive therapy unit was running at full capacity, treating critically ill patients. The high dependency unit was full to capacity. There were 500 beds available throughout the Worthing and Southlands hospital trust, and fewer than 13 were unoccupied. That does not strike me as being a reason to downgrade a hospital or to close it.</p>

In total,35 patients were admitted. That is estimated to be more than are admitted to many of the big London teaching hospitals, and I do not think that anyone is going around suggesting that one of those should be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para4"><a name="06121477000158">Two heart attack patients were treated in the coronary care unit. There were three cardiac arrests. The hospital team assessed, resuscitated and stabilised one critically ill patient and provided medical management for the ambulance transfer to the regional specialist unit. Co-operation across the region for Worthing and other hospitals happens as it does in other parts of the country. That has not changed in terms of medical and clinical practice and it is not likely to change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para5"><a name="06121477000159">In the 24-hour period, four patients had their broken hips replaced or repaired. That could not happen at home and need not happen 40 minutes to an hour down the road at Brighton, Chichester or Portsmouth. Radiographers took 144 X-rays. We might at some stage have portable X-ray equipment, but at the moment it is probably better that X-rays take place in hospitals, so that will not be transferred to the community although I recognise that GPs are capable of doing more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para6"><a name="06121477000160">The Minister rightly referred to developments in audiology. I want to add that he could have said that audiology is excluded from the &#147;Let&#146;s have no more than 18-week waiting times in two years&#146; time&#148; target. In Worthing, and I suspect in many other places, the waiting time for a 20-minute hearing test is more than two years. Someone aged 89 whose hearing might have deteriorated and who plays their radio or television&#151;often their only companion&#151;at a level that disturbs their neighbours who live above, below or either side of them if they live in a semi-detached property, has to wait more than two years for a 20 minute procedure and then face an emergency block on capital spending ordered by the strategic health authority so the &#163;71 for the hearing aid is not allowed.

hospital in Brighton, to which it is possibly proposed to transfer the A and E admissions from Worthing&#151;some 63,000 last year&#151;was on divert for its ambulances to go to Worthing A and E department. The hospital in Brighton could not cope with the level of work that it already had, let alone take on what it might have to in the future, which would be a large proportion of that 63,000 if these crazy proposals go ahead.</p>

If we have 3,500 staff in our hospital trust and if more than 1,000 patients a day are treated and many of those patients have family or friends who bring them in or come to visit and use the car park, diverting those patients to a hospital with no easy access either by public or private transport would make life worse rather than better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para8"><a name="06121477000164">I return to what happened in the 24 hours from 6 pm on Saturday to 6 pm on Sunday. There were 144 X-rays, and four patients had CT scans in the new scanner. There were hundreds of blood tests: 115 patients had haematology tests and 119 had biochemistry tests. The blood groups of 60 patients were determined, 30 units of blood were cross-matched for administration and two patients required haemodialysis and ITU to treat acute renal failure. During the day, before the vigil started, 20 patients had regular dialysis for chronic renal failure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para9"><a name="06121477000165">On that day 22,000 litres of oxygen were given; 3,000 litres of nitrous oxide were given; 345 litres of intravenous fluids were given and administered through 500 metres of intravenous tubing; and more than 1,000 syringes were used. I doubt whether all that treatment could easily be transferred into the community; and I do not see why it should have to be transferred, along with the staff, 3,500 patients and their families and friends, who would have to go by minibus from Worthing to a hospital in Brighton or Portsmouth along the A27, especially as the road is often blocked. It seems to me that if the staff, the patients, and the family and friends are in one town&#151;the biggest town in west Sussex&#151;the patients probably ought to be treated in the hospital where they are treated at the moment. Ministers have rightly taken credit for continuing investment in that hospital; it started before 1997, but I assume that we can be non-party political about it and share the credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para10"><a name="06121477000166">I move on. That 24-hour period saw the administration of &#163;20,000 worth of drugs, with pharmacy staff dispensing more than 200 prescriptions. That weekend, a total of 28 patients had surgery. The operations lasted from30 minutes to 10 hours. Such operations could not have taken place in a GP&#146;s surgery or a one-stop clinic. On Saturday afternoon, while others may have been watching football, four operating theatres were running simultaneously. It was a quiet weekend; 1,000 patients are normally seen and treated every weekday.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para11"><a name="06121477000167">None of that is a criticism of the Minister; it is a description of what we take for granted from the support staff, the nurses, the doctors and the managers in our health service, and I do not exclude the family doctor service and clinics, as many patients were referred by their GPs. There is much co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para12"><a name="06121477000168">I hope that those figures help to illustrate the debate, but it is wrong to say that we could do without one or even two acute hospitals in west Sussex. We do not want two towns to get into a fight; we believe that we have an established service that can be adapted and that can evolve, but we do not want people trying, in effect, to wreck one of our centres of excellence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para13"><a name="06121477000169">I hope that we can spend some time talking about funding. I illustrate the point to the Minister, but I do not wish to get into an argument; we should resist that temptation. In my constituency, people live at the same address for an average of 14 years. That is twice the national average. Many people come to the area in their maturity. Someone who retires to the constituency at the age of 65, perhaps from an inner-city area, may live there for 14 years, but it is during the last eight years&#151;often the last four years and frequently the last 18 months&#151;that they make most demands on the health service. Those demands would be roughlythe same if they had been less fortunate and been ill at the age of 55. However, if people do not spend their healthy years in our constituencies, but spend only their mature years there&#151;the times when they are ill&#151;the funding formula clearly cannot continue as it is. I shall not elaborate on that. The Minister is clever enough to understand the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para14"><a name="06121477000170">We are also suffering dramatically from the penalty formulas for hospitals in deficit, and that has had an impact on our medical and clinical practices. The Government now understand that the penalty system introduced in 2000-01 is not only inappropriate but that it must end. If our hospital has apparently overspent by &#163;10 million, it will have to save that money the following year. That is a &#163;20 million hit, and it is wrong. I hope that the Minister accepts that that needs to change. Hospitals are being told first that they will lose 3 per cent. for one reason or another, secondly that they will lose their penalty money and thirdly that they will have to repay it. In addition, they are under instruction from the strategic health authority that no consultant with a space in their clinic is allowed to see a patient referred in the past eight weeks by a GP. Such interference from the centre is totally unjustifiable&#151;unless the Minister wants to justify it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para15"><a name="06121477000171">Finally, funding problems affect doctors in training&#151;people who are cheerfully called junior doctors even though they may be 37 years old and just about to take a consultant&#146;s role. The SHA, I think on instruction centrally from the NHS, has been told that junior doctors in training will have none of their training costs reimbursed for the rest of the year. That is an in-year imposition. If that is untrue, I hope that the Minister will say so. If he does not contradict me, we must assume that I am correct. However, although the information may be correct, it is the wrong thing to have done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para16"><a name="06121477000172">Health Ministers have a difficult job, especially as during this last year the chief executive of the health service has changed twice, every strategic health authority in England seems to have changed and primary care trusts and personnel have changed. Many hospital trusts also have new chief executives or chairmen. It is a miracle that we still have as much medical service as we have.</p>

Even his Whip seems to have deserted him. Secondly, I and all my hon.

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para19"><a name="06121477000176">I recently had a meeting with my campaign group and the chairman and non-executive directors of our local PCT. Although they are clearly concerned about issues, such as accessibility and others that have been touched on during the debate, they are restricted by what the NHS tweely calls the financial envelope within which they have to operate. I had a meeting with the SHA a few weeks ago, at which the Minister was present. The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)&#151;Hastings and Eastbourne are part of the same hospital trust&#151;asked whether, if the PCTs were happy to commission roughly speaking the services that we already have, what would happen. No real answer came from the SHA, but I suspect that if it is not part of the overall plan they would not be allowed to get away with it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="61214h0004.htm_para20"><a name="06121477000177">I stress that we are not being luddites in our various campaigns in the south of the country. We appreciate that day surgery is a massive change in practice. Indeed, my hospital in Eastbourne has one of the highest rates for day surgery and it intends to improve even on that. We appreciate that new drugs and treatments are making a substantial difference. Of course it has always been true and always will be that really serious cases will be referred&#151;serious children&#146;s conditions to Great Ormond Street hospital, or serious head injuries to Hurstwood park hospital, and so on. We are not trying to stand in the way of progress or change. However, it is important for all who take an interest in the matter, including the Minister, that there is a proper debate about changes in medical and clinical practices. I have yet to hear from the Minister what is the distinction between them. Perhaps it is a distinction without a difference.</p>

As recently as August 2004, a detailed clinical review carried out by the trust concluded that maternity facilities should remain on both sites&#151;Eastbourne and Hastings. What has changed since then, in barely two years? The road communications are just as bad: 21 miles of poor roads between Eastbourne and Hastings. The population continues to rise with a lot of new house building&#151;much of it imposed by Labour Ministers&#151;and the requirements of the population in terms of maternity and other needs have increased.</p>

I understand that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has a gold standard of half an hour between deciding to perform a Caesarean operation and actually performing it.

There are also some so-called temporary closures in the offing&#151;particularly for paediatrics. One thing we know about the NHS is that temporary closures have a habit of becoming permanent and part of the status quo. I have some real concerns, which I hope that the Minister will take seriously, about the way that this process is operating. He has talked about political issues, but it would be fundamentally anti-democratic and bad for the whole system if my constituents felt that they were being invited to take part in a public consultation that may not now start until the end of January when some of the options have already been removed from the table.</p>

constituency, but all of them serve my constituents and all are in the firing line when it comes to the potential downgrading of A and E and maternity facilities. They already face difficulties. Between the four trusts that serve my constituency, 1,000 jobs have been cut, or there has been an announcement that they will be cut, and 100 beds have been lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="61214h0005.htm_para7"><a name="06121477000200">The principal concern that I want to articulate on behalf of my constituents, who are watching the progress of the proposals with enormous anxiety, is the travel distances and times that will be involved if they have to go to units that are much further away from them than the units are currently. Right in the middle of my constituency, in the downs, is a little village called Washington. There is even a place called the White house in Washington, to which I have been&#151;that is almost certainly the first and last time that I will ever have tea in the White house in Washington. At the moment, the nearest hospital&#151;Worthing hospital&#151;is just 8 miles from Washington. Should Worthing be downgraded, the travel times involved in going to an A and E department could increase by 2.5 to 5 times, if patients have to travel as far as Portsmouth. I could make that argument across my constituency. People, particularly the elderly population, are extremely worried about the increase in travel times that they may have to face, not just for A and E services, but for other treatments that they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="61214h0005.htm_para8"><a name="06121477000201">Someone came to my constituency surgery the week before last who was having cancer treatment in Brighton. She lives in the middle of my constituency and was already having to make a round trip of some 40 miles three or four times a week for treatment. That was taking hours out of her day and she was extremely worried about it. That is the prospect faced not just by a minority of people in my constituency but, potentially, a majority if the acute facilities that I am talking about are moved away from them. Furthermore, people face a potential increase in travel times along roads that the Government have continually failed to upgrade. The A27 in particular does not resemble anything like a coastal highway; it is a coastal car park. People are worried about the travel times for ambulances should there be additional travel times to A and E facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="61214h0005.htm_para9"><a name="06121477000202">We are constantly told that the reconfiguration is about bringing new facilities closer to people&#146;s homes and delivering great centres of excellence in what the Minister called &#147;regions&#148;&#151;in this case, in Brighton and Portsmouth. The point is that we have seen no credible or costed proposals for the services that are meant to be brought closer to communities. We have seen none. In a rearguard action the Prime Minister started a few weeks ago to make the case for the changes and the documents by Sir George Alberti and Professor Boyle were published. Those documents amount to just seven and 12 pages respectively. They include many attractive photographs, anecdotal argument and diagrams, but no costings whatever. It is impossible to make a judgment on whether the proposed reconfiguration of health care will be financially sustainable or will save money, which is presumably what it is intended to do, when no costings have been provided either locally or nationally. There may well be a strong case for saying that bringing care closer to people&#146;s homes will be more expensive.</p>

That is precisely the point. For their own purposes, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are trying to weld those two things together to create an impression that this is all finance driven, rather than safety driven. If the hon.

The local trusts and the health authorities are clear that the reason why the proposals are being considered in relation to acute hospitals is to save money. The closure of major hospitals&#151;at one point, it was even being considered that we would have no acute facilities in West Sussex at all; now, apparently, we have a reprieve and will possibly have one where there are currently three&#151;is designed to save money, and the Minister should not pretend otherwise.</p>

Yes, 250,000 people have already signed petitions across West Sussex. That is a staggering number and it will increase. People are going out on cold evenings to hold 24-hour vigils because they are immensely concerned about what is going on. They are, quite rightly, subscribing to the notion of something that the Government constantly espouse&#151;patient choice. The question that I put to the Minister is: if people are not to be allowed to choose to keep their local hospital, which is what they clearly want, what does patient choice mean?</p>

From that moment on, they were banned from talking to the press at all. Indeed, some of those whom I met recently feared that they could not even talk to their local Member of Parliament because of that stricture.

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="61214h0005.htm_para25"><a name="06121477000223">I found particularly reprehensible the Minister&#146;s suggestion that the Opposition are scaremongering. What are MPs supposed to do when documents such as &#147;Fit for the Future&#148; are published telling us that major trauma A and E departments in our constituencies are to be closed? Of course, our constituents will be extremely concerned about that. What are we supposed to do when we find that there is no evidence base for the suggestion that there might be improvements in health care as a result of such a publication? The Minister effectively admitted as much today when he told us that he and his Department have only just started to collect the evidence required to justify the proposed changes that have already been published. We know that this is policy making on the hoof and is about money, not clinical practice. Indeed, senior people in the NHS have told us as much. It is a charade to pretend otherwise, and it will not do the Minister any good if he has another go at trying to pretend that it is something to do with clinical practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="61214h0005.htm_para26"><a name="06121477000224">We know what is going on: the Government are trying to save money by closing district general hospitals, replacing them with a smaller number of large critical care hospitals and perhaps creating new urgent care centres. We have no idea what urgent care centres are supposed to do or deliver. Nobody knows; the Government do not know. Neither do they know what savings those centres might generate. What we do know is that the policy will lead to a reconfiguration of health care in West Sussex, which will mean the hollowing out of virtually all trauma A and E provision in the county.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="61214h0005.htm_para27"><a name="06121477000225">In an effort to find out what urgent care centres might do, I gave the SHA a detailed 18 or 20-page response to &#147;Fit for the Future&#148; in which I asked a large list of questions, none of which it has answered. Of course, it does not know the answers, and the Minister himself has admitted that he does not know them either. We do not know whether any of the proposed services can be brought in safely. We do not know whether a business case has been put together that accommodates the fact that counties such as West Sussex have large rural areas in which many elderly people live alone.</p>

We do not know whether or how GPs are to be trained to develop the specialist skills required to plug the gap. </p>

Surely, the argument for specialisation points to the need to continue to provide such care in district general hospitals, not to give it to someone whose main function is to do other worthy work, as is the case with GPs. The GPs in my area have made that point to me  <br>

vigorously. So it is not only clinicians in hospitals who have made that point, but GPs themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para1"><a name="06121477000228">I repeat that I have received no answers to any of my questions. I do not ask the Minister to respond now. I shall write to him with the list of the questions and I would be grateful if he would have a go at answering them. The plain fact is that the evidence does not exist. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para2"><a name="06121477000229">That leads me to one last major point: at policy level, the strategic handling of this issue has been nothing short of catastrophic. We had the publication of &#147;Fit for the Future&#148;, which was so mangled by the people who know most about it&#151;the clinicians, the GPs and a good number of the health managers&#151;that it has effectively been withdrawn. The consultation was apparently initiated by the strategic health authority, but halfway through it was taken over by the primary care trust. The PCTs have been merged, and there have been endless delays on the start of the consultation period, and we still do not know when that will begin. We also remain unsure about who will ultimately be taking this decision, the PCT or the SHA. If something as strategic as this will not be decided by a strategic health authority, we must ask what an SHA is for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para3"><a name="06121477000230">We must also consider the shocking ignorance of Ministers, including the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), about even the most basic questions involved in this reorganisation. For example, she told Mrs. Ellis, a constituent of mine who had written to her, that she should write to Steve Phoenix who, she said, was in charge of the consultation. He has been replaced by John Wilderspin. My constituent was told to write to Western Sussex PCT, but that has been abolished. My constituent was also told that the consultation would begin &#147;in the autumn&#148;&#151;the letter from the Minister of State was dated 13 November. Yet she chaired a meeting at which this Minister and I heard the chief executive of the strategic health authority announce, in response to a question, a delay in the consultation until the end of the year, if not until 2007. That extraordinary ignorance about what is going on&#151;it is as if she does not care at all about the effects of these changes&#151;leads my constituents to be deeply sceptical and worried about the whole process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para4"><a name="06121477000231">I implore this Minister to do three things. First, he should not make changes until the evidence has been collected. The clear indication that he has given today is that such a process might only now be occurring. If it is, it is deeply reprehensible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para5"><a name="06121477000232">Secondly, he should reconsider the increased weighting that was put into the additional need adjustment&#151;the deprivation formula&#151;as a matter of urgency. Something has gone seriously wrong in the allocation of national health service funding across the country as a whole. The deprivation weighting has given huge increases to some areas where life expectancy is lower, but few people in the NHS believe that extra health spending in those areas, when channelled through hospitals, can tackle the problem of lower life expectancy. That is largely a problem of lifestyle and not of hospital care. The consequence is that a large amount of money is probably being wasted and inefficiently used, and because there is a limited national pot, money is being taken from areas such as ours, which have increased need as a result of the ageing of the population.</p>

Perhaps that is because they have taken to heart the instructions of their former leader, David Steel, and they have all gone back to their constituencies to prepare for Christmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para8"><a name="06121477000236">There is a rising sense of anger in my constituency. We do not have an acute hospital in Bexhill and Battle.

We also know that it is preparing to downgrade accident and emergency on one of the sites. We will lose 24-hour accident and emergency provision at Hastings or at Eastbourne, which would be very serious.

in my constituency is saying that there should never be any change. But people want the case for change to be made on clinical grounds and on sound medical evidence based on proven research, and not on the basis of assertions from Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para11"><a name="06121477000239">Nine months ago, I met the chief executive and the chairman of the trust at their office in the Conquest hospital in Hastings. They had just published a review discussing the overall configuration of health care in the area. The primary concern of the senior staff of the trust earlier this year was the long-term threat posed by the potential building of a new hospital at Pembury in Kent, some 30 miles to the north, which could happen some time in the next decade. They saw that as being the primary threat to services at the Conquest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para12"><a name="06121477000240">Just a few months later, however, the picture had changed completely. This had nothing to do with the publication of new research or with the bringing forth of new clinical evidence; it was entirely concerned with the financial crisis at the SHA, which cascaded down to my hospital trust and meant that, in 2005-06, the hospital will have run up a deficit of close to &#163;5 million. At the instruction of the SHA, it will have to claw that back to a deficit of just over &#163;3 million in 2006-07&#151;some &#163;2 million-worth of cuts have to be made in the current 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para13"><a name="06121477000241">That is not about moving care closer to the community, providing more effective care for patients in my area or raising health standards; it is about the cold, harsh reality that money has been lost elsewhere. My constituents are having to pay the very real health price and, as other colleagues have said, they already feel discriminated against by the unfair system that benefits constituencies in the north of the country&#151;Labour&#146;s friends in the north&#151;and discriminates against the older population, which is often very poor, along the south coast. The household income in east Sussex is the same as that in Hull. Pensioners, by and large, are not very prosperous and to talk of my area being affluent is absolute nonsense when so many people are over 85 and dependent on fixed incomes. The argument about affluence simply does not wash in my part of the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="61214h0006.htm_para14"><a name="06121477000242">The case for not having just one maternity site in Eastbourne or Hastings has already been well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. If the site in Hastings, for example, were closed, people would be hard pushed to get from the east of my constituency near Rye&#151;for example, Northiam&#151;across to Eastbourne in less than 50 minutes. That is totally unacceptable. It is not bringing health care closer to the community, but moving it further away. It would make it not only more difficult from the health care point of view, but much more difficult for friends, relations and partners to visit at an important time in a woman&#146;s life when she is dependent on not just medical support, but on the support of her family and partner.</p>

In my part of the country, Northiam surgery, for example, has been campaigning for three years. I have even been to see Lord Warner to try to get a minute amount of capital funding to expand the surgery. That could be done very well, but the funding is simply not available.

Along with it will go the brand new stroke and cardiac units, the MRI scanner and all acute facilities. Their closure marks the end of acute facilities in my general hospital. At the same time, the trust is going ahead with its removal of elective surgery to St. Albans. It means that in 18 months&#146; time, not one in-patient bed will be left in a general hospital that caters for the largest town in Hertfordshire.

Perhaps that is not fair because the parliamentary candidate was there&#151;I apologise; it is just that there are not that many Liberals in my part of the world.

Hemel Hempstead hospital is in the heart of the town, with the best road links anywhere in Hertfordshire. The investment has been made, but the decision has been made to close the hospital completely. The Committee report said that the measures were short-term, and I passionately believe that. I asked the trust chief executive whether he would make such devastating cuts to services if the trust were not in deficit and if the strategic health authority and the Government were not forcing it to cut back so much to rebalance its accounts. The director of medicine, who is brand new to the area, stood up at the meeting and said, &#147;Of course I wouldn&#146;t. These clinical cuts would not be taking place if it were not for the deficits of my trust and PCT.&#148;</p>

As we heard, she said that the people in Hertfordshire are healthier than people in Leicestershire. It was the most astoundingly arrogant comment I have ever heard from a Secretary of State. However, no Opposition Member and none of our constituents is calling for parity throughout the country. We are not saying that everyone should receive exactly the same funding.</p>

We could discuss clinical need and reconfiguration based on clinical effectiveness, but we are not doing so. We are discussing them based purely on the fact that the trust in my constituency does not receive enough money to look after the acute needs of my constituents. That situation is in the public domain, and it is wrong.</p>

It is not just a case of Conservatives demonstrating with banners. With my past, I have not been on the demonstrators&#146; side in many demonstrations. I have certainly been on the other side trying to prevent some of them, although I must stress that that was in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.

At one point, I thought that we should adjourn to Star Chamber Court, as that would suit the occasion better than Westminster Hall. The debate has shown the depth of the suspicion of Government intentions regarding the NHS and hon. Members&#146; laudable concerns about facilities in their constituencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para10"><a name="06121477000287">There is a definite pattern in the critique arranged here against the Government, but the debate is about changes to medical and clinical practice. Medical science does indeed change and advance, and it informs medical practice. Undoubtedly, that has implications for medical service, as do people&#146;s expectations of that service and the resources available. Those are all factors, but clinical auditing and learning and applying lessons and knowledge is, as we all agree, crucial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para11"><a name="06121477000288">Major advances have undoubtedly been made, and it would be churlish not to point to some of them. The treatment of chronic conditions has improved. I am thinking of improvements such as the expert patient programme, of which I was initially quite sceptical. I thought that people went to doctors because they were not experts and did not know what was wrong with them, but when it was explained to me that the programme was about long-term management and ownership of treatment, I accepted that it was very useful and kept patients from constantly needing to have recourse to the doctor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para12"><a name="06121477000289">Drug management is better than ever before, as are drugs. Specialist nurses are in the community and expertise is cascading out of the acute hospital and down to GP level where it is more accessible. Equally, I could point to advances in acute service and the treatment of acute conditions. There are more rapid interventions; we all know about our highly skilled ambulance service and how well kitted out they are to deal with almost any eventuality. More sophisticated interventions are available in hospitals&#151;perhaps not in all, but in many&#151;as well as less invasive interventions such as keyhole surgery. Procedures are done on an out-patient basis that might have led previously to a long hospital stay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para13"><a name="06121477000290">Progress has also been made in dealing with the natural hazards of life, such as maternity. Better pre-natal and post-natal care have shortened hospital stays; that certainly shows up in statistics. For conditions such as senility, supported living has reduced the need for institutional care. As always throughout history, though, many of the big effects, benefits and challenges to the therapeutic sector come from the public health sector. The modern demons of obesity, drunkenness and smoking are fast replacing the ancient demons of poor sanitation and insufficient nutrition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para14"><a name="06121477000291">I think that the outline account that I have given of the development of medical services would generally be agreed with.

drawn from it. One contentious conclusion is that we need fewer hospitals, that we need hospitals to do less and that we need to centralise facilities. That is the Government subtext to this debate. It is ostensibly about medical development, but it is actually about rationalising clinical provision and reconfiguring service.</p>

Quite evidently from Members&#146; testimony here, it leads to massive protests, loss of political support for the Government&#151;as is manifest in the polls&#151;and public anxiety. The Government could conclude that they need to find a better way to put the message&#151;to refine it and deliver it slightly better, because somehow or other, people are not getting the point. Perhaps we must be told that it is not about cost, even though we know the stories about deficits and we know how deficits influence decisions, and that it is not about politics, even though we know the stories about heat maps and how Ministers agonise about the political effects of what they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para15"><a name="06121477000294">We know the Government&#146;s story that it is not about fewer hospitals but about more community care, and we know that research has been published saying that that policy will save more lives. The Institute for Public Policy Research said that if super-hospitals provide most service, it will save something like 1,000 lives. Quite how it manufactured that figure I do not know, but it did. When stuck, the Government will even say, &#147;Doctors want it.&#148; Well, some doctors do. Sir Liam Donaldson said:</p>
<a name="61214h0007.htm_brev0"><a name="06121477000367"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Doctors need to take charge. Many of them privately see the need to make changes, but they feel intimidated when faced by the public waving placards.&#148;</p>

That is a strategy that they might wish to pursue, but I regard it as entirely doomed. It will not work, it is totally impossible and it will not benefit them in the least at the end of the day. If the Minister is wise, he will be thinking of a better or alternative strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para17"><a name="06121477000296">Cost cannot be kept out of the equation. It was proposed recently that accident and emergency should move out of my constituency. It did not happen&#151;the medical people objected to it&#151;but the people who proposed it were not go-ahead clinicians who saw a new way to deliver effective services. They were McKinsey &amp; Company, the consultants who had been brought in for a few weeks to investigate how to save money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para18"><a name="06121477000297">Politics cannot be kept out of it, or why would heat maps have been debated? The Government cannot specify the benefits of community care when it is relatively undeveloped and patchy at the moment. Blood testing in one of the hospitals in my constituency has been moved out of the ward and into a clinic. Fine, but the clinic is at the end of the constituency. In terms of accessibility, it is no better than the hospital was. People find it more difficult to access the blood service than they did when it was at the hospital.</p>

realise that. Even the argument that lives will be saved rather than lost is a little flaky. One cannot argue, as Dr. Roger Boyle does, that it makes a huge difference that 83 per cent. rather than 38 per cent. of heart patients now receive hospital treatment within30 minutes, and then argue that it makes little difference how long it takes to get to the hospital. The Government cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para20"><a name="06121477000299">I suggest that rather than refining the message&#146;s delivery or constructing a better way to present unacceptable policy, the Government should seek to re-examine the message itself. Public instincts on matters as basic as health are rarely far off the mark. Paradoxically, the Government trust the public to choose between hospitals with choose and book, but do not trust them with any voice in how health facilities are configured. That seems to me a fundamental mistake. I believe from some experience of such issues that the public are not stupid. They can grasp what a sensible clinical audit is about. They know that hospital stays are shorter, but they also know that people are getting older all the time. If maternity and geriatric services are stripped out, it does not result in a sharp decline in the acute provision so much vaunted by organisations such as the NHS Confederation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para21"><a name="06121477000300">The public rely on consultants and hospital administrators in some circumstances but know that they are not immune to special pleading and have individual preoccupations&#151;the former with training and professional status and the latter with making the sums add up and pleasing the Department of Health or the SHA. Furthermore, the public really understand any point one wants to make about distance. They are prepared to travel to wherever is necessary when life is at stake, but they do not want to travel miles for triage, basic treatment and competent reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para22"><a name="06121477000301">The public also do not want the health service to be indifferent to the journey that they make to treatment in the first place. To cite another example from my constituency, back in 2003, children&#146;s A and E was moved nine miles out of town. Parents were puzzled as to why when something had happened to a child, it had to be dealt with by making an unnecessary nine-mile trip past an A and E department in an all-singing, all-dancing general hospital, whether the child had fallen on a beach or at school, or whatever, with the mother traumatised by the experience. That decision was not even consistent with Sir George Alberti&#146;s general remit and instructions, and was shored up by duff clinical advice. I can remember standing outside the building in question with a sign saying &#147;Treat children in Southport&#151;20,000 people can&#146;t be wrong&#148;, which was how many people had signed the petition. Those people were not wrong, and that was acknowledged later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="61214h0007.htm_para23"><a name="06121477000302">There is no alternative for the Government, unless they go ahead kamikaze-like with their doomed strategy, to having a real dialogue with the public. That should not involve a lecture to the public or a tutorial, but it should mean genuinely allowing the public into the debate, although not in involvement forums, which are simply not good enough, as sham consultees or even as consultees at all. We should be looking soon to creating a place for the public as decision-makers in their own facilities.</p>

The ignorance that the Minister showed was deeply worrying. We never got the difference between clinical and medical explained. At one stage, he clearly did not know the difference between A and E and maternity departments. He also said that liver disease was caused by what people ate. That is a new one on me. If the Minister had had long enough, he might have claimed that statins were invented by him.</p>

The improvement has been gradual over many years; it has not been brought about by the Government.

is a higher rate, but to come here without a shred of evidence to back that claim up. This is a Minister who is in denial, and he is from a Health Department in denial about the real damage that it is causing&#151;not our scaremongering&#151;by its refusal to hold public consultations out in the open, to engage people properly and then to listen to them properly. That is where the scaremongering is going on.</p>

Well, we did not get that. Was the Minister going to tell us about changes to the financing formula? Again, no. He was completely in denial about the extra costs associated with older people, which is the very reason we have such a problem with deficits in our part of the world. Did the Minister come here to respond to the charges that we have made about maternity units, which are that one in six maternity units faces closure, downgrading or transfer? He did not get on to the list of 49 units at all&#151;again, no safety was granted to any of those, and no evidence based on any research was presented.</p>

There was no mention of mental health or health inequalities, which have worsened under the Government and which are always a reason that he and his colleagues give for the variations in the funding formula that mitigate against people in the south-east. He knows that he has failed to do anything about health inequalities.</p>

It is not unusual that seven of my hon.

Again, is it not noticeable that there are no Labour MPs from constituencies in Brighton and Hove, whose Royal Sussex county hospital stands to gain patients if we lose our department? There are no hon. Members here from Hastings, who stand to gain if Eastbourne is a victim of the cuts in that trust.</p>

Friend&#146;s constituency, despite the fact that we are the most under threat. The Secretary of State has also refused to meet my hon. Friend and me, so that we can deliver hundreds of Christmas cards, sent with the good will of the people of Worthing and the rest of West Sussex, to send her Christmas wishes and ask her to ensure that our hospitals are safe. She will not even receive those from our constituents. Ministers are in denial and blind to the problems that the NHS faces in our part of the world.</p>

It is for those reasons that the local media&#151;Splash FM radio station in Worthing, the local herald, Meridian TV and BBC South&#151;have been at the forefront of the campaign, day in, day out. They have not been inventing scaremongering stories, but reacting to the real fears of their listeners and our constituents. Thousands have taken to the streets; the &#147;Nurse Sunshine&#148; campaign in Worthing and mid-Sussex has caught people&#146;s imaginations.</p>

It will have many more people in the next few years because of the house building targets imposed on us by central Government. Ten years ago, the last Conservative Government greatly expanded Worthing hospital; it is ironic that this Labour Government threaten to be the one to downsize our hospital in the largest town in Sussex, and possibly close Southlands hospital altogether.</p>

They have said that the closure of acute services at Worthing hospital will result in patient deaths as a result of the inter-hospital transfer of sick patients. Do the Government care? We have had little evidence of that. When the excellent Tom Wye&#151;the mayor of Worthing, who heads the KWASH campaign&#151;wrote to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister&#146;s office wrote back to say that the matter had been referred to the Department for Transport.</p>

Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked about 29 A and E departments. His people may not have spoken to the NHS, but we have. He asked for more examples. I shall give them: Buckinghamshire hospitals trust, Calderdale and Huddersfield foundation trust, George Eliot hospital trust, Good Hope hospital trust, Gloucestershire Hospitals trust, Oxford Radcliffe hospitals trust, Royal Cornwall hospitals trust, Royal Free Hampstead trust, South Tees hospitals trust, South Warwickshire general hospitals trust and Whittington hospitals trust. They all categorically deny what the Conservative party said in its material last week. In my book, that was scaremongering.

groundless rumours designed to cause anxiety among the general public? It is high time that they dropped that, and sharpish.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="61214h0008.htm_para12"><a name="06121477000331">I turn to funding figures, as lots of Opposition Members spoke about the funding formula&#151;rightly, because it is an important issue. This financial year<i>&#151;[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) is waving a booklet at me. Let me tell him this: average per-head funding in the NHS this year is &#163;1,274. That cannot be denied; it is a fact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="61214h0008.htm_para13"><a name="06121477000332">Let me read out some figures for some of the constituencies of Members here today. This financial year, the PCT serving Worthing is funded at &#163;1,389 per head, above the national average. The PCT for Bexhill and Rother has &#163;1,445 per head, significantly more than the national average and close to the highest per-head funding in the country. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) said that there were real health needs in his constituency. That is a fair point, and I accept it. His PCT gets &#163;1,432 per head this financial year, compared with a national average of &#163;1,274.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="61214h0008.htm_para14"><a name="06121477000333">I am afraid that bleating about the health funding formula will simply not wash. The hon. Gentlemen should read the facts and figures before they head into large, sweeping statements.</p>

That is a fair point. We have said that we will look again at the case for reversing the impact of past RAB reductions. That will be done only on delivery of financial balance in the NHS in 2006-07. No funding will be allowed to do that immediately. To respond to another point, yes, the NHS will achieve financial balance this year. It will balance overall, and at that point we can consider what steps can be taken on the application of RAB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="61214h0008.htm_para17"><a name="06121477000338">The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) talked about the funding formula. I hope that I answered the point. He and the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire talked about maternity and the evidence on big versus small units. That issue is not politically driven. There is clinical evidence that 24-hour cover by obstetricians and specialist anaesthetists, where that can be given, provides a safer service. I am not saying that there must be one or the other. Of course, there can be a balance and we can offer choice. However, there is evidence that that is not a political debate that we are trying to push on to the health service.</p>

I do not seek to dismiss the real concerns in his constituency about some of the changes. I made a point about leadership and people explaining things clearly, and that is exactly what we do. The changes are important and let us put the evidence before people. I agree that the changes should be evidence-based. I shall be happy to meet the hon. Gentleman to discuss those matters further. He asked whether there was evidence that staff had been banned from talking to the press. We have checked with the strategic health authority, which categorically denies that and says that that can be put on the record.</p>

I respect his opinions on the health service, as he is a good member of the Health Committee and I listen carefully to what he says. There is a difference between an individual expressing in their professional capacity an opinion on a proposal in the public domain and the placing into the public domain of private information, which can exist within any organisation. Any organisation sometimes has information that is not for the public domain. On the former issue, I wholeheartedly support the right of any citizen of this country, regardless of where they work, to pass comment and express their opinion to their Member of Parliament or the press about a live proposal affecting services in their area.

I must stress that the Alberti document is not predicated on the notion that more specialist regional or sub-regional centres mean the closure of local services. As I said to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, it may mean that the A and E does something slightly different or has a different work load. It is not necessarily about one or the other. I hope that the hon.
