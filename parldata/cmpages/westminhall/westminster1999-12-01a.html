<P>

<a name="91201h01_para0"><i>Motion made, and Question proposed, </i>That the sitting be now adjourned.--<i>[Mr. Sutcliffe.]</i>
<P>

<a name="91201h01_time0"><H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew0"><B> Jackie Ballard  (Taunton):</B> 
 I am pleased to have secured this debate on a matter of great concern in my constituency and to many other hon. Members, who may try to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para1">The House last debated NHS dentistry when my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) initiated a debate on the subject in 1998. Sadly, little has changed since then, and in Somerset the position has worsened. In 1998, 10 out of 71 practices accepted new adult registrations on the NHS; today only five do so. In 1998, 72 per cent. of children in Somerset were registered with a dentist; today, that figure is 70 per cent. In 1998, 63 per cent. of adults in Somerset were registered; today, only 49 per cent. are registered.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para2">Many of the dentists who accept NHS patients have a much higher than average list, so waiting time is increasing. In 1998, 200 people called the dentists' telephone helpline each week because of problems with accessing an NHS dentist; today, the number of calls has doubled. In 1998, only two practices in my constituency were taking new NHS patients, and I complained about that at the time; now, there are none in my constituency.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para3">Many people, especially in the more rural parts of my constituency, have no access to NHS dentistry unless they travel long distances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew1"><B> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome):</B> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, my constituency borders hers and I have the same problem. Only one dentist is accepting NHS patients, who may have to travel for one hour to reach a dentist. The initiative that we were promised to solve that problem has done nothing to improve matters. In fact, they have got worse.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew2"><B> Jackie Ballard </B> 
: I thank my hon. Friend. I shall refer to the investing in dentistry initiative later.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para4">As my hon. Friend said, many people must travel long distances to reach a dentist and, in a rural county, 11 miles may be a very long distance for someone without easy access to transport. For people living in Wellington in the south of my constituency, the nearest dentist who is taking patients is in Cullompton, which is in Devon. For people living in Taunton, the nearest dentist is 25 miles away in Minehead, and Taunton is the county town of Somerset. Those who rely on public transport--the elderly, the poor, the most vulnerable and those who cannot drive--are disadvantaged, and inequalities in health are worsened. The Labour party manifeso promised that access to NHS services would be based on need and need alone. Clearly, in many parts of the country, access is dependent on transport, finance and mobility, not on need alone.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 48WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h01_para5">In many parts of the United Kingdom, NHS dentists are becoming as rare as hens' teeth. Dental services are now a lottery of postcode and geography. Dentistry is being rationed, and that has happened by stealth, not by Government decree or after public consultation. We do not have a national dental service. The previous Government seemed to be content to allow that. During their 18 years in power, there was a steady erosion of access to NHS dentistry, with a reduction in the services provided on the NHS and a drop in the number of people registered with an NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para6">I became interested in the subject long before I was elected to the House. In 1991, I was deregistered by my dentist because the fee structure made it difficult for him to repay his practice loan, earn a living and provide a high-quality service. When I raised the matter in the local press, I was denigrated by the local Tories who, with their usual grasp on reality, said "Problem! What problem?"
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para7">People who pay national insurance contributions for many years think that it is a sort of insurance policy which enables them to use the NHS when they need it. We know that national insurance does not work like that, but that is the impression that many people have, and they feel cheated. I hope that the Minister will not brush aside my anxiety and that of other hon. Members, or deny that there is a problem. I hope that he will be able to assure us that he is committed, not just in theory but in practice, to dentistry as a core part of the national health service.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para8">The Government cannot expect dentists to make a commitment to the NHS unless they too make a commitment and spell it out clearly. For example, the Government promised to publish a dental strategy later this year, but, according to a recent parliamentary answer, publication is now expected in the new year. Perhaps the Minister will be more specific this morning.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para9">After the debate in 1998, I received a letter from a local dentist, stating:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The morning I received your letter I took thirty minutes to surgically remove an abscessed tooth under NHS regulations. The fee was &#163;25.90, of which the patient paid &#163;20.72. After deduction of expenses I receive &#163;5.90 before tax. I regard this as completely inadequate remuneration. A hospital referral would cost the NHS several hundred pounds and the patient would receive their treatment free of charge. This is an intolerable situation."
 
I emphasise that the fee received by the dentist before tax was &#163;5.90 for half an hour's work. I do not believe that any of us in the House would do half an hour's work for &#163;5.90. [<i>Interruption</i>.] My hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &#214;pik) is prepared to sell himself cheaply. Not surprisingly, the dentist who wrote to me is no longer taking new NHS patients.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h01_para10">Dental health should be an integral part of primary care. I am disappointed that many primary care groups do not seem to involve local dental practitioners. Oral and dental health is mentioned in health improvement plans, but without easy and affordable access to NHS dentistry, the nation's oral health will decline.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lembit &#214;pik  (Montgomeryshire):</B> 
 Does my hon. Friend agree that dental provision in the NHS is omitted from primary care strategy almost altogether and has been virtually forgotten by many people in rural areas?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew4"><B> Jackie Ballard </B> 
: When we debated the setting up of primary care groups, I remember the Minister saying <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 49WH</B></P>
that dental practitioners should be an integral part of the primary care groups and their service. That is certainly not happening in my part of the country, and I do not believe that it is happening elsewhere. I hope that something can be done to encourage primary care groups to include dental practitioners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew5"><B> Mr. David Heath </B> 
: And optometrists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew6"><B> Jackie Ballard </B> 
: I shall not stray into the realm of eyes, although I realise that they usually go with teeth.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para11">Oral examination is important. In Britain, there are as many deaths from oral cancer as from cervical cancer and skin cancer. Dentists can spot the early signs of oral cancer. I have been told by local general practitioners that there has been an increasing demand on their time because of poor oral hygiene, gum disease and mouth infection, which would previously have been seen at an earlier stage and prevented by dentists. Only this week I received a letter from a GP in my constituency, who stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I very much support your attempts to improve access to NHS dentistry. As a GP I must admit to being very fed up with having to sort out people with dental problems who cannot access a dentist, either because they have not registered with an NHS dentist or they are not prepared to pay dentistry fees. In particular it is acute dental infections which cause problems. From my point of view the most important aspect of this is that dentists should be able to provide 24 hour emergency care."

Another GP wrote to me stating:
<P>
<BR>
"I share your concern about NHS dentistry. It is amazing how a Government can quietly see the service disappear without any hue and cry."

My local GP out-of-hours co-operative, Deane Doctor, reports a 25 per cent. increase this year in the number of calls related to dental problems. The simple fact is that decay and infection will not go away without treatment and, if that treatment is not easily accessible from a dentist, people will go to their general practitioner, adding to the pressure of work which they are already under.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h01_para12">In Somerset, 51 per cent. of adults are not registered with a dentist. Others, like many in my constituency, were registered and seeing their dentist on a regular basis, but recently, out of the blue, received a letter telling them that their dentist would no longer see NHS patients, that there were no vacancies with other dentists in the practice and that patients therefore had the choice of paying into a private dental health plan or registering with a dentist 20 or 25 miles away. In those circumstances, many people will not register, but wait until they have an emergency. Not only will their dental and general health decline as a result, but they will find that emergency treatment is not available in Taunton; they will have to travel far to find it.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para13">In responding to the debate, I am sure that the Minister will draw attention to the investing in dentistry initiative, which the Government have introduced to improve access. Coincidentally, the day that I learned that I had secured this debate--I believe in coincidences--the Secretary of State for Health sent a letter to all hon. Members, in which he said that the initiative had spent &#163;10 million on the expansion of NHS dental practices. However, two years ago, the <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 50WH</B></P>
British Dental Association said that &#163;40 million was needed to reverse the decline in the number of NHS dentists and the problem of access to dentistry. When the scheme was introduced, the then Minister said that it would improve the availability of general dental services and extend the benefits of good oral health by focusing help on the areas with the most serious problems.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para14">The Minister knows that Somerset has a particular problem. I am sure that he will tell us how much has been spent in Somerset, but I know those figures. Bids totalling more than &#163;800,000 went to the Department of Health from Somerset health authority, but only &#163;200,000 has come into the area under the investing in dentistry scheme. In my constituency, a bid for a new surgery was rejected, as was a bid for a new computer system. A new surgery was approved, but that bid has not been taken up because of difficulties in recruiting dentists. Another bid for a new surgery was rejected and a further bid for a new practice was approved, inasmuch as &#163;15,000 of a &#163;25,000 bid was accepted.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para15">The investing in dentistry scheme has clearly had a minimal effect in my constituency; it has not even stopped the decline. The problems in my constituency go back eight or nine years. Therefore, is the Minister content that the scheme has focused help on the areas with the most serious problems?
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para16">Before the general election, the Labour party said that NHS dentistry was in crisis. At Prime Minister's Question Time on 15 October 1996, the then Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), said that he did not know how the Prime Minister could
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"dare mention dentistry in the national health service after what his Government have done to it."--[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 October 1996; Vol. 282, c. 584.]
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h01_para17">However, in responding to an Adjournment debate in 1998, the then Minister, now the Secretary of State for Health, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we must not create a crisis out of a problem."--[<i>Official Report</i>, 18 February 1998; Vol. 306, c. 1161.]

Before the general election, Labour Members believed that there was a crisis, but by 1998, they believed that it was just a problem. I do not know how the Minister can think that the crisis ended in 1997. If he does not think that there is a crisis when my constituents are deregistered by their dentists, for whatever reason, or when people move into the area and cannot find a dentist to take them as an NHS patient, I hope that he thinks that it is a problem that he must solve sooner rather than later.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h01_para18">The Department of Health is piloting phone-and-go dental access centres, but my constituents will not be amused to phone and be told to go 20 miles. I hope that the Minister will tell us his definition of a reasonable distance that people should be asked to travel to a dentist. I hope that the debate will enable hon. Members to tell the Minister of their concerns, so that he can tell us, and our constituents, how and when he intends to improve access to NHS dentistry.

<a name="91201h01_spnew7"><B> Ms Joan Walley  (Stoke-on-Trent, North):</B> 
 I congratulate the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) on securing this morning's debate, which is taking place in a format that I hope the Minister will not <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 51WH</B></P>
find too painful. He is here with all of us to try to find a solution to the problem that we have inherited from the previous Government. I shall frame my speech in the context of that inheritance. No matter how painful finding a solution might be, we must do so simply because of the cuts in NHS dentistry that have taken place during the past 18 years. Several changes in dental provision have occurred in recent years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew8"><B> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> 
 Is the hon. Lady aware that there were 4,500 more NHS dentists when the previous Government left office than when they took office, and that spending on NHS dentistry was 60 per cent. higher in real terms than in 1979?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew9"><B> Ms Walley </B> 
: The important issue is access to NHS dentists for those who need treatment. From birth, people should receive regular preventive dental care and treatment when they need it.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para19">The dental registration scheme which was introduced as part of the new 1990 NHS dental contract has caused the crisis that we have inherited. Following those changes, the number of children and adults registering was much higher than the then Government expected, so a 7 per cent. cut in fees was soon introduced. That consitituted a threat to withhold approximately &#163;15,000 in earnings from each dentist and was due to an overspend. The hon. Gentleman must consider the effects of his party's policies, which changed the formula and the basis on which dentistry had traditionally been agreed. For that reason, we must accept that we have inherited a crisis and turn to the future to discover what needs to be done.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para20">The core of the problem is that, in those areas where access to NHS dental care is not easy, people are angry. They are often in pain and that grim problem should not be tolerated. We must do something about it. Dentists have been squeezed by the formula. The cost of the treatment that they provide must be looked at; dentists must have the time and funds to provide the necessary treatment.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para21">The problem is not necessarily one of too few dentists, but one of too few NHS dentists, especially in the areas of highest need--the postcode syndrome. Access to treatment is unequal, and I implore the Minister to take urgent, considered action. He should decide on the strategy that is needed in the long term in the context of the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para22">The hon. Member for Taunton gave a thorough introduction to the debate. We heard that the investing in dentistry scheme was launched in 1997 and that, initially, &#163;9 million was made available for it. We in north Staffordshire expected that that funding would make a difference to the problem that we had inherited. However, only &#163;175,000 was paid out in the first year of the scheme, despite a provisional allocation of &#163;9 million. I accept that an additional &#163;10 million was made available in the following financial year. The problems of launching that new system emphasise how difficult it is to set up new facilities, especially given the training and other cuts that have taken place during a sustained period over the previous 18 years. It takes time for such schemes to make a real difference.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para23">I am pleased that 10 practices in north Staffordshire, out of the 310 practices nationwide, were successful <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 52WH</B></P>
under the investing in dentistry scheme, but that is a drop in the ocean and the problems of north Staffordshire remain. I make no apology for being parochial and speaking about the problems that my constituents face in being unable to get to an NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para24">I draw the Minister's attention to the further problem of the recruitment and retention of dentists. In north Staffordshire, the health authority has appointed a designated officer to address that problem. Much innovative work has been done to encourage people in dental schools to move to north Staffordshire. North Staffordshire does not have the necessary training places, and people often practise in the area where they trained. If there are no dental training facilities in a particular area, that area will find it even more difficult to recruit and retain people. However, in the past few months, our health authority has funded one third of the educational element of a vocational training scheme based in Crewe. We have high hopes that, after one year of vocational training based in north Staffordshire, two practitioner trainees will continue to practise after completing their educational qualifications. Two practitioners, however, is a drop in the ocean. It does not solve the problem, although I admit that it is a tiny step forward.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para25">I should like to concentrate briefly on the scale of the problem in north Staffordshire. In the week beginning 12 September, a constituent who had suffered intense toothache for about four weeks and was unable to find a dentist consulted north Staffordshire's emergency advisory services. She was given a list of NHS dentists practising in my constituency, one of whom was available to see her, but in four weeks' time. That is termed an emergency service. The constituent was provided with pain-killing relief, but was able to obtain an earlier appointment--only because of my intervention. That should not happen.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para26">We have already heard how not receiving treatment at the right time can lead to far greater dental problems, and greater recourse to general practitioners. Anyone who is in immediate pain should be given emergency treatment; otherwise, the problem will be exacerbated. I am greatly concerned about the human suffering that results from the lack of NHS dentists where they are needed.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para27">In statistical terms, north Staffordshire has a poor dentist to population ratio--1:4,100. The ratio for England and Wales is 1:3,045, and that for the west midlands is 1:3,597. North Staffordshire's adult registration rate is the lowest in the west midlands. I take no pride in that whatever. It is also significantly lower than the average in England and Wales. The England and Wales average is 45 per cent.; ours is 38 per cent.Therefore, one in six people in north Staffordshire is not registered with a dentist, which shows the scale of the problem. A dental advice line monitors where calls come from, and a disproportionate number--650 to 710 a month--come from what is defined as the north Stoke area.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para28">Applications are being made for third wave personal dental service pilots. When the health authority bidding is assessed, it is crucial that the Government should consider north Staffordshire's need for that pilot. The success of the bid on its own will be insufficient; again, it will be a drop in the ocean. We want a formula whereby <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 53WH</B></P>
patients can be registered with dentists, allowing a link-up with the sure start programme. That will ensure that children are registered from the start of their lives through to old age. A strategy to link with primary care groups is also urgently needed. I recently met the chairman of the primary care group in my constituency, and the chairman and chief executive of the health authority, and it is crucial that a dental strategy should be built into primary care groups.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para29">When the Minister considers our personal dental service pilot bid on which I hope that he will look favourably, will he also consider the long term? Will he consider north Staffordshire as a pilot area? We need to start to think about how to make NHS dental services available to the 63 per cent. of people in north Staffordshire who are not registered. Joined-up thinking with other Departments would enable a link with the sure start scheme and the new primary care groups.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para30">We must also consider how to ensure that children receive the dental care that they need. In the next few months, a national debate on fluoridation will take place. I would much prefer that debate to take place after we have been assured that everybody has the right access to NHS dental care.

<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew10"><B> Mr. David Heath  (Somerton and Frome):</B> 
 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard)--who is also my neighbour--on securing this extremely important debate. Had she not secured it, I would have sought to do so in the coming weeks. The situation in Somerset, which she has already described, is becoming worse by the day. Sometimes hon. Members are guilty of hyperbole, but, in the past two weeks, people have come to my surgeries to tell me about two practices in my area that have reluctantly decided to move away from NHS dental work. Those practices have asked their patients to move on to private dental insurance, and the people affected are rightly worried.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para31">This problem must be put in the overall context of health care provision in rural areas. It is difficult to access the health service if one lives in a rural area. Services that are taken for granted in urban areas and throughout most of the country are not available in much of rural Britain. That should concern all hon. Members, and the Minister will know, from his own constituency, what difficulties sparsely populated rural areas can present.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para32">The situation in Somerset seems to be worse than elsewhere; I am sure that the Minister will confirm whether that is the case. The perception is that there has been a wholesale flight from NHS dentistry in Somerset. I am aware of only one practice in my constituency that is admitting NHS patients, and my constituency covers the best part of 900 square miles. As I said, many practices are moving patients from NHS lists on to private dental insurance arrangements.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para33">The location of practices, which are few and far between anyway, is a problem. As my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton mentioned, some people have to travel 25 or 30 miles to visit a dentist. It would be <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 54WH</B></P>
ridiculous if everyone in London was told to go to a dentist in Slough--the equivalent distance--and people would object. In our part of the world, however, travelling such a distance is considered normal. It is questionable whether there is genuine access if there is a complete absence of public transport. If the only way of getting to the dentist is by private car, many of the people who are most in need of dental check-ups will not be able to go because of inconvenience and inaccessibility.
 
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para34">The reason for that is, I suspect, based on a number of factors. I do not blame the dental practitioners in question, because many of them stopped providing NHS access with the greatest reluctance. They do not want to be private practitioners. They want to continue to provide the service that they have provided throughout their working lives, but the arrangements that govern their remuneration and practice are currently so unattractive that they feel unable to do so.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para35">An article in the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, published on 9 September, examined why dentists move from NHS to private provision. It found that dentists have increased private provision principally to improve the quality of dentistry, to increase choice in clinical decision making, to get more time with patients and to widen the range of treatment options. Each of those reasons is, in effect, based on a clinical decision as to how to provide the best treatment for patients. Rightly or wrongly, dentists have concluded that they cannot provide such treatment in the context of the present NHS arrangements.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para36">Financial security is also an important factor. It is difficult to run a small practice when one's remuneration fails to meet its overheads or enable it to work effectively, or when one seriously doubts whether that remuneration will continue. That is a particular problem for a dentist who, at some stage, intends to sell the practice because he or she wants to retire or move elsewhere, and who realises that it will not fetch a reasonable price as an NHS practice. Such a practice cannot be passed on because it will not provide a sufficient return on the necessary capital investment. Practitioners are concluding that their interests, and their patients' interests, do not lie in the provision of NHS care. At the same time, people desperately want access to NHS care, but the practitioners simply are not there.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para37">The initiative that was announced two years ago with considerable fanfare may have achieved wonders across the country, but it has had a limited effect in my constituency, where the arrangements have been subject to further decay. People who move there are astonished. Recently, the wife of a Royal Air Force officer who is based at the Royal Naval air station in Yeovilton--somewhat confusingly, her husband is in a different service from the base at which he is stationed--was unable to find dental care. The Royal Navy would not provide dental care because she was RAF; nor would anyone else provide it. She had been moved to an area that she did not know at the behest of the Ministry of Defence, yet could not obtain dental care for her family. I had to write to the health authority and various other people to try to put her name on lists that were effectively closed. Such problems are encountered regularly .
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 55WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h01_para38">I cannot stress sufficiently the importance of primary care across different disciplines. I know that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I were to stray too far into the world of optometry, in which I used to practise, but there are many parallels. If we fail to get primary care right, not only in general practice but in dentistry, optometry and other disciplines, we will not achieve the hoped-for reduction in disease, and we will see increased hospitalisation because diagnoses will not have been made at the appropriate point. In the long run, that will cost the Government and the health service more, and will subject people to inconvenience and distress that could have been avoided.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para39">For heaven's sake, let us treat the matter as a major problem that needs urgent and serious attention. We must get NHS dentistry right and look at those areas where provision is bad. Provision in Somerset is particularly bad and requires the Minister's urgent and special attention. We must get the contracts right, so that we recruit and retain practitioners in health service practice. Perhaps we shall then provide the service that people reasonably expect from the NHS throughout the country, including rural areas, not just in areas that are lucky enough to have an abundance of practitioners.

 I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) on securing this debate.

For that reason, I was particularly pleased that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) contributed to the debate. It is not merely a question of localised pockets of difficulty; there is a national, structural problem with NHS dentistry.

<a name="91201h01_para40">The debate is particularly apt at the moment because dentistry may illustrate the direction in which the rest of the NHS is moving. There has been a covert move away from a publicly funded service, albeit with contributions from patients, to a purely private arrangement. Many of my friends in dentistry are extremely concerned about that. They feel a conflict between their social conscience, and their clinical and professional responsibility towards patients. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North said that registration may have caused the crisis, but that is wrong. Registration was a good idea. It created a link between dental practitioner and patient, and could have formed the basis of preventive dental care.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para41">Some 15 years ago, enormous improvements were being made in the dental health of the whole population. The Isle of Wight was proud to have the lowest number of dental caries in children under 10. We regularly sample our school population, and I am sorry to say that that record has been completely ruined. The Isle of Wight now has one of the highest rates of dental caries in children. That is largely a result of changes in access to NHS dentistry. West Wight now has no national health dentist. The practice there closed down overnight, and people must now take a bus into the county town of Newport and travel to the depths of Ventnor or Cowes in the hope of finding a dentist. That constitutes a bus journey of about two and half hours, which is ridiculous.
<P>

<P>

<a name="91201h01_para42">It is clear that we need to make dentistry available and accessible to people everywhere, and there are two possible answers. We could take the view, which is overtly taken by the Conservative party, that the NHS can survive only with more insurance-based funding. Clearly, organisations such as Denplan, which have taken over the funding of NHS dentistry, may have a role to play, but the majority of my constituents cannot afford such a service. They truly believe that, having paid into the NHS, they are entitled to some care. The alternative answer, which is emerging from the Government's actions--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hammond </B> 
: In the light of the hon. Gentleman's comments, is he opposed to a mixed economy in dentistry, in which NHS dentists see NHS patients but can offer a menu of treatment that includes NHS options and options that are not available through the NHS? Does he see that as a positive or a negative step?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew13"><B> Dr. Brand </B> 
: I am a firm believer in a mixed economy of provision. It is sad that, at the moment, the better dentists and those who are best equipped have moved away from the NHS. In the past, those people found it possible to mix their practice. The Government-based fee system can take time to catch up with reality, so their private work often helped them to invest in leading-edge technology. That is one of the problems at the moment. I have no problem with a mixed economy of provision, except when it is no longer mixed and becomes available only to those who can afford private insurance.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para43">The Government's apparent solution to the problem is not to talk to dental practitioners to see how a contract can be devised to enable them to offer their services to NHS patients, but to supply a range of services through dentists directly employed by district or area health authorities. I do not have a problem with that if it is the Government's overt policy, but if that is the case, they should say so. If we are no longer to use independent dental practitioners to provide national health services, let us make sure that a comprehensive service is set up alongside them. It would be sad if that happened, because I agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that it is useful to have a mix within the same practice.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para44">I have had extensive correspondence with my health authority over dental problems on behalf of my constituents. I was interested to learn that health authorities are not obliged to provide NHS dental care for patients other than those needing emergency treatment. This is ridiculous. It is 18th-century stuff. It is inadequate that the NHS is responsible only for yanking out teeth and putting in the occasional filling. So much can be done now to retain people's dentition throughout their lives. We seem to be going back to the pre-war set-up, when people were given an appointment with the dentist to have all their teeth out and receive a full set of dentures for their 30th birthday. It is disgraceful to deal with dental care by concentrating only on dental emergencies.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para45">That policy also has a major effect in the medical field, not only by increasing the work load for general practitioners--all GPs moan about that, but they can cope with it. There is a real problem about the dental part of medical training. I think that I had two lectures on dentistry. Proper dentists spend five years studying, <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 57WH</B></P>
and the average GP is not suited or trained to cope with dental problems. Doctors do, however, need help from their dental colleagues in cases of patients with heart disease--especially valvular heart disease--or other diseases that make it imperative that they should not suffer from oral sepsis. Such patients need regular access to dental hygienists and regular checks.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para46">A great many of my constituents do not have access to such services. My health authority informs me that the new pilot dental service, to which it hopes to recruit people, will deal only with those needing emergency treatment, or those with learning difficulties--a special group that has always been catered for by the directly employed service.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para47">We face a crisis in dentistry of successive Governments' making. The present Government owe it to the nation to say which course they wish to take. They must either reinvest the money that they are not currently spending on NHS dentistry into a comprehensive, directly employed, accountable service--there must be an honest debate about the advantages and disadvantages of that--or they must have meaningful discussions with general dental practitioners to ensure that they can once again offer their services in the NHS.


<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew14"><B> Mr. Philip Hammond  (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> 
 I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) on securing this debate, which gives me the opportunity to experience for the first time the somewhat unusual sensation of standing in this Chamber. I was not quite sure where to sit when I came in, and I wonder whether we might be encouraged to change our positions depending on the nature of the debate, and on how close to, or far from, each other we feel on the subject. If it is anything to go by, I notice that today both the Minister and I have positioned ourselves as close to the centre as we reasonably could in the seating available.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para48">The number of Members attending this debate is smaller than it might have been had the subject been debated on a Wednesday morning in the main Chamber. The distractions there are somewhat different for us, because if the debate tends to flag, one can always look at the Public Gallery. We do not have that option in this format, but there are buses passing outside, and a JCB busily working in Parliament square.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para49">There are approximately 21,000 general dental practitioners providing NHS care in England and Wales. About three out of four adults registered with a dentist receive NHS care, while one in four is a private dental patient, often, but not always, through choice. Dentists derive 39 per cent. of their income from private treatment, which is a significantly increased percentage. Most of that increase is due to private work being carried out on NHS patients.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para50">As I said in my earlier intervention on the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), we have achieved a genuine mixed economy among NHS dentists, where it is working properly, in which patients are able to access their dentist under the NHS, but, once the need for treatment has been determined, are offered a genuine <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 58WH</B></P>
menu of choices, including treatments that are available on the NHS and those that are not. I hope that hon. Members will agree with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight and me that more choice is always better than less, provided that it is a genuine choice. I accept the caveat that patients must have access to a dentist on the NHS in the first instance.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para51">The scare stories that one reads, especially in the local and regional press, about there being no NHS dentists in an area are largely untrue. In reality, there is a population of mixed-practice dentists who are, in many cases, unwilling to expand their NHS lists. That does not mean that they have ceased to practise in the NHS altogether. It means that, having regard to the need to assure their own gross incomes--a point to which I shall return--in order to meet their practice overheads and to provide adequate care and time for their patients, they no longer feel able to take on additional NHS patients and remain viable at the current level of NHS fees for service.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para52">That is the core of the problem about which most hon. Members are approached by constituents who are unable to access an NHS dentist as a new patient. The problem is probably getting worse. Half the health authorities in a recent British Dental Association survey reported that the shortage of accessible NHS dentists during the preceding year had worsened.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para53">The number of adult patients registered with a dentist peaked at 24.8 million in 1993 and, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) said, has been falling since then. That is partly due to changes in the registration time limits. The fall put on its greatest spurt between December 1997 and December 1998, when the number registered fell from 22.3 million to 19.7 million. During 1997-98, the Government underspent their NHS dentistry budget by &#163;56.5 million.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para54">The BDA estimates that 20 million adults do not seek regular dental treatment. For whatever reason--cost, fear or simply apathy--that group of people tends to use emergency dental services only. In the longer term, it will clearly be necessary to tackle the issue of those 20 million people who do not pay regular attention to their oral health. That crucial cultural change will not be achieved quickly or easily. I accept that the concept of phone-and-go centres--in areas where they are working--will probably appeal to people who want to be able to access NHS dentistry quickly and easily on the occasions when they need it, but do not seek continuity of care from an NHS dentist.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para55">A more immediate problem--which many hon. Members will have come across in their postbags and I understand is to be the target of the investing in dentistry programme--concerns the estimated 4 million patients who would like to register with an NHS dentist but are unable to do so. They represent an unmet demand for registration that it is imperative that the system should meet.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para56">There is a significant geographical misdistribution of dentists. As one might expect, problems exist in deprived areas with socio-economic difficulties. However, there are also problems in more affluent areas in which premises and establishment costs are particularly high. That is part of the nub of the matter, and I should like to put some points to the Minister about it later.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 59WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h01_para57">The way in which general dental practitioners are remunerated is distinctly different from the way in which general medical practitioners are remunerated. General medical practitioners receive reimbursement for their premises and establishment costs, whereas general dental practitioners receive item of service fees on a national scale across the country, from which they then have to meet the costs of their premises and establishment. That can present grave problems to general dental practitioners who operate in areas where the costs of premises are exceptionally high but are reimbursed only with the same fees that colleagues in lower cost areas of the country receive. I am sure that the Minister is armed with the fact--and will refer to it if I do not--that the investing in dentistry programme has addressed that problem at the margin. Indeed, it has addressed it in my constituency, where at least one new NHS dental practice has been enabled to start up by a grant that has helped it to overcome the high initial capital cost of premises. However, the scheme has been widely condemned as heavily bureaucratic, and its impact has been localised.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para58">The hon. Member for Taunton mentioned the long-awaited strategy for NHS dentistry, which has now been in gestation for 18 months and is presumably under lock and key in Richmond house in a state of partial completion. As a result, this debate is taking place in something of a vacuum. It would be interesting if the Minister were able to enlighten us as to the contents of the document and when we are likely to see it.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para59">I recognise that Health Ministers are regularly embarrassed by the phenomenon of finding that, while they are slaving away in Richmond house over a policy or strategy, some spin doctor in Downing street has managed to wind up the Prime Minister to announce yet another undeliverable pledge. In this case, the pledge was that within two years everyone will be able to see an NHS dentist. To the man in the Dog and Duck, the phrase "see an NHS dentist" would have meant "be able to be registered with an NHS dentist". He would not have thought that the Prime Minister meant "catch a glimpse of an NHS dentist crossing the road". Four million unregistered potential patients want the chance to access, and be registered with, an NHS dentist. However, it now appears that the Prime Minister's pledge should be interpreted in a rather more literal sense--and even that is probably undeliverable. He appears to be offering a drop-in dental service, which, although it may address the urgent needs of the 20 million people who do not seek regular and preventive dental care, will do nothing significant to address the needs of the 4 million who would like to be registered and to engage in proper preventive oral hygiene and dental care.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para60">Thirty phone-and-go centres will not even begin to scratch the surface of the problem on a nationwide basis-that figure represents approximately one centre for every three health authority areas. Two phone-and-go centres are currently running as pilots, one of which, in Shropshire, has already become a phone-and-wait centre. Its capacity is completely filled and patients are unable to gain immediate access to a dentist, which was the whole point of the project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew15"><B> Jackie Ballard </B> 
: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one reason why 20 million people do not register is that <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 60WH</B></P>
many people are still afraid of going to the dentist? They hope that nothing will go wrong with their teeth, and put it off. If fewer and fewer people register and go to the dentist regularly, that is likely to perpetuate across the generations. As a parent, I found that, if I took my child with me to the dentist when I had a check-up, she could see that it did not hurt. If the only time one goes to the dentist is to have emergency treatment, it is more likely to hurt, and one's child will be less likely, as he or she grows up, to seek dental treatment voluntarily.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hammond </B> 
: I am sure that the hon. Lady is right. In a moment, I shall ask the Minister about those 20 million people, specifically whether any analysis of their motives for not engaging in the system has been undertaken. I suspect, as Liberal Democrat Members have suggested, that the future lies in closer integration of primary dental care with the general primary health care system. We should try to break down that wall and encourage people to access the system more easily and overcome their fears.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para61">It is estimated that to register the 4 million people who can reasonably be categorised as seeking registration would require an extra 2,000 dentists. Where does the Minister think the dentists required for the Prime Minister's initiatives will come from? I entirely endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight about the trend towards salaried dentists. If that is the Government's intention for the future, they should state it clearly. The obvious source of salaried dentists for the new service is the existing community dental service. People involved in that service are deeply worried that, because it is already overstretched by having to deal with the increasing needs of the elderly and trying to act as a back-stop service provider, it will be denuded by salaried dentists going off to serve in the new phone-and-go centres.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para62">The Prime Minister's announcement represents a sticking plaster solution, which will be a high-cost way of dealing with a relatively small number of patients, but one--no doubt this has been noted--that will create 30 separate photo opportunities for Ministers throughout the country. Likewise, the much vaunted NHS Direct access to dentistry scheme, whereby NHS Direct will provide guidance for patients on where they may access an NHS dentist, is nothing new. It is no more than formalising a service that most health authorities provide already.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para63">I have noted from this morning's comments that others share our belief that there must be greater integration of primary dental services into the primary health care system in the future. Oral health is a helpful part of overall health, and dentists, like pharmacists and, in deference to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), perhaps optometrists, consider that they are left out of the mainstream of the primary health care system. They are left out of the general thrust of the Government's policy in developing primary care groups and primary care trusts. They are not involved in initiatives, such as the NHS net, yet they, too, need access to patients' records to provide proper continuity of care.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para64">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight cited the example of a patient with heart disease, when it is essential that dentists are aware of a patient's overall medical history. Dentists have not been involved in discussions on <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 61WH</B></P>
referral patterns although they, too, refer patients to hospital and play a significant role in the primary detection of cancers of the head and neck. Will the Minister say whether dentists are included in the Government's cancer referral pledge that all urgent referrals with suspected cancer will be seen by a specialist in a hospital within two weeks? I asked the British Dental Association that question yesterday. It said that it did not know the answer and had received no guidance from the Department of Health about it.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para65">It is self-evident that there is no chance in the short term of recruiting enough new dentists to solve the problem. Clearly, the solution will lie in incentivising existing NHS dentists to do more NHS work and to be open to new additional NHS patients, some of whom may then go on in the mixed economy to buy private care from them as part of the overall solution to their dental hygiene problems. Has the Minister considered the fee basis? Has he compared the way in which GPs are remunerated with reimbursement of their premises and establishment costs? Has he considered how changes to the general dental practitioners' remuneration system could impact on the current situation by addressing the high costs that general dental practitioners face in some areas?
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para66">Does the Minister see a way forward, either by cost-related premiums on fees in specific areas or by separate premises reimbursements? Perhaps such an initiative could include incentives not only to overcome high localised costs, but to attract dentists to what are currently unattractive areas. The contributions of Liberal Democrat MPs from the far south-west have put the thought into my mind this morning that the Government may deal also with the additional costs that are associated with sparsity in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para67">What assessment has the Minister made of the impact of existing charges for NHS dentistry on those 20 million people who are not seeking regular dental treatment? Has his Department undertaken any study to see whether the charges that are currently levied are a significant deterrent to those people, or are other factors keeping them away from a continuing relationship with their dentist and a programme of preventive oral care? What cost-benefit analysis has the Department of Trade and Industry carried out in relation to encouraging additional attendance for preventive dental care, given the established interaction between oral hygiene and general health?
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para68">Can the Minister say whether patients who visit phone-and-go centres will have access to the full range of options offered by most general dental practitioners, including the choice to have private treatment which is not available on the NHS tariff--for example, non-amalgam fillings? Alternatively, will the phone-and-go centres effectively become the second tier in a two-tier service, with patients offered only the limited NHS menu if they are forced to visit such centres rather than to register with an NHS dentist who is offering a mixed economy practice?
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para69">It may surprise some people to know that dentistry is the second largest cause of lost working days in the country. In Glasgow, it is the single largest cause of general anaesthesia being applied. It is not a side show. Clearly, there is a major problem, which can be tackled <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 62WH</B></P>
only by incentivising dentists to do NHS work, to address the real problems of their cost basis in high-cost areas and to integrate dentistry more effectively into the primary care system. That will make them feel part of the mainstream of our health delivery system. The problem will not be solved by soundbites and the creation of photo opportunities for Ministers--although I acknowledge that the Department of Health has some very photogenic Ministers--nor by the Prime Minister raising expectations that cannot be met.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para70">As in so many cases, no one doubts the ability of the Government, and particularly that of the Prime Minister, to spot the opportunity for a soundbite. The Prime Minister leaves a trail of pledges for others to try to meet, as, sadly, we have seen elsewhere in the NHS, often regardless of the cost in terms of disruption to the smooth running of the service and real clinical priorities. I look forward to the Minister's answers this morning to my specific questions and those raised by other hon. Members, and to hearing--in the absence of the promised White Paper on the strategy for NHS dentistry--what the policy is, beyond the soundbites that have already been announced.

<P>

<P>

<a name="91201h01_para71">I congratulate all hon. Members who have been fortunate enough to take part in the debate, particularly the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard). Whenever NHS dentistry is debated in the House, it is clear that right hon. and hon. Members have strong feelings about its accessibility. They are concerned about the current situation, as are the Government. That is why we have taken the steps to which reference has been made during our debate to try to remedy the situation that we inherited in 1997.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para72">We can analyse the problems, there has been much today with which I do not disagree. However, even more important than that is the need to find solutions to the problem. Of course, it is the Government's job to examine the matter, and I shall be outlining the measures that we have taken so far and those that we intend to take. We all share the responsibility for that. It is easy to criticise, but it would be nice now and again to hear some ideas about solving the situation from Opposition Members. They have been conspicuously missing from today's debate so far.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para73">I again congratulate the hon. Member for Taunton on introducing the debate and on her thoughtful comments. The Government have begun an ambitious programme of modernising the national health service. We have also set challenging targets for improving the health of the population through our White Paper on a public health strategy. We are building a national health service for the future, creating a service that is both fit for the new century and one that will be there when people need it. Although it must always remain true to its founding values, the national health service must--I <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 63WH</B></P>
am sure that it will--rise to the challenges ahead if it is to meet the growing demands of our population in the next millennium.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para74">The hon. Member for Taunton expressed concern that I would brush her anxieties aside. I shall not do that. I want to expound on some of the actions that the Government are taking and our vision for the future. The Government believe that NHS dentistry plays a key part within our modernisation agenda for the national health service. All those who have ever suffered from simple toothache know how crucial good oral health and good dentistry can be to the quality of their lives. In the past 50 years, the hard work and skill of dentists and other members of the dental profession have served our population well. Needs and demand are changing; so must the provision of NHS dentistry. It needs to adapt and keep pace. I recognise that people are impatient. We need a faster, more convenient health service which is better attuned to the needs of our modern society; and that obviously includes NHS dentistry.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para75">I must make it clear to the Chamber, and I shall not apologise to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) for doing so, that when the Government took office in 1997, they inherited an NHS dental service that faced some serious problems which were caused by the neglect and the indifference of the previous Administration towards NHS dentistry. The provision of dentistry was, at best, patchy. In parts of the country, there were big gaps between the demand for NHS dentistry and its availability. There were acute problems, and I agree with hon. Members about access to dentistry in the south-west.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para76">Nationally, about a third of health authorities report problems for some of their residents. In recent years, the number of patients registered with NHS dentists had dropped significantly. Patient registration, which was introduced by the previous Government in October 1990 as part of a new pay contract with dentists, peaked in December 1993, when 21.6 million adults were registered. Since then, the number has fallen to 16.8 million--a drop of nearly 5 million.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para77">In September 1996, the previous Government cut the registration period for adults from 24 to 15 months. That meant that people who did not re-visit their dentists in 15 months--previously 24--were taken off the list. That change alone led to a drop of nearly 3 million in the number of registered adults. I was one of them. I came across that new rule when I went back to my dentist in my constituency in Barrow only to find that I had been deregistered. I think that the hon. Member for Taunton said that she or one of her hon. Friends had had that problem, too. The duplicate registrations that can arise when patients change dentists have been weeded out, accounting for another 1 million of the drop. The balance of about 1 million represents people who either deliberately chose not to reregister or who became deregistered because dentists decided not to treat some or all adults on the NHS. It is constructive to consider why that should be.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para78">Before 1990, access to dentistry was informal, with many patients building relationships with an individual dentist over a long period. With a new contract in 1990, relationships between patients and dentist were formalised by a system of registration. Since then, dentists' incomes have been partly based on registrations and, consequently, access to dentistry has <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 64WH</B></P>
depended heavily on registration. Registration was intended to promote continuing care, but it quickly became an end in itself. The previous Government introduced the 1990 contract without fully piloting many of the changes that it contained.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew17"><B> Mr. Hammond </B> 
: The Minister seems to be generally hostile to the principle of registration. Will he make it clear whether the Government are committed to registration in principle or are hostile to it?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew18"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I am trying to explain the drop in the figures that the hon. Gentleman and others have mentioned. I shall come to the new dental strategy in a minute, so I ask the hon. Gentleman to be patient.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para79">As I said, the previous Government introduced a contract in 1990 without piloting many of the changes that it contained. Its intentions were therefore based largely on theory rather than practice, and the consequent results were mixed. In particular, there were significant drawbacks for oral health, NHS dentistry overall and expenditure. The new contract resulted in an overspend of &#163;200 million, which eventually had to be written off. The contract was based on future activity forecasts to guarantee dentists' incomes. They were unsound and resulted in a 7 per cent. fee cut, which led to many dentists increasing their commitment to the private sector--a fact that has been widely commented on this morning. The level of treatment per adult rose while the level of treatment per child fell, and it is difficult to see any clinically based reasons why that should have been so.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para80">The shift towards dentists doing more private work has been slow, but it has been steady. Only a small number of dentists do no NHS work at all, but the amount of time that the rest devote to the NHS has fallen. In a 1993 British Dental Association survey, 75 per cent. of general dental service dentists said that they received 75 per cent. or more of their earnings from the NHS and just 12 per cent. said that they received less than 25 per cent. By 1999, those figures had changed to 58 and 18 per cent. respectively. More than 1 million people now have private dental plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew19"><B> Dr. Brand </B> 
: The Minister said that most dental practitioners still did NHS work. Does he have the facts available to differentiate between NHS work for children and NHS work for adults? My impression is that a large number of NHS dentists have dropped NHS adult work. That is where the difficulty arises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew20"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the figure immediately. I will write to him with the requested information because that is an important point.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para81">It is true that availability problems are not spread evenly across the country or our society as a whole. There tend to be fewer access problems for children than for adults, which partly addresses the concerns of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand). Access is more difficult for charge-paying adults than for those exempted from charges altogether. In many areas, dentists' lists remain open, and anyone who wants NHS treatment can get it. In others, the situation is worse. For example, in the Stockport health authority area, 56 per <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 65WH</B></P>
cent. of the adult population is registered with a dentist, whereas in Bromley the figure is, I am afraid, only 25 per cent. Across England as a whole, the average is 43 per cent.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para82">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) asked whether the Department considered that the situation in Somerset was particularly worse than elsewhere in the country. I shall share with him my understanding of the position in Somerset. In the 12 months from September 1998 to September 1999, adult registrations in Somerset declined from just under 183,000 to just over 177,000--about 45 per cent. of the population. Over the same period, child registrations fell slightly from 69 to 68 per cent. of the child population.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para83">Those figures do not exactly correspond to those given by the hon. Member for Taunton. I cannot explain why they differ slightly; perhaps we will explore that matter in correspondence. In general terms, although the figures are clearly low, they compare favourably with the average for England of 45 per cent. for adults--the average in Somerset--and 62 per cent. for children. In fact, the figures for children in Somerset are higher than the national average.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para84">We accept the point that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and others have made about the problems of equity of access; of course, that is a fundamental concern which we share with all hon. Members who have spoken in the debate. Even where there are enough NHS dentists to meet demand, the process of finding one can be awkward, time-consuming and off-putting. Today, we have heard accounts confirming that position. The Government are committed to reversing that decline. We want the service to be faster and more convenient for patients--a modern dental service which meets the demands of modern life. Our target, which was announced in September by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), is that, by the end of 2001, everyone who needs NHS dentistry will be able to get it.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para85">We have already taken significant and positive strides forward and improved access to dentistry by using the investing in dentistry initiative and personal dental services. The investing in dentistry initiative spent &#163;10 million expanding NHS dental practices. Across the country, 363 locations benefited from the scheme and 830,000 more patients can register with an NHS dentist. Eight investing in dentistry bids were approved from Somerset, including two from the constituency of the hon. Member for Taunton. Those two grants, totalling more than &#163;30,000, have been approved for two dental practices in her constituency. When the new dentists are approved, which we hope will be done soon, they will deliver treatment to thousands more patients in her constituency. Throughout Somerset, the eight schemes should raise 19,000 new NHS patients. Of that target, 6,000 new registrations have already been achieved. I accept the criticism that Opposition Members made about the situation in Somerset, but we are trying to deal with the problem.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew21"><B> Jackie Ballard </B> 
: Yes, funding has gone to practices in my constituency but, as the Minister knows, there are <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 66WH</B></P>
difficulties recruiting dentists. I suspect, but I do not know, that dentists feel that Somerset is an affluent area containing quite a few people who can afford to pay for private treatment, that they can make more money in a private than in an NHS practice and that there is no demand for NHS treatment in Somerset.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para86">I return to the Minister's comments on the Prime Minister's promise. He said that everyone would have access to NHS dentistry within two years. Will he define what he believes to be a reasonable distance to travel? I have with me the health authority list that is given to people who are looking for a dentist in Somerset. It gives two addresses in Minehead and one in Shepton Mallet. Interestingly, the other two postal addresses are not in Somerset, which means that the list contains only three addresses in Somerset. How far does he believe someone should have to travel for treatment?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew22"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: I do not want to avoid answering the hon. Lady's question, but effectively I am being asked to tell the Chamber what is in the new dental strategy. I had the same problem with some of the questions that were asked by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. Clearly, I am not in a position to discuss the details of that strategy. With great respect, hon. Members will have to be more patient. When we publish the new dental strategy in the new year, the answers to some questions will become more apparent. However, I share the hon. Lady's concerns. If I were in opposition and my constituents were told that they had to travel 30 or 40 miles to see an NHS dentist, I should not be satisfied.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew23"><B> Mr. Hammond </B> 
: I accept what the Minister says, and I shall wait with bated breath for the strategy document. If my questions are not answered in it, I shall put them to him again. Will he say precisely what he meant when he said that everyone who wants access to NHS dentistry will have it by 2001? Does that mean that everyone who wants to register, and to have an on-going relationship with an NHS dentist and to obtain preventive care, will be guaranteed the ability to do so?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew24"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: We certainly want to improve access to NHS dentistry. That was made clear by my right hon. Friends at the Labour party conference and on other occasions. I give credit to the hon. Gentleman, who is once again trying to get me to announce what will be in the new dental strategy. With the greatest respect, I am afraid that he will have to wait until it is published.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para87">We accept that the previous arrangements for the provision of dental services were too rigid. Local nuances and the need for such services could not always be met. The personal dental services pilots have successfully overcome some inflexibilities. They were introduced in 1997 to test whether new arrangements could serve as an alternative to the national contract for general dental services. The framework that is contained in the National Health Service Primary Care Act 1997 was used by the pilots.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew25"><B> Dr. Brand </B> 
: Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew26"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
: With great respect, I shall not give way any further. Time is short and I need to conclude my remarks.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 67WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h01_para88">The first wave of 15 personal dental services pilots began in October 1998, and the second wave of 23 pilots began in October 1999. They are concerned with access and seek to guarantee a higher quality of service, but they should have the flexibility to meet the varying needs of different elements in our society. The pilots involved, for example, the provision of services to children, deprived communities and the homeless. Some specialist services, such as sedation, general anaesthetics and restorative dentistry are also part of those innovative schemes.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para89">Proposals for the third wave, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) asked about, are being considered. Access to services for those with special service needs, such as the elderly in residential homes, are included in those expressions of interest. There have been expressions of interest in the third wave of personal dental services from Somerset and from Stoke for the establishment of dental access centres. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and the hon. Member for Taunton wish those projects well. I hope that they understand that I am not in a position today to say whether those expressions of interest have succeeded. An announcement will be made when a decision is taken.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para90">The personal dental services complement general dental services practices, which remain the key way by which most people get high-quality NHS dentistry. There was some concern that phone-and-go centres would provide only a second-tier service. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge had something of a cheek to refer to a two-tier service, since that was precisely the legacy that his party left behind when it left government.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para91">I confirm that phone-and-go centres will provide all the treatment that is necessary to maintain oral health, including check-ups--they will not merely be emergency clinics. They will plug gaps when there are problems of availability. They will provide a high-quality service that is based around the needs of patients. At those centres, people who cannot register with an NHS dentist but who want to see one can simply ring to make an appointment. They can be confident that they will receive good NHS care.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para92">Those centres are fully consistent with our ambition to provide faster and fairer treatement through the NHS. Schemes will be set up in various locations, including high streets, clinics and in some of the new primary care walk-in centres. Opposition Members emphasised the importance of linking dental practice with primary care, and we accept that. That is why the new phone-and-go centre in Swindon, which will open later this winter, will be co-located with a walk-in primary care centre. That is how we want such services and initiatives to develop.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para93">There will be about 30 dental access centres, which will ease the most acute problems of access across the country. Expressions of interests for the third wave of access to dental access centres are currently under consideration along with the third wave of the personal dental services pilots. We are confident that there is sufficient manpower in the dental profession to staff those centres. The number of dentists continues to rise. <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 68WH</B></P>
The phone-and-go centres and personal dental services offer the opportunity of making the most of all the talents in a dental team.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para94">I have more to say on this matter but, sadly, time is about to run out. I confirm what I said to the hon. Member for Taunton at the outset--that the Government attach great importance to improving access to NHS dentistry, and that the present situation is not acceptable. That is why we have taken action. We are investing in dentistry and improving access, which has had a significant impact. Despite some of the criticisms that have been made this morning, we are developing a new dental strategy for the NHS, which we shall publish in the new year. We have also made clear commitments today and on previous occasions about restoring access to NHS dentistry.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para95">We recognise the importance of good health and value the well-being of our nation. I hope that hon. Members agree that the Government are trying to deal with those concerns, which we take seriously, and that we are putting in place appropriate measures to tackle the problems.

<a name="91201h01_spnew27"><B> Mrs. Cheryl Gillan  (Chesham and Amersham):</B> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. What progress has been made to ensure that the parallel chamber is televised throughout Parliament in our offices? I spoke to my staff five minutes ago and I understand that the arrangements for televising broadcasts from this Chamber to our offices have still not yet been completed. I believe that a feed is available to the press, but that it is not available to staff, researchers or parliamentarians around the Palace. I hope that you can throw some light on the matter.

<P>
<P>

<P>
</UL></FONT><a name="91201h01_spnew29"><B> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate):</B> 
 On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Yesterday, I was slightly confused about the status of the gentleman who sat next to the Deputy Speaker. I tried to establish whether the Modernisation Committee recommended that Officers of the House should not dress as Officers of the House when they are in attendance in Westminster Hall. I believe that this Chamber is not a Committee of the House, but an extension of the House. It is hard to sustain the dignity of the House of Commons in this Chamber if Officers who are working in the Chamber do not dress in a way that maintains the dignity and traditions of the House. Would you give a direction to the Officers of the House that they should treat this Chamber in the same way they treat the House itself, of which this place is an extension?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h01_spnew30"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: I remind the hon. Member that the report of the Modernisation Committee that gave rise to the experimental activity in which we are engaged gave no formal approval for the use of the Mace, for prayers or for formal attire. I also remind the hon. <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 69WH</B></P>
Member that, when not in the Chamber but still on duty, Officers of the House do not wear their formal rig. For that reason, no such attire is required here.
<P>

<a name="91201h01_para96">Further to that, I must remind the hon. Member that points of order of this sort are an unwarranted intrusion on private Members' debating time. If he seeks to take the matter further, I suggest that he make it part of his report to the Modernisation Committee--everyone is entitled to make a report--which the Committee will consider at the end of the experimental period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tam Dalyell  (Linlithgow):</B> 
 I introduce the debate by being unashamedly personal: is there any sign of a Marshall plan for the Balkans? In particular, is there a proposal to do anything about sanctions against Serbia? That country is the engine of economic revival in the Balkans, and sanctions would make things far more difficult. I am not alone in that opinion; it is also the opinion of Mrs. Alison Elliot, who speaks on behalf of the church and nation committee of the Church of Scotland, of which she is a convenor.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para0">Half a century ago, I was 17 or 18 years old. I was "22424588 Trooper Dalyell", Gunner-Driver in the Royal Scots Greys, based in the former SS barracks at Luneburg with the Rhine Army. That involved being in a tank and firing guns either at the Hohne ranges in Belsen or at Lulworth. The smell, the din, the cordite are still with me.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para1">The regiment was commanded by Lt. Col. Duggie Stewart, DSO, who was Britain's gold medallist at the Helsinki Olympics. My squadron commander was Major Aidan Sprot, who was Viscount Willie Whitelaw's brother-in-law. The major published a moving account of the Greys' progress from Alamein to Anzio, Monte Casino, Normandy, the Rhine crossing and the Elbe. Those experiences were shared by many in the sergeants' mess, some of whom were proud holders of the Military medal.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para2">I say all that because my formative years gave me not a moral superiority but certainly a more cautious attitude to modern war and bombing than those who took the decision--Prime Minister Blair or President Clinton and their Ministers--to unleash missiles. Frankly--it is a hard thing to say--they seem to see war through celluloid images. That may be generational, but it is against that background that I speak with great anger about what has happened.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para3">Stationed with the British Army of the Rhine I was able to visit the flattened cities of Essen, Nuremburg, Osnabruck and Hamburg. Even then, one saw evidence of reconstruction. Rebuilding and the reinstalling of machinery were tangible results of the vision of General George Marshall and his colleagues, who imaginatively embarked on a programme of aid--Marshall aid. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister, the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), whether there is any sign of a Marshall plan for the Balkans? During the conflict, NATO gave the impression that the people of the Balkans were to partake of the prosperity of western Europe. We heard endlessly about the rebuilding of the Balkans. I want to know whether any effort has been made even to start that rebuilding.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para4">During an Adjournment debate three weeks ago and again during the Foreign Affairs debate on the Queen's Speech on Monday, I asked about the 130,000 jobs at the car plant at Zastava that were destroyed. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) and I visited Zastava at the end of September, and the destruction that we saw was appalling--acres and acres of twisted machinery. The factory produced 230,000 cars a year and although the Yugo was not the most <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 71WH</B></P>
popular car, it was at least a source of work. What does such a massive number of unemployed bode for Serbia, which I repeat is the economic engine for the Balkans?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew1"><B> Mr. Edward Leigh  (Gainsborough):</B> 
 I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Unfortunately, the Government seem not to want to give substantial help to Serbia while Milosevic is still in power. That may be a desirable aim, but is it fair to the Serbian people?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: It has been repeatedly emphasised that we have no quarrel with the Serbian people. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax will bear me out: to put it mildly, the trade unions of Zastava were not fans of President Milosevic. There is a real difficulty.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para5">The second question that I asked during those debates concerned an assessment of the long-term effects of pollution that was caused by the recklessly irresponsible targeting of the chemical complex at Pancevo and the oil refinery at Novi Sad. I believe that I am entitled to ask about the Government's response to Pekka Haavisto, the Finn environmentalist who reported for the United Nations environment programme Balkans task force. He asked whether the rules of warfare that resulted in the people of Serbia and Kosovo being faced with life-threatening pollution should be reviewed. Do the Government agree with Haavisto? What is their response to his report?
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para6">Thirdly, I asked about the blocking of the Danube. Putting it bluntly, when my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax and I went to the Ministry of Reconstruction in Belgrade, it was made abundantly clear that no effort whatever would be made to unblock the Danube at Novi Sad until the dollars and the deutschmarks were put on the table to pay for the rebuilding of the bridges. I know that the city of Dortmund has made an offer, but what is NATO's general response to that and to the worries of Bulgarians, Romanians and others who are greatly disadvantaged?
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para7">My hon. Friend and I had the Bulgarian ambassador to lunch last week, and we found that the situation is extremely serious for those countries. As Misha Glenny pointed out:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The stability pact is washed up on a distant shore of the European Union bureaucracy . . . Countries like Romania and Bulgaria bent over backwards to assist the West during the bombing campaign and they expect payback, but they're not getting it. If they don't get payback, their rulers will be out. And what you might get in their place, heaven knows. We're not even . . . giving Romania and Bulgaria reasonable access to EU markets.
<P>
<BR>
The Stability Pact was a good signal, but it is not happening. It really isn't moving. And yet you don't get Robin Cook coming on television every day to say the Stability Pact is in danger of being washed up, which it is. Do we hear people saying out loud: 'We're in new danger?' No."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h02_para8">I ask about the stability pact and the power stations because I never believed that those graphite bombs were simply a matter of technical, temporary knockout. If one drops graphite bombs on power stations, one should expect the delicate machinery to be destroyed.

If night patrols are not provided, there will be no chance to stop the ethnic cleansing. The British Army and the NATO forces went to war in order to stop ethnic cleansing, and now it is happening in reverse.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Last week, I drove down the same road to Prizren and sought out the same church. I found the field and steel gate. But the church was a ruin. A single wall stood. The rest was pulverised stone. Goodbye, then, to the icons and the saints with the staring eyes. Goodbye to Jesus. Goodbye to the Serb Orthodox church. All across Kosovo I found identical scenes, places of worship--sometimes 600 years old--levelled with explosives and hammers, the very identity of Serb history turned to dust amid fields and hillsides by Nato's Kosovo Albanian allies.
<P>
<BR>
The Serb church has issued its own list of destroyed or partly demolished buildings. Between 13 June--when Nato troops entered Kosovo--and 20 October, they say, 74 churches have been turned to dust or burnt or vandalised. The 15th-century monastery of the Holy Trinity above Musutiste, begun in 1465, has been levelled with explosives. The monastery of the Archangel near Vitina, built in the 14th century, has been looted and burnt."

: Jews, the Roma and other minorities have suffered dreadfully. My hon. Friend and I were told in Belgrade that the 52,000 Albanians--that was in September and there may have been a change since--had not been molested. Did we go to war for Greater Albania? I do not want to go on too long, and that is a long subject.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew5"><B> Mr. Crispin Blunt  (Reigate):</B> 
 It would be useful to give an example of the challenge faced by KFOR forces in defending Serbian property, people and churches. I have recently come back from a visit to Kosovo with the Select Committee on Defence. The Queen's Dragoon Guards were permanently guarding a church in which the local Albanian population appeared to have no interest, so the permanent guard was ceased and the church was to be put on a patrol pattern.Within three hours of the guards' being taken away, that church was burnt to the ground.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew6"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: I would be selfish if I went on for too long, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman catches your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to discuss his experience with the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew7"><B> Mr. Paddy Ashdown  (Yeovil):</B> 
 The hon. Gentleman told us that he was a soldier, so he will know that there is a limit to what armies can do and guard. I saw 30,000 Roma at Podgorica the day before yesterday, and every one was a tragic case. I do not pretend that KFOR is completely flawless, but, rather than concentrating his criticisms on it, he might say, as I did yesterday in Pristina, that the action will never be stopped until the Albanian community and its leaders are prepared to support NATO. The force that can close the shops in Pristina can find the relevant people and stop them. It is a lack of leadership on the part of the Albanian politicians that is the bane of the matter, rather than inefficiencies on the part of limited forces in KFOR.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew8"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: I accept that, but I am conscious of the fact that I am probably the last person on the planet to whom the Albanians would listen.

This imagined Balkans--a world where people are motivated not by rational considerations but by a mysterious congenital bloodthirstiness--is always invoked when the great powers seek to deny their responsibility for the economic and political difficulties that the region has suffered as consequence of external interference. 'The Balkans,' Theordore Geshkoff wrote in 1940, 'are usually reported to the outside world only in time of terror and trouble; the rest of the time they are scornfully ignored.'"

<a name="91201h02_para18">Geshkoff is right. The issue becomes all the rage or seems to be forgotten when the British media move on to something else. The book continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is during these long periods of neglect that the Balkan countries have badly needed the engagement of the great powers. Yet the only country to demonstrate a sustained interest in the economic development of the Balkans was Nazi Germany during the 1930s.
<P>
<BR>
The NATO assault on Serbia and Kosovo should be judged above all in this light. Should the West fail to address the effects, not merely of a three month air war in 1999, but of 120 years of miscalculation and indifference since the Congress of Berlin, then there will be little to distinguish NATO's actions from any of its great power predecessors. The NATO campaign can hardly claim either a moral or political victory if its sole achievement is the explusion of Milosevic's Serbia from Kosovo.
<P>
<BR>
There is an unassailable case for political and economic restitution in the Balkans. Yet this is a daunting challenge. The lack of preparedness on the part of NATO was obvious during the air campaign. It was evident after victory, when the Alliance proved incapable of stopping the KLA from imposing a regime of intimidation and murder which provoked the departure of almost the entire Serbian minority population from Kosovo within weeks of the Albanians' return. If the greatest military machine in history is unable to impose law and order in a small province, one cannot help wondering what the future holds for the international community's other, larger Balkan protectorate, Bosnia-Hercegovina; and whether the great powers, above all, the USA, have the political and economic resources to deal with Serbia as it hovers between civil war, economic collapse and conflict with its sister republic, Montenegro. Yet if the great powers fail to seize the present opportunity by investing heavily in the region, the suffering of the Balkans will surely continue for several decades into the new millennium."

<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew9"><B> Mr. Paddy Ashdown  (Yeovil):</B> 
 I am grateful to be called. I think that this is the first speech that I have made as a Back Bencher. I know that I am confined to 10 minutes--[Hon. Members: "No, you are not."] Am I not? Wonderful. I note--as I have slightly more time--that this Chamber fulfils a dream of mine. I longed for the day when we could speak in a less confrontational, semi-circular Chamber. I thought that that day would never come, but here it is.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para20">I agree with so much of what the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) said, but I am bound to say that I disagree with him on the necessity for NATO to take the action that it did. The hon. Gentleman has been to Serbia, but I wonder whether he has ever gone to the refugee camps of the Albanian Kosovars in Kukes and Macedonia; knowing him, he probably has because he is assiduous in these matters. I do not think that he would have found a single person there--I never found one, <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 75WH</B></P>
even among relatives of those killed by NATO--who did not regard the NATO action as both necessary and right.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bowen Wells  (Hertford and Stortford):</B> 
 It is not surprising.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ashdown </B> 
: I think that it is surprising. If your uncle or aunt were killed by an army that was bombing your country, you might have some doubts about whether that was the right path to pursue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spmin0"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Mr. Frank Cook): </B> 
 Order. I am afraid that I must ask all hon. Members to desist from this casual across-the-Chamber approach. The hemicycle configuration may well encourage it, but I intend to discourage it. All remarks must be made through the Chair and if hon. Members expect to have an opportunity to engage in the debate, they must wait their turn in the proper manner.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ashdown </B> 
: I take your admonition, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in so far as it applies to me, which I am sure it does.
 
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para21">I also disagree with the hon. Member for Linlithgow about lifting sanctions. I can only tell him that in my recent conversations across the Balkans over the past four or five days, I asked that question of every person I met. The answer is best characterised by someone whom I met yesterday in Kosovo. He has a sister in Serbia, married to a Serb, who is suffering under the sanctions. He said, "I am not sure that the sanctions are right and I am not sure that they are not counter-productive in their present form, but I am sure of one thing: any relaxation now would be used as a propoganda victory for Milosevic. That we do not want, and that my sister does not want." That is the reality.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para22">I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman on the need for a co-ordinated policy towards the Balkans and the tragedy of the lack of it. I believe that if history is generous to us, it could well say that the Balkan wars of the latter decade of this century came before Europe was ready--it had not yet prepared the institutions for dealing with them. We have no such excuse for not stabilising the peace, for which we have made such great sacrifices. I fear that the cost of both the Bosnian war and the Kosovo war will be great in terms of the sacrifices made at the time and I remain unconvinced that the unco-ordinated policies that we follow--although they are successful in some areas--will deliver a stable peace.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para23">It seems that we in Europe and the international community have decided that the best way to deal with the Balkans is to Balkanise our approach to them, which is utterly crazy. Each of the successive conflicts has ended with a further duplication of institutions, overlapping competencies and a further proliferation of useless institutions--like the hon. Gentleman, I suspect that the stability pact is one of them. There are piecemeal policies which, although they are followed with some success in one country, are not interlinked with others. The institutions have, at best, muddled lines of command. Europe has no co-ordinated, central, regional vision about what the Balkans could be, nor is there a focused political will to drive it forward or a central body to enact <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 76WH</B></P>
it. It is a difficult--even intractable--interlocked and complex problem; to deal with any such problem in that way is folly, but to deal in that way with the Balkans, which has seen 1,000 years of conflict, conspiracy and fissiparousness, is manifest stupidity.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para24">I shall say something that people seem reluctant to say. The problem is that we are now losing the peace there. That is not because of inadequate actions in Kosovo, because it is actually going rather well in some instances, or because of the situation in Bosnia or in Montenegro--after my recent visit there I feel rather more optimistic than I might have--but because our actions are not locked together in a regional approach. This is pre-eminently Europe's problem. If the Balkans go bad, we will suffer. The United Nations has neither the structure nor the political will to provide that regional approach. Although this is Europe's problem, the US is putting greater resources into many of these countries than we in Europe are. It is deeply engaged in Montenegro, for example, and providing money, while Europe's only contribution so far to an area that could blow up the Balkans in the next few weeks is 62 pregnant cows.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para25">In this century, there have been four Balkan wars, two in the first two decades and two in the last decade. That is not counting one world war which started in the Balkans and another in which the Balkans were a major battle field. If at the end of the century we do not understand that we have to tackle the problem on a regional basis, we are stark staring mad. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I am delighted to hear Conservative Members agreeing with that, because they are not going to agree with what comes next.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para26">There is a reason for that failure. Europe will not face up to the reality of its current position. Let me say something that no one else will say: Europe is developing into a super-power. Can we in Europe continue to be in the ludicrous position of creating a hugely powerful economic entity--perhaps the second most powerful economic entity, if not the most powerful--through the euro, yet have no political responsibility attached to it? That is a free ride which Europe cannot afford any longer. We are creating an economic giant, yet wishing to continue as a political pygmy. We must admit to that. If, as I believe, we are creating a super-power in the world, with that economic strength goes political responsibility and we must behave accordingly. It is in the nature of super-powers that they should be sensitive about their border regions and concerned about their marches. The Balkans are the marches of Europe. That is why they are our problem, yet we seem content to believe that once again Uncle Sam should bail us out in our own backyard. That approach will not work, and the grave danger is that sacrifices made in the war could be lost in the peace.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para27">I hope that Europe will now establish institutions to deal with the region. I am confident that our new European Commissioner, Chris Patten, and Mr. Solana, will bring to the Balkan region the European co-ordination that has so far been lacking.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para28">I shall identify some problems and state the current position. I am more confident than I expected to be about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation is progressing slowly, although we have not reached an irreversible point. On a visit there four or five days ago, I was encouraged by the extent to which we <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 77WH</B></P>
have progressed. A continued application of resources and patience is needed from Europe; the desire and willingness to take responsibility for their actions is needed from the Bosnian politicians. That has so far been lacking.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para29">In many ways, I was listening to the dialogue of the deaf in Bosnia. The Bosnians were saying that we had to come and do things for them and make them act; we were asking why they did not yet have a fully fledged democracy. That question ignores completely the fact that we are asking Bosnians to create in several years the democratic institutions and free market that we took 300 or 400 years to create. In Kosovo, we are asking the same, except that there we are asking for that to be done in months and following a devastating civil war. The Bosnians wanted us to be the Hapsburgs, but we would not do it; we wanted Bosnia to be Switzerland, but it was not ready to be that. We must have patience to see the job through. However, I am generally optimistic.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para30">In Montenegro, Milosevic has tried by economic destabilisation to do what he did by brutality and ferocity elsewhere in the Balkans. We can support Djukanovic with a relatively small sum--perhaps $10 million. If that sum is provided quickly, we can stabilise Montenegro economically and prevent Milosevic from destabilising it. Milosevic is unlikely to use immediately the 12,000 or 15,000 JNA--Yugoslav national army--troops that he has in Montenegro: he will use other means to seek to destabilise that country. However, if we act now and are prepared to provide the resources to stabilise the dual currency that Djukanovic has established, we have an opportunity to wrest Montenegro from the power of Milosevic without war and without everything that accompanies war.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para31">I am much less optimistic about Kosovo. The Serb violence of which the hon. Member for Linlithgow spoke is now diminishing. There have been no murders in Pristina--save for the terrifying one on the night before last--since the most recent arrival of British troops. That could be because all the Serbs have already been kicked out, but 100,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo. The tragedy concerns the Roma: their houses have been burned while NATO--our army--has been there. I spoke to a Roma woman whose child was born a few days ago on a truck crossing the terrible mountains that separate Kosovo and Montenegro; I crossed those mountains shortly afterwards. It shames me to say that a child had been born in the back of a truck and that that woman was there with 30,000 other refugees. I have seen so many refugees in the Balkans--Serbs driven out by Croats, Croats driven out by Bosnians, Muslims driven out by Serbs. In Kosovo, a further tide of refugees is being driven out under the suzerainty of NATO.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para32">The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked why NATO cannot protect people in that tiny province--if the most powerful army in the world cannot provide peace, what is its purpose? We have the most efficient army in the world, yet have been unable to protect the Catholics in Northern Ireland for 30 years. The hon. Gentleman must realise the limits of military power. The job cannot be done without the support of Kosovar politicians. I <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 78WH</B></P>
suspect that I made myself unpopular in Pristina yesterday by telling people straight that NATO could not stop the atrocity unless they supported NATO.

<i> rose--</i>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew14"><B> Mr. Ashdown: </B> 
 Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue briefly.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para33">I told those people that their capacity to achieve the independence that they sought for Kosovo depended on whether they honoured their word to the international community to create a multi-ethnic, tolerant and liberal society capable of taking its place in Europe. I said that their current actions would remove the possiblity of their achieving their dream of an independent Kosovo more surely than anything else that they could do. It is up to them to come forward to assist NATO. I said that yesterday to Hashim Thag: the head of the KLA, and to all the political leaders, including Rugova.
 
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para34">Kosovo stands on the brink. I greatly fear that it could slip back into chaos, despite the best efforts of Bernard Kouchner, who is doing a difficult job with great imagination. He needs all the support that he can get; he does not have the support of the Albanian Kosovar population, and I fear that Kosovo will end up almost where it started.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para35">I give way to the hon. Member for Linlithgow with apologies for the fact that I have taken up so much time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew15"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: There are many shortcomings. However, it cannot be said that we did not understand the limits of military power. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn), my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) and I pleaded with the Prime Minister both publicly and privately and before bombs were dropped not to take such action precisely because we understood those limits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew16"><B> Mr. Ashdown </B> 
: The hon. Gentleman took a sincere and well-meant position; I disagreed with him. He overestimates the current capacity of military power to keep the peace in Kosovo, and to stop the killings that we both deeply regret, without the support of the local population.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para36">We have made great sacrifices. The opinion on the Balkans of the population and, perhaps even more, of our politicians in Europe is: "Been there, done that, got the tee-shirt, won the war. Now we can turn our back on the area." Much patient careful focusing of will, much understanding and much careful and wise positioning is required to push towards peace and stability in a region that has infected the rest of Europe with war for so long. I, and most of that area's people, dream of such an outcome. However, that cannot be achieved without courageous politicians on the ground taking the decisions necessary to support the forces that are there to help them. The task cannot be done without resources or patience either, but, above all, it cannot be done unless we in Europe accept that the Balkans is a region and that it must be dealt with as a region. That is our region, and we must get our act together to ensure that such action is taken.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew17"><B> Mrs. Alice Mahon  (Halifax):</B> 
 At the onset of the bombing, many of my hon. Friends and I signed an early-day motion that condemned NATO aggression as unlawful and immoral. I wish to consider the unlawfulness of the action. Both the Foreign Secretary and the former Secretary of State for Defence--now the Secretary-General of NATO--told the House on several occasions that they had legal authority for NATO's war against Yugoslavia on the basis that force could be used in extreme circumstances to avert humanitarian disaster. That the bombing acted as a catalyst to humanitarian disaster is now clear. Eminent lawyers are arguing that the military action was illegal.
 
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para37">In a recent pamphlet for the Centre for Policy Studies and in an article for <i>The Times</i> on 16 November, Mark Littman QC disputed the lawfulness of the action. Submissions made on behalf of the Yugoslav Government against several NATO countries, including the United Kingdom, were put before the International Court of Justice, alleging that the NATO intervention was unlawful. Mark Littman noted in those publications that the Yugoslav case fell on a technicality. The United Kingdom could have waived the objection and accepted the Yugoslav challenge to have the legality of the bombing tested before the court. The Government chose not to do so. Mark Littman commented:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Given the weight of opinion and legal authority against the NATO position, the paucity of evidence in its favour and the reluctance of the UK to test its view before the International Court of Justice, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the NATO action was illegal."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h02_para38">I submit that the action undoubtedly was illegal; that bodes ill for the future of international law. However, we do not have time to consider that. My overriding reason for opposing the war was my belief, now justified by what we see happening in Kosovo, that the intervention would make matters far worse.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para39">I wish to consider the lead-up to the war. I was disgracefully smeared during the previous debate on the matter, so I shall repeat this point: wherever a crime against humanity is committed, I fully support measures to bring the perpetrators to justice. There are no exceptions to that. I condemn without reservation the Serb murderers, especially Arkan, who has done so much damage throughout the Balkans. I condemn equally--I ask those who supported the war to join me in this--Brigadier General Agim Ceku, who was the main perpetrator of Operations Storm and Flash in Croatia where thousands of Serbs were massacred or disappeared. I recently visited the mass graves and met some of the 300,000 Serbs who were ethnically cleansed. It is interesting to note that, just before NATO went to war with Yugoslavia, the international court tribunal's report, implicating Ceku and an American general in the war crimes that were committed against the Serbs in the Krajina, was leaked. I shall try to obtain an Adjournment debate on that subject.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para40">We should be even-handed when we talk about war criminals, but such are NATO's double standards in this war against Yugoslavia that, far from comdemning Ceku, it accepts that he is now in charge of the so-called Kosovo Protection Corps, the KLA by another name. That reflects NATO's determination to demonise just <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 80WH</B></P>
one side in the Balkans. The right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) talks about the Albanian leaders, but they were our brave allies. We acted as their air force during this war when we took the side of terrorists and murderers. We should not be surprised if their behaviour has not changed.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para41">Another factor in the run-up to the war was the Rambouillet ultimatum. I was pleased to see Robert Fisk's excellent article in <i>The Independent</i> recently, which said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the last days of the Paris peace talks on Yugoslavia last March, something extraordinary happened. The Serb delegation--after agreeing to a political solution in Kosovo--was presented with a military appendix to the treaty which demanded the virtual NATO occupation of all of Yugoslavia."

The Serbs turned down that demand, as would every country in NATO, and NATO went to war. Yet 79 bombing days later, NATO, which had refused to contemplate a change in the military document, lost all interest in the appendix and was content to keep its forces in Kosovo. It did not want to go into the rest of Yugoslavia. The House should debate that in detail because history will show that the Rambouillet accords were an ultimatum, deliberately engineered to start a war.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h02_para42">When I was in Kosovo recently with the parliamentary wing of NATO, we met Mr. Thaqi, the ethnic Albanian leader, the good and brave Mr. Veton Sorroi, who is one of the few hopes for Kosovo, and Mr. Trajkovic, the Kosovan-Serb leader who painted a gloomy picture of what was happening in Kosovo and outlined his fears for the other minorities who live there. Since then, he has been shot in the leg, through the door of his flat. I do not want to criticise soldiers, but, if KFOR cannot protect the leader of the Serbs in Pristina, there is little hope for other ethnic minorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew18"><B> Mr. Ashdown </B> 
: I wonder whether the hon. Lady knows the circumstances of the shooting. Mr. Trajkovic was shot with a .22--one would hardly shoot a rabbit with a .22--through a glass door which deflected the bullet. There is a strong opinion on all sides that that may have been carried out by one of his own people, or even by himself.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew19"><B> Mrs. Mahon </B> 
: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that, but I heard the same argument to support the view that the Serbs blew up their own houses in Pristina. That type of comment is not helpful.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para43">We were told by military and civilian international representatives in Kosovo that they expected the risk and gravity of terrorism for ethnic and criminal motives to increase, and it has. It was clear then, as it is now, that the terrorist organisation--the KLA--was organising, with some success, the murder, kidnapping and ethnic cleansing of all minorities. When a general who briefed us refused to admit the KLA's involvement, I was told to talk to the Irish Guards. As we were staying and sleeping in tents in the camp, I talked to some of the Irish Guards who told me that the KLA was organising those activities. They were clear on that. Since the KFOR occupation, the Roma, Montenegrans, Turks, Bosniaks and Jews have been ethnically cleansed by the KLA.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 81WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h02_para44">According to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report on minorities on 3 November, 348 murders have been committed, 116 kidnappings have taken place and more than 1,000 houses have been burnt down. How many times were we told that we were going into the area to stop ethnic cleansing and murder? How many times did we hear Jamie Shea, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Robertson, who is now Secretary-General of NATO, say that we wanted the Serbs out, NATO in and the refugees back? What about the refugees now? Are we not worried if they belong to one ethnic group instead of another? The Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence should make statements to the House on the situation in Kosovo. The deafening silence is scandalous.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para45">I mentioned Orahovac, which is a Serb and Roma--and once a Jewish--enclave in Kosovo. It is supposedly under the protection of the Dutch KFOR peacekeepers. I have referred to what the Jewish community leader said about the situation there, but information that I received today from Orahovac is appalling. A Serb woman, Mirjana Jokic, pleaded with a group of reporters only yesterday:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Get us out now, please. Living in Orahovac is worse than being in a concentration camp."

Describing the situation as catastrophic, members of other ethnic minorities said that there is no electricity, food or heating in the Serb and Roma parts of town. Almost the only way for people to get food is to wait, sometimes for days, for aid that is delivered by international, Serbian and humanitarian organisations. Babies are being born in basements with no electricity or water. A 70-year-old Serb woman, Javana Cusic, said that she has not seen fruit or vegetables for more than a month. Threats by ethnic Albanians have been increasing hour by hour. It must be awful living under those conditions.

<P>
<P>
</UL></FONT><a name="91201h02_spnew20"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
 It may help the hon. Lady to illustrate the failure of NATO's policy if I point out that, of the 300,000 children who are in education in Kosovo, it is thought that only 1,000--one third of 1 per cent.--are of Serbian extraction, which shows that those people with families have left the area. Only the old people, who are not welcome in Serbia, remain. The future is horribly clear.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew21"><B> Mrs. Mahon: </B> 
 It is only a matter of time before we have an ethnically pure Albania. Albanians such as Veton Sorroi receive death threats if they speak against the terror that is taking place in Kosovo. I agree with the right hon. Member for Yeovil; the Roma are in a worse position than other ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para46">A joint report issued by the OSCE on Wednesday confirmed that there is now a climate of violence and impunity. If attacks by Albanians against the dwindling population and the gypsies continue unabated, more misery will follow. Muslim Slavs in the Prizren area of Kosovo are suffering intimidation and violence because that is how the KLA organises things. We were told when we were there that the organising groups pick on <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 82WH</B></P>
certain groups of people at certain times. The people who guard them have a very difficult task. The tragedy is that we should not have been there in the first place. Had we increased the number of OSCE verifiers and sent 10,000 instead of 2,000--as some of us pleaded with the Government to do--the present misery could have been avoided.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para47">Yesterday, I read in <i>The Guardian </i>that a mob of Kosovo Albanians attacked a family of elderly Serbs and killed one of them. On Sunday, the leader of the KLA, the self-proclaimed leader Hashim Thaqi, and the war criminal General Agim Ceku, presided over a rally at which KLA members, wearing uniforms of the now so-called unarmed Kosovo Protection Corps, fired hundreds of rounds from rifles and guns to celebrate their flag day--KFOR simply looked on. It is time that the Government made a statement giving their response to the lawlessness that is in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para48">My final point was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow. Will the Minister explain to hon. Members the current legal basis for sanctions against Yugoslavia? The House of Commons Library told me on 29 October that the reason was that extreme criminality was being carried out by a Government against their people. That was the message, although I may not have quoted the exact words.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para49">The current extreme criminality is perpetrated by the KLA against its own people. What shall we do about that? We need a clear understanding of why sanctions still apply because the original reason for imposing them no longer exists. I have mentioned the article by Mark Littman and I advise hon. Members to read it because it spells out clearly the illegality of NATO's decisions.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para50">My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and I are members of a campaign to build bridges with the people of Yugoslavia. At the end of September, a delegation from the campaign visited Yugoslavia. We found that the lives of the vast majority of ordinary citizens there have been shattered by the bombing of their country. The consequences continue to take an enormous toll on people from all ethnic groups who have little, if any, influence over the terrible circumstances in which they find themselves.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para51">It has been said that we are not enemies of the Serbian people. Serbia is a multicultural country and I wish that more people would go there. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow under estimated the number of Albanians who live in Belgrade: there are almost 100,000 of them, working in very good positions. There are also 50,000 Montenegrins there--Belgrade is a very mixed community. I visited the camps to which Albanians were driven by the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and I went into Macedonia. My hon. Friend and I also visited the camps outside Belgrade. We visited a Roma camp where people were housed in makeshift conditions in an old school. A visit to refugees is heartbreaking. Some of them have been in the camp for four years, but no one is calling for these Romas or Serbs to return to their homes. NATO has operated a set of double standards.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para52">The civilian infrastructure of the whole of Yugoslavia is devastated. The environment is poisoned. Homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed and roads and bridges have been ruined. We took masses of photographs, so we have all the evidence. The <P>

destruction of the electricity supply and the water purification systems presents an on-going threat to public health. All in all, NATO's action has been an absolute disaster. I have spoken honestly and earnestly. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is the Minister having to take the flak. This is not his brief and I am sad that he has to be here to listen to what I have said. I know him to be a very good and compassionate man. The sooner the Foreign Secretary comes to the House to make a statement on the chaos that is now Kosovo, the better.

<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew22"><B> Mr. Martin Bell  (Tatton):</B> 
 I shall be extremely brief. I commend this new non-confrontational arrangement of the furniture. I, too, have long wanted it. I hope that it will signal a new kind of politics, with less of the fake aggression and synthetic skirmishing which mark too much of the party battlefield.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para53">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for initiating and introducing the debate, although his perspective and mine are somewhat different. From what I have seen of these wars which began in April 1992, I know that one of their distinguishing features was that civilians not only suffered; they were targeted with particular and peculiar ferocity.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para54">With the NATO bombardment of Kosovo and Serbia, we find ourselves in some sense complicit in the targeting of civilians. I believe that because of the manner in which that air campaign was conducted. The attack on the television station in Belgrade was an attack on an unambiguously civilian target. The attacks on bridges were attacks on civilian targets. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have suffered, and are suffering, not only in Yugoslavia but in countries upstream and downstream of the Danube. What did we do in Kosovo itself? We bombed from 15,000 ft so that our casualties should be zero. I do not wish there to be allied casualties, but if the result is that thousands of civilians are killed on the ground who would not have been killed if the operation had been conducted differently, we must ask ourselves what kind of people we are, and whether we have learnt so very much since the tragedies in Bosnia.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para55">What happened in Bosnia when Srebrenica fell in July 1995 was that obviously we assumed that Dutch lives, especially, but also British, German and French lives, mattered on one scale of values, and Bosnian lives mattered on another. It seems to me that the lesson has not been learnt, because we have done the same thing again.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para56">An example with which you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, will be familiar is the incidence of cluster bombs on the soil of Kosovo. Most of the injuries inflicted on casualties in Kosovo every day come not from Serbian and mines or Albanian-laid land mines, but from these engines of death which were dropped by NATO. Many more failed to explode because of the high altitude from which they were dropped--the failure rate might be as high as 20 per cent. There are, on the ground, more than 14,000 cluster bombs with the characteristics of aerially sown land mines. Technically, they are not land mines, but they have the same effect. If we do not consider this matter on a moral level, the Ministry of Defence must seriously question a strategy in which one of its major <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 84WH</B></P>
weapons is just not working and is jeopardising allied soldiers, as the tragic case of the two Gurkhas who were blown up showed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew23"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: How does that lie with the claims of credit from the Secretary-General of NATO, Lord Robertson, in relation to the Montreal convention on land mines? Lord Robertson told us endlessly what an achievement it was to have resolved the problems with that convention.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew24"><B> Mr. Bell </B> 
: That is an interesting point. We congratulate ourselves on signing a treaty while at the same time we not only fail to clear anti-personnel mines on the ground but, in this case, sow some ourselves by dropping them from the air. We should reproach ourselves for that and our Government should learn from it. There is no point going through these experiences unless we learn from them.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para57">That applies to sanctions. I have spent an enormous amount of the past 10 years in countries affected by sanctions. I cannot remember one--and Kosovo is a classic--in which sanctions have worked; they have also been unproductive or counter-productive. It is a classic case of their benefiting the warlords and racketeers and penalising ordinary people. Arkan was mentioned. I know him: in a singular sense, he counts me as a friend. I can assure hon. Members that he enriched himself as a result of sanctions imposed on Serbia in 1993. We have to be aware of the consequences of our actions.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para58">One other point has not been raised so far. I believe that there is a crisis among the 200 or more non-governmental organisations and aid agencies in Kosovo. The streets of Pristina are crammed with traffic jams involving those white vehicles. I heard yesterday of an Army sergeant who is using combat rations--probably against Queen's regulations--to take food up to a starving family in a distant village because none of the aid agencies and NGOs has been up there.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para59">We have to learn from that. I hope that the Department for International Development will evaluate what is working and what is not. To some extent, the operation has to be militarised. We have the best Army in the world, and it has done magnificently in Kosovo, bringing aid and helping people, but, as the Army withdraws and civilian agencies take over, we find that they are simply not doing so well.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para60">May I reinforce what was said by the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown), who has a particular knowledge of these circumstances? He said that it is right to do what we have been doing. Our strategy has been right, but our tactics wrong. We have to hang in there. We must commit ourselves. We must not let these people down. As we end the bloodiest century in recorded human history, we have to realise that throughout the world--and especially in the Balkans--we cannot afford a future like our past.

 I am grateful to be called to speak briefly in this debate. I congratulate the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) on initiating the debate and starting it off so bravely. I also admire the courage of the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon). Both hon. <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 85WH</B></P>
Members have spoken without fear against their Government on these matters and both have been criticised unjustifiably. In my hearing, they have been accused of being traitors to their country. I deeply regret such remarks in the House, as they are entirely undeserved.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para61">I want to focus my remarks on the humanitarian effort. After all, one of the main reasons for going to war--we are talking, unambiguously, about war--was to prevent a huge humanitarian disaster. That was the reason given by the Prime Minister to the House of Commons. However, we have had a huge humanitarian disaster and it is continuing. There is a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, where more than 820,000 refugees now face the severe Balkan winter, in which temperatures are likely to fall to minus 20 degrees. Many older people are incapable of surviving that and will die of hypothermia, as will young children and people in ill health. Hypothermic deaths are likely in large numbers, not just in Kosovo but in Serbia, where there are more than 800,000 refugees or displaced persons.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para62">I want to draw the attention of the House to the traditional meaning of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid, under which the Red Cross and Red Crescent have operated in war zones, was designed to be totally even-handed. It was not supposed to matter whether someone was a non-combatant or a combatant or for what side he fought: anyone in need was to be provided with food and shelter to survive conditions in war. That is why the Red Cross could operate for both sides during the second world war: it was dangerous, but it was allowed to operate.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para63">We are starting to use humanitarian aid politically, particularly in this part of the world. If we continue to do so, we will exacerbate the hatred and tensions in the Balkans. Far from producing an overall settlement--the war was intended to achieve that--we will sow the seeds, as we are already, for further Balkan wars and atrocities. The 800,000 refugees in Serbia are not being serviced by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which should be operating even-handedly in Serbia as well as in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para64">Let us deal with Kosovo first. More than 50 per cent. of houses that are capable of being repaired will remain unrepaired if the necessary materials are not provided for the whole of the coming winter. Those that have been repaired are the result of the provision of those materials, principally by UNHCR operating outside its normal parameters. Of the 50 per cent. that are temporarily repaired for the winter, only one room has been repaired. The rest of the houses will remain unrepaired, which means that the rest of the population--some 400,000 people--will have to be accommodated by friends or relatives in difficult conditions. There will be no food--it will have to be provided by the World Food Programme--and no heating because of the destruction of the power stations. Those people will face a difficult winter, whether in houses that have been temporarily repaired or in those that have not.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para65">What is happening on the other side of the border in Serbia is even worse. Repairs have not been carried out, equipment has not been provided by UNHCR, and Serbia is without heat because of the bombing of power <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 86WH</B></P>
stations. Heat is available only by burning wood. People go out to collect firewood and there is a risk of being blown up by a cluster bomb land mine. There will also be massive environmental destruction as a result of people collecting firewood to keep warm during the winter.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para66">Sanctions against Serbia mean that oil cannot be imported. Heating oil, which is an alternative to electricity for the provision of heat, also cannot be brought in. What are we doing about it? The European Union has organised a large convoy of tankers--I have seen pictures of them--carrying heating oil to be transported across the Serbian borders to the three towns immediately north of Kosovo in Serbia. It is to be supplied to the mayors of those towns for distribution to refugees without heating. It is going only to those three towns because they are headed by mayors who are against Milosevic. If that is not a distortion and a complete undermining of the concept of humanitarian aid, I do not know what is. I do not believe for a minute that that heating oil will be distributed in accordance with the desires of those supplying it. Milosevic is capable of taking it over and distributing it to whomever he likes. That is the nature of sanctions: they give power to the Government to use the supplies entering the country exactly as the Government decide.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para67">Humanitarian aid was never supposed to be about that. It is being used politically and is making a farce of the concept. It will exacerbate the tensions within Serbia between those who have the heating oil and those who do not. That is an entirely unacceptable means of producing a peace settlement, which is what we are supposed to be looking for. The objective of the allies was--however much it is denied--to get rid of Milosevic. They have not done so. They had to negotiate with Milosevic, and they have negotiated the present settlement with him.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para68">We must now move on to the next stage of providing an effective settlement in the Balkans. That will never happen unless humanitarian aid is provided without any prejudice as to its recipients, whether Serb, Roma, Kosovar, Jew or whoever. If people are in need, the humanitarian organisations--to which we are proudly contributing through our Department for International Development budget--must lay the foundations for reconciliation after this terrible war. Bridges must be built and sanctions lifted in order to begin to provide a basis for a settlement in this war-torn area.

<a name="91201h02_spnew26"><B> Mr. Robert N. Wareing  (Liverpool, West Derby):</B> 
 Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spmin1"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Mr. John McWilliam): </B> 
 Order. In this chamber, the correct address is Mr. Deputy Speaker. While I am speaking, I note that several hon. Members still wish to speak. If hon. Members keep their speeches brief, they can all have their say.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew27"><B> Mr. Wareing:  </B> 
Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to work in these surroundings for the first time. We are working in humane and civilised conditions, which certainly cannot be said of circumstances in Yugoslavia.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para69">I listened with great interest to the speeches of my hon. Friends the Members for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon). They have witnessed the <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 87WH</B></P>
dreadful conditions in Kosovo and in Yugoslavia more generally. They mentioned the names of people and towns, but I guarantee that there will be no mention in any newspaper, radio broadcast or television programme tomorrow of what they had to say.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para70">Incidentally, how many massacre sites have been discovered and how many bodies recovered? When Serbs were carrying out massacres, not a day passed when we did not see horrible scenes on our television screens and on the front pages of our newspapers. We were told that all that was a result of ethnic cleansing by the Serbs. I am not surprised that we shall not see any of that in tomorrow's newspapers, and I remind hon. Members of a matter that I raised in 1993.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para71">On 2 May 1993, I stood on the edge of a massacre site in Bosanskibrod in north Bosnia, where 38 bodies in different stages of decomposition were already laid out on the ground. I shall never forget the smell, the flies and the general atmosphere in that town. I felt how I imagine British soldiers must have felt when they liberated Belsen concentration camp. Not a word appeared in the press or the media, whom we informed. The present Secretary of State for Scotland was there and was asked by a pressman, "Who are these people?" He replied: "Oh, they are Serbs who have been massacred by Croats." "But we cannot print that," said the pressmen. "Why not?" asked the Secretary of State. "It will only confuse people," was the reply.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para72">Everything had to be seen in black and white. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will confirm that. So I am not surprised at the lack of even-handedness from day one. The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) spoke about the war starting in April 1992. My God, massacres were going on in 1991. Serbs were being driven from their homes in Croatia in 1991. In early 1992, I remember meeting a Serbian man and a Muslim woman who had been driven out of their homes in Rijeka, Croatia, because they were ethnically impure in the eyes of Franjo Tudjman who, in my eyes, is a war criminal. Those people were not allowed to remain in their homes in Croatia.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para73">Hardly a word is ever spoken about that. We sometimes saw the Foreign Secretary twice a week during the Kosovo conflict. However, he does not get up to speak to the House about the circumstances in Kosovo and the plight of people in Serbia which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax said, is a multi-ethnic state. Hungarians form 25 per cent. of the population in Vojvedina and, as far as they are concerned, there is little oppression. I have met them, so I know that that is the position.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para74">There is no doubt that the ultimatum issued at Rambouillet offered the Yugoslavs the choice of submission or destruction. No sovereign state would have submitted in that way. NATO said to Yugoslavia what Hitler said to Czechoslovakia. He told the Czechs, "We are justified in occupying the whole of your country because you are persecuting German minorities."
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para75">We must see the bigger picture, not just the Balkans. The Balkans fits into the world strategy of NATO, which is dominated by the United States of America. We must consider our relations with Russia, which played a major part in ending the conflict in Kosovo. Yet Russia was rewarded by the refusal to allow a Russian sector. <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 88WH</B></P>
Had the Russians had a sector, many innocent Serbs who have been murdered by the Kosovo Liberation Army may have been alive today.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para76">We must examine the matter in the context of NATO wanting to enlarge. The real motive for the Rambouillet ultimatum was not to save the population in Kosovo or Serbia, it related to the expansion of NATO. Incidentally, annexe B was not shown to Russia until after the event. Russia ought to be included to a greater extent in the security of Europe. After the second world war, we brought West Germany into the community of western nations, despite its Nazi past. What do we do with Russia at the end of the cold war? We ignore it. I was very pleased when I heard on the radio that Russian troops had arrived in Pristina ahead of everyone else. At least they were making a point and making their mark.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para77">We must examine the Balkans within the broader picture involving our relations with Russia. I want an assurance from the Minister--who, I appreciate, is a compassionate member of my party--that Kosovo is still recognised by the United Kingdom as part of the sovereign republic of Yugoslavia.

 I--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew29"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Are these debates not meant for Back Benchers?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew30"><B> Mr. Deputy Speaker </B> 
: They certainly are.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew31"><B> Mrs. Gillan </B> 
: I do not claim to have the experiences of other contributors to this debate, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell), who has persevered in continual raising this topic. However, I do not need the experiences of other hon. Members to know that there is a serious problem. I reiterate the call from Conservative Members for a full inquiry into Britain's diplomatic and military roles, and the aid that has gone to Kosovo. The Prime Minister displayed arrogance in replying to a question from the hon. Member for Linlithgow in May and another from my right hon. Friend the leader of the Conservative party concerning the request for an inquiry. The Prime Minister dismissed the latter question with one line: "I see no need." However, today's contributions reveal a serious need for a full inquiry and for lessons to be learned.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para78">Conservative Members never had any doubt that it was right for NATO to take action to deal with the atrocities committed by Milosevic. Indeed, we were successful in removing Serbian forces from Kosovo. However, I agree with the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) that the international community seems in danger of losing the peace. Indeed, I would go further and say that we are now in danger of turning a disaster into a catastrophe.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para79">The policy of armed intervention to stop the violation of human rights carries a responsibility to fill the vacuum when the oppressor is forced to leave. That has not happened in Kosovo, and the repercussions can be felt throughout the Balkans and Europe.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para80">Will the Minister respond to Back Benchers' valuable points? Even though the subject is not his direct responsibility, I hope that he will pay attention to <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 89WH</B></P>
matters raised in our debate, especially those concerning the state of the inhabitants of Kosovo, who are living in damaged houses without heat or light and who are without policing in a lawless society. It is important that we know the Government's attitude towards the chaos in Kosovo, not least for the protection of the population and the 260 non-governmental organisations working in the area.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para81">I shall give the Minister time to reply, and I hope that he will say specifically whether he will join the rest of the House in calling for an inquiry, and what will he do about the dreadful conditions. Winter and peace in Kosovo could prove to be more lethal than bombs and bullets.

: We owe a debt of gratitude to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for the persistence and integrity with which he has pursued these matters and presented them to the House. He recently won <i>The Spectator </i>Back Bencher of the year award, and all hon. Members would wish to congratulate him sincerely on that. He brings to our deliberations the highest standards of debate, which have been reflected here today.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para82">The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) said that we come from different perspectives and are using a range of perspectives in the analysis of the origins of the conflict and subsequent actions. However, what is shared in this Room is a deep, genuine and serious humanitarian concern for the people and their futures. I was particularly struck when my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow used the seminal phrase about the danger of seeing war through "celluloid images". That was echoed by others, who said that after the crisis and the media images we should not walk away and go on to the next crisis. We should not forget and neglect what has happened. That has not happened in the House precisely because, with respect, most hon. Members who have contributed have direct personal experience over the years of going to the place of conflict, taking notes, listening, discussing and bringing back information. That is a strength in depth in the House. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells) has a track record in aid and development and in asking questions to ensure that aid reaches the people who need it--that view was buried in his questions about whether heating aid was getting through.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para83">I have only a few moments in which to reply and cannot possibly answer all the questions, using the full notes that I have and making comments. However, if any questions are outstanding, I hope that hon. Members will write to my Department. We shall try to respond appropriately and to take the debate on board.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para84">I share with hon. Members the fact that I, too, visited Kosovo. I was the first Minister to go there after the Secretary of State for Defence. I did so precisely because I wanted to take in engineers with expertise in technology and in dealing with power stations and water plants so that they could start rebuilding Kosovo. That was two short weeks after the KFOR troops had moved in. We intervened for humanitarian reasons, and we should not lose sight of that.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 90WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h02_para85">I want to say something about how I saw Kosovo and about the work that has been done to repair energy plants. I visited the power station Kosovo B, which is up and running and producing 40 per cent. more electricity than it did before the conflict. If I had more time, I could spell out exactly why that is. Surprisingly, the grid system goes through the whole of Yugoslavia, not simply Kosovo. So, there is more detail that I would like to spell out.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para86">We are not constructing a wider, full plan for the whole of Serbia. The reason for that is that we are not reconciled with Milosevic. Sanctions, as the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) put it, would give Milosevic a propaganda victory, and we agree.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para87">My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) raised pertinent points about Rambouillet and the legal basis, and I shall touch on that in the moments that I have. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow received a written answer to his question on 26 November. That reply sets out some details, and I simply refer to it for the record. However, at the same time, the UK has not evaded the case brought by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the International Court of Justice. The case was about only interim measures, not the substance--we were not asked about the substance in the first place. The FRY has not yet brought its full case to court and has been asked to do so by January 2000. Then, the allies and NATO, including the UK, will have the time and opportunity to respond, and we shall if the FRY persists with its case. In a sense, the case is still pending at this stage.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para88">My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax referred to Mr. Fisk's article. We disagree with his analysis. The Serbs refused to negotiate seriously on the Rambouillet text. They refused the political agreement, which the Kosovo Albanians accepted. There was no ultimatum to the Serbs at Rambouillet. The Foreign Secretary co-chaired those meetings and he writes in a letter to <i>The Independent</i> today that it is
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"wrong to say that the Serbs were prepared to agree at the Rambouillet peace talks to a political resolution in Kosovo. At the second round of talks, as well as refusing to discuss implementation, the Serbs sought to reopen large parts of the political text to which they had previously indicated assent. All members of the Contact Group, including Russia, refused to accept this."

I shall not read the full letter, but simply touch on it for the record. There are debates and arguments to be had on that issue, but the case put by Robert Fisk was not clear cut and absolutely accurate.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h02_para89">Of course, reconstruction must focus on the future. What do we do immediately and in the longer term? We need to be clear about what we face. There have been massive displacements among the 2 million Kosovars present at the time of the conflict and people have been murdered. Some 400,000 people were displaced inside Kosovo before the NATO air strikes, and there were 90,000 outside Kosovo. A quarter of all European Union asylum applications in 1998 came from Kosovo Albanians. There was a real crisis, and we should bear that in mind.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para90">What are we doing to rebuild Kosovo? I visited it in June. The estimates of the damage to housing varied greatly, from 10 per cent. to 25 per cent. of the total stock. However, much of the damage was not the result of bombing, and I was surprised at how little bombing <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 135WH</B></P>
damage there was. The damage was actually the result of fire. The roofs of houses had collapsed because the wooden beams had collapsed. The white wall structures were still standing and the roofs could be repaired. That seemed, in housing terms, to be more of a rehabilitation job than a clear-and-build job. The flats were still standing in Pristina. While I was there, they were empty. Two days later, they were full of people, as 10,000 people a day came back on trucks and tractors. I saw washing hanging out from the flats, as people started to rebuild their lives. The worst areas were the villages, and I saw Pec. However, the roads were intact. I visited the hospital that was mentioned, which was not bombed. The power station to which I referred was not bombed. However, it seemed to have suffered from 30 years of neglect and from a lack of basic care and maintenance on the part of the previous regime. The machinery--there were boilers from Britain--was 60 years old and needed basic repairs. The problem was that there were no staff to run the power station, and the engineers were doing that job.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para91">I want to give just one vignette in the moments that I have left, because it is important. While I was at the power station--most of the work force had gone--an Albanian engineer knocked at the door and asked for his job back. He said, "I worked in this power station 10 years ago, when I was replaced by a Serb from Belgrade."

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew32"><B> Mr. Dalyell </B> 
: Will my hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew33"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
: May I just finish this point? Then, I certainly will give way.

<a name="91201h02_para92">Meanwhile, the Serb who had been doing the job the previous day had gone home and rung in sick because he feared that Albanians would return and that his house would be burnt down as a result. A soldier went and sat in his house while he returned to work. The Serb and the Albanian then worked on getting the power station up and running, and it is up and running now. I offer that as a tiny sign of hope that ethnic conflicts can be diminished and integrated into contexts in which people might work together.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h02_spnew35"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
: I take the point. Again, I do not have time to go into what we are doing in Serbia. However, the international community is in place on the ground in Serbia with programmes to meet genuine human need, which will continue through this winter and beyond. However, I should say again that while the regime is still in place, with the corruption and the rest of it, it is not all that easy to get aid through to the places where it is needed. However, non-governmental organisations are already operating in Serbia. The European Community's humanitarian office, to which the UK contributes, has increased its programme in Serbia to 62 million euros this year. The International Committee of the Red Cross has assistance programmes in place. There are soup kitchens to provide hot meals for more than 1,000 people. I checked and found that the winter programme that is being put in place provides clothes, shoes and stoves that will help 300,000 people. Those programmes are happening now.
<P>

<a name="91201h02_para93">The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford referred to the difficulties of getting heating oil through. However, it is being blocked at the borders. That suggests that, in other circumstances, a Marshall plan could be put in place, but that there is not an agreement among all the parties to undertake reconstruction. One of the parties is still sitting out on that issue.

<a name="91201h02_spnew36"><B> Mr. Ashdown </B> 
: I am grateful to the Minister because he has been generous in the last few seconds. I want to place a few comments on record, because the question was asked whether there would be a real tragedy in Kosovo this winter. In my most recent visits there, every official, expert and Kosovar whom I met believed that, tough though it would be, this winter would be better than last. Then, they could not bring in the harvests and did not have time to mend their roofs. Although I cannot pretend that nobody will suffer, it will be easier this winter than it was last year under the Serbs.

<a name="91201h03_spnew0"><B> Mr. Llew Smith  (Blaenau Gwent):</B> 
 I declare a non-financial interest as a member of the board of Gwent theatre in education. The debate will cover not just the future of a few theatre companies, but the future of theatre in education and the benefits that our children derive from that experience.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para0">I was reminded of that some days ago when I received correspondence from Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I feel very strongly that involving children in the performing arts at an early age is vital for two reasons. Firstly, it opens their minds and releases their imaginations to creative possibilities and secondly, it allows children from any background or economic circumstance to show and develop their talents on an equal basis. There is no better way in which children can express their self-worth than through working with other children and being encouraged to show what they can do."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h03_para1">Similar sentiments and recognition of the importance of the work were expressed by Hannah Gething in a letter to a local newspaper, the <i>Abergavenny Chronicle,</i> which stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I never realised that education could be so enchanting, inspirational and fun until, at the age of ten years, our class was dragged down to the school hall to watch 'A Midsummer's Night Dream' by William Shakespeare.
<P>
<BR>
A play containing fairies, love, comedy, oppression and class divisions, was softened by Shakespeare's portrayal of magic.
<P>
<BR>
Yet, in my opinion, this magical play would not have captured the intentions of its playwright if it were not for the spectacular performance of Gwent Theatre. Despite being a small company, they create performances that all professional theatre companies would be proud of.
<P>
<BR>
To lose Gwent Theatre would be to lose a valuable and creative part of the community."

The letter continued:
<P>
<BR>
"How many theatre companies would be willing to take in the youth of our town . . . in order to give them a chance to get off the streets and realise talents they were unaware of; talents that could go unrecognised at school?
<P>
<BR>
It is Gwent Theatre who have enabled our young people to attend some of Britain's most successful musical and acting institutions and have prepared other young people for film and television.
<P>
<BR>
Cutting Gwent Theatre's funds is a tragedy but surely not a tragedy where we can simply close the script!"

This debate is our way to ensure that the script is not closed. Indeed, it will not be closed until the drama strategy of the Arts Council of Wales is scrapped.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h03_para2">Only yesterday, the Welsh parliamentary Labour party unanimously called for an inquiry into the matter. It was right to do so, because before becoming the chairperson of the Arts Council of Wales, Sybil Crouch described the drama strategy as a tragedy that will further deprive valley communities outside Cardiff, Milford Haven and Mold, and the consultation process as a mockery. Yet when she became the chairperson, by sheer coincidence, she decided that the strategy was acceptable and proceeded to defend it.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para3">I can forgive a fool, but it is difficult to forgive those who sell their past and everything that has been important to them to further their self-interest and to damn those who are victims of their decisions. Unfortunately, the Minister in the Welsh Assembly who <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 94WH</B></P>
is responsible for the arts seems to be willing to peddle the nonsense provided to him by the Arts Council of Wales. He announced a few days ago that the drama strategy will result in more money, more performances, more actor weeks and larger audiences. That is untrue, and if he did not know that then, I hope that he does now. My hon. Friends the Members for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) and I issued a statement that we were saddened that that Minister should be part of such a publicity stunt, which gave a totally inaccurate picture of drama in Wales. My hon. Friends and I met the Arts Council of Wales on Monday and were told that theatre in education companies that had made bids for the franchise for the work had
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be wanted in the area".

I suppose that that is what Hannah Gething was trying to express in her letter to her local newspaper, and we agree with that sentiment--if we did not, we would be treating our communities and their opinions with disdain.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h03_para4">Theatr Iolo's successful bid for the Gwent area had support from London, Cleveland, Warwick and Merthyr, but not one organisation or individual in Gwent was willing to support that bid for the franchise. When we met the Arts Council of Wales, we suggested that, following the publicity surrounding the recent scandal, someone must have written in to support Theatr Iolo's bid, but the council could not name a single organisation in Gwent that had supported it.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para5">Compare that with Gwent theatre, which received support in Gwent from all--I emphasise all--Members of Parliament, Assembly Members, members of the House of Lords, local authorities, 120 schools, 120 voluntary organisations, a petition signed by more than 8,000 people and stars of stage, screen and television, including Victor Spinetti and Caroline Sheen, who played the lead in "Mamma Mia" in the west end a few days ago and who is a product of Gwent young people's theatre. That support is not confined to the people of Gwent. Outside Gwent, 125 Labour Members of Parliament and dozens of Welsh Assembly Members showed their support.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para6">Gwent theatre is "wanted in the area" because it started theatre in education in that country 20 years ago. It built up a company and a service that is one of the finest in the United Kingdom. The Arts Council of Wales told us that the successful applicant had
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to be wanted in the area",

but it is ignoring its own rules, the support for Gwent theatre and the total absence of local support for Theatr Iola.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91201h03_para7">The Arts Council of Wales is telling people in my valley and other valleys in Gwent that they are not clever people, but idiots, so it cannot allow them to determine the direction of theatre in education or the company that should represent them. The Arts Council of Wales, in its plush offices in the capital city of Wales, is making decisions for those people. Its argument is that not only are people in Gwent incapable of determining the direction that theatre in education should follow, but none of the hundreds of thousands of people in Gwent has the skill, talent or creativity to direct a theatre in education company. The Arts Council of Wales decided to overcome the problem by asking a Cardiff-based company to go and to educate the people of the valleys.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 95WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h03_para8">People from the valleys are not idiots. They are capable of making such decisions, as they were capable of creating the history and a community spirit of which we are proud. The first production by Gwent theatre, which I was with 23 years ago, reminded us of that history. It taught us that the history of our community is not a history of kings, queens and generals, but a history of working people, miners, steel workers and women who worked in factories and at home. That is the history of my village and of our parents. Gwent theatre consistently reminds us to be proud of that history and those communities and never to apologise for them. It can do that because it has been a part of those communities and that history, which it has helped to create.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para9">We wanted to have a rational debate with the Arts Council on the franchise for theatre in education, so we requested certain information. We asked to see Theatr Iola's bids. We asked for the minutes of the discussions in which the decisions were taken, for the minutes of the discussions on Theatr Iola's business plan, for the details of the organisation that supports Theatr Iola and for copies of the individual marks on the 13 criteria that the evaluation panel awarded to each franchise, but all those requests, and more, were refused.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para10">I can only assume that there is something to hide, but what? We are talking about a charitable body--a small theatre company--not about an arms manufacturer selling dodgy weapons to even dodgier foreign powers, so what is there to hide? Why should these requests be refused? Companies such as Gwent theatre and Theatre Powys have made their bids public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew1"><B> Mr. Richard Livsey  (Brecon and Radnorshire):</B> 
 The value of theatre in education, as the hon. Gentleman has said, is immeasurable to young people; it gives them poise, confidence and the ability to make progress in society and to carve out a career. In rural east Wales, companies such as Theatre Powys will not be able to continue as a result of the strategy of the Arts Council of Wales. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there should be a major inquiry and a reversal of that strategy, which is destroying community-based theatre in Wales?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew2"><B> Mr. Smith:  </B> 
 I agree totally with the hon. Gentleman, but that inquiry would be worthless unless we have access to the information that he and I, and many others, have demanded. However, being optimistic, I always believe that it is impossible to keep a secret. Information is leaking out. Although Theatr Iola refused me access to information on the bid, it provided me with other information. I discovered, for example, that its business plan did not mention where in Gwent the company would be sited, or the costs of setting up such a company in a different county. I do not understand how the Arts Council could have accepted the business plan without that information, especially as Gwent theatre's building, which has been refurbished in the past few years, is now worth about &#163;500,000. If Theatr Iola wants to go to Gwent, it will need a similar base. Surely the cost of that base should have been included in the business plan.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para11">Theatr Iola informed me that the funding for its base could come from the money in its bank account and from any other successful bids for funds that it may make in future. Obviously, future grants will not help to <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 96WH</B></P>
solve its immediate problem of setting up a base in Gwent by April 2000. I contacted Companies House in Cardiff to check how much money Theatr Iola had in the bank in April 1999. It was &#163;25,000 in credit. If it used every penny of that money. It could not purchase a dilapidated building in the most deprived part of our community.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew3"><B> Mr. Livesey: </B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman realise that Powys county council has earmarked &#163;145,000 to support Theatre Powys this year, but it is not prepared to match that sum for an outside company? That puts in focus the inadequacy of its financial plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew4"><B> Mr. Smith </B> 
: The position is similar in Gwent. When we asked the Arts Council why it did not check that financial backing was not available to Theatr Iola, it informed us that it could not be certain about such matters. We were staggered by that remark, because that is the one thing that should certainly be demanded in determining a business plan. Where will the base be? What will it cost? How will the money be raised? Those are a few of the questions that must be answered. When I asked the director of Theatr Iola where its base in Gwent would be, he admitted that he did not know, saying, "Look here, we would not want the base to be more than 25 miles away. If it was more than 25 miles away, we would have to pay the additional expenses demanded by Equity." So we can forget about Theatr Iola being based in the northern part of my community--the most deprived part--because those additional expenses are more important than anything else.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para12">When we raised such issues with the Arts Council, we were shocked to be told that the money could come from the &#163;125,000 franchise. If Theatr Iola used all that money, it could have a base similar to that of Gwent theatre. Every penny of that money that it uses is a penny less for the services that were awarded the franchise. We asked how many members of the evaluation panel, whose responsibility it was to decide which bidders would be successful, had allocated points when judging the individual companies that applied for the franchise, but the Arts Council refused to give us that information. It also refused to deny that Theatr Iola was allocated points for criteria on which it should have been impossible for it to receive points. For example, a company cannot be given points for receiving local authority support if it receives no such support. It cannot receive points for having a base, if it has no such base. It would be as though I had awarded top marks to someone who had not even bothered to sit an examination.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para13">It is scandalous that only half the evaluation panel that took the decision had witnessed a performance by Gwent theatre. How can a company's artistic ability be judged without seeing one of its performances? The Arts Council would not tell us of the scores allocated to each company. It did not explain the allocation, nor did it convince us that nothing underhand had taken place in awarding the franchises.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para14">This debate is part of a campaign to rectify that wrong. We hope that the Welsh Assembly, as one of the bodies responsible for Arts Council moneys, will insist on an inquiry, as did the parliamentary Labour party yesterday evening. During the elections to the Welsh Assembly, nearly all the parties told us that they would <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 97WH</B></P>
make a bonfire of the quangos; they would end the quango state in Wales. Unfortunately, that has not happened, but they could begin to rectify that wrong by putting pressure on the Arts Council to change its decision. The Arts Council is as much a quango as any other. The campaign will continue until the injustices have been rectified, and the Arts Council must realise that it is as simple as that.

 I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) for securing this debate, for his vigorous support of the campaign and for his work as a member of the board. I also thank the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) for his contribution to the public meeting on the issue. The same points can be made about Theatre Gwent as about Theatre Powys.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para15">The headquarters of Theatre Gwent is in my constituency at Abergavenny. I have been associated with the company all the time that I have been a Member of Parliament. I have seen performances in village halls, in the middle of Monmouth during the festival and in schools recently.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para16">The decision taken by the Arts Council of Wales not to award Gwent theatre the contract to provide theatre in education of Gwent is mistaken and perverse; it will have catastrophic consequences for a theatre company that has gained a reputation for excellence. That is a serious problem.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para17">I am not qualified to comment on artistic matters, but I can comment on public accountability. How can a publicly funded Welsh body allocate &#163;125,000 without making available its business plan? I ask the Minister to request that the companies' business plans be deposited in the Library.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para18">How can Theatre Iola show evidence of support from local authorities, which was a key criterion, when it did not seek any such support? According to the criterion, each applicant must supply evidence of planned or obtained local authority financial support. To our knowledge, none of the local authorities in this area gave any support. They were not asked to do so, even though a key criterion is to provide education through education authorities, which are funded by local authorities. In response, Blaenau Gwent county council said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The whole procedure has been deeply flawed and none of the stakeholders, the funding partners, have been involved in the allocation of the new franchises."

Monmouthshire county council said:

"All members of the Council have unanimously condemned the decision of the Arts Council and asked all authorities in Wales to hold them accountable for recent decisions."

<a name="91201h03_para19">The third point that I wish to make is on the assessment of artistic ability of the two companies--

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spmin0"><B>Mr. Deputy Speaker  (Mr. John McWilliam) </B> 
: Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to speak because the Minister and his hon. Friend have given him permission. However, the debate is intended to be between the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent and the Minister, and the hon. Gentleman is now eating into the Minister's time.

<P>

<a name="91201h03_spnew6"><B> Mr. Edwards </B> 
: I shall just finish my last sentence, having sought permission to contribute from the <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 98WH</B></P>
Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent. How can the panel assess the artistic ability of either company if it has not gone to the schools? I have been to the schools--I asked permission to do so. It is incredible that a decision can be made on the performance of a company in a school without the evaluation board going to the school. That raises serious issues about public accountability and the accountability of the Arts Council of Wales, and I hope that there will be an investigation.

<a name="91201h03_spmin1"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales   (Mr. David Hanson) </B> 
: I am pleased to take part in a debate on this subject, in which there is great interest. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) secured the debate, but I am also glad that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friends the Members for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) and others are present and taking an interest in this important matter.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para20">I recognise that the issues that were raised today are of a serious nature. They were well presented, with passion, by my hon. Friends. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent will be aware, the Arts Council of Wales is the responsibility of the National Assembly. Nevertheless, arts policy is important to the UK Government, and I fully recognise the concerns raised by my hon. Friend in defending his constituency interests.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para21">I should briefly outline the context of arts funding in Wales. As hon. Members will be aware, the Assembly has the power, under section 32 of the Government of Wales Act 1998, to do anything that it considers appropriate to support the arts in Wales. The Arts Council of Wales is an Assembly-sponsored public body set up by royal charter. The relationship between the Assembly and the Arts Council is governed by the council's management statement, which makes it clear that it is for the council to allocate resources, and for the Assembly to satisfy itself as to the proper conduct in fulfilling that role. Tom Middlehurst, who is responsible for post-16 education, retains direct political control of the Arts Council of Wales and of the areas mentioned. Given the seriousness of the points made today, I am taking an interest in such matters, as is my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para22">Clearly, my hon. Friends who have spoken today are unhappy about the Arts Council's decisions on who will obtain funding under the new theatre for young people scheme, and about the process by which such decisions have been made. The scheme has replaced the school-based theatre in education scheme, which was previously run by the Arts Council. Under the new scheme, funding to provide theatre and educational experiences will be limited to five theatre organisations, which is a reduction on the eight companies that currently receive funding. My hon. Friends have mentioned Theatre Gwent, Theatre Powys and Clwyd Theatre Cymru in north Wales, all of whose bids were unsuccessful. At this point, I should declare an interest: my wife, Councillor Margaret Hanson, is the chair of the Clwyd Theatre Cymru board, but she receives no remuneration for that post.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 151WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h03_para23">I am aware that early-day motion 980, which calls for a review of the proposed scheme, has been signed by well over 100 colleagues. I am also keenly aware that there have been meetings in the House of Commons between hon. Members and the Arts Council, between the First Secretary and hon. Members and between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and hon. Members. Deep concern has been expressed about the impact of the decisions on the theatres that have been mentioned.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para24">In preparing for this debate, I read with great interest the detailed press reports, from all parts of Wales, of further representations. Among those making representations were Victor Spinetti and the Guild of Writers and Musicians, who live and breathe the theatres involved, and recognise the great contribution that they have made to the community in Wales. I must not ignore the local authorities, which are integral to the success of theatres in north, mid and south-east Wales, and which have also expressed concern.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para25">I intend to ensure that the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent, and by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, are put to the Assembly and the Arts Council.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hanson </B> 
: I shall put the request to the Arts Council and the responsible Assembly Secretary.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para26">As I have mentioned, I have no direct responsibility for the Arts Council in Wales. However, I believe strongly in openness and transparency in decisions made by public bodies; I always have and I always will. Openness and transparency were central to the devolution settlement that was agreed: making decisions more open and accountable, and making them closer to the people affected. I was not party to the process by which decisions were made by the Arts Council in relation to the scheme. However, in the interests of openness, I shall write to the Assembly Secretary, Tom Middlehurst, and to the chief executive of the Arts Council, to pass on the concerns of hon. Members who have spoken today. I shall ask them to reply to me at the Welsh Office about those concerns. I shall also request the information for which my hon.

<P>

<a name="91201h03_para27">Devolution is about partnership. Just as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State listened to the Assembly's thoughts on the Queen's Speech, I hope that the Assembly will listen to the concerns expressed in this House today, in the spirit of co-operation and openness that we are seeking to engender in the partnership process. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent will be aware that the theatres concerned can appeal should they so wish. An independent assessor would sit on any appeal panel.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew9"><B> Mr. Llew Smith </B> 
: May I inform the Minister that that is a misuse of the English language? The Arts Council took the decision that Theatre Gwent should not have that franchise, and the Arts Council will decide whether that franchise should be restored. As I understand the meaning of the word, that is not independence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h03_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hanson </B> 
: I shall look into that. Whatever the merits or otherwise of the appeal process, it is in place. I have seen correspondence that my hon. Friend has had with the Assembly Secretary, and he may be able to refer the matter to the Welsh administration ombudsman, if there is evidence of any inappropriate action. I have heard his request for a full inquiry into the matter, and I shall ask the Assembly to treat it with the gravity that it deserves.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para28">The Government believe in theatre and education in the UK context. It is one of the main strands of our arts policy proposals. Education and theatre provide a great opportunity to expand people's potential, involve them in our communities, and make Britain a centre for world excellence in arts and culture. Our three aims are building excellence in the arts, allowing greater access and allowing education to develop a love of the arts and a skill base for future economic development.
<P>

<a name="91201h03_para29">I support the call for openness. I shall write to the Assembly Secretary and the Arts Council, and I shall consider the question of the appeals panel, which my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent mentioned. I shall also ensure that the Assembly addresses his concerns. It is important, in a spirit of partnership, openness and sharing, that differing views are understood, and that the future of the arts in Gwent, Powys and north Wales is considered. I cannot comment on propriety, but I shall ensure that those matters are dealt with.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h04_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael Fabricant  (Lichfield):</B> 
 It is a great pleasure to speak in this Chamber, although I note that there is considerable lack of room in the public areas.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para0">Given that I am speaking in a new Chamber, I shall begin by giving a bit of a history lesson. The 19th century was a golden age for many, although by no means all, in Britain. Our empire spanned the globe, and British warships ruled the waves, preserving a Pax Britannica. It was also a golden age of engineering, and the two ages are connected. Names such as Brunel, Stevenson and Faraday were prominent in the public eye. Those great Victorian engineers were feted by society, and enjoyed something like celebrity status, largely because they were pioneers whose achievements represented a quantum leap in the development of human civilisation.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para1">Improving or developing an existing invention never quite captures the public imagination in the same way, even if, in doing so, its original impact is expanded a millionfold. That, to a large extent, has been the unenviable lot of the 20th-century engineer. He has developed and refined the engineering discoveries of his 19th-century ancestors, and, as a consequence, has been rather taken for granted.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para2">Of course, the advances made by engineers during the past 100 years--the jet engine, mains electricity, the computer, clean hot and cold running water, television, life-saving medical equipment, the motor car, and the telecommunications revolution, including the information super-highway--have had an incalculable and unparalleled impact. Those developments have shaped the ways in which we live, and to which the 20th century can lay claim, yet the contribution of the 20th-century engineer has never been properly recognised.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para3">If ever a moment crystallised the boundless possibilities of human ingenuity and spirit, it was Neil Armstrong's giant leap for mankind--one of the century's, if not the millennium's, indisputable triumphs. It was also an engineering triumph, as was its transmission live on television into our own homes. The media may erroneously refer ad nauseam to rocket science and NASA scientists, but the scientific principles that underpinned Apollo 11's success were not new and, in themselves, could never have propelled man to the moon.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para4">What actually made possible the outstanding achievement of the century was the insatiable capacity of engineers to solve any problem, however daunting it initially appeared. Essentially, the first moon landing was made possible by the application of new materials, allied to innovative mechanical and electronic systems. They are inescapably the preserve of the engineer, rather than the scientist. The fanciful thought of putting a man on the moon fascinated, but eluded, man since the dawn of civilisation. It fell to 20th-century engineers, however, to turn that impossible dream into reality, and shatter for ever any imagined boundaries to human endeavour.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para5">Similarly, I believe that the problems and challenges that the world faces in the 21st century will be largely the preserve of the engineer, rather than the scientist. As the <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 102WH</B></P>
world population continues to rise and the third world continues to develop, a time bomb is ticking with regard to the adequate provision of food, energy and shelter. Sustainable development will be the new millennium's holy grail, and engineers, who may be the only people equipped to find it, are already searching. As this century nears its end, the engineering profession is producing visionary solutions to the challenges that the world faces in the next, in key areas such as transport, energy, telecommunications and the environment. Those are the fronts on which the sustainable development battles of the 21st century will be fought. The good news is that engineers are already mobilising.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para6">Engineers have always been the world's problem solvers, as the history of the last millennium verifies. Until quite recently, their contribution to the development of civilisation was recognised and society regarded them highly. For a variety of reasons, that is no longer the case. During the past 100 years, their status--but not their contribution or their quality--has diminished significantly.
 
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para7">Engineers have indisputably shaped the past, and will undoubtedly shape the future, but they are also shaping the present. Projects designed and built by engineers include the fabulous millennium wheel, known as the London Eye, which stands across the river from the House, and is sponsored by British Airways; the millennium dome, which is controversial in the eyes of many, but a superb technical feat in the eyes of everyone; the channel tunnel; and Portcullis house, which stands opposite this very Chamber, and involved ground-breaking construction methods, including prefabrication techniques that are being copied abroad. They are breathtaking examples of engineering, and remind us that engineering's contribution to the development of civilisation continues apace.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para8">Of course, great engineering is not only, or even primarily, about aesthetics and landmark projects: it is about improving the quality of everyday life. Engineering is also about wealth creation and the nation's well-being. It underpins the entire UK economy and determines our competitiveness on the international stage. The Government claim repeatedly, and publicly, that engineering contributes just 8 per cent. to UK gross domestic product, but their standard industry classification codes reflect an obsolete, out-of-date, flawed definition which encompasses only the heavy, metal-basing end of the engineering spectrum. They have erroneously consigned engineering to a heavy manufacturing ghetto that is in serious decline in all the G7 developed nations.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para9">The Government's ignorance is damaging the industry and the profession alike. What about construction, telecommunications, aerospace, utilities and the process industries? Surely no one, except perhaps the Government, would dispute that all those industrial sectors also constitute engineering sectors. Certainly, the companies that operate in those sectors would not dispute that fact. Many of them have shown their engineering credentials by becoming corporate members of representative bodies such as the Engineering Council. Why would they affiliate themselves to such bodies if they did not consider themselves engineering companies?
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para10">If the Government took account of all engineering-led <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 103WH</B></P>
industries, the calculation of engineering's true contribution to GDP would rocket to more than 40 per cent. If sectors such as financial services and retail, which could not function without engineers, were also taken into account, the figure would probably be nearer to 80 per cent.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para11">In 1998, engineering employed about 1.8 million people and accounted for some 80 per cent. of all UK exports, which were valued at &#163;142 billion. Those statistics demand that the Government should afford engineering far greater attention. They should listen far more closely to what the country's engineers have to say on matters of major national importance.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para12">Following the recent rail tragedy at Ladbroke Grove, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions invited Sir David Davies, who is one of the country's most eminent engineers and president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, to conduct a personal investigation into the effective operation of train protection systems. That was a sensible course of action: no one is better qualified than Sir David to conduct such an investigation. How much more sensible would it have been to consult him and other, similarly qualified engineers about rail transport policy before the accident?
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para13">The technological boundaries of the Government's much vaunted, knowledge-based economy are rapidly changing. As we move inexorably towards such an economy, so the boundaries of engineering are changing in parallel, and engineering is set to become yet more central to civilisation's development and our nation's well-being. More solutions to the global challenges that confront our nation will be found by engineers than by any other group. I believe that engineering will become more important than ever before. In the distant future, it may prove vital to the preservation of life itself.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para14">What of the present day? The influence and impact of engineers on society extend far beyond engineering. Business, commerce and the whole of industry, not just manufacturing, are largely led by engineers. They are led not by accountants, as many people assume, or by corporate lawyers, as some may think, but by engineers. At the last count, 17 of the FTSE top 100 companies were run by engineers, compared with only 15 by accountants. In total, qualified engineers hold about 160 of the total number of directorships of FTSE companies.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para15">Engineers also dominate the academic world, with the latest count showing 18 out the 106 institutions of higher education in the United Kingdom to have engineer vice-chancellors or principals--more than from any other discipline. It is vital to the future success of the country that the Government listen to the nation's professional engineers and, if the nation is to prosper, that they receive and understand sound and timely advice on engineering matters.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para16">We now come to the crux of the debate. At present, the principal source of advice to the Government on all engineering-related issues is the chief scientific adviser to the Cabinet, Sir Robert May, one of the most eminent figures in the scientific world. Engineering forms part of Sir Robert's brief, because the Government see engineering as no more than a branch of science, a sub-set on a Venn diagram.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h04_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Claire Curtis-Thomas  (Crosby):</B> 
 Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Government's persistence in <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 104WH</B></P>
not employing an engineering adviser to the Cabinet sends an unfortunate message to the 2 million or so engineers in the United Kingdom, which is that their status and their contribution to the quality of our lives are not acknowledged or understood at the highest level of government?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h04_spnew2"><B> Mr. Fabricant </B> 
: The hon. Lady has hit the nail on the head. By every measure, engineers enjoy--if that is the word--a lower status in the United Kingdom than in France, Germany, the United States of America or Japan. The Government's continued refusal to accept that engineering is wealth-creating, and different from science, helps to perpetuate the myth that engineers are of a lower status. That is a dangerous and ignorant over-simplification of reality.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para17">Science is the business of discovering about nature and its laws, of finding out what is already there. If one scientist does not find something, there is every probability that, in due course--I am always an optimist--another one will, because scientists are investigating the existing universe and its components. Engineering, however, is about applying the findings of science to create something that has never existed before. Engineers and engineering provide the nation's creativity, innovation and competitiveness, and their views on major issues are not necessarily the same as those of the scientific community.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para18">That is not merely a question of semantics. The distinctions between science and engineering demand that the Government look on them as related but distinct, and treat them differently. It should not be assumed that the interests of engineering and engineers are the same as those of science and scientists. Special measures need to be applied. Nor should it be assumed that a scientist thinks in the same way as an engineer, or vice versa. Scientists are theoretical; engineers are practical and entrepreneurial. It is unlikely, therefore, that one individual could ever represent both groups to everyone's satisfaction.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para19">Science is a net consumer of the national wealth, while engineering is a creator of it, and the key enabler in exploiting the science base and in turning scientific discoveries into practical solutions. That must be recognised in its own right, as it is in other countries. Only the ignorance of politicians in the United Kingdom ensures that it is not. The time is overdue for the Prime Minister to appoint a chief engineering adviser to the Cabinet to mirror the very different role of the chief scientific adviser.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para20">On the previous occasions that the engineering community has questioned the logic of the present strange situation, it has received little encouragement. I have tabled parliamentary questions on the issue, as has the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas), who is also one of only seven chartered engineers in the House. One of the reasons routinely given by the Government for their refusal to consider the proposal is that to give engineering its own representative would be unfair to other specialist disciplines such as medicine or the social sciences, both of which also form part of Sir Robert May's brief. The Government ask why engineering, but no other specialist discipline, should be singled out for special attention. That argument is weak and unacceptable. It damages the wealth-creating capability of the nation and the well-being of our people. <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 105WH</B></P>
It is not an argument given in France, Germany, Japan or the United States. It is given only in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para21">The call for an adviser on engineering should not be seen as a personal attack on Sir Robert May or on his performance as chief scientific adviser. He is an eminent figure in his own right--he even had some training in chemical engineering in his formative years--but essentially he is a natural scientist.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para22">The engineering community has other channels of communication with the Government, as I am sure the Minister will point out, as well as other opportunities to make its voice heard during the policy-making process. It can, and does, respond to Government consultation exercises and submit evidence to Select Committees. It lobbies in the usual way. In all this, its voice is heard no more clearly, or given any greater weight, than the myriad other pressure groups fighting for the Government's ear. That is extremely old-fashioned. It is neither cool Britannia, nor good government.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para23">Evidence of the Government's muddle on the issue was demonstrated last week, when my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) tabled a question on ministerial responsibility for engineering in the Minister's own Department. He received a wholly incorrect answer which even failed to mention the engineering responsibilities of Lord Sainsbury. This muddle is unforgivable.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para24">As Minister for Science, Lord Sainsbury has recently agreed to a regular six-monthly meeting with the chairman of the Engineering Council, Dr. Robert Hawley, to discuss issues of interest to the engineering profession. I welcome that. The Department of Trade and Industry is collaborating with the Engineering Council to develop a closer relatonship with it, and with the profession generally, which I also welcome. Those are undoubtedly moves in the right direction, but they are insufficient when compared with the practices of other nations in which engineering is close to the heart of government.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para25">A great responsibility for the future health and wealth of the nation rests on the shoulders of the country's 280,000 registered professional engineers, and on the additional 1.5 million people employed in engineering. Appointing an engineering adviser to the Cabinet would follow the practice of other developed nations and would demonstrate clearly that the occasional public proclamations made by the Government about the importance of engineering are not merely hollow words. It would send a clear message to the rest of the country that the Government consider engineering important, and it would greatly help the engineering community in its efforts to maintain a world-class engineering work force, thereby sustaining the UK's global competitiveness. It might even ensure that scientific discoveries made in this country are translated into engineering products and sold by British manufacturers, rather than having Japanese and American firms pinch British ideas from British scientists and make money out of them, as happens at present.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para26">The engineering companies on which this country depends are suffering damaging skills shortages because of their inability to recruit top-quality young people into <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 106WH</B></P>
engineering. Bright young people take engineering at society's valuation, and if engineering is looked down on by society, we should not be surprised that young people choose not to enter the profession--a point admirably made by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, as I think I am allowed to call her in this Chamber.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para27">Is the Minister aware that only 43 per cent. of students taking up engineering degrees in 1997 had the equivalent of two grade As or better at A-level, compared with 99 per cent. for medicine and 56 per cent. for law? That is stark, statistical proof--if it were needed--that engineering is not seen as a preferred or attractive career option for the most able school leavers. Yet engineering is so critical to the success of our country that it needs to be attracting the very best available talent.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para28">The time for platitudes is over. The Government will not be thanked by the engineering industry or its professionals for mouthing sweet nothings, no matter how attractive they may be. The time is long overdue for the appointment of a chief engineering adviser if the long-term future of our economy is to be assured. After the customary praising of engineers and engineering, I hope that the Minister will say that at long last such an adviser will be appointed, for the benefit of engineers and the nation's economy. Frankly, nothing less will do.

<a name="91201h04_spmin0"><B>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce   (Ms Patricia Hewitt) </B> 
: It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity so early in the Session to respond to a debate in this new Chamber. I congratulate the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) on securing the debate, and on the passion and deep knowledge with which he introduced the subject. I confess that prior to my preparations for the debate I was not aware that the hon. Gentleman is a chartered engineer. However, I have been able to discuss the issues with my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas).
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para29">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lichfield for giving me another opportunity to place on the record the enormous importance that the Government attach to engineering. We have a deep understanding and appreciation of the extraordinary contribution that engineers make today, as well as the contribution that they have made in the past, to the quality of our lives and the strength of our economy. I endorse much of what the hon. Gentleman said about the importance of engineering and engineers. Those of us who have had the pleasure of listening to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), who was a Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, will know that he was a passionate advocate of the importance of engineering to our economy. I assure the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend that I am no less enthusiastic on the subject.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para30">We have a problem in this country in that engineering is seen as a glory in our past, rather than a strength in our present and vital to our future; yet British engineering remains a world leader. For example, last week the Royal Academy of Engineering awarded the 1999 McRobert award, our most coveted prize for innovation and engineering, to Buro Happold, the UK engineering partnership that designed the magnificent millennium dome.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 167WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h04_para31">It is a pity that so few people in this country realise that the techniques of packet switching, without which the internet could not exist, were devised in Britain by British engineers. Perhaps more people, but not enough, realise that the world wide web, which makes the internet useful and usable to millions of people around the world, was devised by another British engineer, Tim Berners-Lee, and the team with which he worked at CERN, the European centre for nuclear research.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para32">The generation, exploitation and application of knowledge, in which engineering plays a central role, are at the heart of the Government's economic agenda. That was a central theme of our White Paper on competitiveness, "Our Competitive Future: Building the Knowledge-Driven Economy". As the new E-Commerce Minister, I have a role in ensuring, right across government, that we seize and exploit the potential of information and communication technologies, and the convergences between them, in the interests of our economic strength and social well-being. In a wide variety of ways, engineers are creating the backbone and devising the applications that allow full exploitation of those convergent technologies.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para33">As the hon. Gentleman said, perhaps the biggest challenge that we will face in the new century is that of sustainable development. We know that our continued prosperity and quality of life--not only here in the developed world, but across the planet--will depend on our ability to understand, analyse and confront the issues of resources and pollution. We must find new solutions to ensure that growth is sustainable as we raise the living standards of millions of people all over the world who are now living in poverty and destitution. The challenges of environmental degradation which we face will be solved by scientists and, within that group, engineers. In practice, combating global warming and developing efficient renewable energy will be achieved only by the real advances in engineering.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para34">In its widest sense, the engineering community includes hundreds of thousands of people who do not fall within the traditional definition of a professional engineer. The hon. Gentleman referred to definitions by this Department--and presumably the Office for National Statistics--which he regarded as being unsatisfactory in terms of the contribution that engineering makes to GDP. In fact, our definition of engineering goes well beyond the traditional heavy metal-bashing sectors to which he referred. Indeed, the definition of engineering that we use for the purposes of the national accounts is a sensible definition that has been agreed with the Engineering Employers Federation. It is no more helpful for the hon. Gentleman <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 169WH</B></P>
to argue that engineering is the sole support and focus of most of the country's GDP than it would be if I were to argue that information and communications technology is responsible for all our wealth creation--although I could make an equally eloquent case to that effect.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para35">The hon. Gentleman rightly spoke of engineers as practical people. I am a practical politician, and I am interested in what the Government can do in practice to raise the status of engineering. We must ensure that it is promoted as a training option and a career, and fully exploit the contribution that engineers can make. That is why the Government have asked Dr. Robert Hawley, the chairman of the Engineering Council, to review the contribution that the council can make to add value to the activities of the broad engineering community. That will be achieved by promoting engineering and standards in engineering more effectively, building on existing synergies with existing organisations and, more generally, positioning the engineering community within the new knowledge-driven economy. The first part of that work, the definition of strategic objectives, will be completed by the end of January. I will encourage Dr. Hawley to discuss the review team's work with the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, both of whom will have excellent contributions to make to its work.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para36">I turn to the issue of education. Following the action for engineering initiative, the previous Government established SETNET, the science, engineering, technology and maths network. That is now doing exciting work in schools to raise the quality and improve the coherence of a rather fragmented picture of activities that are aimed at promoting science, engineering, technology and mathematics to school pupils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h04_spnew3"><B> Mr. Fabricant </B> 
: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Do I take it, then, that the Government will be appointing a chief engineering adviser to the Cabinet?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h04_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
: I was about to come to that. I regret that I have not had time to deal with every interesting point that the hon. Gentleman raised.
<P>

<a name="91201h04_para37">We are very happy with our chief scientific adviser. Sir Robert May is an eminent and distinguished man with a background in chemical engineering. Some former chief scientific advisers to the Government have been engineers. My understanding is that, contrary to what the hon. Gentleman has said, most other countries have a chief scientific adviser who embraces engineering.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke  (Coatbridge and Chryston):</B> 
 It is somewhat poignant that, following the Government's welcome decision yesterday on beef on the bone, we should today be considering the impact of bovine spongiform encephalopathy on the human food chain, which, alas, will be with us for some time to come. It is in that spirit that I called for today's debate.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para0">My interest in the tragic subject of victims of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease first arose as a result of the case of my constituent, Donna Marie McGivern. Donna Marie died in September this year aged 17 years. Tragically, she was one of the youngest victims of new variant CJD. Prior to her illness, Donna Marie was a caring, intelligent child with a quiet, easy-going nature. She loved music and was an extremely talented Irish dancer. The living room in her home still displays her trophies for dancing and athletics.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para1">In the summer of 1996, aged just 14 years old, Donna Marie began to complain of double vision. By December of that year, she had developed headaches and pains in her legs. Her personality began to change, with uncharacteristic rages, violent outbursts and other evidence of a brain disorder. Before she died, she received what can be described only as heroic care and support from her parents, Marie and James, who coped in the most trying of circumstances. Our hearts and minds as a community stood still, reflecting our seeming helplessness. I know, too, that the family received invaluable support from David Body at Irwin Mitchell, who has provided help for many families in all the constituencies throughout Great Britain. His efforts are greatly appreciated by my right hon. and hon. Friends.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para2">We now know that the new variant CJD is a new and devastating condition. According to the CJD surveillance unit, the United Kingdom organisation established to look into the many difficult and complex issues surrounding new variant CJD, the virus has an incidence in the country of approximately one case per million of the population in one year. So far, 52 people have died of suspected new variant CJD, of whom 48 have been confirmed as having had that disease. A further five patients are still alive. It is conceivable that there are others as yet unidentified, the families of whom, I regret to say, face a distressing future. Deterioration in the patients' condition means that they display initial problems of balance and slurred speech. Many deteriorate quickly to a point at which they have to rely on a wheelchair, and latterly, are confined to their beds, with all the implications of nursing support that that raises.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para3">Only this week, many of us read in the press about the latest United Kingdom victim--Steven McMurry aged just 17 years, from Glasgow, the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sarwar). It was typical of Donna Marie's parents who, having read the article, immediately contacted Steven's family and met them only last night. Steven, too, is displaying all of the horrific symptoms of new variant CJD that I have described. His family are going through <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 110WH</B></P>
a traumatic time, coming to terms not just with his illness, but with the huge array of care responsibilities. Our thoughts are with them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman  (Wirral, South):</B> 
 Will my right hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew2"><B> Mr Clarke: </B> 
 I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me, but I am unable to give way because of pressure of time. I apologise to him.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para4">I wish to draw the attention of hon. Members to the many difficulties that arise from such a situation. The problems of the victims' families, including those of Donna Marie and Steven, cannot be underestimated. Many families face financial difficulties and problems with transport to and from hosptial. They face logistical problems in arranging child care, and managing ordinary activities, such as shopping and housework--with the minimum of sleep--while caring also for their relative. It is, of course, particularly difficult to deal with such practical problems at a time of enormous emotional strain. Again and again, perhaps because much of this situation is relativley new to society, families have to fight for the care that is needed and lack of funding has sometimes prevented them from receiving the best care. Such families often feel that they understand their relatives' needs and the best way in which to care for them, but they have to wait for professional assessments and often have to argue vigorously for help.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para5">Let us take Donna Marie's experience as an example. In May 1997, her parents asked their general practitioner for a wheelchair. He said that there was a waiting list for such equipment, but that he would make an application on her behalf. Eventually a chair had to be borrowed from the Red Cross. Unfortunately, it was too small. Donna Marie's parents then had to obtain one from the local school for children with learning difficulties. However, that chair fell apart because it was wholly unsuitable for people who suffered sporadic movements of their limbs. By the time an appropriate wheelchair was found, Donna Marie's illness was too advanced and she was confined to her bed. It is hard for any of us to appreciate the frustration that that one aspect of her case must have caused.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para6">It is not only the families who have to go through such distress; it is difficult for professionals, too. They need emotional support when looking after patients and their families. The intensity of their involvement means that they are deeply affected by it. They often lack information and find it difficult to manage a condition with which they are unfamiliar. Too often, families are left to cope with such problems themselves, thus compounding matters further. It is difficult to define patients' needs. Professionals, patients and carers all have different perspectives and values when trying to identify needs or even agreeing on a solution.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para7">The fundamental problem for the families of patients, when diagnosis has taken place, is the lack of a co-ordinated, consistent response to the patients' needs. Even now, 13 years after the first CJD case, there is virtually no consistency of approach by local authorities or community health care services throughout the United Kingdom. The necessary co-ordination simply does not exist. It is clear to all who have had the <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 111WH</B></P>
misfortune to have had to deal with this deadly virus that the care provision throughout the country, while variable, is uniformly limited. In addition, the support provided by the various bodies that have been set up to offer care and other services to those suffering from new variant CJD is, frankly, wholly inadequate.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para8">The problem can be explained simply. People who know little about the huge range of difficulties are asked to provide informed solutions. Those who know little about the virus, such as local authorities, social services and even GPs, are expected to offer informed care advice. That is not fair on the professionals, nor is it effective when considering that the most important issue of all is the needs of the patient. At one end of the spectrum, there have been several cases in which care support has been incomparably good. In other cases, the absence of effective timely care provision has been a source of bitter grievance, accentuating the grave sense of injustice that is already felt. Because of the broad-based nature of the problem, I believe strongly that a national approach is vital to provide the consistency of provision that is so clearly needed.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para9">The proposal that we should consider--it was recommended by the CJD surveillance unit--involves the establishment of a central fund for sole use by new variant CJD patients and their carers. Those resources could fund a team comprising, for instance, a case manager and a counsellor. It could assess the actual and prospective care needs of the patient, determine the equipment required and suggest alterations that might be needed to make care at home more effective. Crucially, it could also assess the needs of the family and provide support when people have to come to terms with the eventual death of a family member.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para10">We should also bear in mind the possibility that there may be cases in which a person has neither family nor close friends. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that the proposal is a limited-cost project, which is predicted to involve less than &#163;750,000 a year, but it could bring consistency of care to a group of people whose illnesses all hon. Members wish had never happened. I know that my hon. Friend received details of the proposal, and I look forward to hearing his response to the suggestion.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para11">Marie and James, the parents of Donna Marie, had to give up their jobs to look after their child. My hon. Friend the Minister, who will reply with expertise on behalf of the Department of Health, will accept that greater co-ordination is needed between Departments, including the Department of Social Security, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the various United Kingdom Assemblies and the European Union. Has any progress been made in the consideration of compensatory payments--subject, of course to the BSE inquiry?
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para12">New variant CJD is a fatal disease. In almost every case, diagnosis of the disease is not possible until after the patient has died. As things stand, there is little prospect of any medical treatment emerging in the foreseeable future. What measures have the Government taken to support further research into finding a cure for new variant CJD?
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 112WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h05_para13">I accept that the pharmaceutical industry has little to gain in this regard, but a contribution to the funds that are used to respond to this dreadful disease would enhance the industry's standing and I appeal to it to make such a contribution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman </B> 
: One of my constituents, who recently lost a loved one to new variant CJD, is particularly concerned about consistency of care. Does my right hon Friend agree that it is important for such care to be given to all victims of CJD throughout the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew4"><B> Mr. Clarke </B> 
: I am grateful to my hon. Friend who spoke on behalf of one of his constituents and of the many people who are closely following our debate.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para14">If we redouble our research efforts, provide a consistent package of care when and where it is needed, ease the financial worries of those who are involved, respond quickly on a cross-departmental basis and share whatever knowledge there is about this dreadful condition, we would at least be able to claim that progress has been made.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para15">Little Donna Marie McGivern has left us, her potential unfulfilled. If this tragic experience helps to establish a more professional and timely response in similar circumstances, her leaving us, and the passing of so many others, will not have been in vain.

<P>
<a name="91201h05_spmin0"><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Mr. John Denham) </B> 
: I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke) on securing this debate on care provision for new variant CJD patients, and on his speech, in which he gave moving descriptions of the life and death of Donna Marie McGivern. Our sympathies go to her family and to the other families who have been affected by the disease.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para16">I must admit at the outset that we still have many lessons to learn about how to deal with this dreadful new disease. It was only as recently as March 1996 that the first cases of variant CJD were confirmed. Since then, 48 people have died from the disease. Each case has brought its own harrowing tale--a story that only the families and carers who have been closely involved can possibly fully appreciate. We know that variant CJD is invariably fatal, and as the course of the disease follows its grim path of neurological deterioration, it brings with it enormous suffering, and not only for the patients. Perhaps the suffering is felt most keenly by those who have the responsibility for looking after their loved ones and at the same time have to watch them go downhill.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para17">Unlike many other serious diseases, there is still no proven validated test available for a living person that would enable variant CJD to be diagnosed with certainty. The Spongifom Encephalopathy Advisory Committee--the independent committee that advises the Government on BSE and CJD issues--said at its September meeting that the need to develop a diagnostic test should be seen as paramount. The Government understand that requirement absolutely. The Department of Health is funding some &#163;3 million a year into vital research.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 113WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h05_para18">My right hon. Friend asked a wide question about research. The priority for Government research is treatment. We currently spend about &#163;17 million per annum on research into this related set of diseases. I offer to write to my right hon. Friend setting out the details of the various studies that are covered by that research programme.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para19">Variant CJD, in its early stages, often produces symptoms of anxiety or depression which can mimic the pattern of any number of other psychotic disorders. It is only when the disease moves into its later phase, when profound physical and neurological symptoms reveal themselves, that variant CJD can realistically begin to be seen as a possible suspect. Forty-eight tragic cases is of course 48 too many, but it is still only a tiny proportion of the whole population.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para20">I should like to turn to the needs of variant CJD patients. The course of the disease is unpredictable, which means that needs will not remain static but will change over time. We know that those changes can occur very quickly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mohammad Sarwar  (Glasgow, Govan):</B> 
 Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
: I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not at this stage. If I have time at the end of the debate I shall give way, but I want to reply to my right hon. Friend's speech.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para21">The fact that changes occur quickly means that the management of the condition needs to be rapid and flexible and to be reviewed frequently. Health care will necessarily be provided by a range of different health care professionals. At different times or in combination, patients will require support from a range of clinicians, including neurologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and therapists, including physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. For many patients and families their GP and community team will also provide vital care and support.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para22">The national CJD surveillance unit at Edinburgh, which is funded by the Government--it discovered the first cases of variant CJD--is undertaking important work investigating possible cases. Staff at the unit have worked to develop relationships with other neurologists and clinicians with whom patients are likely to have early contact. Building on their experience of dealing with the disease, they are able to provide advice to clinicians and families. To help the unit to develop its role further, the Government decided to fund the provision of a new care co-ordinator post, and the unit is currently advertising for a suitable candidate.
 
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para23">The NHS services needed by patients with variant CJD are in place across the country. It is essential that the care provided by the different professions is co-ordinated, that it is discussed with the patients and their families and carers and that it is frequently reviewed.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para24">The need for such arrangements is not unique to variant CJD. Other rapidly deteriorating neurological conditions, such as motor neurone disease, also require a speedy and co-ordinated approach to health care. According to the surveillance unit, and taking account of all the difficulties that I have explained, there are <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 114WH</B></P>
perhaps six patients who are highly suspected of having CJD and about 3,500 sufferers of motor neurone disease. In that context, we have declined the call to establish a central fund specifically for variant CJD sufferers. All those people will need consistent quality services, and we must work to deliver those services to them as we work to deliver services to others in need.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para25">That co-ordination needs to happen in two ways. First, services need to be co-ordinated for individuals, so that patients receive integrated care packages, which may involve health and social care professions. Secondly, health and social services staff need to work together to ensure that their services are planned and delivered in partnership. I acknowledge that there have been regrettable instances when that arrangement has failed. As my right hon. Friend said, those experiences have not been uniformly bad, but we are trying to make things better.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para26">Provisions in the Health Act 1999 will allow the NHS and social services to overcome the barriers to joint working. For example, pooled budgets for individuals could be set up to provide responsive packages of care that can change quickly when needed. Local managers would need to identify when that might be required, agree to pool funds to provide a future care package and agree in advance who should manage the pool budget. However, as my right hon. Friend said, local service providers will need help to deal with the particular difficulties of caring for CJD patients. Because of the present rate of incidence of variant CJD, most people who work in the medical profession will not come across a case during their working lifetimes, so those who need to tackle it will need appropriate support.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para27">As well as the new post at the CJD surveillance unit, the Department is giving its backing to the CJD support network for the case co-ordination initiative, which aims to improve the co-ordination of care for patients suffering from all kinds of CJD. As a result, more cost-effective care should be provided that is effectively tailored to the changing needs of patients and carers.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para28">Last year, the CJD support network, in collaboration with the Association of Directors of Social Services, produced new guidance on best practice for social care workers. The Department is producing complementary guidance on health care, which we aim to publish shortly. That will focus on the role to be played by key workers, whose job will be to ensure that all the needs of patients and carers are regularly assessed and put into place rapidly. My right hon. Friend spoke of the knowledge and experience of the families and carers of sufferers, and I assure him that voluntary groups representing families of sufferers were involved in preparing that document, and we are confident that it will make a difference.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para29">The Department also supports the Human BSE Foundation, an organisation run by the families of variant CJD victims, which aims to help relatives, friends and carers by providing support, information and practical advice.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para30">The debate has emphasised one of the alarming features of variant CJD, which is that it can target young people. As part of our research programme, the British paediatric surveillance unit of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is working with the Edinburgh CJD surveillance unit and Addenbrooke's <P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 114WH</B></P>
hospital in Cambridge to look into all cases of progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration occurring in children in the UK.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para31">That project, which has been under way since May 1997, has monitored the incidence of such deterioration and, as far as possible, has determined its cause. Further investigation is encouraged in those cases that do not have a readily identifiable cause, so that we can detect those children who may potentially be suffering from any form of CJD. Results of the unit's work were published earlier this year. Of the 489 cases investigated, no positive results were revealed, although one has since turned out to be a suspect case. I mention the study to reassure my right hon. Friend that we are doing what we can to look out for the development of variant CJD in the young.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke </B> 
: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. I shall be brief, because I hope that he may have time to give way also to my hon. Friend the Member for Govan. I thank the Minister for his tremendous courtesy in replying to the debate at such length. I also take this opportunity to join him in paying tribute to the CJD surveillance unit at Edinburgh, which serves the whole of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
: I shall say a little about the organisation for community care--but less than I would like, so that I can give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Govan. However, I shall rest for a moment on the care of the young.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para32">Children and young people often prefer to be at home in familiar surroundings, which means that they must have adequate support from all the local agencies. I have already emphasised that that requires good co-ordination between the various services. In future, care for children and young people with chronic illnesses such as variant CJD is increasingly likely to be provided in a community setting. That will be achieved by outreach teams that will support the parents, use collaborative care pathways that are agreed by primary care and specialist teams, and work with local authority social services and education departments.
<P>




<B>1 Dec 1999 : Column 115WH</B></P>

<P>

<a name="91201h05_para33">The Government's national strategy for carers, published in February, shows that giving support to carers can also help the people whom they care for. A programme of work is under way to implement the strategy throughout the NHS. It includes raising the awareness of carers' issues when planning, delivering and evaluating services, identifying carers and their own health needs in primary care, and providing information that they need on the health status and the medication of the person whom they are caring for.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew9"><B> Mr. Sarwar </B> 
: A constituent of mine, Steven McCurry, fell over two years ago, when he was 20 years old. He complained of headaches, slurred speech and difficulty in walking, yet it took 18 months for doctors to diagnose the fact that he was suffering from the new variant CJD. Does my hon. Friend agree that, in view of the increased incidence of CJD, a much more co-ordinated approach is needed from local authorities and health workers, which should be backed up by the Government with greater resources that are specifically directed to dealings with that problem?

<P>
<P>
<a name="91201h05_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
: I am delighted to have the opportunity to reiterate some of the key points of my response.
<P>

<a name="91201h05_para34">First, I recognise the difficulties faced by health professionals owing to the fact that we do not yet have a reliable diagnostic test that can be used on a living person to establish the existence of variant CJD beyond doubt. That is a priority for research. Secondly, services must be properly co-ordinated to cope with the needs of individuals so as to ensure that their changing needs--sometimes rapidly changing needs--are reflected in the change of provision. We seek to achieve that through the various initiatives that I have mentioned, including the forthcoming publication of guidance and the funding of the surveillance unit in Edinburgh and elsewhere. For sufferers of variant CJD and a number of other distressing conditions such as motor neurone disease, the challenge is to co-ordinate existing services. That is the key challenge on which we must work, rather than targeting separate or additional funding.
